The stimulation of Dna2 endonuclease activity by RPA requires direct protein&#x02013;protein interaction. In this report we have analyzed genetically and biochemically the interaction of Dna2 with RPA. <italic>RFA1</italic>, the gene encoding the large subunit of RPA, displayed allele-specific interactions with <italic>DNA2</italic> that included synthetic lethality and intergenic complementation. In addition, we identified physical and functional interactions between these proteins and found that RPA binds Dna2 predominantly through its large subunit, Rpa1. Consistent with the mapping of synthetic lethal mutations, robust interaction localizes to the C-termini of these proteins. Moreover, the N-terminal domains of Dna2 and Rpa1 appear to be important for a functional interaction because the N-terminal domain of RPA1 was required to maximally stimulate Dna2 endonuclease activity. We propose that a bimodal interaction of Dna2 with Rpa1 is important for Dna2 function both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The relevance of each interaction with respect to the function of the Dna2 endonuclease activity is discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA replication is a complex enzymatic process that requires a number of proteins to function in a highly coordinated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c3">3</xref>). Among them, replication-protein A (RPA) is known to interact with many replication factors identified in yeast or human cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c5">5</xref>). RPA possesses intrinsic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding activity that plays a role in stabilizing ssDNA in the single-stranded conformation, an active form for many DNA transactions such as DNA replication, repair and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c5">5</xref>). RPA was first identified in human cells as an essential protein required for simian virus (SV) 40 DNA replication <italic>in vitro</italic> and is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of 70- (Rpa1), 34- (Rpa2) and 11-kDa (Rpa3) subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c8">8</xref>). Yeast RPA (yRPA) is a heterotrimeric complex of 69-, 36- and 13-kDa subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c10">10</xref>). The genes encoding yRpa1-3 are referred to as <italic>RFA1-3</italic>, respectively, and each gene is essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c10">10</xref>).</p><p>There are many reports of the dynamic regulatory role played by RPA in DNA transactions. For example, interactions of RPA with SV40 large T antigen and DNA polymerase (pol) &#x003b1;-primase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c11">11</xref>) are required for productive generation of primer RNAs for the initiation of SV40 DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c14">14</xref>). RPA also interacts with proteins involved in DNA repair, transcriptional activation, as well as the cellular regulator p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c19">19</xref>). In some cases, the functional importance of these protein&#x02013;protein interactions is not well understood. In addition, RPA is modified by phosphorylation, which may further contribute to its diverse roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c22">22</xref>).</p><p>Among the three subunits of RPA, the 70 kDa subunit (Rpa1) contains the major ssDNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c25">25</xref>) and has been shown to interact with many proteins including DNA pol &#x003b1;-primase complex, the DNA damage recognition protein XPA, the tumor suppressor p53, and transcriptional activators like VP16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c26">26</xref>). Studies in yeast have demonstrated that mutations in Rpa1 affect DNA replication, repair and recombination <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c30">30</xref>). Rpa1 is composed of four structural domains: three DNA-binding domains are located in the C-terminal two-thirds of Rpa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c32">32</xref>) and a related, but non-DNA binding domain (RPA1N) is located at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c33">33</xref>). The C-terminus of Rpa1 is also necessary for the correct assembly of the heterotrimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c34">34</xref>). These structural and functional conclusions are supported by the fact that trypsin digestion of RPA causes initial cleavage of Rpa1 into &#x0223c;18 kDa N-terminal and &#x0223c;52 kDa C-terminal fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c35">35</xref>). Although various regions of Rpa1 may be responsible for binding some proteins, the N-terminal region has been implicated in many of the known interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c37">37</xref>). This region is apparently dispensable for <italic>in vitro</italic> activity because its deletion does not affect its ssDNA-binding activity or its ability to support SV40 replication <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c39">39</xref>). Surprisingly, the 18-kDa N-terminal region of Rpa1 is essential for growth in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c40">40</xref>). Although the precise biological roles of the N-terminal domain are unknown, the domain is likely to participate in RPA&#x02013;protein interactions since it is not involved in binding DNA.</p><p>In previous studies, we identified RPA as a genetic suppressor that corrected the growth defect of a mutant allele of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA2</italic>, which encodes an enzyme directly involved in Okazaki fragment maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c43">43</xref>). Yeast Dna2 is a 172-kDa protein with conserved DNA helicase motifs that contains DNA helicase as well as ssDNA-specific endonuclease activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c46">46</xref>). Dna2 from Archaea, the hyperthermophile <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic>, has also been shown to possess ATPase, DNA helicase and nuclease activities, although some differences in enzymatic properties were noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c47">47</xref>). We showed that RPA promotes the endonuclease switching between Dna2 and Fen1 based on the following observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c48">48</xref>). RPA binds the 5&#x02032; ends of synthetic Okazaki fragments as they are displaced by pol &#x003b4; and recruits Dna2, resulting in the stimulation of Dna2-catalyzed cleavage of primer RNAs. The cleavage reaction causes RPA to dissociate from the shortened flap, permitting Fen1 to access the remaining flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c43">43</xref>). This mechanism suggests that Dna2 is an endonuclease that processes the long flap DNA generated by displacement DNA synthesis by pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c43">43</xref>). Consistent with this, recent studies confirmed that short 5&#x02032; flaps were efficiently matured by pol &#x003b4; and Fen1, and Dna2 did not stimulate maturation, while maturation of long 5&#x02032; flaps to which RPA can bind required both Dna2 and Fen1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c50">50</xref>).</p><p>We also showed that Dna2 consists of at least three functional and structural domains: the N-terminal domain which is dispensable for enzymatic activities, but is required <italic>in vivo</italic> for growth at 37&#x000b0;C; the central domain required for endonuclease activity; and the C-terminal domain required for helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c51">51</xref>). We proposed that the N-terminus of Dna2 might regulate the function of Dna2 <italic>in vivo</italic> by mediating specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c51">51</xref>).</p><p>In order to investigate the possibility that RPA may exert its regulatory effect via its interaction with the N-terminal region of Dna2 and understand how RPA influences the activity of Dna2, we analyzed their genetic and physical interactions. As expected for proteins that directly interact, we find that certain mutations in Dna2 and Rpa1 display synthetic lethality or suppression of mutant phenotypes. Deletion derivatives were then used to map interaction domains between Dna2 and Rpa1. The primary interaction occurred through the C-termini of Dna2 and Rpa1, while a secondary interaction was identified between their N-terminal domains. We show that the N-terminal domain of Rpa1 is required for maximal stimulation of Dna2 activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. These results indicate that the bimodal interaction of Dna2 with Rpa1 is important for Dna2 function, and provide insight into why the N-terminal domains of Rpa1 and Dna2, each of which is dispensable <italic>in vitro</italic>, are essential <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, oligonucleotides, nucleoside triphosphates and enzymes</title><p>The synthetic lethal screen and the cloning and characterization of <italic>slr157</italic> were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c37">37</xref>).

These <italic>RFA1</italic> alleles were previously isolated based on their sensitivity to MMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c27">27</xref>). Freshly growing cells were scraped from a plate lacking leucine and tested for growth in the presence of 5-FOA. As shown in the right-hand panels of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f1">1</xref>, <italic>dna2-157</italic> was lethal in combination with almost all <italic>RFA1</italic> alleles that contain amino acid substitutions in the ssDNA binding domains (SBD-A, B and C) of Rpa1. In contrast, most <italic>RFA1</italic> mutations that map to the N-terminal domain of Rpa1 were viable in the presence of <italic>dna2-157</italic>. The exceptions to this rule included <italic>rfa1-Y29H</italic> and <italic>rfa1-t49</italic> which were shown by western blot analysis to express &#x0223c;10&#x00025; of the level of Rpa1 protein found in wild-type cells (data not shown). This low expression was likely to contribute to the synthetic lethal phenotype of these mutants. The <italic>rfa1-t73</italic> allele is the only viable mutation with a change in the ssDNA binding domain (E562V) and is discussed further below. In a wild-type (WT) <italic>DNA2</italic> background, the synthetically lethal <italic>rfa1</italic> alleles had either no effect on growth or produced a mild slow growth phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f1">1</xref>A, left). We conclude that <italic>dna2-157</italic> requires the wild-type ssDNA-binding domains of Rpa1 for viability.</p><p>To determine if <italic>RFA1</italic> interacted with specific <italic>DNA2</italic> alleles, the strain HSY738 (<italic>dna2-157 rfa1-Y29H</italic> plus pJM195) was transformed with 12 different <italic>DNA2</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c53">53</xref>) on plasmids. We then tested whether these <italic>DNA2</italic> mutations could complement the synthetic lethality of the <italic>rfa1-Y29H dna2-157</italic> strain by selecting against pJM195 on 5-FOA. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg422tb1">1</xref>, most of the <italic>dna2</italic> mutations that mapped to the helicase domain could not complement the synthetic lethality. In contrast, most mutations that mapped to the nuclease domain were viable in the presence of <italic>rfa1-Y29H</italic>. These results are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f1">1</xref>B. Consistent with these results, <italic>dna2-157</italic> was found to have a point mutation in one of the conserved helicase motifs: a G to A mutation at nucleotide 3765 causing a cysteine to tyrosine change at residue 1255. This result raised the possibility that the RPA heterotrimer physically interacts with Dna2 through the ssDNA binding domains of Rpa1 and helicase domain of Dna2.</p></sec><sec><title>Allele-specific suppression of <italic>dna2-157</italic> by <italic>rfa1</italic> mutants</title><p>As described above, six of eight <italic>rfa1</italic> N-terminal domain mutants were viable in combination with <italic>dna2-157</italic>. We noticed that five of these six viable double mutants were healthier than the <italic>dna2-157</italic> single mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f1">1</xref>A, right). Thus, these <italic>rfa1</italic> alleles are suppressors of the <italic>dna2-157</italic> slow-growth defect. We asked if these mutations could suppress other <italic>dna2-157</italic> phenotypes. The <italic>dna2-157</italic> single mutant is sensitive to the DNA damaging agents MMS and UV. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f2">2</xref>A, <italic>rfa1-t47</italic> and <italic>rfa1-t73</italic> suppressed the MMS sensitivity of <italic>dna2-157</italic> whereas three other mutants, which were themselves MMS sensitive, did not. Interestingly, <italic>rfa1-t73</italic> also suppressed the UV sensitivity of <italic>dna2-157</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f2">2</xref>B). The suppression of these <italic>dna2-157</italic> phenotypes by <italic>rfa1</italic> provides further evidence of an interaction between Rpa1 and Dna2.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression and isolation of RPA and its mutant derivatives</title><p>The above genetic results suggested that the RPA heterotrimer physically interacts with Dna2, perhaps through the ssDNA binding domains of Rpa1 and helicase domain of Dna2. In order to test this idea, we attempted to confirm this observation <italic>in vitro</italic>. For this purpose, each subunit of RPA (Rpa1, Rpa2 and Rpa3; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f3">3</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3) was expressed and purified from <italic>E.coli</italic>. In addition, we isolated several mutant forms of Rpa1; these included Rpa1<sup>1&#x02013;180</sup>, the N-terminal 180 amino acid fragment of Rpa1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f3">3</xref>, lane 4); Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup>, lacking the N-terminal 180 amino acids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f3">3</xref>, lane 5); and Rpa1<sup>I14S</sup>, containing an Ile&#x02192;Ser substitution at amino acid position 14 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f3">3</xref>, lane 6). We were unable to obtain Rpa1<sup>Y29H</sup> since expression of this allele in <italic>E.coli</italic> was extremely poor. We also prepared wild-type RPA and mutant RPA&#x02013;Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup>, in which the large subunit was substituted with Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f3">3</xref>, lanes 7 and 8, respectively). The Rpa1 polypeptides contained polyhistidine tags at their N-termini. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c40">40</xref>), most proteins were insoluble when expressed individually in <italic>E.coli</italic> (data not shown). However, we found that substantial amounts of each subunit (&#x0223c;10&#x02013;30&#x00025;) were soluble. The presence of hydrophilic polyhistidine residues at their N-termini may have improved the solubility of these proteins. All recombinant proteins were purified to near homogeneity (&#x0003e;90&#x00025;; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f3">3</xref>), as described in Materials and Methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Dna2 interacts preferentially with Rpa1</title><p>In order to determine which subunit of RPA contributed to its interaction with Dna2, we carried out ELISA. Each subunit (1 pmol each) of RPA was first adsorbed to a microtiter plate, and then incubated with Dna2 in the presence of increasing concentrations (1&#x02013;10 nM) of purified Dna2. After the plate was washed, adsorbed Dna2 was detected with polyclonal antibodies specific to Dna2. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f4">4</xref>A, interaction between purified Rpa1 and Dna2 was observed, which increased as a function of the level of Dna2 added. This finding confirmed the genetic observations of a direct interaction between Rpa1 and Dna2. When Rpa2 or Rpa3 was used in place of Rpa1, their interactions with Dna2 were much weaker (&#x0223c;20&#x00025;) than that observed with Rpa1.</p><p>In order to further confirm this conclusion, we carried out reciprocal ELISA. We first adsorbed Dna2 to the plate and measured its ability to interact with each RPA subunit (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f4">4</xref>B). To minimize variations in the reciprocal ELISA that may arise from differences in antibody efficiency, the antisera were diluted so that different RPA subunits, at the same molar concentration, yielded an identical adsorption value at <italic>A</italic><sub>405</sub>. Consistent with the results presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f4">4</xref>A, Rpa1 interacted more strongly with Dna2 than Rpa2 and Rpa3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f4">4</xref>B). One noticeable difference, however, is that Dna2 interacted more efficiently (2-fold) with Rpa2 than Rpa3 in the reciprocal ELISA. These results, together with those presented above, suggest that Rpa2 and 3 may also contribute to the overall interaction of RPA with Dna2. The significance of the interactions observed between Dna2 and Rpa2 or Rpa3 remains to be defined by other means.</p></sec><sec><title>Two domains within Rpa1 interact with Dna2</title><p>Since Dna2 interacted with RPA largely through Rpa1, we analyzed mutant forms of Rpa1 (described above, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f3">3</xref>) to map the region required for binding Dna2. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f4">4</xref>C, Rpa1<sup>1&#x02013;180</sup> barely interacted with Dna2, whereas Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup> bound Dna2, &#x0223c;3-fold less efficiently than wild-type Rpa1. Rpa1<sup>I14S</sup>, which was synthetically lethal with <italic>dna2-157</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f1">1</xref>A), interacted with Dna2 as efficiently as Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup>. This suggests that the C-terminal three-fourths of Rpa1 is an important region for the interaction with Dna2. Deletion of the N-terminal 180 amino acid domain of Rpa1 or a mutation within this region reduced significantly (&#x0223c;70&#x00025;) its ability to interact with Dna2 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The N-terminal region of Rpa1, however, does appear to contribute to the interaction when it is an integral part of Rpa1 because the interaction between Dna2 and Rpa1 was more robust than the sum of the interactions of the Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup> and Rpa1<sup>1&#x02013;180</sup> with Dna2. This indicates that the N- and C-terminal domains of RPA1 interact with Dna2 in a synergistic fashion. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f4">4</xref>D, identical results were obtained in a reciprocal ELISA (binding of the Rpa1 derivatives to wells coated with Dna2).</p></sec><sec><title>The N-terminal 45-kDa region of Dna2 is involved in the interaction with Rpa1</title><p>We tested whether modifications such as phosphorylation affected the binding of Dna2 to RPA. For this purpose, we isolated native RPA (yRPA) from yeast extracts or recombinant RPA (rRPA) from <italic>E.coli</italic> and examined their ability to bind full-length Dna2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f5">5</xref>A). The interactions were nearly identical suggesting that modifications in yeast RPA do not appear to affect its binding to Dna2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f5">5</xref>A). RPA over-expression suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth defect caused by deletion of the N-terminal 45-kDa region of Dna2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c43">43</xref>). One interpretation of this result is that deletion of this N-terminal region of Dna2 may reduce affinity of Dna2 for RPA, thereby requiring elevated levels of RPA to restore wild-type growth. In order to test this possibility, we examined the abilities of Dna2&#x00394;405N and wild-type Dna2 to bind RPA and its mutant derivatives.</p><p>The binding of Dna2 to rRPA&#x02013;Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup> (in which the Rpa1 subunit lacks the N-terminal 180 amino acids) was significantly (&#x0223c;40&#x00025;) lower than the wild-type rRPA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f5">5</xref>A). This is consistent with the results obtained with Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup> alone as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f4">4</xref>C and D, and supports the notion that efficient binding of Dna2 to RPA requires the N-terminal 180 amino acid domain of Rpa1. In parallel, we also examined the interaction between Dna2&#x00394;405N and wild-type RPA and found that it was also significantly impaired (&#x0223c;40&#x00025; compared to full-length Dna2) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f5">5</xref>A). Interestingly, Dna2&#x00394;405N bound rRPA&#x02013;Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup> and wild-type RPA with identical efficiency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f5">5</xref>A). This result demonstrates that the N-terminal 180 amino acid domain of Rpa1 cannot participate in the protein&#x02013;protein interaction with Dna2 when the N-terminal 405 amino acid domain of Dna2 is absent. These results, together with those described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f4">4</xref>, indicate that both N-terminal domains of Dna2 and Rpa1 are required for the maximal interaction between Dna2 and Rpa1. Consistent with this, Dna2&#x00394;405N binds Rpa1 at &#x0223c;70&#x02013;80&#x00025; of the level observed with wild-type Dna2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f5">5</xref>B). Moreover, Dna2<sup>1&#x02013;405</sup>, the N-terminal 45-kDa fragment of Dna2, was capable of interacting with Rpa1, but with reduced efficiency (&#x0223c;40&#x00025; compared to that observed between Dna2 and Rpa1) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f5">5</xref>B). In support of these <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, yeast two-hybrid assays revealed similar interactions between Dna2 and Rpa1 <italic>in vivo</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f6">6</xref>). The interaction between Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup> and Dna2 was stronger than that observed for Rpa1<sup>1&#x02013;180</sup> and Dna2. These two interactions, however, were weaker than that between wild-type Rpa1 and Dna2.</p></sec><sec><title>The N-terminal region of Rpa1 is important for stimulating Dna2 endonuclease activity</title><p>In order to test whether the physical and genetic interactions observed between RPA and Dna2 have physiological relevance to the enzymatic properties of Dna2, we examined the influence of RPA or RPA&#x02013;Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup> on the endonuclease activities of Dna2 and Dna2&#x00394;405N. In an earlier study, we showed that RPA recruits Dna2 to a flap containing primer RNA (generated by displacement DNA synthesis by pol &#x003b4;), and stimulates the cleavage of the flap by Dna2 endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c43">43</xref>). We first examined whether RPA&#x02013;Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup> was able to stimulate the endonuclease activity of Dna2. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c43">43</xref>), the amount of flap-structured substrate cleaved by wild-type Dna2 increased markedly with increasing levels of wild-type RPA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f7">7</xref>). On the other hand, RPA&#x02013;Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup> was less efficient than wild-type RPA in stimulating Dna2-catalyzed cleavage of flap DNA substrates (20&#x02013;80&#x00025; of that observed with wild-type RPA). At the lowest level (1 fmol) of RPA added, stimulation was marginal (1.4-fold) with RPA&#x02013;Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup>, whereas strong (&#x0223c;5-fold) stimulation was observed with wild-type RPA. At saturating levels of RPA (5&#x02013;10 fmol), however, stimulation did not differ significantly (6&#x02013;7-fold and 9-fold, respectively, for RPA&#x02013;Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup> and wild-type RPA). This result indicates that the N-terminal 180 amino acids of Rpa1 is important for the interaction that leads to the stimulation of the Dna2 endonuclease activity.</p></sec><sec><title>In the absence of the N-terminal 45-kDa domain of Dna2, RPA&#x02013;Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup> is more efficient in stimulating Dna2 endonuclease activity</title><p>We then examined whether RPA could stimulate the endonuclease activity of Dna2&#x00394;405N, given that this protein is partially impaired in its ability to bind Rpa1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f5">5</xref>A and B). The endonuclease activity of Dna2&#x00394;405N was stimulated by RPA, but the stimulation was significantly lower (2-fold) than that observed with wild-type Dna2 (compare Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f8">8</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;9). This suggests that deletion of the N-terminal domain of Dna2 impairs its functional interaction with RPA. In our previous report, the Dna2&#x00394;405N protein was fully active <italic>in vitro</italic>, but cells carrying a single copy of this mutation showed temperature-dependent growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c51">51</xref>). It is worthwhile to mention that the specific activities of endonuclease and ATPase of Dna2&#x00394;405N were significantly higher (&#x0223c;3&#x02013;5-fold) than the full-length Dna2 activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c51">51</xref>). This, however, was observed only with a &#x003a6;X174-based DNA substrate containing bulk ssDNA. When we used the oligonucleotide-based substrate here, the specific activities of the two enzymes were quantitatively similar (data not shown). The growth defect caused by the N-terminal deletion of 405 amino acids of Dna2 was rescued by the increasing copy number of either the <italic>dna2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>405N</italic> allele or <italic>RFA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c51">51</xref>). Therefore, elevated levels of RPA may further stimulate Dna2&#x00394;405N endonuclease activity, providing an explanation for the suppression of the <italic>dna2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>405N</italic> growth defect. Unexpectedly, Dna2&#x00394;405N was stimulated more efficiently by RPA&#x02013;Rpa1<sup>&#x00394;180N</sup> than by wild-type RPA, approaching the level of stimulation observed with the wild-type proteins (compare Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f8">8</xref>). This observation will be further discussed (see Discussion) in light of a bimodal interaction of Dna2 with Rpa1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have previously shown that RPA plays a role in targeting Dna2 to flap-structured ssDNA for Okazaki fragment processing, which results in the stimulation of the endonuclease activity of Dna2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c43">43</xref>). Biochemical analyses indicate that both targeting and stimulation of Dna2 in this process involves the interaction between the two proteins for the following reasons: (i) a ternary complex composed of RPA, Dna2 and the DNA substrate appears to be an intermediate for the cleavage reaction; (ii) RPA stimulates the formation of a complex of Dna2 with the DNA substrate in a synergistic fashion; (iii) RPA accelerates the rate of Dna2-catalyzed cleavage of ssDNA in a manner that requires RPA binding to substrate DNA. In order to understand these functional interactions at the protein level, we searched for biochemical and genetic interactions between Dna2 and the three subunits of RPA. We have discovered that Dna2 primarily interacts with Rpa1, the large subunit of RPA. In support of our conclusion that Rpa1 and Dna2 show direct protein&#x02013;protein interaction, we identified allele-specific interactions between <italic>RPA1</italic> and <italic>DNA2</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f1">1</xref>).</p><p>Based upon the following genetic and biochemical observations, we suggest that Dna2 and Rpa1 interact with each other in a bimodal fashion. (i) Mutations in <italic>RFA1</italic> that are synthetically lethal with <italic>dna2-157</italic> largely map to the C-terminal ssDNA-binding domains of Rpa1. (ii) The affinity of full-length Dna2 for the C-terminal two-thirds of Rpa1 is significantly less than that of the full-length proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f4">4</xref>C and D). (iii) Although the binding of the isolated N-terminal domain of Rpa1 to full-length Dna2 was barely detectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f4">4</xref>C and D), optimal interaction required both N-terminal and C-terminal regions of Dna2 and Rpa1 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f5">5</xref>). (iv) Deletion of the N-terminal region of either Rpa1 or Dna2 reduced the extent of stimulation of Dna2 endonuclease activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f7">7</xref>), even though the stimulation of Dna2 endonuclease activity was observed regardless of the presence of N-terminal regions of both Rpa1 and Dna2. This suggests that critical interactions occur between the C-termini of Rpa1 and Dna2. (vi) In the absence of both N-termini of Rpa1 and Dna2, the extent of endonuclease stimulation was similar to that observed with both wild-type proteins <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f8">8</xref>). Although counterintuitive, such a result might be expected if the two N-terminal domains regulate a transiently formed complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. For example, the complete abrogation of the N-terminal interaction might destabilize the complex formed and allow more rapid turnover of Dna2, which in turn results in an elevated rate of cleavage of the substrate <italic>in vitro</italic>. We were not able to test whether <italic>rfa1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>180N</italic> could rescue the growth defect of <italic>dna2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>405N in vivo</italic> since <italic>rfa1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>180N</italic> cells are lethal.</p><p>The bimodal interaction between Dna2 and Rpa1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f9">9</xref>) is likely to play an important role in the recruitment of Dna2 to RPA-bound flaps and the subsequent stimulation of the endonuclease activity of Dna2. We now know that deletion of the N-terminal region of either Dna2 or RPA affects cell growth and impairs the physical interactions between these proteins. These two effects could be related if the lethality caused by the N-terminal 180 amino acid deletion of Rpa1, which supports SV40 DNA replication <italic>in vitro</italic>, is due to a failure of the mutant RPA to interact optimally with Dna2 <italic>in vivo</italic>. In our bimodal interaction model, the primary mechanism of recruiting Dna2 to ssDNA-bound RPA is the interaction between C-termini of these proteins. This interaction is followed by a secondary interaction between the two N-terminal regions, further stabilizing their overall interaction. The secondary interaction between the two N-termini of Dna2 and Rpa1, however, appears to be auxiliary <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, since cells carrying the <italic>dna2</italic>&#x00394;<italic>405N</italic> allele are viable, at least at 30&#x000b0;C. The secondary interaction may be required to control the optimal rate of Dna2-catalyzed cleavage of the RPA-containing flap, by affecting a conformational change of Dna2 or RPA before and after the cleavage reaction. Alternatively, it may be required for the timely dissociation of either Dna2 or RPA or both proteins from substrates after cleavage occurs. At present, we cannot rule out the possibility that the N-termini of Rpa1 and Dna2 may be important for a functional protein conformation required for each protein action rather than the direct protein&#x02013;protein interaction. This model does not rule out the possibility that the essential role of the N-terminus of RPA is to mediate Dna2 interactions via a third protein that was absent from our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. Although two major interactions were detected between domains of Dna2 and Rpa1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, we cannot formally rule out the possibility that there is an interaction between the N-terminal domain of Rpa1 and the C-terminal domain of Dna2 since some mutations in the N-terminal domain of Rpa1 can suppress the growth defect of <italic>dna2-157</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg422f1">1</xref>B). If this is the case, the N-terminal domain of Rpa1 could interact with one other domain in addition to the N-terminal domain of Dna2.</p><p>How the interaction between RPA and Dna2 stimulates the function of Dna2 is presently unclear. The interaction, at least between the two N-terminal domains, is analogous to the inter-subunit interaction between Rpa1 and Rpa2. The N-terminal region of Rpa1 is positively charged, appears to resemble a ssDNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c33">33</xref>), and may contribute to the stability of the ssDNA&#x02013;RPA complex. Recently, it has been suggested that this region of Rpa1 is able to interact with the phosphorylated form of the N-terminal region of Rpa2 (M. Wold, personal communication). It is known that the N-terminal 180 amino acid region is relatively flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c33">33</xref>). The flexibility of this domain may confer on it the ability to interact with several replication proteins such as DNA polymerase &#x003b1; and Dna2. It is noteworthy that the N-terminal 45-kDa region of Dna2 is also unstructured and highly sensitive to protease digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg422c51">51</xref>). Therefore, the flexibility and relatively unstructured nature of both N-termini might allow the two proteins to interact more readily and regulate the enzymatic activities of Dna2. This property may account for why the N-terminal 180 amino acids of Rpa1 is essential <italic>in vivo</italic> but is not required to support SV40 DNA replication <italic>in vitro</italic>. The essential role of this domain <italic>in vivo</italic> may be to regulate the critical functions of Dna2.</p><p>Interactions between Dna2 and Rpa2 or Rpa3 were also observed although weaker (20&#x02013;30&#x00025;) than those detected with Rpa1, raising the possibility that Dna2 also interacts with RPA through these two subunits <italic>in vivo</italic>. The significance of this interaction, however, is not clear at present since we used purified subunits of Rpa2 and Rpa3 rather than the three-subunit complex. This may reflect a simple electrostatic interaction between Dna2 and Rpa2 or Rpa3 <italic>in vitro</italic>.

The primary interaction (as indicated by a thick closed arrow with double arrowheads) between the two C-terminal domains of Dna2 and Rpa1 helps form an initial complex, leading to conformational changes in the two proteins (step A). This in turn allows the secondary interaction (indicated by an open arrow with double arrowheads) to occur between the N-terminal domains of the two proteins (step B), forming a functional Dna2&#x02013;RPA complex. This bimodal interaction is likely to play a role for optimal stimulation of Dna2-catalyzed cleavage of DNA substrates and the subsequent disassembly of the protein&#x02013;DNA complex formed with the flap DNA.
