One important immune escape mechanism is the inhibition of complement activation mediated by interactions of the host-derived immune regulators factor H (CFH) and factor H-like protein 1 (CFHL1) with borrelial complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (BbCRASPs). BbCRASP-2 is a distinctive CFH- and CFHL1-binding protein that is produced by serum-resistant <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> strains. Here we show that binding of CFH by BbCRASP-2 is due to electrostatic as well as hydrophobic forces. In addition, 14 individual amino acid residues of BbCRASP-2 were identified as being involved in CFH and CFHL1 binding. Alanine substitutions of most of those residues significantly inhibited binding of CFH and/or CFHL1 by recombinant BbCRASP-2 proteins. To conclusively define the effects of BbCRASP-2 residue substitutions on serum sensitivity in the bacterial context, a serum-sensitive <italic>Borrelia garinii</italic> strain was transformed with plasmids that directed production of either wild-type or mutated BbCRASP-2 proteins. Critical amino acid residues within BbCRASP-2 were identified, with bacteria producing distinct mutant proteins being unable to bind either CFH or CFHL1, showing high levels of complement components C3, C6, and C5b-9 deposited on their surfaces and being highly sensitive to killing by normal serum. Collectively, we mapped a structurally sensitive CFH/CFHL1 binding site within borrelial BbCRASP-2 and identified single amino acid residues potentially involved in the interaction with both complement regulators.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was funded by the <grant-sponsor>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</grant-sponsor> (Grant <grant-num>Kr3383/1-1</grant-num> to P.

As are many other blood-borne pathogens, most infectious isolates of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> sensu stricto (s.s.)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">2</xref> are resistant to complement, a key effector system of the first line of defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Resistance to the alternative pathway of complement activation is facilitated, in part, by attachment of host complement regulatory proteins such as factor H (CFH) and factor H-like protein 1 (CFHL1) to the spirochetal outer surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>).</p><p>CFH and CFHL1, the two human immune regulators of the alternative pathway of the complement system, are structurally related plasma proteins. Both glycoproteins are composed of several homologous globular domains termed short consensus repeats (SCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). CFH is a 150-kDa glycoprotein composed of 20 SCR domains. CFHL1 is a 42-kDa glycoprotein and produced from an alternatively spliced transcript of the CFH gene, and consists of seven SCRs. The N-terminal seven SCRs of both complement regulators are identical, with the exception of four additional hydrophobic amino acids at the C terminus of CFHL1. Both molecules act as cofactors for factor I-mediated degradation of C3b, accelerate the decay of the C3 convertase of the alternative pathway by competing with Factor B for C3b-binding, and protect self surfaces from harmful attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>).</p><p>The interaction of CFH and/or CFHL1 with <italic>Borrelia</italic> species involves a variety of surface-exposed, outer membrane lipoproteins known as &#x0201c;CRASPs&#x0201d; (<underline>c</underline>omplement <underline>r</underline>egulator-<underline>a</underline>cquiring <underline>s</underline>urface <underline>p</underline>roteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Diverse Lyme disease genospecies can produce different CRASPs, so the proteins of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> s.s. are often referred to as &#x0201c;BbCRASPs,&#x0201d; those of <italic>Borrelia afzelii</italic> are called &#x0201c;BaCRASPs,&#x0201d; etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). Different <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> strains express different numbers of CRASP proteins, each of which varies in relative affinity for the two host immune regulators. According to their ability to bind to CFH and/or CFHL1, the CRASPs produced by <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> s.s. <italic>B. afzelii</italic>, and <italic>B. spielmanii</italic> are divided into (i) CFH- and CFHL1-binding proteins (Ba-, Bb-, BsCRASP-1 and Ba-, Bb-, BsCRASP-2), (ii) the CFHL1-binding protein BaCRASP-3 of <italic>B. afzelii</italic>, and (iii) molecules that soley interact with CFH (BbCRASP-3 to -5 from <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, BaCRASP-4 and BaCRASP-5 from <italic>B. afzelii</italic>, and BsCRASP-3 from <italic>B. spielmanii</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). CRASP-encoding genes belong to three genetically distinct classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). BbCRASP-1, encoded by <italic>cspA</italic>, belongs to the formerly categorized pgf 54 family and is produced by <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> (s.s.) only during tick-to-mammal and mammal-to-tick transmission stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Another class of proteins, including BbCRASP-3 (ErpP), BbCRASP-4 (ErpC), BbCRASP-5 (ErpA), and OspE, are encoded by the polymorphic <italic>erp</italic> gene family and produced at varying levels throughout mammalian infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). The <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> (s.s.) CFH/CFHL1 binding protein, BbCRASP-2, was recently identified as being encoded by the <italic>cspZ</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). Studies investigating its expression revealed that BbCRASP-2 is poorly produced by Borreliae during tick colonization, but is expressed at high levels during mammalian infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). Additionally, comparative analysis of the <italic>cspZ</italic> genes of diverse <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> (s.s.) strains showed high degrees of sequence conservation, in particular within regions determined to be involved in binding CFH and/or CFHL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). A recent study indicated that production of BbCRASP-2 is not essential for short term (up to 18 days) infection of mice, although the importance of BbCRASP-2 production for long term mammalian infection has yet to be examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>).</p><p>In the present study we used site-directed mutagenesis to identify amino acid residues within BbCRASP-2 necessary for binding of CFH and CFHL1. A total of 31 residues were mutated, and the recombinant proteins were analyzed for CFH and CFHL1 binding. In addition, the effects on complement susceptibility and deposition of complement components were studied in Borreliae engineered to produce wild-type or mutated BbCRASP-2 proteins. The sensitivity of BbCRASP-2 interactions with CFH was also examined under varying salt and heparin concentrations. Collectively, these analyses defined several amino acids involved in binding of the immune regulators and showed that binding of CFH and CFHL1 contribute to serum resistance of Borreliae. The results presented in this study might further allow the definition of epitopes of BbCRASP-2 useful for vaccine development.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Bacterial Strains and Culture Condition</italic>&#x02014;<italic>B. garinii</italic> strain G1 was originally isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a Lyme disease patient and is highly susceptible to complement-mediated killing <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). <italic>Borrelia</italic> were grown at 33 &#x000b0;C for 5&#x02013;6 days up to cell densities of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> ml<sup>-1</sup> in modified Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK) medium as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> JM109 was used as host for cloning and purification of recombinant proteins.</p><p><italic>Site-directed Mutagenesis, Sequence Analysis, and Generation of Recombinant Proteins</italic>&#x02014;To introduce single or double amino acid substitutions into the BbCRASP-2-encoding <italic>cspZ</italic> gene, a site-directed mutagenesis approach was conducted as described by the QuikChange&#x02122; protocol (Stratagene). The mutagenic high-performance liquid chromatography-purified primers employed in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) and listed in supplemental Table S1. Briefly, PCR reactions were carried out for 18 cycles (95 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, 55 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, and 68 &#x000b0;C for 13 min) using 100 ng of expression vector pGEX CSPZ, 125 ng of each mutagenic primer, and 2.5 units of <italic>Pfu</italic> DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in a final volume of 50 &#x003bc;l. For the introduction of site-specific mutations into shuttle vector pCSPZ (previously referred as pCRASP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>)), thermal cycling was performed for 18 cycles at 95 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, 55 &#x000b0;C for 60 s, and 68 &#x000b0;C for 16 min. Before transformation of <italic>E. coli</italic>, the reactions were treated with 10 units of DpnI (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) for 1 h at 37 &#x000b0;C. All mutations introduced into the <italic>cspZ</italic> gene were verified by DNA sequencing of both DNA strands.

The goat anti-human C3 and C6 antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem, and the monoclonal anti-human C5b-9 antibody was from Quidel (San Diego, CA).

Charged, hydrophobic, or polar amino acids within the putative CFH and/or CFHL1 binding region 2, which encompasses amino acid positions 70&#x02013;88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>), were systematically replaced by alanine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Initially, binding of each recombinant mutant BbCRASP-2 protein to CFH and CFHL1 was quantified using ELISA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Mutant proteins D70A, S72A, K73A, Q76A, K82A, K83A, N85A, and K86A all bound CFH and CFHL1 with intensities comparable to the wild-type BbCRASP-2 protein. Mutant S79A showed reduced binding to CFH, and binding of CFHL1 was decreased in mutants Q71A and N75A. Replacement of aspartate with alanine at position 84 (mutant D84A) impaired binding of both CFH and CFHL1. The strongest effect on binding of both immune regulators was observed when phenylalanine was replaced by alanine at position 81 (mutant F81A).

Pathogenic <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> s.s., <italic>B. afzelii</italic>, and <italic>B. spielmanii</italic> isolates resist complement-mediated killing due to the production of multiple CRASPs proteins, which bind CFH and CFHL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). All serum-resistant <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> s.s. isolates examined so far produce as many as five distinct CRASPs, belonging to three genetically distinct classes. Complementation of serum-sensitive Borreliae with either BbCRASP-1 or BbCRASP-2 increases resistance to complement-mediated lysis (Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref> and this work). The recently identified CFH- and CFHL1-binding BbCRASP-2 protein (also referred as CspZ) is highly conserved among <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> s.s. isolates, and infected humans and laboratory animals produce robust antibody responses against this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>).</p><p>In our earlier analyses, through use of a peptide-based approach, we identified four linear regions within BbCRASP-2 capable of binding of CFH and CFHL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). Until cocrystals of BbCRASP-2 with its ligands become available, the identification of residues acting upon CFH/CFHL1 binding has to be sought by other means, such as the site-directed mutagenesis approach used here. We decided to systematically substitute residues within the putative binding region -2, -3, and -4 with a neutral alanine residue, to limit side-effects and to best allow maintenance of the native conformation of BbCRASP-2 molecules. Substitutions of 14 distinct amino acid residues within the putative binding regions affected CFH and CFHL1 binding. In addition, some substitutions affected binding of CFH (S79A) or only CFHL1 (N75A, H130A, and D133A). The binding profiles show that the N-terminal part of region 4 appears to represent the most sensitive CFH/CFHL1 binding site, as changes at any position between 204 and 211 decreased binding of complement regulators. In addition, several amino acid residues within binding region 2 (Gln-71, Asn-75, Ser-79, Phe-81, and Asp-84) and binding region 3 (Arg-129, His-130, and Arg-139) also influence binding of the complement regulators. These data confirm the concept that BbCRASP-2 uses multiple contact sites for CFH/CFHL1 binding. ELISA experiments indicated that several charged residues, <italic>e.g.</italic> Asp-84, Arg-129, Arg-139, Arg-204, Lys-206, and Glu-214 as well as hydrophobic residues Phe-81, Tyr-207, Phe-210, and Tyr-211 are involved in these interactions. These results suggest that interactions between BbCRASP-2 and immune regulators are dictated by two different binding mechanisms, one dependent on electrostatic forces and the other being favored by hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonding. This is in line with the general conclusion that the predominant driving forces in protein-protein interactions include covalent and non-covalent interactions, <italic>e.g.</italic> van der Waals contacts, electrostatic forces, and hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). Effects of increasing salt concentrations on CFH binding to BbCRASP-2 suggest that long range electrostatic forces and ion pairings play a subordinate role. In general, salt concentrations in the range of 0.1&#x02013;1 <sc>m</sc> reduce the formation of salt bridges and drastically influence protein-protein interactions that are primarily mediated by electrostatic forces, such as the interactions between CFH and host C3b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>). The relative influence of the electronegative polysaccharide heparin on BbCRASP-2-CFH interactions also suggests that other forces beside electrostatic are involved in this interaction. Alternatively, heparin and CFH may share overlapping but not identical binding sites on BbCRASP-2. In contrast, CFH binding to the borrelial proteins BbCRASP-1, BbCRASP-3, and OspE is completely inhibited by heparin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>). Thus, the type of interaction of the individual CRASP proteins with the same host complement regulator ligands is different. Long range electrostatic forces together with hydrophobic interactions might also be required for the stabilization of the complex formed by BbCRASP-2 and CFH/CFHL1.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Serum susceptibility of <italic>B. garinii</italic> G1 strains expressing diverse BbCRASP-2 proteins.</bold> A growth inhibition assay was used to investigate susceptibility to human serum of G1, G1/pKFSS1, G1/pCSPZ, G1/pCSPZ F81A, G1/pCSPZ R139A, G1/pCSPZ Y207A, G1/pCSPZ Y211A, G1/pCSPZ R139A/Y207A, and G1/pCSPZ Y207A/Y211A.

Thus, serum resistance directly correlated with binding of CFH and CFHL1 and significant reduction of complement activation products deposited on the cell surface. Moreover, we showed that some exchanges of single amino acid residues (in mutants F81A, R139, and Y207A) did not always result in higher serum susceptibility, whereas mutations at two positions had additive effects to increase susceptibility to complement (mutants R139A/Y207A and Y207A/Y211A).

These lines of evidence suggest that distinct amino acid residues play pivotal roles for interactions of BbCRASP-2 with CFH and CFHL1. In addition to the Lyme disease Borrelia species a number of other important human pathogenic bacteria produce proteins utilize host immune regulators CFH and/or CFHL1 for immune and complement evasion and for adherence to human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>). The underlying mechanism(s) of the molecular protein-protein interaction are largely unclear, but it appears that various bacterial proteins bind to human immune regulators by different modes. Involvement of conformational binding structures and linear determinants is uncertain regarding the CFH-binding proteins of relapsing fever Borrelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref>) and various pneumococci strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>). Thus, elucidating the structural underpinnings of this aspect of host-pathogen interactions will have major impacts upon developing new specific therapeutics against human pathogens.</p><p>In summary, we mapped a structurally sensitive CFH/CFHL1 binding site within BbCRASP-2 and identified single amino acid residues, which are involved in interactions with the two host immune regulators. Furthermore, binding of CFH and CFHL1 to <italic>Borrelia</italic> producing BbCRASP-2 on their surface is sufficient to facilitate serum resistance in this pathogen. To our knowledge, this is the first report analyzing mutated proteins on the surface of live spirochetes under physiological conditions. Altogether, this study represents a major step toward a full understanding of the molecular interactions between serum-resistant Borreliae and immune regulators of the human host.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M805844200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M805844200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Steffi H&#x000e4;lbich, Christa Hanssen-H&#x000fc;bner, and Jane Herrlich for skillful and expert technical assistance.
