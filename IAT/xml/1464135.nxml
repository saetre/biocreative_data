Seven subtypes (P2X<sub>1&#x02013;7</sub>), each encoded for by a separate gene, are present in mammalian species (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]) and these combine to form either homo or hetero trimeric channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] exhibiting different expression profiles and functional properties. P2X<sub>1</sub>, the first subtype to be isolated, was cloned over a decade ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and the physiological roles of this channel in the regulation of arterial tone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and in the neuronal control of smooth muscle contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] are well established. The presence of P2X<sub>1 </sub>receptors in platelets was discovered shortly after its cloning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], however, it has not been until more recent times that the physiological importance of P2X<sub>1 </sub>in platelet function has started to fully emerge (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). Activation of platelet P2X<sub>1 </sub>receptors by extracellular ATP results in a rapid Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx which activates cytoskeletal events to induce a transient but substantial shape change and granule centralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], both important early events in platelet activation. P2X<sub>1 </sub>receptors can also synergize with P2Y, collagen, adrenaline and thrombopoietin receptor mediated responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] to enhance platelet function. Furthermore, over expression of P2X<sub>1 </sub>in the platelets of transgenic mice results in a prothrombotic phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] whereas an absence of the receptor in P2X<sub>1 </sub>knockout mice leads to a reduced risk of thrombosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] suggesting that the level of P2X<sub>1 </sub>receptor expression in platelets is of physiological and clinical significance.</p><p>Although the physiological roles and consequences of altered expression levels of platelet P2X<sub>1 </sub>receptors are becoming increasingly apparent, the mechanisms that regulate P2X<sub>1 </sub>expression in platelets are poorly understood. Since platelets are cell fragments devoid of any nuclei the complement of channels and receptors present on their surface must ultimately rely on the regulation of gene transcription in the megakaryocyte, the platelet precursor cell. bHLH factors and E proteins are thought to be involved in smooth muscle specific <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Nothing however is known about transcriptional regulation of <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>in megakaryoblastic cells. In order to initiate studies on the transcriptional mechanisms involved in determining P2X<sub>1 </sub>expression levels in platelets, we have identified and characterized the <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>promoter in the megakaryoblastic cell line MEG-01 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We show that Sp1 and NF-1 regulatory elements located in the direct vicinity of the transcriptional start site are essential for basal transcription of <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>in MEG-01 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cloning and analysis of the <italic>P2X<sub>1 </sub></italic>gene 5' upstream sequence</title><p>The human genomic BAC clone RP11-167N20 was found to contain all 12 exons of the human <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>gene and 64 kb 5' upstream sequence. The 4.772 kb upstream of the ATG start codon was cloned into the pGL-3 Basic luciferase reporter plasmid to generate the plasmid p-4407/+365 and the sequence analyzed by the Proscan computer program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A potential core promoter was predicted at -151 to +99 bp with a promoter score of 70.32.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>transcription start site is located 365 bp upstream of the start codon</title><p>To map the location of the <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>transcription initiation site in MEG-01 cells, four anti-sense oligonucleotides Pet1, Pet2, Pet3 and Pet4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) were used for primer extension. As positive control we utilized a previously published primer sequence pTXRHR-100 which has been used to map the transcription start site of the thromboxane receptor gene in MEG-01 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Similar to previous studies, this control primer yielded a single extension product of ~110 bp (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> lane 1). A single extension product of ~210 bp was generated by Pet1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> lane 3), two distinct extension products of ~150 bp and ~249 bp, were generated by Pet3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> lane 5), a doublet band of ~66 bp was generated by Pet4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> lane 6) and no extension products were observed from Pet2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> lane 4). Extension products of 66 bp (Pet4), 150 bp (Pet3) and 210 bp (Pet1) correspond to a transcription start site located ~365 bp upstream of the ATG start codon. The Pet2 sequence is very close to this site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and so would not be expected to produce an extension product. An additional extension product of 249 bp produced by the Pet3 primer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, lane 5) indicated the possibility of an additional transcription start site located ~465 bp upstream of start codon. However, no bands corresponding to such a start site were observed with the Pet1, Pet2 or Pet4 primers. Furthermore, subsequent analysis of promoter activity in constructs where this potential site had been removed (p-111/+149 compared to p-68/+149 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>)) did not indicate the presence of a functional transcription start site in this region. We therefore attributed the 249 bp band produced by the Pet3 primer as a non-specific extension product. To precisely map the start site, sequencing reactions primed with the same Pet primer used for primer extension were run in parallel to extension reactions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The 150 bp Pet3 extension product (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> lane 6) corresponds to a transcription start site located at a "T" residue 365 bp upstream of the ATG start codon. This site is 78 bp downstream of the start site previously described for <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>in smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] but matches closely to the EST clone BX644575 which was isolated from human bone marrow, a tissue rich in megakaryocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>PMA induced differentiation results in a 20-fold increase in <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>reporter gene activity</title><p>In initial studies, we tested the p-4407/+365 construct for promoter activity in three cell lines previously reported to show endogenous P2X<sub>1 </sub>expression, MEG-01 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], HL-60 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and Jurkat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The human kidney proximal tubular epithelial cell line HK2 was used as negative control. Cells were assayed both with and without prior treatment with PMA, a phorbol ester previously reported to increase P2X<sub>1 </sub>mediated currents in MEG-01 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and HL-60 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] cells. Low promoter activity was detected in untreated MEG-01, HL-60 and Jurkat cells but not in HK2 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Treatment of MEG-01 cells with 10 nM PMA caused cells to differentiate to a non-proliferating adherent phenotype and resulted in a ~20 fold increase in promoter activity of p-4407/+365. This PMA-induced increase was also apparent in Jurkat and HL-60 cells but not in HK2 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Comparisons of promoter activity between different constructs in untreated MEG-01 cells proved problematic since promoter activities were not sufficiently above background to allow accurate quantification. PMA-differentiated MEG-01 cells were therefore utilized for subsequent analysis since these cells represent a well characterized model of megakaryocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and the higher <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>promoter activity aided quantification of differences between constructs.</p></sec><sec><title>Deletion analysis of luciferase reporter gene constructs</title><p>To define the mechanisms controlling transcriptional regulation of <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>in MEG-01 cells, a series of deletion constructs were generated. Gradual deletion of 5' sequence from -4407 to -2235 resulted in no significant change in luciferase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) suggesting that no important regulatory elements reside in this ~2 kb region. Removal of sequence between -2235 and -1398 in construct p-1398/+365 however resulted in a 88 &#x000b1; 14% increase (p &#x0003c; 0.01) in promoter activity indicating the presence of a repressive element. Sequence analysis of this region revealed a 396 bp polypyrimidine tract located -1801 to -1405 bp which contains 15 copies of the sequence motif 5'-TCCCTCCCTCCC-3'. Interestingly, this same sequence motif is present in the mouse c-Ki-ras promoter where it plays a role in transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Within this polypyrimidine tract region are clustered multiple potential Sp1, Ets-2 and MAZ transcription factor binding sites. The increase in promoter activity was maintained throughout deletions from 1398 to 190 in the constructs p-805/365, p-454/+365, p-330/+365, and p-190/+365 (p &#x0003c; 0.01 for each construct) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The difference in promoter activity between constructs p-1398/+365 through to p-190/+365 was not significant. Removal of 3' sequence from +365 to +149 bp (p-190/+149) decreased promoter activity back to the level of the p-4407/+365 construct. Deletion of 5' sequence from -190 to -111 bp (p-111/+149) resulted in a 63 &#x000b1; 5% decrease (p &#x0003c; 0.01) in promoter activity. Further deletion of 43 bp 5' sequence in construct p-68/+149 produced no significant change in activity from p-111/+149. Removal of 3' sequence however from +149 to +17 bp in construct p-190/+17 completely abolished promoter activity.</p><p>Thus, to summarize the deletion analysis performed on the <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>upstream region, promoter activity was stable or increased in 5' deletions from -4407 through to position -190. Deletions past -190 up to position -68 significantly reduced promoter activity whereas removal of 132 bp from +149 to +17 bp abolished promoter function demonstrating that this region contains regulatory elements essential for transcription.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro </italic>binding of Sp1/3 and NF-1 to the <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>promoter</title><p>Results from the above deletion analysis suggested that the region -190 to +149 bp plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Analysis of this region using the programmes TESS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and PROSCAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] did not reveal putative TATA or CCAAT boxes, but detected several potential transcription factor binding sites including NF-&#x003ba;B, YY-1, GATA-1, NF-1, and multiple Sp1 sites. To begin to understand which specific transcription factors are involved in regulating <italic>P2X<sub>1 </sub></italic>gene transcription we initially performed EMSAs on nuclear extracts from PMA-treated MEG-01 cells using oligonucleotides corresponding to a potential NF-1 site and two Sp1 sites (named Sp1a and Sp1b) located in the immediate vicinity of the transcription start site. The radiolabelled probe O-NF1 containing a potential NF-1 binding site produced a major retarded band (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> lanes 1 and 3), the formation of which was prevented by an excess of unlabelled O-NF1 itself (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> lane 4) but not by the mutated O-NF1-mut probe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> lane 5). In the presence of an anti-NF-1 antibody, the DNA-protein complexes were either supershifted or remained in the well (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> lane 2). Similar results for NF-1 supershift complexes have also been reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], we therefore concluded that NF-1 can bind to the <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>proximal promoter.</p><p>The probes O-Sp1a and O-Sp1b corresponding to the Sp1a and Sp1b binding sites respectively, gave rise to three major DNA-protein complexes, the larger two of which appear as a doublet band (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> lanes 1 and 4). To identify specific transcription factor binding, supershift assays with Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies were performed. The Sp3 antibody produced a supershift ("ss" Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> lanes 3 and 6). Sp1 antibodies caused a decrease in intensity of the doublet band but produced no visible supershifted products (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> lanes 2 and 5). To further clarify the molecular basis of Sp1/Sp3 interactions with the oligonucleotide probes, competition experiments were performed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Addition of unlabelled O-Sp1a or O-Sp1b prevented binding of Sp1/Sp3 to labelled probe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> lanes 2 and 6). Similarly, addition of an unlabelled commercial consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> lanes 4 and 8) also prevented Sp1/Sp3 binding to O-Sp1a and O-Sp1b. In contrast O-Sp1a-mut and O-Sp1b-mut did not prevent protein binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> lanes 3 and 7) demonstrating that a 2 bp mutation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) disrupted Sp1/3 binding.</p><p>An oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the potential NF-&#x003ba;B binding site (O-NF&#x003ba;B) did not produce super-shifted products after addition of an NF-&#x003ba;B antibody (data not shown). In summary EMSAs demonstrated that Sp1, Sp3 and NF-1 transcription factors can bind regulatory elements in the P2X<sub>1 </sub>proximal promoter implying that these factors are involved in the regulation of P2X<sub>1 </sub>gene transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Sp1 and NF-1 sites are essential for basal transcription of the <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>gene</title><p>We next conducted site-directed mutagenesis to disrupt the Sp1/3, NF-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B binding sites in selected <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>promoter constructs. Promoter activity of mutated constructs was determined in PMA treated MEG-01 cells and expressed relative to that of the wild type p-190/+149 construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Single mutation of the NF-&#x003ba;B (construct mNF-&#x003ba;B) and Sp1a (construct mSp1a) sites produced no significant change in promoter activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Single mutation of the NF-1 site (construct mNF-1) or Sp1b site (construct mSp1b) however resulted in 76 &#x000b1; 5% (p &#x0003c; 0.01) and 76 &#x000b1; 2% (P &#x0003c; 0.01) reductions respectively. A double mutation ablating both NF-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B sites simultaneously (construct mut1) reduced promoter activity by 80 &#x000b1; 2% (p &#x0003c; 0.01), whereas double mutation of Sp1a and Sp1b sites (construct mut2) reduced activity by 92% &#x000b1; 1 (p &#x0003c; 0.01). Simultaneous mutation of NF-1 and Sp1b sites (construct mut3), the NF-1 site together with Sp1a and Sp1b sites (construct mut4), or deletion of the fragment from +18 to +149 bp which removes both Sp1a and Sp1b sites (construct p-190/+17) effectively abolished promoter activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).</p><p>In order to confirm the apparent redundancy of the potential NF-&#x003ba;B site, we generated a further set of mutations in the plasmid p-111/+149, a construct where the potential NF-&#x003ba;B site has been removed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Whilst removal of 79 bp from -190 to -111 resulted in a ~50% decrease in promoter activity, the overall pattern of promoter activity resulting from Sp1 and NF-1 binding site mutations was very similar to that observed in the p-190/+149 mutations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).</p><p>A <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>transcription start site 78 bp upstream from site identified in this current study has been reported in human smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. If this same site is utilized in MEG-01 cells then its removal in deletion constructs would be expected to abolish promoter activity. To test this hypothesis and to further delineate a functional core promoter, the construct p-68/+149 was generated. p-68/+149 displayed a promoter activity 32 &#x000b1; 3% that of the p-190/+149 construct. Single and double site-directed mutations of Sp1 and NF-1 binding sites in this p-68/+149 construct again showed a similar pattern of promoter activity to that observed in the p-190/+149 construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).</p><p>From the above mutation and previous deletion analysis, we defined the region spanning -68 to +149 as the <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>core promoter composing of a single NF-1 binding site and two Sp1-binding sites. To prove the importance of these sites in controlling basal transcription, the Sp1a, Sp1b and NF-1 sites were mutated in the original 4.7 kb reporter construct p-4407/+365 to generate the construct p-4407/+365(mut4). Promoter activity from this triple mutated construct was abolished in both untreated and PMA-treated MEG-01 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>) confirming the essential roles of Sp1 and NF-1 in <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>basal transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Direct binding of Sp1/3 and NF-1 to the endogenous <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>core promoter</title><p>Having identified Sp1, Sp3 and NF-1 sites essential for <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>reporter gene function, we next utilized ChIP to determine whether the corresponding transcription factors are physically recruited to the endogenous <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>core promoter <italic>in vivo </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Primers for the <italic>Hsp70 </italic>and <italic>histone H4 </italic>promoters were used as positive controls as Sp1 and Sp3 have previously been detected at these promoters by ChIP assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. As a negative control, parallel experiments using primers for the coding region of the <italic>GAPDH </italic>gene were performed.

As a first step towards understanding the transcriptional mechanisms regulating <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>expression in megakaryocytic cells, we have analyzed the <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>promoter in MEG-01 cells. We identified a transcription start site 365 bp upstream of the start codon and defined a core promoter located within the region -68 to +149 bp. Two Sp1 sites and an NF-1 site in the core promoter were shown to be critical for basal transcription.</p><p>The <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>core promoter was found not to possess "TATA" or "CCAAT" elements but contained Sp1 and NF-1 sites critical for basal transcription. Mammalian promoters lacking a TATA box often contain Sp1 elements and rely on Sp1 to recruit TATA-binding protein and guide RNA polymerase II to the initiator site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Sp1 and Sp3 are members of a large family of transcription factors that regulate transcription through interactions with GC-boxes. They are both zinc finger proteins that bind the same DNA recognition sequences with similar affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Despite ubiquitous expression, tissue-specific gene activation by Sp1 and Sp3 may be achieved by a variety of mechanisms including variability in the concentration of Sp1 and Sp3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], interactions of Sp1 with tissue specific transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and tissue specific post-translational modification of Sp1 and Sp3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Sp1/3 can regulate gene transcription through a variety of mechanisms, functioning as either a basal promoter element or an upstream activator, depending on promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Two Sp1/3 sites were identified in the <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>promoter and mutation of the Sp1b (+71 to +79) site most markedly reduced promoter activity. Single mutation of the Sp1a (+44 to +52) site did not significantly reduce transcription. However, simultaneous mutation of both Sp1a and Sp1b together entirely abolished transcriptional activity. Thus, the Sp1b site can completely compensate for the loss of the Sp1a site but Sp1a can only partially compensate for the loss of Sp1b suggesting that whilst both sites may be utilized in basal transcription, the Sp1b site plays a more prominent role.</p><p>An NF-1 site in the <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>core promoter was also found to be important for transcription. NF-1 proteins are recruited to promoters in a cell type specific manner and can associate with different regulators to either activate or repress transcription depending on the promoter and cellular context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Site-directed mutagenesis of the NF-1 site in the <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>core promoter significantly reduced transcriptional activity by ~80% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Simultaneous mutation of both NF-1 and Sp1b sites completely abolished promoter activity suggesting that NF-1 and Sp1/3 may act synergistically to recruit the initiation complex to the <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>core promoter.</p><p>The human <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>promoter identified in this study shows characteristics typical of those normally associated with housekeeping genes: lack of classical TATA or CCAAT boxes, an increased GC content and critical Sp1 and NF-1 elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This would appear ideally suited for P2X<sub>1 </sub>expression in megakaryocytes since constant synthesis is required for platelet production. Constitutive expression of <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>however does not occur in all hematic cell types and their progenitors as neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes show no significant expression of P2X<sub>1 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. This suggests that tight repression of the P2X<sub>1 </sub>promoter occurs and that release from this repression may be an important feature of <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>transcriptional regulation. Deletion analysis performed in this study identified a repressive element in an upstream region containing a 396 bp polypyrimidine tract located -1801 to -1405. Removal of this tract in deletion constructs p-1398/+365 through to p-190/+365 resulted in a ~90&#x02013;100% increase in promoter activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Polypyrimidine tracts can harbor multiple binding sites for Sp1 and Sp3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and play important roles in the regulation of gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. A possible mechanism for the repressive effect of the <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>polypyrimidine tract could be that this region facilitates a local sequestration of Sp1/3 factors hindering their binding to the Sp1a and Sp1b sites further downstream in the core promoter.</p><p>Important transcriptional regulatory elements often show conservation between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. We therefore investigated whether the NF-1, Sp1a and Sp1b binding sites identified in the human promoter are also present in the upstream sequence of <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>genes from other species. Using BLAST searches of genomic sequence data we identified <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>genes from mouse, chimp, dog and rat. Similar to human, the upstream regions of these genes were also GC-rich and contained no "TATA" or "CCAAT" elements. Sequence alignment revealed NF-1, Sp1a and Sp1b sites in identical positions across all species examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). These results demonstrate a conserved core promoter structure in mammalian P2X<sub>1 </sub>genes and suggest that the involvement of Sp1/3 and NF-1 in the regulation of <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>transcription has been conserved during evolution.</p><p>PMA-induced differentiation of MEG-01 cells is widely used as a model of megakaryocytic maturation and is known to increase the expression of megakaryocytic lineage specific antigens, such as integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. PMA activates signaling cascades via activation of PKC and other C1 domain containing receptors resulting in a wide range of cellular effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. PMA can enhance P2X<sub>1 </sub>mediated responses in MEG-01 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], THP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and HL-60 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] cells and is also thought to have more acute effects by increasing phosphorylation of a putative P2X<sub>1 </sub>accessory protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In this study, we found that <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>promoter activity increased ~20-fold in PMA-differentiated MEG-01 cells compared to untreated cells. Several studies have shown Sp1 DNA-binding activity and expression level to increase upon treatment of cells with PMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Similarly, PMA induction has been shown to increase the formation of NF-1 DNA complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. We therefore speculate that PMA enhances P2X<sub>1 </sub>ion channel function through the actions of Sp1 and NF-1 at the <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>core promoter resulting in an increase in gene transcription and the synthesis of new P2X<sub>1 </sub>protein. The signaling pathways that link PMA stimulation with <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>gene activation and whether these result in alterations in the levels of Sp1 and NF-1 or in protein modifications such as phosphorylation altering the affinity of factors for their respective binding sites remain to be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> control of <italic>P2X<sub>1</sub></italic> transcription in megakaryocytes is undoubtedly a complex combinatorial process involving the integration of a large number of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that mediate cell type specific expression during megakaryocyte differentiation and the ability respond to regulatory inputs. This study provides the first steps towards unraveling the complexities of this control by providing the fundamental information of <italic>P2X<sub>1</sub></italic> core promoter location and composition in a megakaryocytic cell line. We demonstrate that Sp1 and NF-1 are critical for <italic>P2X<sub>1</sub></italic> core promoter function in both proliferating and PMA-differentiated MEG-01 cells. The targeting of signaling pathways that influence the function of these transcription factors in megakaryocytes may therefore provide the basis for the future therapeutic manipulation of platelet P2X<sub>1 </sub>function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reporter constructs</title><p>The human genomic BAC clone (RP11-167N20) containing the human <italic>P2X</italic><sub>1 </sub>gene was obtained from the Sanger Institute. 4.772 kb upstream of the start codon was amplified by PCR using <italic>Pfu </italic>polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) and cloned into pGL3-Basic (Promega).
