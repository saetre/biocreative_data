They are found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes as light sensors. <underline>Long H</underline>ypocotyl in <underline>F</underline>ar-<underline>R</underline>ed 1 (HFR1) has been identified as a positive regulator and a possible transcription factor in both blue and far-red light signaling in plants. However, the gene targets that are regulated by HFR1 in cryptochrome 1 (cry1)-mediated blue light signaling have not been globally addressed. We examined the transcriptome profiles in a cry1- and HFR1-dependent manner in response to 1 hour of blue light. Strikingly, more than 70&#x00025; of the genes induced by blue light in an HFR1-dependent manner were dependent on cry1, and <italic>vice versa</italic>. High overrepresentation of W-boxes and OCS elements were found in these genes, indicating that this strong cry1 and HFR1 co-regulation on gene expression is possibly through these two <italic>cis</italic>-elements. We also found that cry1 was required for maintaining the HFR1 protein level in blue light, and that the HFR1 protein level is strongly correlated with the global gene expression pattern. In summary, HFR1, which is fine-tuned by cry1, is crucial for regulating global gene expression in cry1-mediated early blue light signaling, especially for the function of genes containing W-boxes and OCS elements.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Light is not only an energy source for photosynthesis, it is also an important signal for plant development.

Overexpressing the C-terminus of HFR1 constitutively activates a subset of photomorphogenic responses in darkness, far-red and white light. In addition, the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation by HFR1 also depends on phyA, FHY1 and FHY3 under far-red light, or phyB under red light, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003563-Yang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>; suggesting that HFR1 is involved in a complex regulatory network in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In addition to its role in phyA signaling in far-red light, HFR1 is also a component of cry1-mediated blue light signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003563-Duek1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutant <italic>hfr1</italic> alleles have reduced de-etiolation responses under blue light. Unlike <italic>hy5</italic>, de-etiolation in <italic>hfr1</italic> mutants is particularly significant under high fluence rates. But it is still unknown how HFR1 identifies its downstream targets and what they are. Although cry1 is the predominant photoreceptor in high fluence blue light, other photoreceptors participate as well.

HFR1 and cry1 protein levels were examined under the same conditions as well. Interestingly, we found a close relationship between cry1 and HFR1 on the induction of gene expression. cry1 depends on HFR1 to turn on certain genes, and HFR1 requires cry1 to sustain its protein stability. Using computational methods, we also propose that HFR1 may elevate downstream gene expression through W-boxes and OCS elements, indicating that a subset of genes, having either of these <italic>cis</italic>-elements, may be responsive to cry1-mediated early blue light signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>hfr1-23</italic> mutant isolation and identification</title><p>Genetic screening was conducted among the T-DNA mutant pools (CS31087).

In each pair-wise comparison (WT/<italic>cry1</italic> and WT/<italic>hfr1</italic>), all genes were calculated for the variance of G, L and the interaction of G&#x0002a;L. The significance of the variance was quantified as the p-value. Genes with p-values lower than the false discovery rate for interaction of G&#x0002a;L were selected as regulated by blue light and dependent on the genotype in each comparison. The magnitude of the contribution of cry1 or HFR1 on each gene in the blue light response was quantified by the mean fold change for the induction or repression of each gene. A fold change of 1.0 represents no contribution by cry1 or HFR1, respectively. The fold change of all of the candidates taken into account was expected to be higher than 2.0 (including 2.0), which represents a significant effect of cry1 or HFR1, respectively. In each pair-wise comparison, all candidates regulated by the interaction of G and L with more than a 2 fold change (including 2 fold) in blue light were selected to generate gene lists representing genes induced or repressed by blue light and also dependent on the genotype. Strikingly, 74&#x00025; (293 of 398) of the genes that were identified as blue light-induced, and dependent on HFR1, were also found to be dependent on cry1. These 293 genes were 70&#x00025; of the 416 genes induced by blue light and dependent on cry1. However, only 16&#x00025; (41 of 263) of the genes that were blue light-repressed, and dependent on HFR1, were found to be dependent on cry1, which is 30&#x00025; of the 138 genes that were repressed by blue light and dependent on cry1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003563-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003563.s006">Data S6</xref>). Neither the quantity (41) nor the mean magnitude of repression (2&#x02013;14.54 fold) of these repressed genes is comparable to the induced genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003563.s006">Data S6</xref>). These 41 repressed genes are a much smaller proportion of the genes observed to be repressed by blue light that are dependent on either cry1 (41/138&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;30&#x00025;) or HFR1 (41/263&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;16&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003563-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggests that HFR1 is more likely a turn-on switch to light-induced genes rather than a shutdown of genes expressed in the dark.</p><p>In the 293 genes that were significantly induced by blue light and dependent on both cry1 and HFR1, 50&#x00025; (146 of 293) were induced by more than 10 fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003563.s002">Data S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003563.s003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003563.s004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003563.s005">S5</xref>). The 293 genes induced by cry1 (WT/<italic>cry1</italic>) in blue light were also very robustly induced by blue light in WT compared to those in the dark (B/D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003563-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). When these 293 genes were ranked by blue light induction in WT, there was no blue light response observed for these 293 genes in <italic>cry1</italic> mutants, and a significantly reduced blue light response was found for these 293 genes in <italic>hfr1</italic> mutants; suggesting that cry1 is required for blue light induced gene expression and that HFR1 is required to elevate their expression levels. A few genes involved in electron transport were induced by more than 100 fold by 1 h of blue light and dependent on both cry1 and HFR1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003563.s002">Data S2</xref>); suggesting that there was a highly active electron flux after the seedlings were exposed to 1 h of blue light. The majority of the 293 genes were induced by less than 100 fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003563.s003">Data S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003563.s004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003563.s005">S5</xref>). These gene products are involved in a large number of bioprocesses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003563-g002">Figure 2D</xref>); indicating that blue light potentially stimulates the entire system to initiate photomorphogenesis through both cry1 and HFR1. There are also some genes regulated by blue light that are dependent on either cry1 or HFR1 in the same comparison; indicating that a small portion of the blue light signal perceived by cry1 is processed by factors other than HFR1 to regulate downstream gene expression. Meanwhile, HFR1 can also process blue light signals perceived by photoreceptors other than cry1.</p><p>To examine the dynamic changes in gene expression in response to early blue light, selected genes were tested for their expression patterns in the dark, and after treatment by 30 min and 1 h of blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003563-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

Most of them were focused on much later seedling stages than a 1 h treatment. The Spalding group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003563-Folta1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> has looked at cry1-responsive gene profiles at a much higher blue light irradiance (100 <italic>&#x000b5;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></italic>) after a shorter time (45 min). They found that approximately 5&#x00025; of the genes presented on the 8K Genome Arrays were differentially expressed in <italic>cry1</italic> mutants under their conditions. These genes were those that encode products that are involved in different bioprocesses. We used a much lower blue light irradiance (50 <italic>&#x000b5;mol m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup></italic>) to avoid high irradiance-caused damage to plant cells. In addition, the <italic>Affymetrix</italic> ATH1 22K Arrays have greater capability to look at the entire genome, with many more genes that are missing on the 8K arrays. Considering the high sensitivity of the microarray approach, and various experimental conditions and arrays that were used, it is not surprising that all these microarray profiles, including ours, are not comparable to each other. In addition to the interest in cry1, we also looked at HFR1 which has a role in the blue light signaling pathway has not been elucidated at the genomic level before. The most interesting result from the 2-way ANOVA analysis was a list of genes changed due to the interaction of blue light and genotype. A significant interaction, quantified by p-value, means the effect of one variable (blue light) changes depending on the level of the other factor (cry1 and HFR1), which provides insight into the biological pathways induced by blue light and activated by cry1 and HFR1, rather than the simple cumulative effect of blue light and cry1/HFR1. It is notable that genes with low p-values for their genotype and light treatment may, or may not, be due to the interaction of both factors. Given the knowledge that cry1 is the predominant, but not the only blue light receptor, it is possible that some blue light responsive genes are able to have a low p-value for cry1 and blue light separately, but that these two factors are independent of each other. Other blue light receptors might be involved in light perception by also triggering gene expression changes. Therefore, these blue light regulated gene changes are not specifically cry1-mediated. In light of our interest in gene expression, specifically regulated by blue light through both cry1 and HFR1, introducing the concept of the interaction between genotype and blue light treatment can rule out non-specificity and provide a way to look at gene profiling without the interference from other blue light photoreceptors.</p><p>Our data suggest that HFR1 may be responsible for the majority of transcriptional regulation in cry1 signaling.

To-date, three cryptochromes (cry1, cry2 and cry-DASH) have been found in plants.

Phytochrome A and phototropins have been recognized as blue light receptors as well. In addition, several downstream regulators were also found to positively or negatively regulate blue light signaling, such as HFR1, HY5, HRB1, PP7, RPT2, NPH3, OBP3, SHB1 <italic>etc</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003563-Kang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003563-Duek1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003563-Inada1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003563-Ward1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The blue light signaling pathway may involve all or some of these regulators in the entire system to control global gene expression. In our case, cry1 and HFR1 significantly induced a large number of common gene targets, while they showed little regulatory function at the transcriptional level in the dark. Similarly, blue light signaling was similarly repressed when either cry1 or HFR1 was missing. This suggests that HFR1 may play a key role in regulating gene expression in cry1 signaling in response to blue light.

It is likely that the similar level of HFR1, but not cry1, between <italic>cry1</italic> and <italic>hfr1</italic> is responsible for global gene expression profiles. There is a correlation between the expression changes in selective genes from the dark, 30 min to 1 h blue light treatment and the dynamic HFR1 protein level with the strongest HFR1 protein accumulation detected at 1 h of blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003563-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). As previously suggested by a high-resolution kinetic study of blue light-mediated hypocotyl growth inhibition, the hypocotyl elongation rate is indistinguishable in darkness and during the first 30 min in blue light between WT and <italic>cry1</italic> mutants, while it becomes significantly distinguishable after 30 min. It has been suggested that cry1 takes over control of photomorphogenesis from phototropins only after 30 min of blue light irradiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003563-Folta3">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data suggest that the cry1-mediated blue light induced transcriptional machinery is likely evoked no earlier than 30 min after blue light exposure, and HFR1 seems to be the key to this machinery. The presence of cry1 negatively correlates with <italic>HFR1</italic> RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003563-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Combining both protein and RNA level of HFR1 that we detected, it is possible that the accumulation of HFR1 protein itself provides a negative feedback signal to its transcription, and this feedback signal is attenuated in <italic>cry1</italic> mutants due to a significantly reduced amount of HFR1 protein.</p><p>Dissection of transcriptional networks is one of the greatest challenges of functional genomics. Usually, genes that are co-expressed over multiple biological conditions may share common regulatory elements in their promoters. Our data show that genes that were induced by blue light and dependent on both cry1 and HFR1 encode products with very diverse biological functions. The repression of their expression in <italic>cry1</italic> and <italic>hfr1</italic> mutants may cause pleoitropic phenotypes in the mutants. In a previous study, a G-box (CACGTG) element was found enriched in high irradiance-responsive genes that were regulated by cry1 and HY5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003563-Kleine2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Phytochrome-interacting factors bind to G-boxes in red/far red light pathways as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003563-ToledoOrtiz1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Instead of G-boxes, we found that W-boxes and OCS elements were significantly overrepresented in the upstream 500 bp region in the blue light-induced genes that were dependent on both cry1 and HFR1. The W-box is a WRKY binding motif, which is the specific binding site of a transcription factor family related to senescence and defense systems in plants. W-boxes were found in most of the induced genes, such as the cytochrome P450 genes <italic>CYP82C2</italic>, <italic>CYP81F2</italic> and <italic>CYP71A12</italic>. The W-box-containing promoter in <italic>CYP82C2</italic> gene is fully functional only when both cry1 and HFR1 are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003563-g004">Figure 4B and C</xref>). The OCS element is a consensus sequence found in plant promoters that have been strongly linked to plant defense and stress response genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003563-Foley1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003563-Bouchez1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, such as GST and heat shock protein genes. It seems that a series of stress responsive/defense-related mechanisms are turned on as photomorphogenesis starts. Such a significant overrepresentation of these two motifs is likely due to a direct binding of specific transcription factors that are activated by the signal from cry1 through HFR1. It is also possible that HFR1 induces the expression of the transcription factors that bind to these motifs to elevate the expression of the gene targets. It will be helpful to further dissect the role that HFR1 plays in gene regulation when such a promoter analysis is done in other light conditions.</p><p>In conclusion, our study on cry1 and HFR1 specific global gene expression profiles provides an intriguing way to analyze the transcriptional machinery evoked by blue light as well as a genome-wide profile regulated by HFR1. For the first time, <italic>cry1</italic> and <italic>hfr1</italic> have shown striking similarities in the &#x0201c;microarray phenotype&#x0201d; during blue light treatment. This phenotype is correlated with HFR1 protein abundance indicating that HFR1 plays a key role in sorting out the cry1-mediated blue light signal and sending it to the entire genome. On the other hand, the presence of cry1 is required for HFR1 protein accumulation in blue light. Without HFR1, even when cry1 is present, as in the case in <italic>hfr1</italic> mutants, the signal sent by cry1 cannot be properly delivered. We also propose that the cry1-mediated blue light signal is possibly delivered to W-box and OCS element-containing genes, although it is still unclear whether they are direct targets of HFR1, or whether other W-box and OCS element binding factors are targeted by HFR1. It will also help to reveal the larger picture of the cry1 signaling pathway by examining the protein dynamics of other factors in the blue light pathway in <italic>cry1</italic> mutants, in addition to cry1 itself.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant Growth Conditions and Mutant Screening</title><p>All <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants used here are from the Columbia (<italic>Col</italic>) background.
