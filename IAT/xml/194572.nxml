Typically, RNAi is triggered by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that are cleaved into small 21&#x02013;23 bp small interfering RNAs by a dsRNA-specific enzyme, and thereafter, cellular machinery that causes degradation of dsRNA-complementary endogenous mRNA is set in motion. The physiological role of RNAi, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS), remains speculative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], but the applicability of experimentally induced RNAi for functional genomics, i.e. loss-of-function studies, is becoming more apparent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we developed a method of dsRNA-injectable RNAi as a tool for loss-of-function studies in adult <italic>Drosophila </italic>(fruit fly) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] that combines loss-of-function phenotypes with neuropharmacological techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Injectable RNAi has been successfully applied to adult honeybees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], snails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and also to mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This method can be used both during various developmental stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, e.g., embryonic RNAi, as well as selectively in adult flies. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, RNAi appears to be cell- and isoform-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Whereas the GAL4-driven hairpin-induced RNAi can be cell autonomous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], injecting adult <italic>Drosophila </italic>intra-abdominally with either long or short dsRNAs resulted in cell-nonautonomous silencing of the complementary endogenous mRNA and produced an altered phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Thus, these two methods of RNAi induction in <italic>Drosophila </italic>could be used as complementary experimental approaches; the injectable cell-nonautonomous RNAi appears preferable for studies of genes in which cell- or tissue-specificity of expression is unknown.</p><p>Previously, we demonstrated that injection into adult flies of dsRNA corresponding to a putative gene CG5652 (GM06434) destroys its cognate mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A homologue of this putative <italic>Drosophila </italic>gene has been characterized in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Thus, Choy and Thomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] carried out a genetic screen for mutants that were resistant to a certain behavior, i.e., nose twitches, induced by antidepressant drugs such as fluoxetine (Prozac) (hence, "nose resistant to fluoxetine", NRF). However, in our work we did not observe any major behavioral effects of the fluoxetine in fruit flies, which precluded us from attempting to find the <italic>Drosophila </italic>correlate of fluoxetine-triggered nose twitches observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This could be attributed in part to the failure of fluoxetine, whose mechanism of action involves binding to and inhibition of the serotonin transporter, to bind and inhibit the <italic>Drosophila </italic>serotonin transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, these findings suggested to us that the CG5652 gene in <italic>Drosophila </italic>may have a different role from its putative homologue in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and that this gene does not mediate behavioral actions of fluoxetine in fruit flies. Nevertheless, in pilot experiments with CG5652 gene silencing using injectable RNAi in adult flies, we observed an effect of RNAi on the spontaneous egg laying behavior of adult females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In our present work, we used both embryonic and adult RNAi to further characterize this putative <italic>Drosophila </italic>gene. Our results indicate a developmental role for a novel gene that we named <italic>beltless </italic>based on the embryonic loss-of-function phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>Blt </italic>mRNA is expressed at multiple developmental stages and in adult female and male <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>To examine the expression of <italic>blt </italic>mRNA during <italic>Drosophila </italic>development, we conducted RT-PCR assays with total RNA isolated from 0&#x02013;6 h embryos (early embryos), late embryos (stages 15&#x02013;17), first to third instar larvae, pupae, and in the total RNA isolated from male and female heads and bodies.

On the other hand, the N-terminal of this protein is modified by an acyltransferase named skinny hedgehog (Ski). Ski, which is a member of a group of segment polarity genes, is required for Hh activation by palmitoylation of the N-terminal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Alternatively, the N-terminal of the Hh signaling protein can be modified by the Rasp protein, another member of the segment polarity genes that is catalytically active as an acyltransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, the primary sequence and hydrophobicity profile of the Blt protein suggest that this is a membrane-associated protein with 7 transmembrane domains, whereas its homology with several uncharacterized <italic>C. elegans </italic>and <italic>Drosophila </italic>genes with acyltransferase domains suggests that Blt could possess acyltransferase activity. These characteristics point to putative similarities between <italic>blt </italic>and other segment polarity genes. This possibility is further supported by our findings of the <italic>blt </italic>loss-of-function embryonic phenotype, and we postulate that the putative acyltransferase activity of <italic>blt </italic>may be needed for Hh activation in anterior abdominal segments A2&#x02013;A4. Namely, after <italic>blt </italic>RNAi, we did not observe embryos with missing A1 or A5&#x02013;A8 denticle belts.</p><p>Based on our characterization of the localization of embryonic <italic>blt </italic>mRNA, i.e. in the neuroectoderm, CNS, and the invaginating pole cells, an additional developmental role for <italic>blt </italic>should be considered. Developmental <italic>blt </italic>expression also includes the ring gland, which degenerates during metamorphosis and produces hormones that participate in molting and metamorphosis. The embryonic lethality of <italic>blt </italic>RNAi and <italic>blt </italic>deletion also point to a putative crucial developmental function of this gene.</p><p>The selective use of <italic>blt </italic>RNAi in adult flies enabled us to investigate <italic>blt </italic>loss-of-function phenotype in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Thus, in addition to the embryonic <italic>beltless </italic>phenotype, we observed that <italic>blt </italic>silencing produces a major disruption in egg development and maturation in adult females. Whether the putative acyltransferase activity of <italic>blt </italic>participates in the adult loss-of-function phenotype should be investigated.</p><p>Localization of <italic>blt </italic>mRNA in the nervous system of developing and adult <italic>Drosophila </italic>indicates a possible role for Blt in neuronal development and functioning. As indicated above, the primary sequence and hydrophobicity profile of the Blt protein suggests 7 transmembrane domains and regions with low complexity composition. There was no evidence for an N-terminal signal sequence; this would classify Blt as a type III membrane protein typically found in endoplasmic reticulum Golgi bodies. Furthermore, the predicted amino acid composition of Blt suggests similarities to the peroxisome microbody. Peroxisomes belong to the microbody family of organelles and peroxisomal proteins are crucial for neuronal development; defects of peroxisomal assembly factors lead to severe neurological diseases known as peroxisome biogenesis disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The peroxisomal signal motif N/T/K/KL (PTS1; the peroxisome-targeting signal 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] was found at the C-terminal end of Blt protein.</p><p>Found in neural cell peroxisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], acyltransferase activity is important during insect development, particularly in the larval synthesis of triacylglycerols and phosphoglycerides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Acyltransferase activity also appears to be important for <italic>Drosophila </italic>synaptic vesicle budding at the neuromuscular junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and in general, is involved in synaptic vesicle biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Interestingly, we found prominent <italic>blt </italic>mRNA presence in the neurite-like structures at the neuromuscular junctions of the larvae. It has recently been proposed that the dendritic localization of mRNAs underlies certain aspects of synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Finally, acyltransferase activity was found in insect ovaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] where we also observed significant <italic>blt </italic>expression. Based on our RNAi experiments in adult flies, the presence of Blt in the ovaries appears to be functionally important and the loss-of-function phenotype in adult flies included both morphological and functional (e.g., oviposition) alterations and deficits. It is possible that these phenotypes are a reflection of an essential function of Blt in the corpus allatum, which releases the juvenile hormone that regulates egg maturation, as well as of Blt in the surrounding epithelial sheath in the ovariole.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we identified a novel <italic>Drosophila </italic>gene that we named <italic>beltless</italic>. Our results demonstrated that <italic>blt </italic>is crucial during oogenesis and embryogenesis. The expression of <italic>blt </italic>in the adult nervous system suggests that besides its developmental role <italic>blt </italic>might be important for neuronal functioning. Further studies are needed to fully characterize this novel gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Fly stocks and injections</title><p>Wild type <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>(CS/S) flies and Df(1)RK4 mutant flies (Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center, Donors: Robert Kreber and Rachel Drysdale) carrying a deficiency of the X chromosome region 13A9-B1 were cultured at 25&#x000b0;C, 50&#x02013;60% humidity, 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle, on yeast, dark corn syrup, and agar food.

Using custom-beveled glass pipettes (20 &#x000d7; 40 &#x003bc;m tip diameter) coupled to a cell injector (Narashige IM-200) and a micromanipulator under a stereo microscope (Leica GZ6), we injected a volume of 0.2 &#x003bc;l/fly by a pulse pressure of 300 kPa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

Eight 39-mer DNA oligonucleotides with an attached T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technology, Inc.); these oligonucleotides represented both sense and antisense strands. The sequences of the sense and antisense DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the <italic>blt </italic>gene used for the in vitro transcription reaction are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; only one match was found in the genome database pattern search analyses for each chosen targeted sequence.</p><p>One set of oligonucleotides produced dsRNA probes with a 3'overhanging 2 UUnt, and a second set was used for the production of blunt-end dsRNAs with GG..CC flanking nucleotides. Equal amounts of oligonucleotides were annealed to form a double-stranded template by heating at 80&#x02013;85&#x000b0;C for 5 min and cooling down on ice. The in vitro transcription reaction (30 &#x003bc;l volume) for the synthesis of the 22 nt RNA run of transcripts contained 0.1 &#x003bc;g of a template, 500 &#x003bc;M each CTP, GTP, ATP, and UTP, 1 &#x000d7; transcription buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1% bovine serum albumin), 20 U of RNAse inhibitor, and 50 U T7 RNA polymerase (Gibco BRL). The reactions were carried out at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h. The RNA molecules were annealed together in heat denaturing conditions (65&#x000b0;-70&#x000b0;C for 5 min) and placed on ice. The quality of both RNA and DNA oligonucleotides was analyzed on 6% NuSive agarose gel (Sigma). As a negative control, we used dsRNA that targeted the human 5-lipoxygenase gene because <italic>Drosophila </italic>does not have any lipoxygenase homologues.

The most effective and longest lasting (5 days) silencing effect was detected with the lowest concentration of dsRNA (i.e., 10 ng/&#x003bc;l) for both probes, and we used this concentration in all subsequent experiments, except one experiment that was conducted with 100 ng/&#x003bc;l (where indicated).</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)</title><p>To determine the presence of endogenous <italic>blt </italic>mRNAs and the effect of RNAi, we used an RT-PCR assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The total RNA was extracted from samples collected at different stages of <italic>Drosophila </italic>development. For adult flies, the total RNA was extracted separately from the heads and bodies of male and female flies; two flies were used for each experiment. Two embryos displaying cuticular defects and two normal embryos from Df(1)RK4 flies were used for RT-PCR. RNAs were DNAase treated prior to RT reaction. The rp49 gene was used as an internal control.

Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to resolve and visualize the PCR reaction products.</p></sec><sec><title>Northern blot assay</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from the heads and bodies of male and female flies with a Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL). Ten micrograms of total RNA per sample were analyzed according to a standard protocol for the Northern blot analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A digoxigenin-labeled 524 bp PCR fragment of <italic>blt </italic>was used as the hybridization probe.

The heads were sliced on dry ice with a sterile surgical blade (#11) and transferred into the tubes with a fixation buffer (15 % formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline; PBS; pH 7.4) for 20 min. Ovarian, corpus allatum, and ring gland hybridization was done on cryostat sections of female flies and 3rd instar larvae. For the 3rd instar larval muscle preparation, larvae were dissected from the ventral side with a surgical blade (#11), the cuticle was stretched and pinned down, and the preparations were fixed. The ovaries also were collected from anesthetized flies for confocal microscopy (Leica TCS-NT 1.6.587) without the in situ hybridization. They were manually dissected in PBS and fixed in a 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS buffer for 20 min, rinsed in PBS, and mounted in a NaCl/glycerol solution.</p><p>The in situ hybridization procedure was applied as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Briefly, the samples were incubated with proteinase K (10 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 5 min at room temperature, rinsed with a glycine (2 mg/ml) in PBS, and prehybridized (6x SSC, i.e., 3 M NaCl, 0.3 M sodium citrate, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml yeast tRNA, 50 % formamide, 0.01 % Tween-20) at 55&#x000b0;C for 1 h.

They were washed three times in PBS, 1 h each at 55&#x000b0;C, and incubated with anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1:1000 in PBS at room temperature for 1 h). Thereafter, sections were washed 4 times 30 min each in PBS at room temperature, and rinsed twice in a blue color development buffer for alkaline phosphatase (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% Tween-20). The color was developed with NBT/BCIP (nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate; Roche) and the reaction was stopped with 2 mg/ml glycine in PBS, pH 2.2. Samples were mounted in a mounting solution (80% glycerol, 0.25 mM NaCl) and images were taken under the microscope.</p><p>Since we were not able to detect mRNA staining in embryos with conventional in situ hybridization (probably because the signal is below detection level), we used an in situ RT-PCR assay with digoxigenin-labeled dUTP to localize <italic>bl</italic>t mRNA in the embryos. Briefly, the 0&#x02013;20 h embryos were collected on agar plates and fixed and processed as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].

Thereafter, they were washed several times in PBT (PBS/Tween-20), incubated with anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1:1000 in PBS) for 30 min, and washed in PBS for 2 h. Specific primers used in this PCR reaction were as follows: direct-5'-tagtcggctgatgaggattgttcc-3', reverse-5'-acacgtagttgatgtcacccatgg-3'.
