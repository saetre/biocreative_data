PTP1B mRNA and protein expression were compared in confluent and subconfluent cells by RT-PCR and western blots. Immunocytochemistry was used to determine the subcellular localization of both PTP1B and EGFR following epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Western blots were used to analyze the time-dependent effect of EGF on phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr992 plus or minus CinnGEL 2Me, an inhibitor of PTP1B activity.

Positive staining for PTP1B was localized in vesicular structures below the plasma membrane. EGFR staining was located at cell-cell borders in untreated endothelium, but was mainly cytoplasmic by 15 min after EGF treatment. In control cultures, phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr992 peaked by 5 min following EGF stimulation and rapidly decreased to basal levels by 30 min. In cultures pretreated with CinnGEL 2Me, Tyr992 phosphorylation peaked 2 min following EGF addition and was consistently sustained at a higher level than controls until 60 min after treatment. By 18 h following EGF treatment, cultures pretreated with CinnGEL 2Me exhibited a 1.7 fold increase in the number of Ki67-positive cells compared with control cultures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Comparison of PTP1B mRNA and protein levels indicates that PTP1B expression is regulated mainly at the protein level and is higher in subconfluent cells.

The ability of PTP1B inhibitor to sustain EGFR Tyr992 phosphorylation and increase the number of Ki67-positive cells indicates that PTP1B plays a role in the negative regulation of EGF-induced signaling and helps suppress cell cycle entry.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Corneal endothelial cells do not normally proliferate in vivo to increase cell numbers. However, they retain proliferative capacity and can divide both in culture and in ex vivo corneas if cell-cell contacts are disrupted and cells are exposed to positive growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to induce proliferation in corneal endothelial cells from several species, including rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>], cows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>], cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Although EGF is known to stimulate proliferation in these cells, there is very little information regarding how the EGF-induced signal is regulated.</p><p>The EGF receptor (EGFR) is an 1,186 amino acid transmembrane protein and is a member of a group of receptors possessing intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation helps regulate important cellular processes, including proliferation, migration, and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. In response to ligand binding, specific tyrosine residues within the COOH-terminal intracellular domain of EGFR become autophosphorylated. These residues include Tyr992 and Tyr1148 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Tyrosine autophosphorylation within growth factor receptors promotes direct binding of signaling proteins that contain src homology-2 (SH2) domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Ligand binding to EGFR can lead to activation of a number of signaling pathways, including phospholipase C-&#x003b3; (PLC-&#x003b3;) and its downstream calcium- and protein kinase C (PKC) cascades, and ras which leads to activation of various MAP kinases. Upon ligand binding and activation, EGFR is rapidly internalized into endosomes, with its extracellular domain within the endosome and its intracellular domain extending toward the cytoplasm. EGFR remains active in the endosome for several min before either being sorted to lysosomes (where it is degraded) or recycled back to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. The fate of the receptor and the output of the signaling process depend on continued ligand binding and kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>].</p><p>The catalytic activity of many receptor tyrosine kinases is tightly regulated by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which act as "on" and "off" switches for numerous signaling events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. PTP1B is a widely expressed 50 kDa non-receptor PTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] that helps regulate multiple cellular functions, including proliferation. Among its functions, PTP1B binds to the EGFR both in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>] and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>] and specifically interacts with and dephosphorylates both Tyr992 and Tyr1148 within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Studies indicate that there is competition for PTP1B binding at these sites. For example, the SH2 domain-containing protein, PLC-&#x003b3;, also interacts with Tyr992, while the GTPase-activating protein of ras (GAP) interacts with Tyr1148. This competitive binding indicates that PTP1B must play a role in regulating EGFR downstream signaling via PLC-&#x003b3; and/or GAP. PTP1B contains a 35 amino acid COOH-terminal hydrophobic sequence that anchors it to the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. PTP1B-catalyzed dephosphorylation of EGFR and attenuation of the phosphotyrosine-induced downstream signal requires receptor endocytosis and occurs in a specific "dephosphorylation compartment" prior to the movement of the receptor to lysosomes or to recycling back to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>].</p><p>A number of studies have been conducted to determine whether manipulating the expression or activity of PTP1B can have an effect on growth factor-induced downstream cellular processes. For example, PTP1B attenuated PDGF-BB-induced proliferation in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells via dephosphorylation of the PDGF-beta receptor, whereas expression of a dominant-negative form of PTP1B promoted proliferation of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. In immortalized fibroblasts from PTP1B<sup>-/-</sup> mice, cells lacking PTP1B exhibited increased and sustained phosphorylation of both EGFR and the PDGF receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. PTP1B also negatively regulates phosphotyrosine-induced signaling via the insulin and leptin receptors, implicating PTP1B activity in Type 2 diabetes and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. Because of the potential role of PTP1B in these diseases, as well as in cancer, much attention has been paid to the development of specific inhibitors of PTP1B as potential therapeutic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>].</p><p>Studies from this laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>] have demonstrated the expression of several PTPs in rat corneal endothelial cells both in ex vivo corneas and in culture. Among the PTPs expressed were PTP1B, SHP-1, SHP-2, PTP-mu, and the dual-specificity phosphatase, PTEN. When cultures of rat corneal endothelial cells were treated with the general phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate (SOV), cell cycle entry was increased, as indicated by an increase in the number of cells with positive staining for Ki67, a marker of actively cycling cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. The increase in Ki67-positive cells upon exposure to SOV strongly suggests that phosphatase activity helps suppress cell cycle entry in corneal endothelium. The current studies were conducted to determine whether PTP1B plays a role in regulating Tyr992 phosphorylation of EGFR and cell cycle entry in rat corneal endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Rat corneal tissue</title><p>Corneas were obtained from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic, Hudson, NY), which were treated in accordance with the ARVO Statement on the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Whole corneas were used for some experiments. For other experiments, endothelial cell explant cultures were prepared according to Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. Primary cultures were grown to confluence in Medium 199 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 50 &#x003bc;g/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT). All incubations were performed at 37 &#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, humidified atmosphere.

Primers specific for PTP1B were available from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Primer sequences were based on mouse PTP1B sequences. PCR was performed according to protocols provided by Santa Cruz and included two PCR reactions. Briefly, the first PCR reaction was performed in a mixture containing 100 ng cDNA and 1 &#x003bc;l of Primer Pair A, plus reagents from a commercially available kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Specificity and yield of the PCR products were enhanced using the hot-start approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. PCR was performed for 36 cycles. Cycle conditions included denaturation at 94 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, annealing at 55 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, and extension at 72 &#x000b0;C for 3 min. A 10 min extension was added at the end of the 36 cycles of PCR. A second PCR reaction was performed in a mixture containing 1 &#x003bc;l of product from the first reaction and 1 &#x003bc;l of Primer Pair B, plus reagents from the aforementioned commercially available kit. After the hot start, PCR was performed for 26 cycles, and the conditions were the same as above except that the extension time at 72 &#x000b0;C was for only 1.5 min. Negative controls consisted of samples containing all reagents plus primers, but without cDNA. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH; Clontech, Mountain View, CA) acted as a positive control for the PCR. To ensure that the total RNA samples were not contaminated with genomic DNA, a negative control using 100 ng total RNA was substituted for cDNA in the PCR reaction mixture, along with 2.5 &#x003bc;M each of upstream and downstream G3PDH primers. PCR products and 100 bp DNA ladder molecular weight markers were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels containing 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml ethidium bromide and photographed. All experiments were conducted in duplicate and repeated three times to ensure consistent results.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein extraction and western blot analysis of PTP1B</title><p>Passage 2 subconfluent and confluent cultures of rat corneal endothelial cells were used for western blot analysis of PTP1B protein levels. Protein was extracted by incubating cells for 30 min at 4 &#x000b0;C in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 &#x003bc;g/ml aprotinin, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mM sodium fluoride, and 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate (all from Sigma, St. Louis, MO), followed by sonication and centrifugation. Supernatants were stored at -80 &#x000b0;C until used for SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Equal concentrations of soluble protein were loaded on 10% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) for SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the membrane overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C in 5% non-fat dry milk diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen).

The current studies confirmed and extended this finding by comparing relative mRNA and protein expression for PTP1B in confluent versus subconfluent rat corneal endothelial cells. Cells were maintained in the presence of 10% FBS prior to processing for RT-PCR and western blots. RT-PCR revealed positive bands for PTP1B and G3PDH for both confluent and subconfluent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Controls containing all reagents plus PTP1B primers, but without cDNA, were negative. Samples containing total RNA rather than cDNA yielded no positive bands, indicating lack of contamination of the RNA samples with genomic DNA. Band density for PTP1B was very similar in both confluent and subconfluent cells. In this study, PCR was performed using two sets of primer pairs based on methods recommended by the supplier. To confirm these results, PCR of the second set of primers was run for 10, 20, and 26 cycles for both samples. Similar results were obtained under all cycle conditions (data not shown) and indicate that PTP1B mRNA is expressed at similar levels in both confluent and subconfluent cells. Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) showed a strong positive band for PTP1B in the positive control, as well as positive bands for both corneal endothelial samples. In contrast to the RT-PCR data, densitometric analysis of the western blots indicates that PTP1B is expressed at 3 fold higher levels in subconfluent versus confluent cells.

CinnGEL 2Me is the methyl ester of a tripeptide-substituted cinnamic acid that exhibits significant inhibition of PTP1B activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. The supplier of CinnGEL 2Me states that the methyl ester permits cell permeability and is hydrolyzed to active inhibitor by intracellular esterases. For this study, subconfluent cultures of rat corneal endothelial cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then preincubated for 1 h in culture medium containing Medium 199, gentamicin, and DMSO either with or without 1 mM CinnGEL 2Me. DMSO was used as a control for these experiments, because the inhibitor was solubilized in this reagent. The concentration of CinnGEL 2Me was chosen following a preliminary dose-response study (data not shown). After this 1 h incubation, cultures were treated with 25 ng/ml EGF for 0, 2, 5, 15, 30, 60, or 120 min and samples were taken for western blot analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref> presents representative results of the western blots and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref> shows the results of the densitometric analysis. Overall, the kinetics of EGFR Tyr992 phosphorylation in cells maintained in control medium containing DMSO were very similar to those described above in which cells were maintained in medium without DMSO. This indicates that DMSO did not affect the ability of the cells to respond to EGF stimulation. In the DMSO-treated control cells, phosphorylated Tyr992 levels peaked 5 min after EGF addition, rapidly decreased to near-basal levels by 30 min, and then gradually returned to basal levels by 120 min. In CinnGEL 2Me-treated cells, Tyr992 phosphorylation peaked 2 min after EGF addition. Although the relative level of phosphorylation decreased over time, it was consistently sustained at a level higher than that observed in controls until the 60 min time-point. Thus, inhibition of PTP1B by CinnGEL 2Me resulted in a more rapid response to EGF stimulation and an increased duration of EGFR Tyr992 phosphorylation.</p><fig id="f5" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Effect of the PTP1B inhibitor, CinnGEL 2Me, on the time-course of EGFR Tyr992 phosphorylation.

In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>] we used rat corneal endothelium to identify a subset of PTPs expressed in these cells and to examine the effect of SOV-induced PTP inhibition on cell cycle entry. PTP1B was among the PTPs identified in that study. PTP1B is widely expressed, but its specific function(s) within individual cell types is still being investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. PTP1B is clearly involved in the regulation of signal transduction and has been found to play an important role in diabetes, obesity, the cell cycle, and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Since PTP1B is known to regulate EGFR signaling and corneal endothelial cells express these receptors, it is important to obtain a better understanding of the role of this PTP in EGF-induced cell cycle traverse. The current studies were conducted in rat corneal endothelial cells, because the initial studies were conducted in this species and it was important to obtain a base of information in rat that could eventually be applied to studies of PTP1B in human corneal endothelial cells. The goal of these studies was to determine whether PTP1B plays a role in regulating EGF-induced Tyr992 phosphorylation of EGFR and cell cycle entry in rat corneal endothelial cells.</p><p>The current studies confirmed and extended the finding that PTP1B is expressed in rat corneal endothelial cells. PTP1B protein levels were found to be substantially higher in subconfluent cells compared with confluent cells, while PTP1B mRNA levels were similar, strongly suggesting that PTP1B expression is regulated mainly at the protein level in these cells. This finding is interesting, because subconfluent cells were used in studies testing the effect of the PTP1B inhibitor. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is normally balanced by dephosphorylation, suggesting that the relative expression of PTPs may be dependent on overall tyrosine phosphorylation activity. In fact, several studies have demonstrated that expression of PTP1B is increased upon neoplastic transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>], as well as in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. Overall, our finding of increased PTP1B protein levels in subconfluent cells appears consistent with increased proliferative activity. The specific mechanism by which PTP1B protein levels are regulated in corneal endothelial cells remains to be determined. PTP1B has also been shown to regulate both cadherin- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>] and integrin-based adhesion in some cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>]. The relative difference in PTP1B protein levels in confluent versus subconfluent cells may also reflect these functions of PTP1B in corneal endothelial cells, but this remains to be established.</p><p>The PTP1B staining pattern in the endothelium suggests it is associated with submembranous vesicles; however, the current studies did not test whether PTP1B is specifically associated with the endoplasmic reticulum as has been reported in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. The fact that EGFR is internalized in response to EGF stimulation suggests that it could interact with and be regulated by PTP1B. Indeed, the similarity in the kinetics of EGFR internalization and the kinetics of Tyr992 phosphorylation supports this idea. The kinetics of EGFR Tyr992 phosphorylation in cells incubated in culture medium containing DMSO were very similar to those of cells incubated in medium without DMSO, indicating that DMSO did not significantly affect EGF-induced signaling, at least under these experimental conditions. The finding that inhibition of PTP1B activity by CinnGEL 2Me results in sustained EGFR Tyr992 phosphorylation compared with controls is similar to that of Haj, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>], who found that fibroblasts isolated from PTP1B<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited increased and sustained phosphorylation of EGFR, as well as of the receptor for PDGF. Together, results strongly suggest that PTP1B negatively regulates EGF-induced receptor signaling in rat corneal endothelial cells.</p><p>Previous studies found that treatment of rat corneal endothelial cells with the general phosphatase inhibitor, SOV, increased the number of Ki67-positive cells over controls, indicating that phosphatase inhibition promoted cell cycle entry. These results were similar to those reported by Suzuki, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>], who showed that SOV treatment promoted cell cycle entry in cultured vascular endothelial cells. The current study extends this finding by demonstrating that treatment of subconfluent rat corneal endothelial cells with CinnGEL 2Me increased the number of Ki67-positive cells, thereby implicating PTP1B in the negative regulation of EGF-induced cell cycle entry. The current studies did not explore the effect of CinnGEL 2Me on the extent of cell cycle traverse. Positive staining for Ki67 is first upregulated in mid-G<sub>1</sub>-phase of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>]. As such, the observed increase in the number of Ki67-positive cells in CinnGEL 2Me treated cultures suggests that more cells had at least begun to enter the cell cycle. In the previous study of rat corneal endothelial cells treated with SOV, it appeared that inhibition of phosphatases was not sufficient to move cells from mid-G<sub>1</sub> through S-phase of the cycle, since there was no increase found in the number of BrdU-stained cells. It is possible that inhibition of PTP1B is sufficient to promote changes leading to the initial stages of cell cycle entry, but that other signaling mechanisms compensate for the lack of PTP1B activity, resulting in the inability of cells to further traverse the cycle. This possibility was suggested by Haj et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>] who observed an increase in EGFR phosphorylation in PTP1B<sup>-/-</sup> mice, but detected little-to-no increase in the activity of downstream signals, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms to prevent uncontrolled growth factor receptor activation. Further study will be needed to more specifically identify the changes induced by PTP1B inhibition that promote cell cycle entry. In addition, careful studies are needed to identify the specific downstream signaling cascades affected by PTP1B activity. It is assumed that PLC-&#x003b3; and the GAP-MAP kinase cascades will be affected, since these proteins appear to compete for PTP1B binding for phosphotyrosines on EGFR in other cell types. It should also be mentioned that EGF is not the only growth factor known to stimulate proliferation in corneal endothelial cells. For example, significant information has been obtained in rabbit corneal endothelial cells regarding cell cycle regulation by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>]. It would be interesting to determine whether PTP1B might help regulate FGF-2 signaling in these cells, as has been found in cultured smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>].</p><p>In summary, results strongly suggest that PTP1B plays a role in the negative regulation of EGFR signaling in rat corneal endothelial cells, at least at the level of Tyr992 phosphorylation, and that inhibition of PTP1B activity increases both the duration of EGFR autophosphorylation and the relative number of cells entering the cell cycle. With this base of information, studies can now be conducted to explore the role of PTP1B in regulation of EGFR signaling in human corneal endothelium.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Ms. Rebecca Ickes for her excellent technical assistance in conducting the studies of EGFR internalization following EGF stimulation.
