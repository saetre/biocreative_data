Our data suggest that caveolins play an important role in the function of retinal cells. Our observations refute previous assumptions that there is a shortage of caveolins in the retina.

Multiple forms of caveolin have been identified: caveolin-1-&#x003b1;, caveolin-1-&#x003b2;, caveolin-2, and caveolin-3. They differ in their specific properties and tissue distribution. Caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 may originate from a common ancestor. They are most abundantly expressed in adipocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. The expression of caveolin-3 is thought to be muscle specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>], although it has been shown that they are present in astroglial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] and neurons of vegetative ganglions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Scherer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>] identified two caveolin isoforms in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Their findings indicated that caveolins are structurally and fuctionally conserved across species from worms to human. These data suggest that caveolins might have an important evolutionary role. The short cytoplasmic domain of the N-terminal region of caveolin isoforms forms multivalent homo- and hetero-oligomers of caveolins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. In contrast to caveolin-1, caveolin-2 was not found to form homo-oligomers. This latter isoform exists mainly as a monomer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>], or it forms stable hetero-oligomeric complexes with caveolin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Thus, caveolin-2 may function as an accessory protein in conjunction with caveolin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. It has been proposed that the caveolin family members function as scaffolding proteins to organize and concentrate specific lipids (cholesterol and glycosphingolipids), lipid-modified signaling molecules and G proteins within caveolae. Binding may suppress or inhibit enzyme activity through the caveolin scaffolding domain, which is a common caveolin domain.</p><p>There are only a few published reports about the presence and distribution of caveolin in the retina. Caveolin-1 was found to be present in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) of mouse retina in the synaptic ribbon in photoreceptor terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. In another study caveolin-1 was detected in various layers of the rat retina, from the inner plexiform layer (IPL) to the outer limiting membrane (OLM), suggesting that caveolin-1 is expressed in M&#x000fc;ller cells. Using specific markers, Scherer et al. confirmed M&#x000fc;ller cells do contain caveolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Caveolin-1 was also discovered to be present in pigment epithelial cells. Laser scanning confocal microscopical analysis of intact retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) localized caveolin-1 to the apical and basal surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Recently Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>] reported, caveolin-1 was present in the majority of retinal layers in the rat retina. Caveolin-2 immunostaining was much weaker, however it was intensely detected around the blood vessels. Caveolin-2 stained in the processes of glial cells and Muller cells, but immunoreactivity was very limited in retinal neuronal cells including the ganglion cells, amacrine cells, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and photoreceptor cells. Only central regions of the retina were involved in the study. No examinations were made about caveolin-3.</p><p>There are no data available about the distribution of caveolins in the human retina. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the localization of caveolin isoforms in the human retina. Since immunocytochemical analysis of the retina requires special preparation, including immediate and precise fixation, we used only enucleated human eyes for our experiments. We chose retinas affected by melanoma malignum choroideae, a common reason for enucleation. The quantity and the distribution of the caveolin isoforms were obviously different in the human retina compared to other species. The caveolins were present in many regions and layers in the human retina. They were present in both neuronal and glial cell types, which suggests, that caveolins must play a role in the functions of these cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Material</title><p>Three patients were involved in the study: two males (ages: 50, 57) and one female (age: 50). These patients were operated after the diagnosis of posterior uveal melanoma (melanoma malignum choroideae) in 2005 at the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Debrecen. The enucleation was made without prior treatment (brachytherapy was disqualified). Thus the retinas were not damaged due to any other treatment and stayed as intact as possible.</p><p>After the enucleation the eyes were included into histopathological study. The histological types according to Callendar's classification were: spindle A (male patient, age: 50), dominantly spindle B (female patient, age: 50), and dominantly epitheloid tumor (male patient, age: 57), respectively. All experiments involving human subjects were carried out according to the Helsinki Declaration and with the approval of the Human Studies Ethical Committee, University of Debrecen.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of the retina</title><p>Immediately after enucleation a dorsal stitch was made for orientation. A non-infiltrated part of the eye was removed for further investigation, the rest was sent to histopathology. The former section was subsequently placed in the fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), and incubated for 24 h at 4 &#x000b0;C. Thereafter the solution was replaced with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), and rinsed for at least 24 h before further processing. The retina was carefully detached from the posterior eyecup. Extreme care was taken to obtain samples from the peripheral part of the retina, and from behind the ora serrata. These ciliary and iridic regions can not be separated from the ciliary body and the iris, so they were handled together. For frozen sections the retinas were incubated overnight in 30% sucrose (diluted in 0.1 M phosphate buffer), embedded in cryomatrix (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thermo.com">ThermoShandon</ext-link> Pittsburgh, PA), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Next, 10 &#x003bc;m thick radial sections were prepared on a ThermoShandon cryotome. For radial semithin sectioning three samples were taken from the human retina following a radial plane including the macular region (M), periphery (P), ciliary body (CB).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>Sections of 10 &#x003bc;m thickness were cut on a cryostat and dried onto poly-L-lysine coated glass microscope slides at 37 &#x000b0;C. Sections were then soaked in PBS for 20 min. A blocking solution of, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) with 0.1% Triton X-100 was applied for 2 h. The primary antibody was applied at 4 &#x000b0;C overnight. Primary antibodies anti-caveolin-1 (polyclonal rabbit IgG, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bdbiosciences.com">Transduction</ext-link> Laboratories, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), 1:100, anti-caveolin-2 (monoclonal mouse IgG, Transduction Laboratories), 1:200, and anti-caveolin-3 (monoclonal mouse IgG, Transduction Laboratories) 1:100, were diluted in 1% BSA at 4 &#x000b0;C overnight. Caveolin-1 and -3 anti-rabbit and anti-mouse Alexa 488 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.invitrogen.com">Molecular</ext-link> Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used as secondary antibodies. Since caveolin-2 gave a weakly detectable signal with the previous method, we used biotinylated anti-mouse IgG, then Streptavidin Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes), 1:100, to intensify the signal. Even with this extra method, caveolin-2 still gave a weak signal. For visualization of the cytoskeleton, we used Alexa fluor 594-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes) to stain F-actin (1:100). Vectashield HardSet Mounting Medium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vectorlabs.com">Vector</ext-link> Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) was used to cover the slides. When DAPI binds to DNA, its fluorescence is strongly enhanced, with excitation wavelength 350 nm (nuclei appear blue). Control reactions were made using rabbit and mouse normal serum, non-specific primary antibodies, and by omitting the primary antibodies to preclude non-specific binding. The retinas were inspected on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope Thornwood, NY, using the appropriate filter set for the fluorescent antibodies. Micrographs were obtained using an Olympus DP50 camera. Fluorescent double- or triple-labeled specimens were also inspected on a Radiance 2100 Multi Photon Imaging System coupled to a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope using LaserSharp 2000. Both Adobe Photoshop 7.0 and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cyto.purdue.edu/flowcyt/software/cas402.htm">Confocal Assistant</ext-link> were used for primary image processing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Caveolin-1</title><p>The bound antibody was present in all layers of the retina.

Differences among the various sites were obvious, and only semiquantitative scoring was used. In contrast to monoclonal antibodies polyclonal sera may exhibit a reactivity against multiple epitopes. Accordingly, to avoid any uncertainty, caveolin isoform immunocytochemistry was performed with utmost care using a wide range of controls. For the same reason, the distribution of caveolin-1 detected by a polyclonal antibody was studied separately from that of the other two isoforms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Caveolin-1</title><p>Caveolin-1 expression has only been studied in rodent retinas. It was found to be present in the outer plexiform layer in mouse retina at the synaptic ribbon in photoreceptor terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], and also detected in M&#x000fc;ller cells and pigment epithelial cells of the rat retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Song et al. reported, caveolin-1 was present in the majority of retinal layers in the rat retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Caveolin-1 is known to be expressed abundantly in adipocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells. The observations of Song et al. and others confirm, that caveolin-1 is also expressed in some neuronal and glial cell types. No data are available about the distribution of caveolin-1 in the human retina yet, but studies on mammalian retinas suggest, that the densities of different caveolin types seem to be much lower compared to our sections. Caveolin-1 was only observed in a few cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>] and layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>], including the ganglion cell layer, IPL, OPL, and in the vascular endothelial cells of the rat retina. Our observations show, caveolin-1 is evenly distributed among the different layers of the human retina, including the epithelium of the ciliary body. Although each cell type was not identified with specific markers, it was still obvious, that caveolin-1 is expressed in many cell types, including pigment cells, outer segments of photoreceptors, ganglion cells, and probably also in all the other cell types as well. Interestingly, the density of caveolin-1 exhibited a characteristic center-to-peripheral variation; after an increase toward the mid-periphery it reached a maximum level and then started to decrease toward the ora serrata.</p></sec><sec><title>Caveolin-2</title><p>In previous studies, caveolin-2 was described to be present only around blood vessels of the rat retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. This correlates with the fact, that caveolin-2 is expressed in adipocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells. Our observations confirmed the following: caveolin-2 is clearly localized around the human blood vessels. Caveolin-2 is also expressed in many layers in the human retina from the ONL to the ILM, indicating its presence in neuronal cell types. It is worth mentioning, that the most peripheral part of the human retina also expressed caveolin-2. The latter part, the epithelium of the ciliary body, was not examined previously in rodents.</p></sec><sec><title>Caveolin-3</title><p>Until the present study, no studies examined the presence of caveolin-3 in the human retina. Caveolin-3 remains to be studied in rodent retinas. Traditionally, caveolin-3 has been thought to be muscle specific, however it has been detected in astroglial cells and vegetative ganglions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. It is also known that the expression of caveolin-3 is intense in the central nervous system in early embryonic stages in the chicken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>].</p><p>The distribution of caveolin-3 in the human retina was similar to caveolin-2: IRs were present from the ONL to the ILM. At the most peripheral regions, IR density was prominent. During retinal development, central portions of the retina develop first, and peripheral areas develop later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. Supporting previous observations about chicken development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>], caveolin-3 gives the highest density in this special, two layered peripheral part, which represents an early developmental stage of the retina.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The quantity and distribution of the caveolin isoforms in the human retina are different from that found in other animals. Caveolins are present in more regions and in more layers in the human retina than in other species. Although caveolin is a conservative protein, the amount and distribution of caveolin in different tissues may exhibit considerable changes across species. Further data are needed to map the species-specific distribution of the detectable isoforms.</p><p>Further investigations are needed to explain the role played by caveolins in the intact human retina and in that of other species. Our observations demonstrate that in contrast to previous beliefs, there is no shortage of caveolins in the retina. It is hoped this study will facilitate additional research into the tissue specificity of caveolins. Since the retina contains a number of different neuronal and glial cell types, the caveolin expression of these cells can no longer be a matter of dispute.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Attila Magyar and Botond &#x000cd;gy&#x000e1;rt&#x000f3; for providing non-specific antibodies used as controls in our experiments.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bridges</surname><given-names>CC</given-names></name><name><surname>El-Sherbeny</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Roon</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Ola</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kekuda</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Ganapathy</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Camero</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name><name><surname>Cameron</surname><given-names>PL</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A comparison of caveolae and caveolin-1 to folate receptor alpha in retina and retinal pigment epithelium.</article-title><source>Histochem J</source><year>2001</year><volume>33</volume><fpage>149</fpage><lpage>58</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11508338</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="r2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Carter-Dawson</surname><given-names>LD</given-names></name><name><surname>LaVail</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Rods and cones in the mouse retina.
