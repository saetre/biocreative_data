One of the main transcription factors that regulate these processes is AP-2&#x003b1;, a cell-type specific protein required for vertebrate development and embryogenesis. AP-2&#x003b1; also regulates apoptosis and cell-cycle specific events by interacting with the oncogene c-Myc.

Spatially and temporally restricted expression patterns of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c8">8</xref>) provide essential clues for embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c10">10</xref>), regulation of programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c11">11</xref>), and cell growth and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c12">12</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the relevance of protein&#x02013;protein interaction on AP-2&#x003b1; activity has been reported. AP-2&#x003b1; modulates the function of Myc as a proliferative agent and also as apoptosis inductor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c13">13</xref>). Other known AP-2&#x003b1;-interacting proteins are the retinoblastoma Rb protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c15">15</xref>), the Yin Yang 1 factor (YY1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c16">16</xref>), and the transcription factors YB-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c17">17</xref>) and Sp-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c18">18</xref>).</p><p>We have recently described the presence of allelic polymorphisms in the transcriptional regulatory region of the <italic>APOE</italic> gene, which produce variations in promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c19">19</xref>). Two of these variants are associated with an increase in risk for developing late-onset Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c21">21</xref>). We also found that the activity of the proximal <italic>APOE</italic> promoter is upregulated by cAMP and retinoic acid, in astrocytic but not hepatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c22">22</xref>). The cAMP effect is mediated, in part, by interaction of factor AP-2&#x003b1; with two sites located in the <italic>APOE</italic> proximal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c22">22</xref>). The stimulatory effect of cAMP on <italic>APOE</italic> promoter in HepG2 cells involves AP-2&#x003b1; phosphorylation at Ser239 by protein kinase A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c23">23</xref>). In this work, we investigate the existence of potential AP-2&#x003b1;-interacting factors which may modulate AP-2&#x003b1; activity. We have identified the oncoprotein DEK as an AP-2&#x003b1;-binding factor; DEK was found to enhance the effect of AP-2&#x003b1; on <italic>APOE</italic> promoter, probably enhancing the DNA binding of AP-2&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Recombinant protein expression</title><p>For the construction of the pcDNA3hisAP-2 vector, which expresses an N-terminal truncation of human AP-2&#x003b1; (deletion of the first 122 amino acids) with a poly-histidine extension at its N-terminal end (hisAP-2), a fragment was amplified by PCR using pTrcHisBAP-2 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c23">23</xref>) as template, followed by cloning of the fragment into the pcDNA3 vector using the <italic>Xho</italic>I and <italic>Hin</italic>dIII cloning sites.</p><p>For purification of HisAP-2 from U-87 derived cell lines, identical amounts of nuclear protein from 25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c24">24</xref>) were diluted 50-fold with buffer D (0.2 M KCl, 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.6, 10&#x00025; glycerol, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and protease inhibitors) and loaded onto a 200 &#x000b5;l Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> column (Invitrogen Corporation) previously equilibrated in the same buffer.

A 50 kDa protein band was clearly enriched in the eluted fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg247f1">1</xref>). This band was excised from a silver stained SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel, subjected to in-gel tryptic cleavage and analysed by nanospray-ion trap MS&#x0002f;MS mass spectrometry. From the total mixture of tryptic peptides, three of them (EPFTIAQGK, LLTNRPGTVSSLK and NVGQFSGFPFEK) were identified by a database search. All sequenced peptides showed a 100&#x00025; identity to the human DEK protein, a 43 kDa protein initially discovered as a fusion partner of the CAN nucleoporin in a specific subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c26">26</xref>). The identity between the sequenced peptides and the sequence of human DEK indicates that the purified protein is the DEK rat homologue, which has still not been cloned. We then investigated whether a physiologically relevant interaction between AP-2&#x003b1; and DEK occurs in human cells.</p></sec><sec><title>The oncoprotein DEK interacts with AP-2&#x003b1; in human cells</title><p>An N-terminal histidine-tagged AP-2&#x003b1; protein (hisAP-2) was stably expressed in the astrocytoma cell line U-87. Two highly expressing hisAP-2 U-87 clones, D7 and D10, were selected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg247f2">2</xref>A, lanes 2 and 3). From these two cell clones, we were only able to purify hisAP-2 from protein extracts from the D10 clone by using Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> columns (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg247f2">2</xref>B, lane 3), suggesting that the form of hisAP-2 expressed by D7 contained a non-functional protein due to some mutation or deletion in the Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding domain. Consistently, the fractions purified from protein extracts from D7 did not present any noticeable DNA binding activity, whereas this activity was detected in the fractions eluted from Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> columns loaded with clone D10 extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg247f2">2</xref>C, compare lanes 6 and 7 with 8 and 9). We therefore used the D7 clone as an internal control in subsequent experiments. An unidentified 110 kDa band co-purified with AP-2&#x003b1; and was recognised by the anti-AP-2 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg247f2">2</xref>B, lane 3). A band of similar molecular weight has been described by other authors using anti-AP-2&#x003b1; antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c28">28</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated whether DEK co-purified with hisAP-2. The nuclear expression levels of DEK in the two clones, D7 and D10, were similar to those of the original U-87 cell line (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg247f2">2</xref>D, lanes 1&#x02013;3). DEK was clearly detected in the AP-2&#x003b1;-enriched fractions when nuclear extracts from clone D10 where subjected to Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-affinity chromatography (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg247f2">2</xref>D, lane 6). In clear contrast, DEK was absent in the eluates from either U-87 or clone D7 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg247f2">2</xref>D, lanes 4 and 5). These data strongly suggest that DEK interacts with AP-2&#x003b1; in cell cultures.</p></sec><sec><title>DEK increases transcriptional activity of AP-2&#x003b1; in HepG2 cells</title><p>To investigate the physiological relevance of the DEK-AP-2&#x003b1; interaction, we tested whether DEK could modulate AP-2&#x003b1; transcriptional activity. We co-transfected increasing amounts of a DEK expression vector with a constant amount of an AP-2&#x003b1; expression vector and an <italic>APOE</italic> promoter-luciferase reporter vector &#x0005b;from &#x02013;227 to &#x0002b;1 <italic>APOE</italic> promoter sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c22">22</xref>)&#x0005d; in the hepatoma cell line HepG2. According to previously reported results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c29">29</xref>), AP-2&#x003b1; transactivated <italic>APOE</italic> promoter in these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg247f3">3</xref>). The addition of increasing amounts of DEK enhanced AP-2&#x003b1; activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg247f3">3</xref>, black bars). AP-2&#x003b1; was directly involved in this effect, since overexpression of DEK alone did not have any effect on <italic>APOE</italic> promoter activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg247f3">3</xref>, grey bars). Taken together, these results suggested that DEK plays a role as co-activator of the transcriptional activity of AP-2&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>DEK enhances binding of AP-2&#x003b1; to DNA</title><p>We then examined whether a recombinant preparation of GST-DEK affected the formation of AP-2&#x003b1;&#x02013;DNA complexes by EMSAs. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg247f4">4</xref>, while <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding activity of small amounts of AP-2r (30 ng) was undetectable, formation of AP-2r&#x02013;DNA complexes could be observed in the presence of GST-DEK. This effect of GST-DEK appeared to be specific since GST did not enhance the DNA-binding activity of AP-2&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg247f4">4</xref>). The stimulatory effect of GST-DEK was dose dependent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg247f4">4</xref>), and we were unable to observe the formation of DNA complexes with GST-DEK alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg247f4">4</xref>). In addition, the presence of GST-DEK did not produce a significant increase in the mobility of the AP-2&#x003b1;&#x02013;DNA complex. In our assay conditions we have been unable to detect a supershift band with an anti-humanDEK antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c30">30</xref>) (data not shown) suggesting that DEK is not present in the complex; it is also possible that DEK is not recognised by the antibody in the presence of bound AP-2&#x003b1; due to some kind of steric hindrance. Taken together, our results suggest the existence of a physiologically relevant interaction between the oncoprotein DEK and the transcription factor AP-2&#x003b1;; DEK enhances AP-2&#x003b1; transcriptional activity by a mechanism that appears to involve an enhancement in AP-2&#x003b1;&#x02013;DNA binding.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that suggests a role for the oncogene DEK as co-activator of a transcription factor. DEK contains a SAP (after <underline>S</underline>AF-A&#x0002f;B, <underline>A</underline>cinus and <underline>P</underline>IAS) DNA-binding motif which is involved in chromatin remodelling and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c31">31</xref>). Coincidentally, several SAP family members, such as Miz1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c32">32</xref>), alter the DNA binding activity of transcription factors, modifying their transcriptional activity. Since DEK is known to bind condensed chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c33">33</xref>) and chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c34">34</xref>), altering the nucleosomal DNA topology and reducing the chromatin replication efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c35">35</xref>), it is possible that DEK produces a change in chromatin conformation that increases the DNA binding of AP-2&#x003b1;. The AP-2&#x003b1; binding site on <italic>APOE</italic> promoter (TGGGGCAGGG) is very similar to the known DEK binding site in the HIV-2 promoter, which is a pets sequence (TTGGTCAGGG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c30">30</xref>). Although DEK does not appear to bind to the CXX probe <italic>in vitro</italic>, it is possible that, upon a possible <italic>in vivo</italic> binding to DNA, DEK may act as a recruitment factor for AP-2&#x003b1;. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the expression of Pho5 is controlled by a similar &#x02018;cooperativity&#x02019; mechanism. In this case, the Pho4 transcriptional activator is cooperatively recruited to the active sites by the homeoprotein Pho2, a protein that binds very weakly to DNA in the absence of Pho4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c36">36</xref>).</p><p>However, DEK appears to enhance the interaction of AP-2&#x003b1; with DNA without affecting the rate of migration of this complex, and no evidence was found suggesting a direct interaction of DEK with DNA. Thus, DEK behaves similarly to Miz1, another SAP protein, which enhances DNA binding of the transcription factor Msx2 without forming ternary complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c32">32</xref>). Our results suggest the existence of a transient interaction in which DEK affects the conformation of AP-2&#x003b1;, enhancing its DNA binding. A similar &#x02018;hit and run&#x02019; mechanism has been demonstrated for the effect of Phox 1 over DNA binding of the serum response factor (SRF); Phox 1 was proposed to lower an activation energy barrier, enhancing the rate of stable SRF&#x02013;DNA complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c37">37</xref>).</p><p>The interaction of AP-2&#x003b1; with DEK was demonstrated using an N-terminally truncated AP-2&#x003b1; fragment. This suggests that the interaction domain of AP-2&#x003b1; is located in the C-terminal moiety, which includes the DNA binding and dimerization domains. Both domains are highly conserved between all members of the AP-2 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c38">38</xref>) suggesting that DEK may be interacting with other AP-2 family members.</p><p>It has recently been suggested that cardiac, neural crest and neural tube defects in mice lacking Cited2 are produced because this protein plays a role as AP-2&#x003b1; co-activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c39">39</xref>). Also, over-expression of some co-activators, such as PC4 and PARP, partially rescue the malignant phenotype of PA-1 cells transformed by AP-2&#x003b1; via a mechanism that involve an effect of these co-activators over other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c40">40</xref>). Since DEK can partially revert the transformation-prone phenotype of cells from patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c41">41</xref>), it is reasonable to think that DEK may rescue this phenotype due to the action of DEK-dependent transcription factors, such as AP-2&#x003b1;. In this sense, we can speculate that the oncogenic activity of the chimera DEK-CAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c26">26</xref>) may be due to the inhibition of the interaction with AP-2&#x003b1; and other transcription factors, provoking, as a result, cell transformation.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that DEK is an oncogene associated with human hepatocellular carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c42">42</xref>). The DEK oncogenic properties and the co-expression of DEK and AP-2&#x003b1; in several tissues such as spleen, thymus, kidney and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg247c26">26</xref>) suggest that DEK could be acting in a coordinate way with AP-2&#x003b1; in the cell cycle regulation.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg247f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Purification of DEK by AP-2&#x003b1; affinity chromatography.
