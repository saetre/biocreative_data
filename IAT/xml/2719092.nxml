Expansions in coding-regions cause protein gain-of-function effects, while non-coding expansions produce toxic RNAs that alter RNA splicing activities of MBNL and CELF proteins. Bi-directional expression of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) CTG CAG expansion produces CUG expansion RNAs (CUG<sup>exp</sup>) from the <italic>ATXN8OS</italic> gene and a nearly pure polyglutamine expansion protein encoded by <italic>ATXN8</italic> CAG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts expressed in the opposite direction. Here, we present three lines of evidence that RNA gain-of-function plays a significant role in SCA8: 1) CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts accumulate as ribonuclear inclusions that co-localize with MBNL1 in selected neurons in the brain; 2) loss of <italic>Mbnl1</italic> enhances motor deficits in SCA8 mice; 3) SCA8 CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts trigger splicing changes and increased expression of the CUGBP1-MBNL1 regulated CNS target, <italic>GABA-A transporter 4</italic> (<italic>GAT4/Gabt4</italic>). <italic>In vivo</italic> optical imaging studies in SCA8 mice confirm that Gabt4 upregulation is associated with the predicted loss of GABAergic inhibition within the granular cell layer.

Moreover, our demonstration that relatively short CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts cause RNA gain-of-function effects and the growing number of antisense transcripts recently reported in mammalian genomes suggest unrecognized toxic RNAs contribute to the pathophysiology of polyglutamine CAG CTG disorders.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>We describe several lines of evidence that RNA gain-of-function effects play a significant role in spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) and has broader implications for understanding the CNS effects of other trinucleotide expansion disorders including myotonic dystrophy type 1, Huntington disease like-2, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 7.

In human SCA8 autopsy tissue, CUG positive inclusions were found in the cerebellar cortical layers (red dots) by confocal microscopy. These CUG ribonuclear inclusions are distinguishable from background lipofuscin auto-fluorescence which appears as a yellowish-brown perinuclear staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000600-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Although ribonuclear inclusions were seen in all three SCA8 autopsy brains examined, the foci varied in distribution, size, and number between SCA8 cases and compared to ribonuclear inclusions found in DM1 cerebellum. In cerebellar tissue from SCA8 patients with 1000 and 400 CTG repeats, single CUG foci were frequently found in the nuclei of molecular layer (ML) interneurons and the Bergmann glia surrounding the Purkinje cells in the granule cell (GC) layer, while multiple smaller foci were typically found in Purkinje cells (PC). Although qRT-PCR shows CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts are expressed at comparable levels in all three SCA8 autopsy cases, ribonuclear inclusions were not reproducibly found in the brain with 109 CTG repeats, and were only detected in a single molecular layer interneuron (not shown). While these data suggest that ribonuclear inclusions are less likely to form in patients with shorter expansions, CUG RNA foci were readily detectable in SCA8 BAC transgenic mice which express similarly sized SCA8 <italic>ATXN8OS</italic> (CUG)<sub>116</sub> transcripts under the control of the endogenous human promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000600-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom row). Similar to the RNA foci found in SCA8 autopsy tissue with 400 and 1000 repeats, the foci in these mice have a similar distribution in the cerebellar cortex (Purkinje cells, Bergmann glia, and molecular layer interneurons). Additionally, ribonuclear inclusions were found in the deep cerebellar nuclei in our mice, an area of the brain we were not able to examine in the human autopsy cases. No foci were seen in mice expressing normal repeat (CTG)<sub>11</sub> or non-transgenic littermates and additionally, no CAG foci were detected using a CTG oligonucleotide probe (not shown).</p><fig id="pgen-1000600-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000600.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CUG<sup>exp</sup>&#x02013;positive ribonuclear inclusions and co-localization with MBNL1 in SCA8 cerebellum.</title><p>(A) CUG-positive nuclear foci (RED) in SCA8 mouse and human cerebellum.

While no change in GABT4 RNA or protein was seen in cells overexpressing MBNL1/41 alone, overexpression of MBNL1/41 and SCA8 CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts reverses the increase in GABT4 RNA (p&#x0003c;0.0001) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000600-g007">Figure 7A and 7C</xref>) triggered by SCA8 CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts alone and restores exon 7 alternative splicing ratios to the normal adult pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000600-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).

We investigated RNA gain-of-function effects in SCA8 and present three lines of evidence that CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts play a role in SCA8. First, we demonstrate CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts accumulate as ribonuclear inclusions in selected cells and that these RNA foci co-localize with Mbnl1 in a subset of neurons in SCA8 patients and mice. Second, we show genetic loss of <italic>Mbnl1</italic> enhances motor coordination deficits in low-copy SCA8 BAC<sup>exp</sup> mice. Third, we demonstrate SCA8 CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts trigger increased expression of a CUGBP1-MBNL1 regulated CNS target, <italic>GABT4</italic>, in both mice and humans as well as in a human cell culture model and demonstrate the predicted loss of GABAergic inhibition within the granular cell layer occurs in these animals.</p><p>Although CNS effects are a clinically important feature of myotonic dystrophy, mechanistic studies have focused on skeletal and cardiac muscle and little is known about the effects of CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts in brain. In addition, the antagonistic relationship between CUGBP1 and MBNL1, previously documented in heart and skeletal muscle, has not been demonstrated in the CNS. In this study we used CLIP analysis to identify putative Cugbp1 CNS targets. To explore the molecular basis of the loss of GABAergic inhibition we investigated changes in expression levels and alternative splicing of the Cugbp1 CLIP target, <italic>Gabt4</italic>, in our mice. We show that overexpression of CUGBP1 in human SK-N-SH cells, or depletion of MBNL1, result in an upregulation of <italic>GABT4</italic> that mimics the <italic>in vivo</italic> changes in steady state levels caused by CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts. These data provide the first evidence that CUG<sup>exp</sup> RNA gain-of-function effects in the brain involve the dysregulation of CUGBP1-MBNL1 pathways. These data also suggest that MBNL1 overexpression, which has been demonstrated to be therapeutic in skeletal muscle, might also be an effective treatment to reverse pathological changes associated with expression of CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts in the CNS. Additionally, the long list of other putative Cugbp1 targets identified in mouse brain provides an important future resource for the identification of additional CNS genes dysregulated in SCA8 and DM.</p><p>Previous studies in myotonic dystrophy suggest that the expression of CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts, together with MBNL1 and CELF proteins and their downstream target genes need to be coordinated temporally and spatially for disease pathogenesis. Therefore, defining the temporal and cell specific <italic>ATXN8OS</italic> expression pattern will be crucial for understanding disease pathogenesis and interpreting future results. We identified for the first time in SCA8, CUG-RNA foci in Purkinje cells, molecular layer interneurons and the deep cerebellar nuclei. In addition, we show MBNL1/Mbnl1 colocalizes with SCA8 CUG foci in molecular layer interneurons and the DCN. Interestingly, although Purkinje cells had nuclear CUG foci in both DM1 and SCA8, co-localization with nuclear MBNL1 was not observed in these cells. Further studies will need to be done to determine if MBNL1 is expressed in the nucleus of these cells or if changes in MBNL1 splice forms affect its ability to bind to the CUG expansion transcripts. Taken together, these results suggest that temporal and spatial expression patterns of expansion transcripts and the overlap in expression of specific RNA binding proteins and their downstream target genes are likely to underlie the susceptibility of specific cells to RNA gain-of-function effects and the clinical difference between DM and SCA8.</p><p>To investigate the broader significance of MBNL1 in SCA8, we tested the effects of Mbnl1 depletion on a behavioral phenotype in our SCA8 mice by crossing heterozygous <italic>Mbnl1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x00394;E3</sup></italic> animals with a low-copy SCA8-BAC-EXP5 line. The phenotypic enhancement of the rotarod deficits found in the doubly transgenic animals with reduced Mbnl1 suggests that expression of CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts in SCA8 and the subsequent downstream effects on Mbnl1 are sufficiently significant to contribute to the movement disorder phenotype found in SCA8.</p><p><italic>GABT4</italic> upregulation in human SCA8 autopsy tissue and cell culture studies supports a model in which <italic>GABT4</italic> levels are regulated by alternative splicing changes and the NMD pathway.

Additional studies are also required to directly test the hypothesis that <italic>GABT4</italic> upregulation causes the decrease in GABAergic inhibition seen in our SCA8 BAC-EXP mice.</p><p>While these data provide the first evidence for RNA gain-of-function effects in SCA8, it is also possible that the polyQ expansion protein contributes to the disease. In contrast to other disorders in which polyQ expansions are expressed as part of a mature protein, the SCA8 CAG<sup>exp</sup> is expressed as a nearly pure polyQ tract. While previous studies have shown that pure polyQ repeats are toxic in Drosophila and mice, the relative contribution of RNA and protein gain-of-function effects in SCA8 still needs to be assessed.</p><p>In this study we provide several lines of evidence that RNA gain-of-function effects play a significant role in SCA8 and show that SCA8 CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts affect alternative splicing patterns controlled by MBNL1 and CUGBP1 in the mammalian brain. While SCA8 is the first reported disease in which a single expansion mutation expresses both a polyglutamine protein and CUG<sup>exp</sup> transcripts, bidirectional expression has also been recently described in other triplet expansion disorders.

The maximal response to whisker stimulation occurred in frames 31&#x02013;75 and these frames were averaged to generate the response image. A pixel was defined as responding to the peripheral stimulation by the following threshold procedure. First, the response image was low-pass filtered (3&#x000d7;3) and the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the pixels in a control region (usually a corner of the image) were determined. The pixels above the mean &#x0002b; 1 SD of the control region were considered to respond to the stimulus. The response area was defined as total area of all the pixels responding and the response intensity as the sum of the DF/F of all responding pixels. Differences in the area and intensity of the responses between the SCA8 and FVB mice were evaluated using a Student's <italic>t</italic>-test (&#x003b1;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.05). For display the pixels above or below this mean&#x000b1;1 SD were pseudo-colored and superimposed on an image of the folia studied.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000600.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Candidate RNA Gain-of-Function Targets by Cross-Linking and Immunoprecipitation (CLIP).</p><p>(0.18 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000600.s001.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank family members for their participation and J.
