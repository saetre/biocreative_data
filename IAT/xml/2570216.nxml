Breast, prostate, kidney, thyroid and lung cancers metastasize to the bone. Tumor cells reside within the bone using integrin type cell adhesion receptors and elicit incapacitating bone pain and fractures. In particular, metastatic human prostate tumors express and cleave the integrin A6, a receptor for extracellular matrix components of the bone, i.e., laminin 332 and laminin 511. More than 50&#x00025; of all prostate cancer patients develop severe bone pain during their remaining lifetime. One major goal is to prevent or delay cancer induced bone pain. We used a novel xenograft mouse model to directly determine if bone pain could be prevented by blocking the known cleavage of the A6 integrin adhesion receptor. Human tumor cells expressing either the wildtype or mutated A6 integrin were placed within the living bone matrix and 21 days later, integrin expression was confirmed by RT-PCR, radiographs were collected and behavioral measurements of spontaneous and evoked pain performed. All animals independent of integrin status had indistinguishable tumor burden and developed bone loss 21 days after surgery. A comparison of animals containing the wild type or mutated integrin revealed that tumor cells expressing the mutated integrin resulted in a dramatic decrease in bone loss, unicortical or bicortical fractures and a decrease in the ability of tumor cells to reach the epiphyseal plate of the bone. Further, tumor cells within the bone expressing the integrin mutation prevented cancer induced spontaneous flinching, tactile allodynia, and movement evoked pain. Preventing A6 integrin cleavage on the prostate tumor cell surface decreased the migration of tumor cells within the bone and the onset and degree of bone pain and fractures. These results suggest that strategies for blocking the cleavage of the adhesion receptors on the tumor cell surface can significantly prevent cancer induced bone pain and slow disease progression within the bone. Since integrin cleavage is mediated by Urokinase-type Plasminogen Activator (uPA), further work is warranted to test the efficacy of uPA inhibitors for prevention or delay of cancer induced bone pain.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Of the estimated 565,650 people in the U.S. who will die of cancer in 2008, almost all will have metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003535-Jemal1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Escape from the prostate gland and invasion through the capsule is associated with poor prognosis whereas confined disease is treatable.

Integrins are transmembrane heterodimer cell adhesion receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003535-Demetriou2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Integrin expression within the normal prostate gland reflects the diversity of the extracellular matrix components.

However, within invasive carcinomas, the majority of the integrin subunits are not observed on the tumor cell surfaces.

This allowed us to determine if blocking production of a laminin receptor (A6pB1) would alter the ability of the tumor cells to migrate or modify the environment within the bone and whether this held functional significance in terms of bone pain.</p><p>The results showed that modifying the production of the A6pB1 laminin receptor on the tumor cell surface can remarkably hinder migration within the bone. The direct injection model allows for the precise placement of known numbers of tumor cells within the bone. Since the tumor cells grow equally well independent of integrin status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003535-Pawar1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003535-Pawar2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> (both in tissue culture and as human tumors in mice), the data suggests that the distribution of tumor cells within bone may be a key element influencing cancer induced bone pain. The inability of tumor cells to reach the epiphyseal region of the bone due to integrin status coincided with a remarkable decrease of three distinct behavioral pain measurements. While it is unknown currently whether location of tumor cells within bone and bone pain were functionally linked, other reports have indicated that within bone, microenvironments are sufficiently distinct to warrant this possibility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003535-Morrissey1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It is possible that the diminished bone pain is due to the inability of the integrin to be cleaved, independent of the location of the tumor cells within the bone. Integrins and cadherins are cleaved or shed on tumor cell surfaces<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003535-Najy1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003535-ConacciSorrell1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The liberated fragments of receptors undergoing ectodomain cleavage are biologically active and may contribute to cancer induced bone pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003535-DelloSbarba1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Further experiments will distinguish between these possibilities.</p><p>Although bone metastases are traditionally thought to be either osteolytic or osteoblastic, morphological analyses have revealed that, in most patients, bone metastases have both osteolytic and osteoblastic elements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003535-Mundy1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. In prostate cancer patients, bone metastases frequently show more osteoblastic phenotype, although some patients have osteolytic lesions similar to those seen in patients with metastatic breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003535-Mundy1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. This research focused on a human prostate cancer cell line that produced mostly osteolytic bone remodeling in the mouse bone. The inability of the integrin to be cleaved resulted in reduced bone loss and fracture. As most bone loss and fracture are observed at the distal end of the bone, the inability of the tumor cells to reach the epiphyseal region of the bone may have reduced the bone loss and fracture in that area. Future studies on the role of integrins on osteoblastic bone remodeling would be needed to determine whether altering integrin function will also alter osteoblastic reactions in the bone.</p><p>Finally we note that cancer induced bone destruction is associated with severely reduced quality of life stemming from complications such as hypercalcemia, bone fracture and incapacitating pain. Advances in cancer detection and therapy are extending the life expectancy of cancer patients and is increasing a focus on improving patients' quality of life. Both the use of the novel xenograft mouse model for studying the prevention of cancer induced bone pain and targeting adhesion receptors on the tumor cell surface for the bone should significantly impact the quality of life for patients with metastatic disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Human Prostate Cancer Cell Lines</title><p>The PC3N cells were transfected with plasmids containing either the wildtype or mutated integrin A6 as previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003535-Pawar1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.
