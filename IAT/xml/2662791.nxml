However, cells can divide and flies can, for a large part of development, develop without them. Many centrosome proteins have been identified but the roles of most are still poorly understood. The centrioles of the centrosome are similar to the basal bodies of cilia, hair-like extensions of many cells that have important roles in cell signalling and development. In a number of human diseases, such Bardet-Biedl syndrome, centrosome/cilium proteins are mutated, leading to polycystic kidney disease, situs inversus, and neurological problems, amongst other symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We describe zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos depleted for two uncharacterised, centrosome proteins, Cep70 and Cep131. The phenotype of these embryos resembles that of zebrafish mutants for intraflagellar transport proteins (IFTs), with kidney and ear development affected and left-right asymmetry randomised. These organs and processes are those affected in Bardet-Biedl syndrome and other similar diseases. Like these diseases, the root cause of the phenotype lies, in fact, in dysfunctional cilia, which are shortened but not eliminated in several tissues in the morphants. Centrosomes and basal bodies, on the other hand, are present. Both Cep70 and Cep131 possess a putative HDAC (histone deacetylase) interacting domain. However, we could not detect in yeast two-hybrid assays any interaction with the deacetylase that controls cilium length, HDAC6, or any of the IFTs that we tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Cep70 and Cep131 contribute to ciliogenesis in many tissues in the zebrafish embryo: cilia are made in cep70 and cep131 morphant zebrafish embryos but are shortened. We propose that the role of these centrosomal/basal body proteins is in making the cilium and that they are involved in determination of the length of the axoneme.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The centrosome is an approximately one micrometre-cubed organelle that acts as the microtubule organising centre in higher eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It consists of two cylindrical centrioles, built from microtubules, surrounded by a protein matrix. During cell division, the centrosome is duplicated contemporaneously with DNA and the two centrosomes contribute to the formation of the poles of the mitotic spindle that segregate the duplicated chromosomes faithfully between daughter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. For almost a century, the centrosome was seen as an essential component of the cell cycle, especially mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]: frog eggs with no centrosomes do not divide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; sea urchin eggs with too many undergo multipolar divisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The requirement of centrosomes for cell division has been severely tested over the last few years. In cell culture, the centrosome can be removed or obliterated with a laser and the cell will still divide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In Drosophila, mitotic centrosomes are not necessary for the development of the centrosomin mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. DSas-4 mutant flies can even develop to maturity in the absence of centrosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], although they rely on maternal stores of protein for early embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and they die soon after hatching by drowning in their food or from dehydration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This raises the question of what is the precise role of the metazoan centrosome and what all the hundred or so proteins in the complex do. Part of the answer might lie in the other cellular structure that is formed from centrioles.</p><p>Basal bodies are centriole-like structures observed underneath the cell membrane at the base of cilia, hair-like extensions of the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These cilia range from the highly motile, such as those that line the trachea, to the immotile and highly specialised, such as the connecting cilium to the outer segments of photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Virtually all vertebrate cells have a cilium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], though for many cell types the seemingly inactive primary cilium has the appearance of a relic organelle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The basal bodies can be made from the pre-existing centrosomal centrioles that migrate to the surface, with duplication in multi-ciliated cells, or de novo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Research into the cilium has undergone a resurgence recently with their linkage to a number of inherited human diseases and the discovery of their role in a number of important developmental processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Primary cilia dyskinesia (PCD aka immotile ciliary syndrome) was shown to be due to abnormal cilia in the mid-seventies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. More recently, polycystic kidney disease (PKD) has been linked to the condition of cilia in the kidney tubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Cilia in the node, a fluid-filled compartment also known as Kupffer's Vesicle in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], are involved in initiation of left-right asymmetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] This explains the situs inversus often associated with PCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and observed in a targeted mouse mutant for the gene, Tg737, which encodes the Polaris protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This mutant, an allele of the Tg737<sup>orpk </sup>hypomorph which models PKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], affects the mouse homologue of the Chlamydomonas IFT88 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], one of the family of intraflagellar transport proteins (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]) that move other proteins up and down the cilium in conjunction with motor proteins.</p><p>Bardet-Biedl, Alstrom and Oral-facial-digital syndromes are a number of other human diseases described whose pleiotropic and overlapping symptoms include polycystic kidney disease, situs inversus, retinal dystrophy and neurological problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The products of the genes mutated in these diseases localise to centrosomes and basal bodies of cilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>A large portion of the centrosome inventory consists of novel and uncharacterised proteins often with no domains to give clues as to their cellular function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We therefore set out to screen this list for proteins with developmental roles by systematically depleting them from zebrafish embryos using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides. This model system enables us to rapidly work through the centrosome inventory in a vertebrate host with fast and experimentally accessible tissue and organ development. Here, we analyse two genes involved in centrosome function. The absence of either gene in zebrafish results in 'ciliary' phenotypes, which closely resemble those of zebrafish mutants for intraflagellar transport genes (IFTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We conducted a pilot screen for centrosome proteins with developmental roles, injecting zebrafish embryos with morpholinos directed against the mRNAs for thirty centrosomal proteins that have been identified, focussing primarily on those that had not been well characterised. We were able to identify seven morpholinos that, upon early injection, resulted in morphological phenotypes (CJW &#x00026; WAH, unpublished data). Two morphants particularly caught our attention. Embryos injected with morpholinos against the zebrafish homologues of cep70 and cep131 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] displayed a curved back, slightly shortened body axis and ectopic otoliths were frequently observed (21/45 in cep70, 21/30 in cep131, not observed in same number of WTs) at 48 hours post-fertilisation (h.p.f.) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;D</xref>). Both morpholinos gave a robust and highly penetrant phenotype.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>cep70 and cep131 morphants at 48 h.p.f. </bold>cep131 (A, B) and cep70 (C, D) with WT embryos shown at the top (B) and bottom (D) with morphants of varying severity as judged by curvature of the spine. The ectopic third otolith can be easily seen in (A) and (C), is labelled with an arrow and the otic vesicle is magnified in the insets. There is an arrowhead to the hydrocephaly present in the cep70 morphant in (C). To demonstrate morpholino effectiveness, embryos were co-injected with morpholino and an mRNA encoding the morpholino target site spliced in frame to GFP. In these embryos (F, G), expression was greatly reduced compared to embryos not injected with morpholino to another target sequence (E). Very little signal &#x02013; much of it autofluorescence &#x02013; could be detected when exposure time was increased to 8" for morphants (F, G) compared to 1/8" for control (E); otherwise panels would be blank. cep70 morphants and corresponding control embryos were treated with PTU hence the lack of pigmentation. Scale bar: 250 &#x003bc;m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-10-17-1"/></fig><p>We initially tested the effectiveness of these morpholinos against the desired sequence by modifying GFP to include the morpholino target site 5' and in-frame to the coding sequence and co-injecting mRNA for this construct with the morpholino. As expected, GFP fluorescence in the embryos was practically eliminated, which was not the case if a control morpholino was injected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E&#x02013;G</xref>).</p><p>To show the specificity of the effect of depleting the proteins, we next tried to use splicing inhibitory morpholinos for both genes. Morpholinos were designed that bound the intron 3 &#x02013; exon 4 junction of the predicted pre-mRNA of each gene. In both cases, a very similar phenotype of curved back and ectopic otoliths (cep70, 7/37; cep131, 12/30) was observed, although it was less severe for cep70 compared to the translation-inhibiting morpholino (data not shown). For each gene, then, two different morpholinos operating by different mechanisms &#x02013; translation inhibition and inhibition of splicing &#x02013; gave a very similar morphant phenotype. We used RT-PCR to assay if the level of mRNA of each gene had been reduced. In both cases, significant reduction was observed, though this was greater in the case of cep131 than cep70, as might be expected from the phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). We used the translation-inhibiting morpholinos in subsequent experiments as the severity of the phenotype suggests a greater level of depletion.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localisation of Cep70 and Cep131</bold>. (A) Splicing-inhibitory morpholinos result in a reduction in cep70 and cep131 mRNA levels, as judged by RT-PCR of a 480 bp or a 360 bp fragment, respectively, that covers the splice site. In the cep131 morphant, an additional, faint band at 260 bp can be observed. This is consistent with skipping of the third exon, though other splicing products might also be possible. Right, an antibody to Cep70 recognises a 70 kDa band in PC2 cell line and zebrafish embryo extract. (B-J) Subcellular localisation of Cep70 and Cep131. An antibody raised to Cep70 gives a punctate staining (B) similar to gamma tubulin (C) in PC2 zebrafish cultured fibroblasts. The two signals coincide when the two channels are merged, the centrosome now shown in yellow (D). GFP-Cep70 and GFP-Cep131 localise to the centrosome, as expected (E-J). Cep70 or GFP fusions are shown in green, gamma tubulin is in red, nuclei are in blue (DAPI) in merged pictures. Insets enlarge the centrosome signal. Scale bar: 10 &#x003bc;m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-10-17-2"/></fig><p>We cloned both cep70 and cep131 by RT-PCR from 24 h.p.f. zebrafish embryos and raised antibodies to recombinant zebrafish Cep70 overexpressed in E. coli and affinity purified. The recombinant protein was recognised by sera from rabbits immunised with zebrafish Cep70; one serum was used for subsequent experiments (rabbit anti-Cep70, polyclonal 485-4).</p><p>In both zebrafish PC2 cells and two-day old zebrafish embryo extracts, a band at the expected size could be detected by the rabbit anti-Cep70 serum, as well as a low molecular weight band in the cell line extracts. This protein was difficult to detect in embryos by Western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><p>Immunofluorescence microscopy of PC2 cells labelled with anti-Cep70 antibody revealed a punctate, perinuclear pattern that coincided with that of gamma tubulin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B&#x02013;D</xref>) and was absent from cells probed with the pre-immune serum. As expected, GFP-Cep70 and GFP-Cep131 localised to the centrosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E&#x02013;J</xref>). Two dots of signal were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G, J</xref> insets), strongly suggesting that these are present on or around both centrioles and not localised to one specific centriole or mother centriole-specific structures like the (sub-)distal appendages.</p><p>In 24 h.p.f. embryos, GFP-Cep70 localises to the apical surface of cells in the otic vesicle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) and eye (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>) with a punctate appearance. This can be replicated with wholemount immunofluorescence staining of 24 h.p.f. embryos with rabbit anti-Cep70 485-4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F, G</xref>). This staining coincides with that of mouse monoclonal GTU-88 to gamma tubulin which labels centrosomes and basal bodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> &#x02013; merge of C and D) and lies at the base of cilia labelled with mouse monoclonal 6-11B-1 to acetylated tubulin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>), shown in detail in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref> and inset. In the otic vesicle there is non-specific staining of the otoliths but in other ciliated tissues, only the basal bodies are labelled (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref> (eye), I (pronephros), J (spine canal)). In ciliated cells, therefore, Cep70 localises to the basal bodies of cilia.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Confocal wholemount (immuno)fluorescence localisation of Cep70 in zebrafish embryos</bold>. (A and E) In embryos injected with GFP-Cep70 and H2B-RFP, the Cep70 signal, though weak, is observed at the apical surface of cells in the otic vesicle (A) and eye (E) at 24 h.p.f. . Long dashed lines indicate the apical surface: interior to the circle in (A) and above the line in (E). Other panels: 24 h.p.f. zebrafish embryos were probed with anti-Cep70 (green) and either anti-acetylated or anti-gamma tubulin (red). (B, C, D) Otic vesicle stained for gamma tubulin (C), Cep70 (D) and merged picture (B) showing that the two signals coincide. Arrowheads point to the non-specific staining of the otoliths.

Yellow colour, the overlap of Cep70 and acetylated-tubulin signal is due to the angle at which some of the cilia are seen. Again, a long dashed line indicates the apical surface of the eye in (F).

It has been found that defective cilia formation is the main cause for the phenotype of these embryos with altered IFT function. We reasoned that the cellular cause of the phenotype we observed should also lie in the state of embryonic cilia rather than the centrosomes themselves.</p><p>We used confocal microscopy to analyse 30 h.p.f. morphant embryos, which were labelled for both gamma tubulin and acetylated tubulin. These mark centrosomes or basal bodies (&#x003b3;-tubulin) and stabilised microtubules found in the axonemes of cilia (acetylated tubulin).

In some IFT morphants, the pronephros expands to form a visible bubble at the head of the pronephros and histological sections of these embryos reveal much expanded pronephric ducts and tubule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We did not observe such a severe phenotype although paraffin sections of cep70 morphants embryos showed a significant expansion in the ducts, which can also be observed in the confocal images of the ducts at an earlier stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D, E</xref> and data not shown). This morphant phenotype is similar to that found in <italic>oval </italic>mutants, in which the pronephric cysts are mild compared to other mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Analysis of the cilia in the pronephric ducts by confocal microscopy revealed a reduction in the length of the cilia from 9.0 &#x000b1; 1.8 &#x003bc;m (n = 47) to 2.8 &#x000b1; 1.4 &#x003bc;m in cep70 (n = 67) and 3.3 &#x000b1; 1.6 &#x003bc;m (n = 39) in cep131 morphants (mean &#x000b1; s.d.; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F&#x02013;H</xref>). However, basal bodies are still present in these cells, beneath the shortened cilia, so the effect on cilia is not due to the absence of centrioles and basal bodies from which the cilia extend.</p><p>The otic vesicles in zebrafish contain two types of cilia: two sets of long, tether cilia (5 &#x003bc;m) are surrounded by short, motile cilia about 1 &#x003bc;m long [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The former anchor the two otoliths normally observed in zebrafish embryos at this stage. The latter move the vesicle fluid that contains the calcium-protein particles that aggregate to form the otoliths. In the absence of effective cilia, these aggregates can form ectopically, rather than on the tether cilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The motile cilia themselves are too short to accurately compare the length between morphant and wild-type by immunofluorescence microscopy. By visual inspection, the size of the tether cilia, much longer than the motile cilia in the rest of the vesicle, is not obviously affected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I&#x02013;K</xref>). In both morphants, basal bodies are still present in the ciliated cells and centrosomes in the surrounding tissue.

The Kupffer's vesicle (KV) is the zebrafish equivalent of the node in mouse embryos and harbours motile cilia, which are crucially involved in determining left-right laterality in both brain and body. The absence of these cilia or their lack of motility results in left and right in the developing embryos being randomly assigned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].

Both Cep70 and Cep131 are coiled-coil proteins proposed by the SMART protein analysis tool to have a histone deacetylase-interacting domain (HDAC-ID) located in the middle of the peptide chain. HDAC6 is, in fact, also a tubulin deacetylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] so these domains could be relevant to the function of these proteins in ciliogenesis. Cep131 also possesses an IQ domain in its N-terminus. To assess whether these domains are responsible for centrosomal association or function of these proteins, we expressed both Cep70 and Cep131 as fragments in PC2 cells. The HDAC-ID-containing half of Cep70 did indeed localise to the centrosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>) whereas the other half of the protein only showed a cytoplasmic staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). The behaviour of the Cep131 fragments is more complex. On its own, the N-terminal third minus the HDAC-ID displays nuclear localisation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>); only a fragment containing both the native N-terminus, IQ and HDAC-ID domains shows centrosomal localisation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref>). Other fragments form cytoplasmic aggregrates that do not always co-localise with the centrosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D, E</xref>). None of these fragments had any notable effects on the cells, apart from at high expression levels where the large aggregates appeared to be toxic.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localisation of Cep70 and Cep131 fragments</bold>. The N-terminus of Cep70 localises to the centrosome (A) whereas the C-terminus does not (B).

This protein fragment, when injected at moderate to high amounts (&#x0003e; 100 ng), resulted in severe defects and toxicity and did not rescue the morphant, presumably reflecting the effect of the aggregates that can form in transfected cells (GFP-fusions of full-length Cep70 and N-terminal fragment, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7H, G</xref>).</p><p>To test for interaction between these proteins we used the yeast two-hybrid assay with these combinations: Cep70 against Cep131; either Cep70 or Cep131 against HDAC6; and either Cep70 or Cep131 versus members of the IFT family of proteins (IFTs 52, 57, 88). We could not detect any interaction between Cep70 or Cep131 and HDAC6, IFT52, IFT57 or IFT88. Cep70 and Cep131 did not interact with each other by this assay but Cep70 did bind itself (data not shown). As it is a predicted coiled-coil protein, this is not surprising.</p><p>Lastly, we looked at the ultrastructure of basal bodies and centrioles in cep70 morphant zebrafish embryos but could observe no difference to the wild-type organelles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A&#x02013;D</xref>): all nine triplet microtubules of basal bodies or centrioles appeared intact and axonemes could be observed emerging from the basal bodies in the brain, where hydrocephaly is observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A&#x02013;D</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, arrowhead). Unlike some mutants with similar phenotypes (e.g. <italic>fleer </italic>where axonemal microtubules are disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]) there were no obvious, gross defects in the centrioles. Whilst we cannot exclude the possibility of fine ultrastructural changes in the tissues affected, centrioles and basal bodies are clearly present in the embryo so the ciliary-related defects are not due to a global absence of centrioles.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Micrographs of basal bodies and cilia from WT and cep70 morphant zebrafish embryos</bold>.

In the case of IFT88 and IFT57 morphants, as for Cep70 and Cep131 morphants, cilia are shortened but not completely eliminated in Kupffer's vesicle, the spine and pronephros [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Cilia disappear at later stages (3 d.p.f.) in eye and ear in the oval mutant (IFT88) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Centrosomes and basal bodies/centrioles are still present in Cep70 and Cep131 morphants so the organelle that seems to be most vulnerable to depletion of these proteins is the cilium rather than the basal body/centriole from which it grows. With the levels of depletion we achieve, although the cilia are much reduced in length, they are not completely eliminated. Indeed, similar to Vladar and Stearns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], Graser and Nigg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] have found that a number, but by no means all, centrosome proteins contribute to ciliogenesis of the primary cilium of cultured retinal pigmented epithelial cells. So far though, only one, Cep164, can be depleted with almost complete elimination of cilia but preservation of the basal body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], similar to the 'end-point' of the oval mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>The motile cilia of the otic vesicle are already of a size to which other cilia in the cep70/131 and IFT57/88 morphants are reduced. This might make them resistant to defects in the ciliogenesis pathway in which Cep70 and Cep131 are involved that reduce the length of other cilia. Any proportional changes in length would also not be accurately measurable with our techniques. The motility of the cilia could still be impaired, which would also result in the formation of the ectopic otoliths observed. The tether cilia appear normal whereas, based on the pronephric cilia, one would expect a clear, visible reduction in length to that of the neighbouring motile cilia. Subtle differences between cilia and cell types in different tissues could render these proteins redundant in certain cells. It is not the case that depletion of any (peri)centriolar protein has the same effect on all cilia in the zebrafish embryo. Depletion of IFT proteins in zebrafish affects nearly all cilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Zebrafish morphants for the Bardet-Biedl syndrome genes show normal eye development, do not exhibit a curved back or ectopic otoliths but do display randomisation of left-right asymmetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Morphants of the Joubert syndrome/nephronophthisis-associated protein Cep290 have certain defects with cerebellum morphology and have kidney cysts but both length and movement of the pronephric cilia is unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Indeed, Zhao and Malicki have recently identified a set of zebrafish mutants in which subsets of cilia are affected although the subcellular localisation of the gene products has yet to be determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>Morphants for zebrafish IFT78 and IFT88 homologues closely but not completely resemble the two morphants described here, both at the gross anatomical, cellular and subcellular level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. IFT57/88 morphants show reduced cilia length in the KV, pronephros and spine central canal as we observe in the two Cep70/131 morphants. The IFT family of proteins might therefore contain candidate partner proteins. However, we could not detect an interaction between Cep70 or Cep131 and several of the IFT proteins. Our search was limited, though, and it remains possible that, as more of these proteins are identified, one member of the IFT family could still be the partner for these two proteins.</p><p>Other proteins that could be partners of both Cep70 and Cep131 are the histone deacetylases as both Ceps possess HDAC interacting domains. However, the exact role of these domains is not immediately obvious. The HDAC that deacetylates tubulin reverses ciliogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Unless these Ceps sequester HDAC6 at the basal body, localising active HDAC6 to cilia via Cep70 and Cep131 would prevent ciliogenesis and so depleting these proteins would prevent cilium reabsorbtion or deciliation. Whilst the HDAC-ID of Cep70 is in the centrosome-localising region of this protein, this domain is not the sole determinant of centrosomal localisation in Cep131, which would also suggest that these proteins would act as anchors for the enzyme, not the other way around. Again, though, our assays failed to detect an interaction between these proteins. This could be a technical limitation or the HDAC-ID, in fact, anchors another HDAC or another molecule.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have described here a role for previously uncharacterised centrosome proteins, Cep70 and Cep131, as contributors to ciliogenesis in certain tissues in the developing vertebrate (zebrafish) embryo. It is as components of the basal bodies of cilia rather than centrosome proteins per se that these proteins appear to exert their effect in these morphants. Neither protein interacts with several IFTs or the deacetylase HDAC6, which are known to have key roles in extending and maintaining cilia, so, if Cep70 and Cep131 are involved in these pathways, other proteins probably act as interlocutors. Alternatively, these two proteins act in another pathway that controls cilium length. The resemblance of both cep70 and cep131 morphants to those of zebrafish IFT57 and IFT88 makes the two proteins candidates for genes mutated in inherited human diseases similar to Bardet-Biedl syndrome in which cilia in a number of tissues are affected. Further investigation of their function should yield valuable knowledge on the function of cilia and their roles in embryonic development and disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Zebrafish</title><p>Zebrafish were maintained and bred at 26.5&#x000b0;C; embryos were raised at 28.5&#x000b0;C, as described by Westerfield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].
