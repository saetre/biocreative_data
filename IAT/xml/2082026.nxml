Stimulation of cells by ESAT-6 along with sodium orthovanadate (a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor) restored phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the nucleus, suggesting active dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 by some putative phosphatase(s) in the nucleus.

The na&#x000ef;ve or resting macrophages are extremely prone to invasion by Mtb bacilli and are unable to mount any anti-bacterial response associated with activated macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Thus, the resting macrophage seems to provide an ideal niche where intracellular tubercle bacilli may reside, replicate and persist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The proteins that are secreted by mycobacteria have gained particular attention in the recent years both as vaccine candidates and virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Some of these proteins like CFP-10 and ESAT-6 are encoded by the RD-1 region of Mtb genome, a region consistently deleted in all BCG vaccine strains of <italic>M. bovis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are evolutionarily conserved enzymes that are important in signal transduction. They play a diverse role in cell proliferation, cell death, cytokine production and cell differentiation. Three main families of MAPKs are found in mammalian cells: c-Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNK 1, 2 and 3); the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2); and the p38 MAPK (p38 &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3; and &#x003b4;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. They play diverse roles in the cell, ranging from apoptosis, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, stress response, to production of proinflammatory cytokines etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Targeting the MAP kinase pathway is one of the favorable strategies adopted by the pathogens to survive inside the macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Mycobacteria modulate MAPK signaling to promote their survival in the host cells. Studies on MAPKs have been done using virulent and attenuated strains of mycobacteria. <italic>M. avium </italic>has two strains; smooth transparent (SmT) and smooth opaque (SmO) which represent a more virulent and a less virulent phenotype, respectively. Both SmT and SmO induced early phosphorylation of p38 upon infection; however, only the attenuated strain elicited sustained activation of p38 MAPK. The virulent strains of mycobacteria caused greater inhibition of MAP kinases, particularly ERK1/2 pathway, as compared to the avirulent strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this phenomenon have not been investigated. Here, we show for the first time that ESAT-6 protein can modulate the ERK1/2 group of MAP kinases by limiting its activation in the nucleus. The MAP kinase-inducible transcription factor c-Myc is known to enhance cell proliferation as well as apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Here we show that by modulating the MAP kinase ERK1/2, ESAT-6 down regulates the LPS-induced <italic>c-myc </italic>gene expression in the macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>ESAT-6 caused activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) in cytoplasm but not in nucleus</title><p>We studied the effect of ESAT-6 on the activation status of ERK1/2 group of MAP kinases. MAP kinases are activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli such as stress, growth factors, and cytokines. The activation of ERK1/2 occurs through phosphorylation; the activated or phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) translocate to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] where they phosphorylate and activate the downstream cognate transcription factors such as CREB etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We found that ESAT-6 (5 &#x003bc;g/ml) caused a time-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) in cytoplasm of RAW264.7 cells compared to unstimulated cells. In the Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> the ERK1/2 is shown as a doublet where upper band represents ERK-1 with molecular weight of 44 kDa and the lower band represents ERK-2 with molecular weight of 42 kDa. In general cytoplasmic pERK1/2 would have translocated to the nucleus to activate the downstream molecules, but in the case of ESAT-6-stimulated cells we did not observe any pERK1/2 in the nuclear extract at any of the time points under the observation period (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). To determine whether the effect of ESAT-6 was specific for ERK1/2 or not, we checked for the phosphorylation of another MAP kinase p38. ESAT-6 triggered phosphorylation of p38 in both cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>) and the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>), therefore the effect of ESAT-6 was specific for ERK1/2.

The activation of ERK1/2 in cytoplasm was observed as usual (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Since with ESAT-6 alone there was no pERK1/2 in the nucleus, but with Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4 </sub>treatment there was phosphorylation of ERK1/2, so there might be some putative phosphatase(s) dephosphorylating the pERK1/2 as it translocated from cytoplasm to the nucleus. We checked whether sodium orthovanadate alone could induce activation of ERK1/2; in the cells stimulated with 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4 </sub>for the same time points, we found weakly activated ERK1/2 in cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>) and none in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>).

We also found that this modulation was achieved by inhibition of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the nucleus. However, the phosphorylation of another MAP kinase p38 was not affected by ESAT-6. Nevertheless, LPS, a general macrophage activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] triggered phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in both cytoplasm and the nucleus. This showed that the limited activation of ERK1/2 in the nucleus was specific for ESAT-6 stimulation. Costimulation of cells with LPS and ESAT-6 dampened the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the nucleus compared to that obtained with LPS alone; clearly ESAT-6 was exerting a strong inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the nucleus. Our finding that the treatment of cells with Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] along with ESAT-6 caused pERK1/2 to appear in the nucleus indicated that there was some phosphatase(s) activity in the nucleus that was triggered upon stimulation with ESAT-6. Moreover, when this phosphatase activity was suppressed by Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, the pERK1/2 reappeared in the nucleus. The results of kinase assay further corroborated our observations from western blotting that phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was concomitant with its activation. Measurement of phosphatase activity associated with ERK1/2 in the nucleus showed that there was an increase in this activity over the given time period; this finding was consistent with our observation that following treatment with both ESAT-6 and a phosphatase inhibitor (Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>) there was an increase in phosphorylation of ERK1/2. It was already established that ERK1/2 after getting phosphorylated in cytoplasm translocates to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]; therefore at zero minute, we observed little pERK1/2 in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Our findings tend to suggest that although with increase in the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the cytoplasm of the ESAT-6-stimulated cells, pERK1/2 must have migrated to the nucleus, but increasing phosphatase activity in the nucleus, again associated with ESAT-6 stimulation, dephosphorylated the pERK1/2 coming from the cytoplasm; therefore no pERK1/2 was detectable in the nuclear extract. Since MAP kinases undergo rapid turnover in the nucleus, the levels of total ERK1/2 in the nucleus remained constant over the experimental time period.</p><p>The <italic>c-myc </italic>is one of the early response genes that encode a transcription factor c-Myc, which is a key regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Since <italic>c-myc </italic>expression was reported to occur through Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], we studied the effect of ESAT-6 on <italic>c-myc </italic>expression in RAW264.7 cells. ESAT-6 itself did not have any effect on <italic>c-myc </italic>expression over the basal level. However the LPS induced <italic>c-myc </italic>expression was found to be downregulated by ESAT-6 compared to LPS stimulation alone. Again treatment with ESAT-6 along with 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4 </sub>increased the level of <italic>c-myc </italic>compared to that observed with ESAT-6 alone while Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4 </sub>alone did not have any effect on <italic>c-myc </italic>levels. These results can be explained by the dampening of LPS-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the nucleus by ESAT-6. As noted above, treatment with Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4 </sub>along with ESAT-6 resulted in an increased level of ERK1/2 activation in the nucleus compared to ESAT-6 alone. This differential activation of ERK1/2 pathway resulted in differential <italic>c-myc </italic>expression. To further confirm the role of ERK1/2 pathway in <italic>c-myc </italic>expression, we determined <italic>c-myc </italic>expression in the presence of MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] along with Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4 </sub>and ESAT-6. PD98059 downregulated <italic>c-myc </italic>levels while SB203580 did not have any effect on <italic>c-myc </italic>levels. The activation of ERK1/2 pathway in nucleus upon treatment with Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4 </sub>and ESAT-6 was abrogated by PD98059 and hence <italic>c-myc </italic>levels were downregulated. Since SB203580 did not have any effect on <italic>c-myc </italic>expression, p38 MAP kinase was not involved in the gene expression. It confirmed the earlier observations of p38 phosphorylation from western blotting where there was no inhibition in p38 activation in cytoplasm or nucleus by ESAT-6.</p><p>Although there are reports that CFP-10 forms a 1:1 complex with ESAT-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]; however other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] have shown that there is discordance between secretion of CFP-10 and ESAT-6. Okkels and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] have shown that there are as many as 8 different forms of ESAT-6 and that the acetylation of ESAT-6 was required for complexation with CFP-10. Another study has shown that ESAT-6 as well as the CFP-10:ESAT-6 complex inhibited the PI-3 kinase-Akt signaling, indicating that the active component involved in downregulating the macrophage signaling was the ESAT-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Our studies with CFP-10 and CFP-10:ESAT-6 complex did not show any inhibition of the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cytoplasm or nucleus of the RAW264.7 cells (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). It has also been shown that ESAT-6 binds to the Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2) and not TLR-4 on the surface of RAW264.7 macrophages, and causes inhibition of activation of transcription factors NF-&#x003ba;B and Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) through the Akt kinase pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Our studies suggest yet another mechanism, <italic>viz</italic>., modulation of the ERK arm of the MAP kinase pathway, by which ESAT-6 could bring about deactivation of the host cell.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has shown that mycobacterial secretory protein ESAT-6 could inhibit ERK1/2 activation in the nucleus of RAW264.7 cells. This inhibition resulted in downregulation of LPS-induced ERK1/2 activation in the nucleus and subsequent expression of c-Myc, a key factor in macrophage activation. These findings underline the role of ESAT-6 in deactivation of the macrophage, the host cell for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and Antibodies</title><p>Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and p-nitro phenylphosphate (p-NPP) and other fine chemicals were obtained from Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA.
