Metastasis is the primary cause of breast cancer mortality. The 5-year survival rate for women diagnosed with localized breast cancer is 98%, which contrasts dramatically with the 27% survival rate of women diagnosed with distant metastasis breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] (data based on the November 2006 SEER data submission, posted to the SEER Okay web site in 2007. Development of effective chemopreventive and therapeutic strategies for metastatic disease is urgently needed.</p><p>The free radical nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in regulating tumor growth and metastasis. The amount of NO produced depends on the expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms. NOSI and NOSIII are expressed constitutively and produce trace amounts of NO. NOSII is the inducible isoform and can generate large amounts of NO.</p><p>Low concentrations of NOSIII-derived NO promoted the growth, invasion, and metastasis of murine mammary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In contrast, high levels of NOSII-mediated NO have been shown to suppress tumorigenesis and metastasis <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. EMT-6J murine breast carcinoma cells, which constitutively expressed inducible NOSII and secreted high levels of NO, had a lower metastatic potential than NOSII-deficient EMT-6H cells when injected into mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. EMT-6H cells induced the formation of numerous metastases in the lungs of all the injected mice, while the number of mice with lung metastases and the number of metastases per lung were lower in the EMT-6J group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Similarly, pancreatic cells transduced with wild-type <italic>NOSII </italic>suppressed tumor growth and distant metastasis to the liver in an orthotopic xenograft model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>We previously demonstrated that breast cancer cells possess intrinsic resistance mechanisms that can prevent the induction of NOSII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; any chemopreventive or therapeutic strategy designed to produce high NO levels in such cells should therefore not depend on NOSII induction. Given the suppressive effects of high levels of NO on tumorigenesis and metastasis, drugs that supply NO exogenously could have potential in breast cancer therapy and chemoprevention. The challenge is to deliver NO in a sustained and controlled manner.</p><p>NO donors that spontaneously generate large amounts of NO independent of NOSII induction are activated at physiological pH and can induce NO-mediated systemic hypotension. NO prodrugs are another type of NOSII-independent NO-releasing agent. NO prodrugs do not release NO spontaneously, but rather can be activated to generate high concentrations of NO upon metabolism by intracellular enzyme targets. Arylated diazeniumdiolates have been designed to be activated for NO release by reaction with glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). GSTs are a superfamily of enzymes that detoxify xenobiotics by conjugating them to glutathione and increasing their cellular excretion. Among the major isoforms (&#x003b1;, &#x003bc;, &#x003c0;), GST-&#x003c0; is expressed at the highest concentration in breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The expression of GST-&#x003c0; is associated with more aggressive tumors, poor prognosis, increased risk of relapse, and decreased disease-free survival in breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>O<sup>2</sup>-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) 1- [(4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (JS-K), a diazeniumdiolate activated to release high levels of NO by GST enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], has been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Whether JS-K can suppress cancer invasion, however, is not known. In the present article we report the novel findings that JS-K inhibits the invasive activity of breast cancer cells across the Matrigel basement membrane at doses by which JS-K was not cytotoxic, and that increasing TIMP-2 production is one mechanism by which JS-K mediates its anti-invasive effects. The results presented here have a bearing on the potential for NO prodrugs to be used in the prevention and therapy of metastatic breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Matrigel and type I collagen were purchased from BD Biosciences (Bedford, MA, USA) and Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co (St. Louis, MO, USA), respectively.

A type I collagen invasion assay was performed to determine whether JS-K may inhibit the invasiveness of breast cancer cells across the bone matrix. The conditions for the collagen invasion assay were identical to those of the Matrigel invasion assay, except that type I collagen was used to coat the transwell insert. The MDA-MB-231 and F10 cells displayed a high invasive capacity on type I collagen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>), but MCF-7/COX-2 cells did not (data not shown). JS-K did not reduce the invasiveness of breast cancer cells across type I collagen-coated insert (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>).

In contrast, TIMPs regulate the activity of MMPs and protect the basement membrane from proteolysis. A human MMP array was performed to screen the effects of JS-K on MMP and TIMP production. The array profiles for JS-43-126-treated cells were similar to those of untreated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). In contrast, the most consistent effect observed in the arrays of the three cell lines as a result of JS-K treatment was an increase in the production of TIMP-2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). To confirm the JS-K-mediated increase in TIMP-2 levels that were observed in the MMP arrays, TIMP-2 ELISAs were performed.
