We recently used admixture mapping to identify an approximately 1-megabase region on chromosome 1, where ancestry status (African or European) almost entirely accounted for the difference in WBC between African Americans and European Americans. To identify the specific genetic change responsible for this association, we analyzed genotype and phenotype data from 6,005 African Americans from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study, and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. We demonstrate that the causal variant must be at least 91&#x00025; different in frequency between West Africans and European Americans. An excellent candidate is the Duffy Null polymorphism (SNP rs2814778 at chromosome 1q23.2), which is the only polymorphism in the region known to be so differentiated in frequency and is already known to protect against <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> malaria. We confirm that rs2814778 is predictive of WBC and neutrophil count in African Americans above beyond the previously described admixture association (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3.8&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>), establishing a novel phenotype for this genetic variant.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Many African Americans have white blood cell counts (WBC) that are persistently below the normal range for people of European descent, a condition called &#x0201c;benign ethnic neutropenia.&#x0201d; Because most African Americans have both African and European ancestors, selected genetic variants can be analyzed to assign probable African or European origin to each region of each such person's chromosomes. Previously, we found a region on chromosome 1 where increased local African ancestry completely accounted for differences in WBC between African and European Americans, suggesting the presence of an African-derived variant causing low WBC. Here, we show that low neutrophil count is predominantly responsible for low WBC; that a dominant, European-derived allele contributes to high neutrophil count; and that the frequency of this allele differs in Africans and Europeans by &#x0003e;91&#x00025;. Across the chromosome 1 locus, only the well-characterized &#x0201c;Duffy&#x0201d; polymorphism was this differentiated. Neutrophil count was more strongly associated to the Duffy variant than to ancestry, suggesting that the variant itself causes benign ethnic neutropenia. The African, or &#x0201c;null,&#x0201d; form of this variant abolishes expression of the &#x0201c;Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines&#x0201d; on red blood cells, perhaps altering the concentrations and distribution of chemokines that regulate neutrophil production or migration.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A large proportion of healthy African Americans have been observed to have a white blood cell count (WBC) that is persistently lower than the normal range defined for individuals of European ancestry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-Forbes1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-Haddy1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. This condition, called &#x0201c;benign ethnic neutropenia&#x0201d;, can have important effects on medical decision-making, since WBC is a valuable indicator of immunocompetence, infection, and inflammation. To seek the genetic basis of benign ethnic neutropenia, we recently carried out an admixture mapping analysis in which we identified a locus on chromosome 1 where local inheritance of African or European ancestry is sufficient to account entirely for the epidemiological differences in WBC levels between African Americans and European Americans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-Nalls1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. By genotyping samples from two epidemiological cohorts&#x02014;the Health Aging and Body Composition Study (Health ABC) and the Jackson Heart Study (JHS)&#x02014;at a panel of markers that were extremely differentiated in frequency between Africans and Europeans, we identified an approximately 900 kilobase locus on chromosome 1 (99&#x00025; credible interval of 155.46&#x02013;156.36 Mb) where individuals with low WBC had increased African ancestry compared with the average in the genome.</p><p>In the present study, we narrowed the region of association from 900 kb to a single base pair substitution that is likely to have a strong effect on variation in WBC. To achieve this, we increased our sample size from 1,550 in the initial study to 6,005, by pooling samples from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), the Health ABC Study, and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. We found that neutrophil count is responsible for the vast majority of the WBC association at the locus, and therefore focused on neutrophil count in the current analysis. We also showed that the genetic change that is probably responsible is the Duffy Null polymorphism (rs2814778, also called <italic>FY&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</italic>), which is already known to protect individuals of African descent against <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> malaria infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-Miller1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-Horuk1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, and which has recently been associated with susceptibility to HIV infection and rate of progression to AIDS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-He1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Our identification of this polymorphism as the probable cause of benign ethnic neutropenia should prompt further investigation of its effects on hematopoiesis and immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Merging Samples across the JHS, ARIC, and Health ABC Studies</title><p>We pooled 6,005 African American samples from three cohort studies: the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), the Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, and the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study. For each sample, we required a high quality genome-wide admixture scan (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), a genotype at SNP rs2814778, body mass index (BMI), age, gender, and a full differential white blood cell count (with the exception that for Health ABC samples we did not require a measurement of bands).</p><p>To explore correlations between the genetics and the phenotype, we first used the genotype at SNP rs2814778, which occurs at position 155,987,755 in Build 35 of the human genome reference sequence, within the 99&#x00025; credible interval defined by our previous admixture mapping study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-Nalls1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

Later, we demonstrate that there is in fact a slightly stronger association to neutrophil count for rs2814778 than for ancestry, which is important in showing that the <italic>FY&#x02212;</italic> allele at this polymorphism may actually be responsible for low neutrophil counts, and is not just in admixture linkage disequilibrium with the causal allele.</p><fig id="pgen-1000360-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000360.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Relationship between ancestry and the distribution of neutrophil count.</title><p>(A) Distribution of normally transformed absolute neutrophil count for the three classes of genotype at rs2814778.

We found that all sets of samples showed quantitatively similar associations to the chromosome 1 locus. In particular, for neutrophil count, individuals carrying at least one European-type (&#x0201c;<italic>FY</italic>&#x0002b;&#x0201d;) allele of rs2814778 had 1.58&#x02013;1.65 times higher values, depending on the study, than individuals homozygous for African ancestry (<italic>FY&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic>), a tight enough range that we decided to pool all four groups of samples for subsequent analyses. Despite the similar correlation of neutrophil count to local ancestry across studies, we observed that the correlation coefficient to &#x0201c;European carrier status&#x0201d; was significantly higher for JHS-ARIC overlap samples, &#x003c1;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.57, than for the samples for which only one measurement was made: &#x003c1;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.52 for JHS-only (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.03 for a reduction) and &#x003c1;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.50 for ARIC-only (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.002 for a reduction) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000360-t001">Table 1</xref>). This is likely to reflect a more accurate assessment of basal neutrophil count when it was measured twice and averaged over different environmental conditions (the baseline measurements in JHS and ARIC studies taken an average of 14 years apart) than when it was measured only once. In support of this hypothesis, the JHS-ARIC overlap samples contributed more per sample to the statistical signal than those measured in only one cohort: 28&#x00025; more per sample on average, which we calculated by dividing the LOD score they contributed by the total number of samples.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Dominant Effect of European Ancestry on WBC Counts</title><p>Combining all samples (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6,005 in total) and working with normally transformed cell counts for each white blood cell lineage (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) we explored how counts of total WBC and each of the 6 differential counts were associated with ancestry at the locus, using the genotype at rs2814778 as a surrogate for ancestry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000360-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>There was strong evidence that the allele at the locus that contributed to high white blood cell count had an almost purely dominant effect.

The correlation (&#x003c1;) of normally transformed absolute neutrophil count to carrier status for the <italic>FY</italic>&#x0002b; allele was 0.519, which was higher than that of the general WBC phenotype originally mapped to the locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-Nalls1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> (&#x003c1;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.458).

After controlling for neutrophil count in a regression analysis, only monocyte count (&#x003c1;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.025, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.05) and basophil count (&#x003c1;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.034, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.009) remained nominally associated, and these associations were not significant after correcting for the 6 hypotheses tested (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000360-t002">Table 2</xref>). The weak evidence of association to monocyte and basophil counts may reflect a real effect, or may be a false-positive due to multiple hypothesis testing. It is also possible that the result may be an experimental artifact related to the Coulter Counter technology used to measure differential WBC. In these measurements, the positions of monocytes and basophils were near those of neutrophils in the plots used for cell classification. Even a small amount of misclassification among neutrophils, monocytes, and basophils (a couple of percent) could cause their counts to be artifactually correlated, contributing to the signals we observe in the context of measurements in large sample sizes. Since neutrophil count appears to drive at least the great majority of association, we focused on this WBC phenotype for all further analysis</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Epidemiological Impact of the Chromosome 1 Locus on Neutrophil Count</title><p>To assess whether the higher neutrophil count observed in European Americans compared with African Americans can be entirely accounted for by ancestry at the chromosome 1 locus, as is the case with total WBC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-Nalls1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, we examined samples from the Health ABC study (1,331 European Americans and 658 African Americans). Among African Americans who could be classified with confidence as carrying at least one chromosome of European ancestry at the locus, the absolute neutrophil count did not differ from that of European Americans (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.99). Thus, genetic variation at the chromosome 1 locus was sufficient to account for the entire epidemiological difference across these populations.</p><p>The predictive effect of ancestry at the chromosome 1 locus was profound. Carrier status for the European-type (<italic>FY</italic>&#x0002b;) allele at the rs2814778 variant predicted 26.95&#x00025; of the variance in normally transformed neutrophil count, which was far more than the 3.37&#x00025; predicted by genome-wide European ancestry proportion. After controlling for rs2814778 genotype, there was no longer any association to genome-wide European ancestry. Similarly, after controlling for rs2814778 genotype, BMI and gender only predicted 0.79&#x00025; and 0.14&#x00025; of variance in neutrophil count respectively, while smoking (analyzed in JHS only) only predicted 0.8&#x00025; of the variance. Age was not significantly associated to neutrophil count in our data (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.25). We did not analyze other phenotypes like hypertension and coronary artery disease status for their correlation to neutrophil count. Because of the relatively weak contributions of all the non-genetic predictors we analyzed, we focused subsequent analyses on genotype at the chromosome 1 locus uncorrected for covariates.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The Causal Allele must be &#x0003e;91&#x00025; Differentiated between Africans and Europeans</title><p>We were able to place strong constraints on the frequency of the variant affecting neutrophil count by analyzing the distributions of neutrophil count for individuals with 0, 1 and 2 copies of European ancestry at the chromosome 1 locus, which in practice we marked by the genotype at rs2814778.

Of the 817 SNPs we identified, 594 could be ruled out as not completely differentiated in frequency between the European and African chromosomes used in SNP discovery, an additional 79 could be ruled out as not sufficiently differentiated across populations based on data from the International Haplotype Map database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-Frazer1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and 49 could be ruled out by their allele frequencies in our own follow-up genotyping of HapMap samples. Thus, 88.5&#x00025; (&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;(594&#x0002b;79&#x0002b;49)/817) of SNPs discovered in the admixture peak could be ruled out. This allowed us to infer that 72.8&#x00025; (&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;82.3&#x00025;&#x000d7;88.5&#x00025;) of nucleotides can be excluded as causal for the observed major effect on variation in neutrophil count.</p><p>These results provide yet another line of evidence that the rs2814778 single nucleotide change may itself be causing low neutrophil levels. There are now five reasons why we believe rs2814778 is likely to be the direct cause for low neutrophil count: (1) rs2814478 falls within the &#x0223c;450 kilobase admixture peak. (2) rs2814778 contributes a signal of association above and beyond the admixture signal, showing that the true underlying causal variant is in an even narrower region around rs2814478. (3) rs2814778 is already known to have functional consequences, based for example on past molecular work showing that it affects expression of an antigen on red blood cells and thus modulates resistance to <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria. (4) rs2814778 is known to have a frequency differentiation across populations that makes it consistent with the underlying causal variant; a degree of differentiation that is extremely unusual, with only 0.003&#x00025; of known SNPs in the genome having a differentiation this extreme. (5) Genome sequencing data directly rule out about three quarters of other nucleotides in the admixture peak as containing the variant. (We have not carried out a similar analysis of insertion/deletion polymorphisms, which are known to occur at about a tenth the rate of SNPs.)</p><p>We caution that an association study is always correlational, and can never by itself prove a functional effect of an allele. To prove causality, it is essential to follow up any association study with biological work. Nevertheless, the present study provides the best example of which we are aware of taking association analysis to its limit, and using association analysis to demonstrate a likely causal effect. Our study justifies further work to understand the biological mechanism by which a single nucleotide change at rs2814778 probably causes reduced neutrophil counts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have used admixture mapping to localize a variant affecting neutrophil levels to a region of about 450 kb centered on the Duffy null locus. We have further shown that the underlying variant must be &#x0003e;91&#x00025; different in frequency between West Africans and European Americans, placing it among the top 115 HapMap SNPs in the genome in terms of allele frequency differentiation (top 0.003&#x00025;). Since only one SNP in the admixture peak, the Duffy null polymorphism rs2814778, is known to be this differentiated in frequency across populations, we tested this SNP for evidence of association above and beyond the ancestry effect, and found a signal (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3.8&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>). Finally, we ruled out the great majority of nucleotides across the region, apart from rs2814778, as sufficient to cause the signal.</p><p>Methodologically, these results provide a case-example of fine-mapping in a difficult context. We have moved from an initial association signal discovered via mapping by admixture linkage disequilibrium, to a more fine-grained association based on linkage disequilibrium inherited from the ancestral African and European populations, and finally to an analysis where we systematically excluded the great majority of nucleotides in the region as contributing to the association.</p><p>The study is also novel in demonstrating the value of mapping in multi-ethnic and admixed populations. The variant could not have been mapped in non-African Americans (either Africans or Europeans), since it is nearly fixed in both populations, showing how studying diverse populations is important in biology. For example, when we genotyped rs2814778 in more than 10,000 European Americans from the ARIC study, we could not obtain a replication despite the large sample size.</p><p>The mechanism of low neutrophil count in persons homozygous for the <italic>FY</italic>&#x02212; allele is unknown.

The term &#x0201c;ethnic neutropenia&#x0201d; has been applied to persistently low neutrophil count in both Yemenite Jews and in populations of African ancestry, and the condition is clinically similar in these two populations.

Exercise-induced increments in neutrophil counts (demargination) are also smaller in persons with &#x0201c;ethnic neutropenia&#x0201d; than in healthy volunteers.

First, we recorded whether the individual was a carrier of the <italic>FY&#x0002b;</italic> &#x0201c;functional&#x0201d; allele (&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1) at rs2814778, or was homozygous for the <italic>FY&#x02212;</italic> &#x0201c;null&#x0201d; allele (&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0) (homozygosity for the &#x0201c;null&#x0201d; allele abolishes expression of the Duffy antigen on red blood cells but not on other cell types). Second, we used the ANCESTRYMAP software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-Patterson1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> to estimate the probability that in the region spanning this SNP, at least one of the individual's chromosomes was of European ancestral origin. Importantly, we included the genotype of rs2814778 in the ancestry estimation. Thus, if neutrophil count were better correlated to rs2814778 genotype than to an ancestry estimate that included information from both rs2814778 and closely neighboring SNPs, it would indicate that the neighboring SNPs did not add relevant information, and that rs2814778 is either the causal variant or is in strong LD with the causal variant.</p><p>To determine whether genotype at rs2814778 or ancestry at the chromosome 1 locus was the better predictor of neutrophil status, we carried out three regressions:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>We regressed the genotype of the Duffy functional allele at rs2814778 to neutrophil count under a dominant model and calculated a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> statistic.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We regressed inferred European ancestry at the chromosome 1 locus to neutrophil count using a dominant model and calculated a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> statistic.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We regressed both predictors together to neutrophil count and calculated a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> statistic.</p></list-item></list><p>To test for evidence of an association of the genotype at rs2814778 above and beyond ancestry, we subtracted the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> statistics of (c)-(b).

To select cases and controls for fine-mapping, we identified individuals from JHS for whom we were &#x0003e;99&#x00025; confident of African ancestry on both chromosomes at the admixture peak. By limiting cases and controls to persons with more confident estimates of entirely African local ancestry, it was easier to detect whether any signal of association was significant above and beyond the admixture association. For this analysis, the estimate of ancestry at the admixture peak using ANCESTRYMAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-Patterson1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> excluded SNPs within the peak.</p><p>Among individuals who had &#x0003e;99&#x00025; confidence of entirely African ancestry at the locus, we identified 696 individuals who had a &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; neutrophil count, defined based on visual inspection of the distribution as an absolute count of &#x0003c;2,100/mm<sup>3</sup> (and corresponding to &#x0003c;0.7 s.d. below the population mean for the entire JHS sample). We also identified 77 individuals who had a &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; neutrophil count, defined as an absolute count of 5,100/mm<sup>3</sup>&#x02013;9,100/mm<sup>3</sup> (1.3&#x02013;2.8 s.d. above the population mean). For genotyping, we selected a random subset of individuals with &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; neutrophil count, and all of the individuals with &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; neutrophil count. We successfully genotyped 148 subjects with low and 74 subjects with high neutrophil count that we could use in this analysis.</p><p>To identify additional SNPs across the admixture peak that might be associated with neutrophil levels, we used the Tagger software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-deBakker1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> to choose a panel of SNPs from the International Haplotype Map database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-Frazer1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> that captured all SNPs of &#x0003e;5&#x00025; minor allele frequency in West African samples with a correlation of r<sup>2</sup>&#x0003e;0.8. Forcing these SNPs into the analysis, we chose additional SNPs across the region until we had similarly captured all SNPs in European Americans with &#x0003e;5&#x00025; minor allele frequency. All SNPs identified in this way were selected for genotyping on the Sequenom iPLEX platform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-Tang1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Cases and controls were successfully genotyped at a densely spaced panel of 193 tag SNPs across the &#x0223c;450 kilobase admixture peak. Each SNP was tested using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> statistic assuming an additive effect on neutrophil count for each additional copy of the allele. We did not test a dominant or recessive model because none of the genotyped SNPs (apart from rs2814778) had a frequency differentiation across populations consistent with that SNP explaining the admixture signal (and thus being the main effect SNP; see above). We chose an additive model to search for variants that might modulate the neutrophil count beyond the main effect because it is known that for substantial minor allele frequencies this provides reasonable power to detect an association, whether the true underlying effect is dominant, additive, or recessive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000360-Lettre1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Analysis of Shotgun Sequencing Data to Rule out the Great Majority of Nucleotides in the Admixture Peak as Containing the Causal Allele</title><p>While we found that rs2814778 was more predictive of neutrophil count than ancestry, we were concerned that the variant might not itself be causal, but instead only in LD with the causal variant. To search for additional candidate SNPs in the region that are highly different in frequency between Africans and Europeans, we examined shotgun genome sequence data derived from public databases, from 6 individuals who were known to have West African ancestry across the region (NA18507, NA18517, NA19129, NA19240, NA17109 and NA17119), and 5 individuals who were known to have European ancestry across the region (NA12156, NA12878, NA07340, HuAA and HuBB).

At sites where we had more than 1&#x000d7; coverage, we randomly sampled one sequence to represent the individual.</p><p>To determine the ancestry of the human genome reference sequence across the admixture peak, we first observed that it was spanned by a mosaic of 5 fully sequenced Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BACs), each representing a clone of 86,000&#x02013;196,000 base pairs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>). The problem of determining ancestry of the human reference sequence across the region thus amounts to determining the ancestry of each of the clones separately. To do this, we obtained the allele of the human genome reference sequence at each of 284 HapMap SNPs across the region that had been genotyped in both West Africans and European Americans. For each window of 8 consecutive SNPs in HapMap, we calculated the likelihood that the human reference sequence was of African or European ancestry. To determine this likelihood empirically, we compared the findings to 120 phased European chromosomes and 120 phased African chromosomes from the HapMap database, counting the number of matches to the human reference sequence in each population over that window. We conservatively added 1 to the counts of the tested haplotype for each population to preclude an estimate of zero probability for either population. Under the assumption that only European and African ancestry were possible, the results showed with confidence that 3 of the clones were of European ancestry and 2 were of African ancestry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000360-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the participants in the JHS, Health ABC, and ARIC studies, as well as the staff of all three studies.
