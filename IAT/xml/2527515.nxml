Forty-five neonates developed BPD. Nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were sought in the MMP2, MMP14 and MMP16 genes. After adjustment for birth weight and ethnic origin, the TT genotype of MMP16 C/T (rs2664352) and the GG genotype of MMP16 A/G (rs2664349) were found to protect from BPD. These genotypes were also associated with a smaller active fraction of MMP2 and with a 3-fold-lower MMP16 protein level in tracheal aspirates collected within 3 days after birth. Further evaluation of MMP16 expression during the course of normal human and rat lung development showed relatively low expression during the canalicular and saccular stages and a clear increase in both mRNA and protein levels during the alveolar stage. In two newborn rat models of arrested alveolarization the lung MMP16 mRNA level was less than 50&#x00025; of normal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>MMP16 may be involved in the development of lung alveoli.

BPD appears to result from arrested lung development and is characterized by abnormal alveolar septation and abnormal microvascular maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Jobe1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Alveolarization requires coordination of extracellular matrix remodeling with epithelial morphogenesis and capillary growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Greenlee1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. This process involves matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are classified into two major groups according to their subcellular localization: membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs) and secreted MMPs. Among secreted MMPs, MMP2 is known to play a key role in lung development and repair after injury. Mice lacking this proteinase show delayed alveolar development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Kheradmand1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, and low MMP2 levels in tracheal effluent and plasma have been linked to an increased risk of BPD in infants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Danan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Schulz1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Type I transmembrane MT-MMPs participate in the activation of the zymogen form of MMP2 (pro-MMP2). Among these, MT1-MMP (MMP14) has a major role in alveolarization. We recently observed a fourfold increase in MMP14 transcripts in lung fibroblasts during alveolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Boucherat1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, while mice lacking this enzyme have a reduced alveolar surface area and enlarged air spaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Atkinson1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Oblander1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, although this seems partly independent of the ability of MMP14 to activate MMP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Oblander1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. MT3-MMP (MMP16) was originally cloned from a human placental cDNA library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Takino1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Although its role in lung development has not previously been studied, its ability to localize on the cell membrane and to activate pro-MMP2 has been clearly demonstrated. MMP16 is also known to have a splice variant, consisting of a soluble form lacking the transmembrane domain. This soluble form can also activate pro-MMP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Matsumoto1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although exposure of the immature lung to various insults is thought to play a central role in the onset of BPD, significant genetic susceptibility to BPD was recently demonstrated in preterm infants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Bhandari1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Hereditary differences in the expression of genes critical for lung development may therefore have a role in BPD pathogenesis. We postulated that polymorphisms in MMP genes might affect MMP function in preterm lung and thereby influence the risk of BPD at a given gestational age. Indeed, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of the MMP2 gene (&#x02212;1306 C/T) modulates the promoter activity of MMP2 and has functional significance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Price1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, a haplotype of four MMP14 polymorphisms (&#x02212;130 T: &#x0002b;256 T: &#x0002b;6762 C: &#x0002b;7131 C) has been linked to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Saitoh1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, the MMP16 splice variant might potentially be generated by polymorphism of the gene region coding for the hemopexin domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Matsumoto1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our initial aim in this study was to examine whether any of nine SNPs in the MMP2, MMP14, and MMP16 genes was associated with BPD in premature infants, and with the level of MMP2 activity in tracheal effluents. As we found a significant association with two SNPs in the MMP16 gene, we further examined the expression of this enzyme during normal human and rat lung development, and in newborn rat models of arrested alveolar development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population</title><p>Two hundred and eighty-four neonates with a gestational age of &#x0003c;28 weeks were included from two neonatal intensive care units (Creteil and Cochin-Port Royal) between March 2002 and December 2006.

Perinatal factors susceptible to influence the risk for BPD were collected: bacteriologically proven maternofetal infection ; antenatal steroid therapy ; histologically defined chorioamnionitis ; persistent ductus arteriosus requiring medical or surgical treatment ; bacteriologically proven postnatal sepsis ; air leaks. The duration of ventilation support was not analyzed because of evolving strategies over study time.

The penultimate nucleotide of the reverse primer was modified (G replaced by <bold>C</bold>) in order to create a restriction site for Bfa1. PCR was carried out in a 50-&#x000b5;L volume containing 200 ng of genomic DNA, 5 &#x000b5;L of 10&#x000d7; PCR Rxn Buffer (Invitrogen), 2 &#x000b5;L of 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Invitrogen), 1 &#x000b5;L of nucleotide mix (dNTP 10 mM, Invitrogen), 13 pmol of forward and reverse primer and 1.5 units of Taq polymerase (Recombinant Taq DNA Polymerase, Invitrogen). The thermal cycling conditions were 94&#x000b0;C for 5 min, 37 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 59&#x000b0;C for 1 min and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min, then 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Enzymatic digestion was carried out in a 20-&#x000b5;L volume containing 3 &#x000b5;L of PCR product, 7.5 units of Bfa1 (New England Biolabs) and 2 &#x000b5;L of 1&#x000d7; Nebbuffer 4 (New England Biolabs). This mix was then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 hours. The size and number of the different fragments were determined by electrophoretic migration on ethidium bromide-stained 3&#x00025; agarose gel. We expected to obtain one 188-bp fragment for the CC genotype, two fragments (162 and 26 bp) for the TT genotype, and three fragments (188, 162 and 26 bp) for the CT genotype.</p><p>The &#x0002b;6762 C/G, &#x0002b;6802 G/A, &#x0002b;6926 C/T and &#x0002b;7131 T/C genotypes were determined by PCR followed by DNA sequencing.

The thermal cycling conditions were 96&#x000b0;C for 2 min, then 25 cycles of 96&#x000b0;C for 10 sec, 55&#x000b0;C for 5 sec and 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min. Sequencing was performed by the Molecular Medicine Unit of Henri Mondor Hospital (IM3). Sequences were read in our laboratory with Chromas Pro 1.34 software.</p><p>Genotype analysis of &#x02212;129 G/T, &#x0002b;256 T/C, rs2664349 A/G and rs2664352 C/T was performed with allele-specific fluorogenic probes and the TaqMan&#x000ae; technique. Primers and probes were designed and synthesized by Applied Biosystems and provided as an SNP Genotyping Assay Mix specific for each SNP. Probes were labeled with the fluorophores, 6-carbofluorescein (FAM) or VIC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003188-t001">Table 1</xref>), and were minor groove binder (MGB) probes. PCR was carried out in a 20-&#x000b5;L volume containing 10 ng of genomic DNA, 10 &#x000b5;L of TaqMan&#x000ae; Genotyping Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 1 &#x000b5;L of TaqMan&#x000ae; SNP Genotyping Assay Mix 20&#x000d7; (Applied Biosystems).

Realtime PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7000 (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) using the following protocol: initial denaturation (10 min at 95&#x000b0;C), then two-step amplification program (15 s at 95&#x000b0;C followed by 1 min at 60&#x000b0;C) repeated 40 times. Melt curve analysis was used to check that a single specific amplified product was generated. Reaction mixtures consisted of 25 ng cDNA, SYBR Green 2&#x000d7; PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and forward (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GAAGAAGCCTCGATGTGGTGTAC-3&#x02032;</named-content>) and reverse primers (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CTTCTGCCCAGTTAATGCATAGC-3&#x02032;</named-content>) in a reaction volume of 25 &#x000b5;l. Primers were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Real-time quantification was performed by measuring the increase in fluorescence caused by the binding of SYBR Green dye to double-stranded DNA at the end of each amplification cycle. Relative expression was determined by using the &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct (threshold cycle) method for normalized samples (&#x00394;Ct) relative to a calibrator sample, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each PCR run included a no-template control and a sample without reverse transcriptase. All measurements were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To test whether the genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we compared the observed genotype frequencies with their expected frequencies at equilibrium, based on the Chi2 test. Odds ratios (Ors) and p values adjusted for birth weight and ethnic origin, obtained by logistic regression, were calculated to test the association between the genotypes and BPD. Differences between treatment groups in animal studies were evaluated with the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test for multiple group comparisons, and the Mann-Whitney U test for two-group comparisons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study population</title><p>All infants were inborn, and received prophylactic surfactant in the delivery room. Of the 284 neonates initially enrolled, 21 died before 36 weeks PMA and were not included in the analysis. Death was mainly due to severe neurological or infectious complications. Among survivors, 48&#x00025; had histologically defined chorioamnionitis, 8&#x00025; had bacteriologically proven maternofetal infection, 76&#x00025; received medical treatment for persistent ductus arteriosus, 16&#x00025; had bacteriologically proven postnatal sepsis, and only one had air leak. Ninety-two percent of mothers had received partial or complete steroid treatment before delivery. Forty-five (17&#x00025;) of the other 263 infants still needed oxygen supplementation at 36 weeks PMA and were thus diagnosed with BPD. As expected, the risk for BPD was significantly associated with birthweight, persistent ductus arteriosus, postnatal sepsis, and chorioamnionitis in univariate analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003188-t002">Table 2</xref>).

We found a significant association between two SNPs in the MMP16 gene and BPD outcome, even after adjustment for birth weight and ethnic origin. The MMP16 genotype also influenced the size of the activated MMP2 fraction in the infants' tracheal aspirates. In addition, MMP16 gene expression was high during normal newborn rat lung alveolarization, and was markedly reduced by insults that arrested alveolarization.</p><p>Heterogeneous management of preterm infants hampers genetic analyses. Indeed, the frequency of BPD varies widely among neonatal intensive care units, underlining the role of environmental factors. The prospective nature of our study helped to ensure that newborns who did and did not subsequently develop BPD received similar initial management. The rate of BPD was low (17&#x00025;), reflecting good control of external insults. Furthermore, oxygen dependency at a postmenstrual age of 36 weeks was diagnosed with a validated test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Walsh1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>No association was found between the risk of BPD and SNPs in the MMP2 or MMP14 gene.

In the present study, MMP2 content and activity were measured in tracheal effluents. The main finding was the association between the risk of BPD and the proportion of the activated fraction of MMP2. Relative to infants who did not develop BPD, infants who developed BPD had a significantly smaller fraction of active MMP2 at birth, but a larger fraction at the second sampling time. These results support our previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Danan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. They are also in keeping with the early increase in the active MMP2 fraction previously observed in the lungs of newborn rats exposed to hyperoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Buckley1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. However, contrary to our previous findings, total MMP2 activity did not differ on day 0 between neonates who subsequently developed BPD and those who did not in this study. Differences in the study populations might account for this apparent discrepancy. In the present study the neonates were more premature, were all sampled within minutes after birth, and all received prophylactic surfactant administration. No association was found between the MMP2 and MMP14 genotypes and MMP2 levels in tracheal aspirates. By contrast, the MMP16 genotype was associated both with the risk of BPD and with the level of MMP2 activity in tracheal aspirates. In keeping with our observation that BPD was associated with an elevated active fraction of MMP2, the MMP16 genotypes associated with a lower risk of BPD, i.e. GG and TT, were also associated with lower active fractions of MMP2.</p><p>MMP16, also called MT3-MMP, is very similar to MMP14 in both structure and function. It is present in membranes as an active 65-kD form, and has recently been shown to be shed in a 32- to 35-kD soluble form that retains its ability to activate MMP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Zhao1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. A 45-kD soluble form of MMP16 has also been suggested to be formed by alternative splicing of mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Matsumoto1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, the splicing point potentially lying in the hemopexin-like domain. It was recently suggested that the two forms of this protein could play distinct roles during embryogenesis. Indeed, Xenopus laevis embryos injected with full-length MMP16 mRNA showed no significant changes in the expression levels of the tissue-specific genes encoding endodermin, chordin and muscle actin, whereas mRNA for the soluble form of MMP16 reduced the expression of all three marker genes. In addition, while full-length tethered MMP16 failed to alter gelatinase activity, a 50&#x00025; increase occurred after injection of the soluble form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Walsh2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. MMP16 was recently shown to act as a major collagenolytic enzyme in bone and cartilage during mammalian embryogenesis, with MMP16-deficient mice displaying delayed skeletal growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Shi1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Although no genotype-related abnormality is reported in lungs of adult mutant mice in the international database resource for the laboratory mouse (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/external/ko/deltagen/1241.html">http://www.informatics.jax.org/external/ko/deltagen/1241.html</ext-link>), lung development was not extensively studied in these mice. MMP16 is known to be expressed in the human lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Takino1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Its role is largely obscure, but it has been implicated in disease processes such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-GarciaAlvarez1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study is therefore the first to provide strong evidence of MMP16 participation in normal and abnormal lung development, in both newborn rats and premature infants. In newborn rats, lung MMP16 gene expression is low during the canalicular and saccular stages, and increases significantly very close to the beginning of alveolarization, i.e. postnatal day 4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Burri1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Then, lung MMP16 gene expression peaks on day 14 and remains elevated until day 24 of life, before falling to very low levels in adulthood. MMP16 protein expression in rat lung ran parallel to MMP16 gene expression, with a gradual increase in both the presumed transmembrane and soluble forms during alveolarization, and strong expression on day 21. The results we obtained with homogenates of normal human fetus lungs sampled at various stages were concordant with the results we obtained in rats. We observed a clear increase in the expression of the presumed soluble form as early as 30 weeks of human pregnancy, i.e. just before the beginning of alveolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Burri1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Although these observations were gained from tissues collected postmortem, these samples have previously been proven suitable for evidencing developmental changes as well as differences between normal and diseased lungs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Boucherat2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Boucherat4">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. We found that the pulmonary MMP16 expression profile differed from that of MMP14 in lung fibroblasts from newborn rats. MMP14 gene expression increased at the time of peak alveolarization but rapidly returned to the basal level as early as 16 days of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Boucherat1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Although MMP16 is closely related to MMP14 in terms of its molecular structure and tissue expression pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Takino1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Shi1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, differences in the expression profiles suggest that MMP16 is not merely functionally redundant to MMP14. Alveolarization takes place between days 4 and 21 in rats and comprises two successive steps, namely secondary alveolar septation from day 4 to day 14, and alveolar wall thinning with fusion of the initially double capillary layer into a single, central microvascular network from day 14 to 21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Burri1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. The different expression profiles of MMP14 and MMP16 suggest primary involvement of the former in the first step and of the latter in the whole process, including the second step.</p><p>The functional domains of MMP16 and MMP14 are not interchangeable for pro-MMP2 activation and collagenolysis, despite their similarities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Jiang1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. It was also shown recently that the collagenolytic activity of MMP16 is complementary to that of MMP14 in mice lacking both enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Shi1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Further evidence supporting the role of MMP16 as a significant controller of alveolar growth/maturation comes from its down-regulation in models of arrested of lung development. We found that hyperoxia and dexamethasone, both of which impair alveolarization, strongly reduced lung MMP16 gene expression in newborn rats. We also observed a significant association between two polymorphisms in the MMP16 gene and the risk of BPD in highly premature infants. Despite strong evidence of genetic susceptibility to BPD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Bhandari1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, only polymorphisms in the genes for glutathione-S-transferase-P1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Manar1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, surfactant protein-B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Rova1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, and TNF-a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Kazzi1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> have been identified as possible genetic determinants. The functionality of the two SNPs that we studied in the MMP16 gene remains to be determined. They were chosen because they are tags for a haplotype in a gene region that codes for the hemopexin-like domain and that might be alternatively spliced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Matsumoto1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The association we found between the infants' genotypes and both the MMP16 protein level and the size of the activated MMP2 fraction in tracheal aspirates strongly suggests that these polymorphisms have functional consequences, although no definitive proof is given that the changes in MMP16 are causative of reduced MMP2 activation.. The premature infants had a gestational age lower than 28 weeks, corresponding to the early saccular stage of lung development. We found that expression of the 45-kD soluble form of MM16 was low in human fetal lung tissue. The TT and GG genotypes were associated with a 3-fold lower 45-kD MMP16 protein content in tracheal aspirates collected within 3 days after birth, and with a smaller MMP2 active fraction, in keeping with experimental results linking expression of the soluble MMP16 form to the level of gelatinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003188-Walsh2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. These genotypes were also found to be associated with a significantly lower risk of BPD, suggesting that maintenance of the physiologically low expression of the 45-kD soluble MMP16 isoform at this stage of lung development protects against BPD. Apparent discrepancies between changes in MMP16 expression in BPD infants and changes in animal models of arrested alveolarization may be due to differences in time frame. Animal experiments are models of arrested alveolar septation, a stage associated to a strong physiological increase in MMP16 expression. Thus, in both BPD infants and animal models, altered distal lung development is associated to opposite changes in MMP16 expression as those normally observed in the corresponding lung development stage. It is also noteworthy that changes in protein expression in animal models were found significant only for the tissular 65 kD form. For evident reasons, we were not able to evaluate this tissular form in human prematures. Changes in balance between tissular and soluble forms may also contribute to lung growth disorders.</p><p>In conclusion, we identify MMP16 as a possible new regulator of lung alveolar development and provide evidence that MMP16 polymorphisms are associated with protection from bronchopulmonary dysplasia in highly premature infants.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
