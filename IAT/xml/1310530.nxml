The single mammalian progranulin gene encodes a glycoprotein precursor consisting of seven and one half tandemly repeated non-identical copies of the cystine-rich granulin motif. A genome-wide duplication event hypothesized to have occurred at the base of the teleost radiation predicts that mammalian progranulin may be represented by two co-orthologues in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The cDNAs encoding two zebrafish granulin precursors, progranulins-A and -B, were characterized and found to contain 10 and 9 copies of the granulin motif respectively. The cDNAs and genes encoding the two forms of granulin, progranulins-1 and -2, were also cloned and sequenced. Both latter peptides were found to be encoded by precursors with a simplified architecture consisting of one and one half copies of the granulin motif. A cDNA encoding a chimeric progranulin which likely arises through the mechanism of <italic>trans</italic>-splicing between <italic>grn1 </italic>and <italic>grn2 </italic>was also characterized. A non-coding RNA gene with antisense complementarity to both <italic>grn1 </italic>and <italic>grn2 </italic>was identified which may have functional implications with respect to gene dosage, as well as in restricting the formation of the chimeric form of progranulin. Chromosomal localization of the four progranulin (<italic>grn</italic>) genes reveals syntenic conservation for <italic>grna </italic>only, suggesting that it is the true orthologue of mammalian grn. RT-PCR and whole-mount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization analysis of zebrafish grns during development reveals that combined expression of grna and grnb, but not grn1 and grn2, recapitulate many of the expression patterns observed for the murine counterpart. This includes maternal deposition, widespread central nervous system distribution and specific localization within the epithelial compartments of various organs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In support of the duplication-degeneration-complementation model of duplicate gene retention, partitioning of expression between grna and grnb was observed in the intermediate cell mass and yolk syncytial layer, respectively.

Progranulin is secreted in an intact form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], or undergoes proteolysis leading to the release of its constituent peptides, the granulins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Individual granulins have an approximate molecular weight of 6 kDa, and are structurally defined by the presence of 12 cysteines arranged in a characteristic motif: X<sub>2&#x02013;3</sub><underline>C</underline>X<sub>5&#x02013;6</sub><underline>C</underline>X<sub>5</sub><underline>CC</underline>X<sub>8</sub><underline>CC</underline>X<sub>6</sub><underline>CC</underline>X<sub>5</sub><underline>CC</underline>X<sub>4</sub><underline>C</underline>X<sub>5&#x02013;6</sub><underline>C</underline>X<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Comparison of the biosynthetic origin of granulin peptides in various mammals reveals that all are commonly derived from a precursor composed of one amino-terminal half followed by seven non-identical copies of the granulin motif.</p><p>A role of progranulin in mammalian embryogenesis has been suggested. The exogenous addition of recombinant progranulin to eight-cell stage mouse embryos grown in culture <italic>ex vivo </italic>accelerates the onset of cavitation, stimulates the rate of blastocoel expansion, and leads to an increase in the number of trophectoderm cells compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Conversely, the use of a progranulin function-blocking antibody arrests growth and prohibits embryo implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These results are consistent with the growth-promoting activity of progranulin upon epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Despite these advances, the evolutionary history and phylogenetic distribution of the progranulin gene outside the mammalian radiation remain largely unexplored. In order to shed light on this issue, and to establish a model for studying the functional contribution of progranulin to vertebrate development, we undertook the characterization of the biosynthetic origins of progranulins in the zebrafish. The widely documented evidence in favor of a pan-genomic duplication event at the base of the teleost radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], commonly referred to as 3R, predicts that the single mammalian progranulin gene will likely be represented by two zebrafish co-orthologues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Results reported here demonstrate that, in zebrafish, progranulins arise as members of an extended gene family represented by two distinct architectures, in excess of that predicted by 3R.</p><p>Comparative chromosomal mapping of the various progranulin genes (<italic>grns</italic>) was performed to assist in the establishment of an orthologous relationship to their mammalian counterpart and to provide a point of reference to discuss the evolutionary origins of the distinct progranulin architectures. In support of the duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] gene expression analysis of the zebrafish progranulins reveals spatio-temporal divergence among the different family members, possibly reflecting extensive functional devolution of an ancestral form. Also, the occurrence of natural antisense transcription to some grns suggests that gene dosage may have influenced the retention of extra grn paralogues in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Evidence for a progranulin multigene family in teleosts</title><p>A previous study indicated that major forms of granulin peptides found in hematopoietic organs of carp, <italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>, differ in their relative abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Specifically, extracts of carp spleen contained granulin-1 only, while the head kidney contained granulins-1, -2, and -3, arguing that some granulins found in teleost fish, unlike those found in mammals, have different biosynthetic origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We revisited the issue of the sole occurrence of granulin-1 in carp spleen and confirmed the earlier report. However, granulin-1 was found to co-purify with another member of the granulin family (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Panel A). Sequencing of this peptide suggested that it is a close homologue of mammalian granulin-A, sharing 58% identity with the human peptide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Panel B). The isolation of a carp granulin peptide homologous to mammalian granulin-A suggested that teleosts synthesize a protein equivalent to mammalian progranulin. Carp is a tetraploid species known to express multiple copies of closely related genes that can complicate the study of the origins of multigene families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Therefore, we chose to study the structure and expression of granulin genes in the zebrafish, a closely-related diploid teleost of the cyprinoforme order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Reversed-Phase HPLC purification of granulin-A and granulin-1 from extracts of two carp spleens</bold>. <underline>Panel A</underline>: HPLC fractions derived from an extract of two carp spleens and enriched in granulin-1 immunoreactivity were further purified by HPLC using 0.13% heptafluorobutyric acid as counterion.

In contrast with mammalian progranulins, the deduced architecture of these zebrafish precursors, named progranulin-1 (grn1) and progranulin-2 (grn2), consist of one full and one amino-terminal half granulin-like repeats only (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

However, this mobile element is in the reverse complement orientation within the antisense transcript, and has undergone extensive mutations resulting from nucleotide insertions, deletions and point mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">Additional File 7</xref>). Thus, <italic>ASgrn1-2 </italic>never possessed the ability to encode a translatable transposase protein, nor does it have a clearly predictable ORF in view of the presence of several termination codons in all three possible reading frames. For these reasons, this naturally occurring antisense transcript is considered to belong to the category of non-coding RNA genes.</p></sec><sec><title>The zebrafish co-orthologues of mammalian progranulin</title><p>Based on the finding of a carp granulin peptide whose sequence was homologous to mammalian forms of granulin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, panel B), it was reasoned that these observations could be extended to the zebrafish. Using a strategy identical to that used for cloning a cDNA encoding granulin-1, we isolated a partial cDNA encoding a deduced zebrafish granulin-A peptide (data not shown). BLAST searches using this sequence retrieved two distinct ESTs from GenBank databases (accession <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AW174591">AW174591</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AW184435">AW184435</ext-link>), the former being identical to our cloned sequence. Sequencing of these cDNAs, referred to as progranulin-a (grna) and progranulin-b (grnb) respectively, revealed that each encodes a deduced granulins precursor bearing 10 and 9 tandemly repeated and non-identical granulin domains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), demonstrating that the zebrafish progranulin repertoire is not limited to the simplified <italic>grn </italic>gene structures.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Sequence comparison of zebrafish progranulin-A and -B with human progranulin</bold>.

Weak, ubiquitous grna expression can first be detected by 12 hpf (6 somite stage), with slightly stronger signal in the hypoblast (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panel A, c, d). Grnb expression remains similarly ubiquitous, however defined regions of heightened expression are evident including in the hypoblast, central nervous system (CNS), optic epithelial layers, ear primordium, lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) and tailbud (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panel B, c, d and data not shown). As the embryo matures to late segmentation stages (18&#x02013;20 hpf), low levels of grna expression become confined to the eyes, tectum and tailbud (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panel A, e, f), whereas grnb expression undergoes further regionalization within the eyes and CNS, the caudal region of the notochord and surrounding adaxial cells, and in the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panel B, e, f). During the pharyngula period (24&#x02013;48 hpf) and hatching stage (72 hpf), overlapping expression patterns between grna and grnb include the pharyngeal and anterior visceral endoderm, the skin epidermis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panels A and B, g&#x02013;i), and the pronephric tubules, albeit at modest levels (data not shown). In addition, both genes are expressed temporally within the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) between 36 and 72 hpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panels A and B, h, i and data not shown). Divergent expression of the zebrafish co-orthologues of mammalian progranulin is also notable during this period (24&#x02013;72 hpf). For instance, only grna is strongly expressed in the intermediate cell mass (ICM) caudal region, the lens and retina as well as the tectum of the 24 hpf embryo (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panel A, g). Grna is also uniquely expressed at low levels within the forming head vasculature and aorta at 48 hpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panel A, h&#x02013;i and data not shown), and exhibits relatively increased leukocytic expression from 48 to 72 hpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panel A, h&#x02013;k). In contrast to that observed for grna, grnb is expressed within the YSL and often found concentrated at the end of the yolk extension. Sustained high levels of grnb were observed within the brain at all stages examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panel B, g&#x02013;k) and in the swim bladder by 72 hpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panel B, k). Patterns observed during the hatching period generally persist and are accentuated in the 5 day-old larva (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, panels A and B). In addition, grna can be detected in the epithelial lining of various visceral organs, in particular the pharynx, intestine, swim bladder and pronephric ducts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, panel A, a). Weak staining in the dorsal aorta but not the posterior cardinal vein can sometimes be noticed in whole-mount and through sectioning of the animal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, panel A, a). Likewise, grnb is widely expressed in the visceral region of the larval stage animal, in particular the intestine, pancreas and YSL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Weak expression is also detected for both genes in the olfactory epithelium and in the presumptive thymus as bilateral patches located caudal to the eyes (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Developmental expression analysis of zebrafish grna and grnb mRNAs by whole mount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization</bold>.

At the 4-cell stage (a) and 50% epiboly (b) ubiquitous expression is observed for grnb only. A lateral view of the 6-somite stage embryo (c) reveals discernable ubiquitous expression above background levels for grna, and increased grnb expression in the epithelium of the eye primordium and CNS, as well as the caudal region. In a dorsal view of the same animals (d), caudal expression in the axial mesoderm (arrow) is observed for both genes, whereas only grnb is detected in the paraxial mesoderm (arrowheads). Lateral (e) and frontal (f) views of the late somitogenesis stage embryo (18&#x02013;20 hpf) show continued expression in the eye primordium, CNS and tailbud for both genes. In addition, grnb can be detected in the YSL (arrow) (e) and the adaxial cells (arrowheads) (f) flanking the axial mesoderm. At 24 hpf (g), grna expression is found in the tectum and eye retina, in a diffuse pattern in the anterior endoderm (arrowhead) and in a punctuate pattern within the ventral tail region of the ICM (arrow), whereas elevated expression persists for grnb in the forebrain, midbrain and ventral hindbrain region, the eyes, as well as in the YSL, concentrated at the tip of the yolk extension (arrow).

This sequence corresponds to the 3'UTR region of the <italic>grna </italic>gene and is not bisected by an intron at the genomic level. This precludes the conclusion that this candidate antisense transcript is not an artifact of cloning. To confirm its directionality, cDNA was synthesized for subsequent PCR amplification using a primer located within the 3'UTR exon of grna that shared complementarity to ASgrna (sense relative to grna) or using another primer that was located downstream of the cloned ASgrna sequence and within a known intron for <italic>grna </italic>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S11">Additional File 11</xref>, panel A).

A series of related cysteine-rich peptides (designated granulins A, B, C and D) were purified from extracts of human neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The definition of the structure of human progranulin as a glycoprotein bearing multiple copies of the granulin motif made it apparent that granulin peptides are generated through proteolytic cleavage of this precursor within the phagolysosomal compartment of the neutrophil. This explains the roughly equimolar ratios observed for members of the granulin family that are co-packaged within this subcellular compartment. The hematopoietic tissues (spleen and head kidney) of the carp (<italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>) were also shown to be abundant sources of three granulin-like peptides (granulins-1, -2 and -3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, the non-stoichiometric ratios observed for carp granulins-1,-2 and -3 suggested that the granulin gene family in this teleost species may expand beyond the prototypic single <italic>grn </italic>gene found in mammals. Specifically, carp spleen contains mainly granulin-1, whereas granulins-1, -2 and -3 were found in extracts of the head kidney (Belcourt et al. 1993). To simplify the identification of teleost granulin gene family members, the zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) was chosen based on its usefulness as a model of vertebrate development and disease.</p><p>The presence of extra gene paralogues in teleost fish has been extensively documented, often [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] but not invariably supporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] the hypothesis that the actinopterygian (ray-finned) lineage underwent an additional round of genome duplication (3R) subsequent to diverging from the sarcopterygian (lobe-finned) lineage approximately 450 mya. Specific examples include the <italic>Hox </italic>clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], the annexins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], the claudins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and the Nodal-related genes <italic>squint </italic>and <italic>cyclops </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

Despite this apparent discrepancy, a co-orthologous relationship between <italic>grna </italic>and <italic>grnb </italic>relative to mammalian <italic>grn </italic>is supported by their sequence conservation as well as their extensive overlapping expression patterns observed during development.</p><p>Two smaller <italic>grn </italic>genes, <italic>grn1 </italic>and <italic>grn2</italic>, each encoding one full and one amino-terminal half copies only of the granulin motif, were also characterized (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Interestingly, a common ancestry of the smaller zebrafish <italic>grn </italic>genes with <italic>grna </italic>and <italic>grnb</italic>, and thus mammalian <italic>grn</italic>, is implied by conservation of the strict exonic organization that these genes display. However, it is unlikely that <italic>grn1 </italic>and <italic>grn2 </italic>arose from the postulated whole genome duplication event corresponding to 3R since they were found to be localized in tandem on LG19 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

It was previously shown that carp granulin-1 and granulin-2 peptides are differently distributed in the spleen and head kidneys of the carp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Interestingly, RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that the expression of the homologous structures in zebrafish were similarly uncoupled at the level of mRNA, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, panel C), reflected in a lack of detectable zebrafish grn2 expression in adult spleen. Also, grn1 appears to be the predominant form in the heart, while the eyes express higher levels of grn2. Whether the widespread pattern of expression for zebrafish grns is due in part to leukocyte entrapment in some organs, cells known to express granulins in carp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and goldfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] cannot be determined using this experimental approach.</p><p>Other notable differences in the expression of the paralogous and orthologous pairs of genes were observed. First, maternal transcripts for grna and grnb are readily detectable, with grnb showing higher abundance than grna until early somitogenesis when the two genes become expressed at similar levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, panel A). In contrast, although very low levels of grn1 mRNA are also detected in the newly-fertilized egg, the combined expression of grn1 and grn2 only becomes detectable by 30 hpf, at a stage when most organogenesis is well advanced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, panel A). Thus, the absence of grn1 and grn2 expression prior to the onset of zygotic expression argues that these genes are functionally dispensable in early embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of progranulin expression by whole mount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization</title><sec><title>Early expression</title><p>In order to determine possible roles for the grns during development, their spatio-temporal distribution was examined by whole mount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization.

Transcripts for both zebrafish co-orthologues are maternally deposited and remain ubiquitously expressed subsequent to the onset of zygotic transcription (mid-blastula transition &#x02013; 3 hpf). Similarly, in a pattern that reflects the replacement of maternal mRNAs with zygotically expressed transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], murine grn mRNA levels fall rapidly after egg fertilization, reaching negligible levels as early as the 2-cell stage, but rise again to detectable levels by the eight-cell stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] Notably, this precedes the morula stage and subsequent blastocyst stage when the epithelium is first formed. It is interesting to note that during zebrafish epiboly, which comprises the morphogenetic movements of the blastoderm towards the vegetal pole (dome to tailbud stage &#x02013; 4.5 hpf to 10 hpf), grna and grnb are still ubiquitous but more intense in the outer enveloping monolayer of cells (EVL), which ultimately will give rise to an epithelium covering the blastoderm. Expression of these grns in the EVL and later in the skin ectoderm is reminiscent of the more elevated levels of expression for grn in the apical surface of the mouse blastocyst epithelium, the trophectoderm, relative to the inner cell mass population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>CNS</title><p>Although several regions display increased expression of grna and grnb during brain segmentation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panel A and B, c&#x02013;f), regional specificity is more apparent at 24 hpf. Distinct or non-overlapping patterns observed include grna expression within the tectum and a more expansive grnb expression pattern encompassing the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, tegmentum and telencephalon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panel B, g). Despite the expression of both grna and grnb in the epithelial lining of the eyes and lens, transient expression within the retina and tectum is noticeable for grna only, suggesting that this orthologue may affect the development of the retinotectal projections. Similar functions may also be implied for mammalian grn, given its expression within the retinal glia during murine development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Interestingly, murine grn expression is abundant throughout the central and peripheral nervous system, similar to that observed for grnb at later developmental time points within the zebrafish CNS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The generally unrestricted gene expression pattern suggests a role for progranulin in cell survival or proliferation or as a competence factor. Indeed, mammalian grn has been demonstrated to be a potent glial cell mitogen <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and is consistently up-regulated in malignant human gliomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Grn2 and ASgrn1-2 but not grn1 demonstrate similar unrestricted expression within the zebrafish brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11d,h</xref>). Taken together these expression patterns suggest that CNS development in the zebrafish may involve a functional interplay between the various molecular forms of granulin.</p><p>The only known functional and physiological contribution that <italic>grn </italic>gene expression is known to make during neural maturation is its involvement in the sexual differentiation of the male rat brain. It has been shown that male sexual behaviour is associated with steroid-dependent <italic>grn </italic>expression in the male neonatal hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Similar distinctions in <italic>grn </italic>gene expression were not determined in the present study given that sexual differentiation of zebrafish gonads occurs much later and spans roughly 21&#x02013;28 dpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Endoderm</title><p>The expression of the zebrafish <italic>grn </italic>gene family members also displays overlapping and distinctive patterns with respect to the endoderm and tissues derived from this germ layer. At 24 hpf both grna and grnb can be found within the pharyngeal and foregut endoderm, whereas only the latter is located within the YSL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panels A and B, g). Both transcripts maintain a degree of dispersed endodermal expression until 120 hpf where grna is located within the epithelial lining of the stomach and anterior intestine while grnb can be found within the YSL, pancreas and proctodeum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the expression of grna and grnb, the paralogues grn1, grn2 and hybrid granulin are highly abundant and for the most part restricted to pharyngeal and visceral endodermal derivatives from 72 hpf onward. Although grn1 and grn2 demonstrate some endodermal tissue-specific expression, these transcripts often co-localize (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11a,b,d,e</xref>). The restricted expression of hybrid granulin within the proctodeum is particularly striking (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11g</xref>). Consistent with the manner in which the hybrid transcript is formed, both grn1 and grn2 are likewise expressed in the proctodeum. However, expression of these two transcripts overlaps within a large portion of the intestine and stomach where no hybrid grn transcript is found. This suggests that wherever the hybrid grn is observed, the generation of this chimeric peptide must be a highly regulated process and that a specific function is implied.</p><p>In contrast to the observed grn distribution in zebrafish, murine grn is not detected within developing endodermal derivatives, with the exception of adult deep crypt enterocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. This suggests that mammalian dependence on grn expression may be developmentally restricted to endodermal-epithelial transitions in the gut or subsequent maintenance of this organ. Alternatively, it is possible that endodermal expression of zebrafish grns reflects a species-specific requirement.</p></sec><sec><title>Hematopoietic tissue</title><p>Of particular interest in regards to functional equivalence between species and functional separation between duplicated co-orthologues, is the almost complete partitioning of grn hematopoietic expression onto grna and to a much lesser extent grn2. In zebrafish, primitive hematopoiesis occurs within the anterior ICM from where nucleated erythroblasts originate and myeloid cells that can be seen circulating at 24 hpf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are then believed to populate the dorsal aorta and yolk sac which represent the zebrafish equivalent of the mammalian aorta-gonad-mesonephros, the tissue presumed to be responsible for later definitive erythropoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The posterior ICM, located within the ventral tail and positive for molecular markers of all three hematopoietic lineages, may represent a secondary zebrafish HSC population or region required for HSC maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Unlike the murine model, zebrafish definitive hematopoiesis undergoes a migratory transition from the dorsal aorta/ventral tail to the kidney (roughly 96 hpf), without the involvement of liver or bone marrow.</p><p>In accordance with expression patterns mentioned previously, grna only acquires distinctive tissue-specificity at 24 hpf, as is the case for its prevalence within the caudal ICM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panel A, g&#x02013;j), restricting its involvement to definitive hematopoietic waves. Grna can be found at low levels within the dorsal aorta at 48 hpf (data not shown) and is highly expressed within the caudal-ventral tail region throughout all stages post-24 hpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), suggesting its involvement in multiple hematopoietic lineages. Significantly, sustained <italic>grna </italic>expression in this hematopoietic organ is coupled with the appearance of <italic>grna</italic>-expressing leukocytes dispersed throughout the animal with levels that peak at approximately 72 hpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, panel A, j&#x02013;k). Thus <italic>grna </italic>expression in presumed granulocytes all over the body of the animal may suggest its involvement in the innate immune response of the host. Grn2 expression is also found within peripheral leukocytes, but in a sporadic pattern that is distinct from that observed for grna. Whether these differences reflect leukocyte sub-populations or activation states for these cells has not been addressed. Commensurate with the transition of ICM to kidney as the major site of hematopoiesis, grna can be found within the pronephric ducts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) along with grn1 and grn2, which are also present in the head kidney (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>, panel B and E).</p><p>Mammalian grn exhibits a similar expression pattern, particularly in neutrophils. Furthermore, murine grn can modulate the inflammatory response during wound healing, acting as both a chemokinetic factor and inhibitor of neutrophil degranulation and respiratory burst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. It remains to be determined whether grna supports a similar role in zebrafish.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Chimeric transcription</title><p>During the initial degenerate primer amplification of cDNAs encoding grn1 and 2, a third cDNA was cloned and identified as sharing strict identity with portions of both grn1 and 2. Interestingly, this granulin-hybrid showed 100% identity with exons 1 and 2 of <italic>grn-1</italic>, and with exons 3, 4 and 5 of <italic>grn-2</italic>, suggesting that this hybrid cDNA may represent a splicing of granulin-1 and 2 primary transcripts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Chimeric transcripts usually result from one of the following mechanisms: chromosomal translocations, transcription of neighboring genes as a single transcription unit or alternative splicing in <italic>trans</italic>. In all cases, joining of exons is predicted to occur through the recognition of canonical splice acceptor and donor sites.</p><p>A hybrid granulin structure has been previously reported through cloning of cDNA sequences in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Specifically, a structural splice variant of progranulin cDNA was retrieved and predicted to encode a granulin domain consisting of the amino-terminal domain of granulin-C fused to the carboxyl-terminal domain of granulin-D, consistent with the removal of an exon from the larger primary transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The zebrafish hybrid grn described here likely originates through a mechanism other than alternative splicing from a larger primary transcript since the <italic>grn2 </italic>gene is located 5' to the <italic>grn1 </italic>gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This topology was confirmed through the cloning and structural analysis of the partially complementary <italic>ASgrn1-2 </italic>gene. Also, we found no evidence for the presence of additional grn1-like genomic sequences located upstream of the <italic>grn2 </italic>gene, or elsewhere in the genome by Southern analysis (data not shown). In particular, no equivalent of carp grn3 was found in zebrafish. These observations suggest that the presence of hybrid grn in zebrafish likely occurs through a splicing reaction in <italic>trans </italic>between grn1 and grn2 pre-mRNAs, similar to the mechanism originally documented in trypanosomatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Although rare, scrambled or intergenic RNA molecules consisting of exons originating from distinct genes through a <italic>trans</italic>-splicing reaction have also been documented in vertebrates. For instance, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (<italic>ACAT-1</italic>) and the CYP3A family of P450 cytochrome genes produce hybrid mRNA variants in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. <italic>Trans</italic>-splicing of the voltage-gated sodium channel in response to nerve growth factor stimulation, further suggests that this alternative mode of splicing can be a regulated process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Indeed, there is evidence suggesting that splicing in <italic>trans </italic>may be facilitated through the recognition of regulatory elements within transcript sequences called splicing enhancers that require binding of SR proteins for activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Whether grn1 or grn2 harbour a necessary enhancer sequence that could explain the directionality of hybrid grn is currently not known. We believe the hybrid granulin represents the first example of <italic>trans</italic>-splicing with regards to the modification of a growth factor gene product.</p></sec><sec><title>Antisense transcription</title><p>Although the majority of deposited zebrafish EST library sequencing confirmed the existence of grn1 and grn2, one particular sequence (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AW777232">AW777232</ext-link>) corresponded to the exact reverse complement to both <italic>grn1 </italic>and <italic>grn2 </italic>within the same exon/intron spanning region (exons 2&#x02013;3 and intervening intron), and was named <italic>ASgrn1-2 </italic>accordingly. In addition, <italic>ASgrn1-2 </italic>harbours sequences for an extensively mutated <italic>tzf </italic>transposon (Tc1/mariner superfamily) in its last exon, but in the reverse complement orientation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">Additional File 7</xref>). Despite its polyadenylation, the lack of an ORF classifies ASgrn1-2 as a non-coding RNA. To our knowledge, ASgrn1-2 represents the first example of a single spliced transcript with antisense complementarity to two tandemly organized paralogous protein-coding genes.</p><p>The existence of ASgrn1-2 has potential implications in aspects of <italic>grn1 </italic>and <italic>grn2 </italic>function. Classically, antisense transcripts often function as inhibitors of the expression of their associated gene, through repression of transcription or promotion of mRNA degradation. There is the possibility that ASgrn1-2 is involved in the formation of hybrid grn wherein this complementary transcript may provide a scaffold to sequester grn1 and grn2 mRNA transcripts within the same intracellular locale, preventing or alternatively facilitating the <italic>trans</italic>-splicing reaction.</p><p>Regarding the RT-PCR data, despite evidence of clear tissue-specific and temporal ASgrn1-2 expression in adult tissues and various developmental stages respectively, this transcript shows no clear reciprocal relationship to grn1 or grn2 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). These expression patterns were confirmed at all stages examined using sense riboprobes for grn1, grn2, and verified for specificity by using the corresponding sense riboprobe to hybrid grn as negative control (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>, and data not shown). At 5 dpf, ASgrn1-2 is expressed in the presumed hyoid ossification center, stomach and rostral intestine, as well as swim bladder (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11i&#x02013;n</xref>). Although grn1 and grn2 are found within most of these tissues (particularly grn1), specific expression of ASgrn1-2 in the hyoid region undergoing osteogenesis may suggest the required down-regulation of the expression of its counterpart genes during bone development. Therefore a reciprocal relationship may exist between these genes under strict spatio-temporal regulation. Although ASgrn1-2 may mediate a degradation independent mode of gene regulation, such as alternative splicing, it clearly does not perform as a universal negative regulator of <italic>grn1 </italic>and <italic>grn2 </italic>expression.</p><p>At least one type of transcription modulation may be associated with ASgrn1-2 based on whole mount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization analysis. There is a clear reciprocal relationship between hybrid grn expression and absence of ASgrn1-2 transcription. At 120 hpf, hybrid grn is restricted to the distal intestine and despite the expression of its substrate transcripts within several other locales, no other grn1/grn2 rich setting is devoid of ASgrn1-2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). This pattern further suggests that ASgrn1-2 expression prevents formation of the hybrid grn RNA.</p><p>The existence of <italic>ASgrn1-2 </italic>suggested that an equivalent entity may exist for one or both co-orthologues, <italic>grna </italic>and <italic>grnb</italic>. Indeed, the sense probe for grna in whole mount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization analysis produced a consistent and reproducible signal within the intestine and pronephric ducts at 5 dpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, panel A, b). Several unidirectionally cloned cDNAs (accession numbers (<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CD585878">CD585878</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CD585963">CD585963</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CD596001">CD596001</ext-link>) were found to correspond to the reverse complement sequence of grna within the 3'UTR. Northern blot analysis using sense grna demonstrated a putative 4 kb transcript and directional cDNA synthesis followed by RT-PCR indicated this putative antisense transcript extended within the known grna intronic sequence. However, repeated attempts to clone the full-length transcript by RACE were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, these observations provide evidence for the existence of a second naturally occurring grn complementary transcript, namely ASgrna.</p></sec><sec><title>The granulin motif &#x02013; phylogenetic and functional implications</title><p>The granulin motif is so distinctive that it is a relatively simple matter to search the protein and nucleotide databases to obtain an impression of its phylogenetic origins. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref> shows a diagrammatic representation of the nature of proteins bearing the granulin motif that can be confidently predicted through searching the cDNA, EST and/or genome sequence databases using BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

The source of the sequence data used to predict these structures is listed as accession numbers in the legend to Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>.

With some interesting exceptions (e.g. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>), the granulin motif can be found throughout eukaryotes, both in plants and multicellular animals. In contrast there is no representation within fungi or unicellular organisms. The presence of a protein bearing the granulin motif within the slime mold (<italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>) is particularly revealing since this organism is thought to be a modern representative of an amoeboid organism that was a transition species between unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. The appearance of this organism is thought to predate the divergence of plants and animals about 1.5 billion years ago. This suggests that a primordial gene bearing a single granulin motif evolved once during this transition period. The plant motif is found in just one context as a carboxyl-terminal domain of a cysteine protease that is found in many members of the viridiplantae including <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>).

Indeed two rounds of genome-wide duplication are believed to have occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. More precisely, the first genome duplication probably occurred in a common ancestor of all agnathans and gnathostomes after its divergence from cephalochordates, ~594 mya (million years ago). The second round is presumed to have occurred ~488 mya, within the lineage leading to jawed vertebrates after the jawless line diverged, presumably before the split between cartilaginous and bony fish. Despite this, all mammals studied thus far have retained only a single copy of the progranulin gene, whereas two rounds of genome duplication would theoretically create four progranulin genes. It is therefore interesting to consider the biological rationale behind retention of <italic>grna </italic>and <italic>grnb </italic>following the teleost genome duplication, an event not permitted within other vertebrates, in conjunction with the appearance of two extra paralogues, <italic>grn1 </italic>and <italic>grn2</italic>.

The carp granulin-1 amino acid sequence was used to design degenerate forward DF1 (5'-GTI ATY CAY TGY GAY GC-3') and reverse DR1 (5'-CAR CAR TGR ATI CCR TC-3') and DR2 (5'-TCR CAR TGR TAI CCR TG-3') primers for use in the polymerase chain reaction (IUPAC codes are used to refer to the bases in primer sequences). The template for the initial amplification reaction was a 5'-STRETCH plus cDNA library cloned in lambda gt10 vector (Clontech BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ONT). cDNA for this library was prepared from 1-month-old zebrafish using a combination of oligo-dT and random priming. 0.25 &#x003bc;l of library (approximately 10<sup>8 </sup>pfu/ml) was used in a final reaction volume of 100 &#x003bc;l for each new amplification attempt. The annealing temperature was determined empirically in order to maximize yield of product. PCR amplifications were performed with Taq DNA polymerase, unless specified otherwise, using a Hybaid thermal cycler from Bio/Can Scientific Inc. (Etobicoke, ONT). Amplified products were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc. Mississauga, ONT) and sequenced after cloning into TOPO pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). An initial reaction using the DF1 and DR1 primer pair yielded several products. 5 &#x003bc;l of this reaction was subjected to re-amplification using DF1 primer in combination with the nested (anchored) DR2 primer, which revealed a product of 126-bp encoding a partial sequence for granulin-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>, step 1). New grn1 primers F126 (5'-ACTGTGTGTCCAGACGG-3') and R215 (5'-CCATCCCTGCAACACTG-3') were then designed based on this sequence and were used, respectively, in combination with flanking gt10 primers in order to obtain the 5'- and 3'-untranslated region (UTR) cDNA sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>, steps 2 and 3). Finally, the entire ORF was amplified with Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics), using forward F1 (5'-ATGTTCCCAGTGTTGATG-3') and reverse R (STOP) (5'-GCTTACAACTCCAACCCG-3') primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional File 1</xref>, Step 4). This PCR was performed in a final volume of 100 &#x003bc;l, containing 0.25 &#x003bc;l of library, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, (pH 8.8), 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mM concentration of each dNTP, 0.5 unit of Pwo DNA polymerase, and 100 pmol of each primer. An initial denaturation step was carried out at 94&#x000b0;C for 3 min. Annealing temperatures of 54&#x000b0;C, 56&#x000b0;C and 58&#x000b0;C were used sequentially for 10 cycles each. Typical denaturation, annealing, and amplification reactions were carried out at 94&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 54&#x000b0;C for 1 min, and 68&#x000b0;C for 1 min, respectively. A final extension step of 10 min at 72&#x000b0;C was carried out after adding 0.25 unit Taq DNA polymerase. An amplification product specific for grn1 was sequenced on both strands. The 5'-UTR, and a portion of the 3'-UTR for grn1, were amplified using grn1-specific primers in conjunction with a lambda gt10 primer. Distinct cDNAs encoding progranulin-2 and a chimeric progranulin were uncovered through this approach. Each transcript was confirmed through sequencing of independent amplification reactions using template cDNA derived from either adult organs or embryos of mixed stages. Following a strategy similar to that used for the isolation of zebrafish grn1 cDNA, primers based on the purified carp granulin-A peptide sequence were designed to clone partial cDNAs for zebrafish grna and grnb, respectively (not shown). BLAST searches using the cloned sequences retrieved two unique ESTs at NCBI sharing an exact match with grna and grnb, respectively (accession numbers <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AW174591">AW174591</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AW184435">AW184435</ext-link>). These respective ESTs were purchased from RZPD GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany; clone ID: UCDMp574E2318Q2 and UCDMp574I0223Q2) and sequenced on both strands to create a final assembly of the full-length cDNAs encoding zebrafish progranulin-A and progranulin-B. In addition to our cloning strategy, the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed with the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen, Burlington, ONT) using total RNA isolated from adult zebrafish intestine. For grn1 and grn2 transcripts, a reverse primer that corresponded to nucleotides 195&#x02013;215 based on the cloned ORF of both transcripts (5'-CCATCCCTGCAACACTGACCC-3'), was used to perform the 5' RACE, while a forward primer corresponding to nucleotides 1&#x02013;22 of each transcript (5'-ATGTTCCCAGTGTTGATGTTAC-3') was used to perform the RACE in the 3' direction. Similarly a 5' UTR sequence for grna was obtained using the map reverse primer (see below).

Kodak X-OMAT AR film was used for autoradiography (Fisher Scientific Ltd, Whitby, ONT). Three positive clones (706K2254Q, BUSMP706K14116Q2, 706F20133Q2) were detected by autoradiography, and the first two were confirmed to carry at least part of the grn1 gene by PCR, using the F1 (5'-ATGTTCCCAGTGTTGATG-3') and R215 (5'-CCATCCCTGCAACACTG-3') primer pair which does not discriminate between grn1 and grn2, and sequencing.

Screening of colonies transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Xymotech, Montreal, QUE), employing the same probe used for the original library screening, was performed in the following prehybridization and hybridization conditions: 2 &#x000d7; SSC, 0.5% SDS, 0.05% Na Pyrophosphate at 65&#x000b0;C.

Plasmid DNA from a positive clone was purified using the high pure plasmid isolation kit (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, QUE). An insert of ~9-kb was fully sequenced and revealed the presence of the promoter region and approximately half of the grn1 gene. The remaining gene sequence was found in a ~6-kb insert clone isolated by re-screening the colony lifts with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled reverse R(STOP) oligonucleotide (5'-GCTTACAACTCCAACCCG-3') as probe.

For the assignment to zebrafish linkage groups, each PCR amplification experiment was performed at least twice.</p></caption><media xlink:href="1471-2164-6-156-S9.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for file</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S10"><caption><title>Additional File 10</title><p><bold>Sequences of primers and predicted sizes of PCR amplicons</bold>.

The presence of an amplicon for both primer pairs using each +RT cDNA template, but not using template derived from -RT reactions, indicates that ASgrna extends in the 3'end direction and overlaps with intronic sequences of grna. Positive controls for PCR conditions using genomic DNA as template, as well as a no template control are indicated, respectively. The authenticity of the amplicons was determined through sequencing.
