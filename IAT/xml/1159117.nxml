Alternative targets include the co-repressor small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) and the co-activators CBP/p300, indicating that EID1 utilizes different inhibitory strategies. Recently, EID2 was characterized as an inhibitor of muscle differentiation and as an antagonist of both CBP/p300 and HDACs. Here, we describe a third family member designated EID3 that is highly expressed in testis and shows homology to a region of EID1 implicated in binding to CBP/p300. We demonstrate that EID3 acts as a potent inhibitor of nuclear receptor transcriptional activity by a mechanism that is independent of direct interactions with nuclear receptors, including SHP. Furthermore, EID3 directly binds to and blocks the SRC-1 interacting domain of CBP, which has been implicated to act as the interaction surface for nuclear receptor co-activators. Consistent with this idea, EID3 prevents recruitment of CBP to a natural nuclear receptor-regulated promoter. Our study suggests that EID-family members EID3 and EID1 act as inhibitors of CBP/p300-dependent transcription in a tissue-specific manner.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>CBP and p300 are highly related proteins that participate in a variety of cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). They serve as transcriptional co-activators for nearly every gene-specific <italic>trans</italic>-activator, participating in multiple regulatory networks, and communicating with other co-activators and multi-protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Therefore, CBP and p300 are also called co-integrators that are involved in multiple biological processes that affect cell growth, transformation and development. The adenoviral transforming protein E1A is one of the most studied viral oncoproteins. It targets both CBP and p300; the latter was originally identified through its interaction with E1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). The reprogramming activity mediated by E1A and the host cell response to this reprogramming lead to transformation, growth arrest or apoptosis. E1A mediates the repression of CBP/p300-dependent <italic>trans</italic>-activation by sequestration of CBP/p300, TBP and p/CAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>Recent work has indicated the existence of cellular proteins that share intriguing features with E1A. The first of these proteins, designated EID1 (E1A-like inhibitor of differentiation 1), was cloned on the basis of interactions with the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor protein and was subsequently characterized as inhibitor of CBP/p300-dependent functions on differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). We identified EID1 as cofactor of the orphan nuclear receptor SHP (small heterodimer partner, NR0B2) and demonstrated that EID1 inhibits genes regulated by a variety of nuclear receptors (NRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). EID2 was cloned as the second member of this family and was shown to act as an inhibitor of gene expression. Interestingly, it has been suggested that EID2 inhibition is a combination of two mechanisms, binding to CBP/p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) or recruiting histone deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the identification of a third member of the EID family. EID3 is specifically expressed in testis and, at the sub-cellular level, localized to both nucleus and cytoplasm. We demonstrate that EID3 inhibits gene expression mediated by NRs, most probably by interacting with the SRC-1 interacting domain (SID) of CBP that has been implicated in co-activator assembly, thus preventing recruitment of CBP to a natural NR-regulated promoter. Our study suggests that interference with CBP/p300 function represents a common and crucial feature of at least these two members of the EID family.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>All human EID3 and human EID1 expression plasmids described in this study were generated by PCR-based cloning using appropriate primers and verified by sequencing.

Ligands dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were added for the indicated times, and protein&#x02013;DNA complexes were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Crosslinking was quenched by adding 125 mM glycine and cells were washed with PBS, harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and sonicated 10 times for 10 s. The soluble chromatin was collected by centrifugation, and an aliquot of the chromatin was put aside and represented the input fraction. The supernatants were incubated with 30 &#x003bc;l protein A/G Sepharose (50% slurry; Pharmacia) under gentle agitation for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, and 0.5&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;g of antibody was added and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Protein A/G Sepharose (20 &#x003bc;l of a 50% slurry) was then added and incubated for 1.5 h.

DNA was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 50 &#x003bc;l. Antibodies used were rabbit normal IgG (Santa Cruz), anti-oestrogen receptor &#x003b1; (anti-ER&#x003b1;) (H-184; Santa Cruz), anti-FLAG M5 (Sigma), anti-CBP (A-22; Santa Cruz). For real-time PCR, SYBR green qPCR supermix UDG (Invitrogen) was used with primer pairs 5&#x02032;-GGCCATCTCTCACTATGAATCACT-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GGATTTGCTGATAGACAGAGACGA-3&#x02032; for presenilin 2 (pS2). To calculate the enrichment differences among the receptor and cofactors using real-time PCR, E2 treatments were normalized to the DMSO treatments. The enrichment level for each of the factors during DMSO treatment was set to 1 and the enrichment levels after E2 treatment of the ER and cofactors were compared with it. Since the DMSO treatment was carried out for the same amount of time as the E2 treatment, we defined these as time-matched and solvent-normalized values.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Cloning of a third member of the EID family</title><p>NCBI BLAST databases were searched with the EID1 open reading frame (ORF) to identify potential functional homologues and revealed the existence of several unpublished ORFs. In this study, we focused on a predicted human cDNA with an ORF encoding 333 amino acids, which can be accessed through NCBI Protein Database under NCBI accession no. AAH27612. The EID3 gene is located on chromosome 12 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/HsBlast.html"/>). A mouse homologue with accession number NM_025499 encoding 310 amino acids was also found, located on chromosome 10 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/MmBlast.html"/>). Both the human and mouse genes were located in the 5&#x02032; end of the thioredoxin reductase 1 gene, in the intron between thioredoxin reductase 1 splice variants 2 and 3. The human clone showed similarity in its central/N-terminal part (amino acids 56&#x02013;92; 73% similarity and amino acids 106&#x02013;146; 66% similarity) to the C-terminus of EID1 (amino acids 114&#x02013;147 and amino acids 148&#x02013;184) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Unlike EID1, EID3 has a conserved C-terminus with unknown function referred to as COG5125 domain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi"/>). We subsequently cloned the human full-length cDNA from testis by PCR and designated it human EID3 as the third putative member of the EID family.</p></sec><sec><title>EID3 is expressed in testis and represents a 39 kDa intracellular shuttling protein</title><p>In order to determine the tissue distribution of EID3, multiple tissue northern blots containing RNA from 16 different tissues were analysed and revealed an &#x0223c;2.0 kb transcript highly expressed in testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To characterize the EID3 ORF, we produced [<sup>35</sup>S]labelled, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed and translated protein to ascertain the molecular weight. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, EID3 has a size of 39 kDa consistent with the predicted molecular weight. We next studied the intracellular localization of EID3 in comparison with EID1. FLAG-tagged EID3 was found to be localized in the cytoplasm (66%) and in the nucleus (34%) of transfected COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, unlike EID1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), the intracellular distribution of EID3 was not affected by the presence of the nuclear export inhibitor LMB, indicating the intracellular distribution of EID3 is regulated by mechanisms independent of CRM1-dependent nuclear export. Further studies also show that increasing amounts of transfected over expressed FLAG-EID3 result in a shift in localization towards a more cytoplasmic and less nuclear distribution, and that it is stable according to western blot (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>EID3 inhibits nuclear receptor-dependent transcriptional activity</title><p>To investigate whether EID3 had inhibitory functions on transcriptional activity comparable with its relatives EID1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) and EID2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), we transiently co-transfected EID3, and for comparison EID1, with NRs known to be expressed in testis. SF-1 is expressed in testis and has a role in regulating the steroid hydroxylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is expressed in several cell types in testis and inhibits steroidogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). The oestrogen receptor &#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;) is expressed in testis and has a role in the expression of oestrogen-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The effects of androgens are mediated through the androgen receptor (AR) to regulate genes involved in primarily male sexual differentiation and maturation, and the maintenance of spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). We observed that EID3 potently inhibited the transcriptional activity of SF-1, GR, ER&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and AR (data not shown). Furthermore, we show by western blot that the expression of the NRs is not altered by the presence of over expressed EID1 and EID3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, sub-cellular localization studies suggest that FLAG-EID3 preferentially accumulates in the cell nucleus in cells co-transfected with the NRs, which may be due to the formation of a complex between over expressed NR and endogenous CBP/p300 (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>CBP-dependent transcriptional activation is inhibited by EID3</title><p>In order to elucidate if EID3 could inhibit CBP-dependent transcriptional activity similar to the EID1 inhibition of p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), HuH7 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the C-terminus of CBP (amino acids 1678&#x02013;2441), a reporter plasmid containing GAL4 DNA-binding sites, and a plasmid expressing wild-type EID1 or EID3. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, EID3 had a profound inhibitory effect on the transcriptional activity of CBP, indicating functional similarities to EID1. Furthermore, western blot shows that the expression of GAL4-CBP C is not altered by the presence of over expressed EID1 and EID3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>EID3 binds to the C-terminus of CBP <italic>in vivo</italic> and the CBP SID <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Considering that the EID1 C-terminus is homologous to an EID3 domain encompassing amino acids 106&#x02013;146 and that this domain has been implicated in binding to the C-terminus of CBP/p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), we wanted to investigate whether EID3 could interact with the C-terminus of CBP <italic>in vivo</italic>. To test for interactions of these proteins in mammalian cells, HuH7 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-EID3 and FLAG-EID1, and GAL4-CBP C-terminus. CBP complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-GAL-DBD antibodies, resolved on an SDS&#x02013;PAGE gel and analysed for the presence of EID3 in the immune-precipitates using anti-FLAG antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Both EID1 and EID3 were found to be co-immunoprecipitated with the C-terminus of CBP. GST pull-down assays showed that both EID1 and EID3 interacted with the so-called SID of CBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating a functional conservation of these interactions within the EID family. In order to demonstrate the competition of EID3 and the p160 co-activator, TIF-2 transient transfection experiments were performed. These results show that EID3 completely abolishes the TIF-2-induced <italic>trans</italic>-activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>EID3 and EID1 blocks recruitment of CBP to the endogenous pS2 promoter</title><p>The above results suggested that EID3 inhibits NR transcription by means of interference with CBP-dependent co-activation. To further dissect these mechanisms, we performed ChIP assays using the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, which expresses endogenous ER&#x003b1; and CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Cells were treated with 10 nM oestradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) for 1 h before harvest, and then proteins were crosslinked to chromatin and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against ER&#x003b1;, CBP or FLAG. The ChIP analysis was performed with primers specific for the pS2 promoter, an established oestrogen-responsive gene. The amplified input DNA did not significantly differ among the samples (data not shown). The immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified with primers that recognize the pS2 mRNA located 2000 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site; no amplicon was detected by real-time PCR after 45 cycles, suggesting that the ER and CBP do not bind to that region of the promoter (data not shown).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, EID1 and EID3 inhibit the recruitment of CBP to the pS2 promoter. However, when comparing the occupancy of ER&#x003b1; at the pS2 promoter in the FLAG transfected cells, there is an &#x0223c;3&#x02013;4 times higher occupancy than in the FLAG-EID1 and FLAG-EID3 transfected cells. This may be the result of the absence of CBP owing to binding of EID1 and EID3, which might be necessary for the proper assembly of cofactors at the ER&#x003b1;-bound pS2 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). There is no occupancy of EID1 and EID3 at the pS2 promoter, indicating that they might bind to CBP before it becomes recruited to the promoter.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we have identified EID3, a third previously uncharacterized EID family member. The exclusive expression of EID3 in testis contrasts to the more ubiquitous expression pattern of the other two members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), indicating that EID3 might have testis-specific functions. However, unlike EID1, EID3 has an extended C-terminal domain of unknown function.</p><p>EID3 shows homology to a region of EID1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that is implicated in binding to CBP/p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, EID3 had a profound inhibitory effect on the transcriptional activity of CBP, indicating functional similarities to EID1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). This is most likely due to the binding of EID3 with the C-terminus of CBP (amino acids 1678&#x02013;2441) observed in co-immunoprecipitation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which indicates a functional conservation of these interactions within the EID family.</p><p>The more potent inhibition of NR transcriptional activity mediated by EID3 compared with EID1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, C and E</xref>) could be due to the fact that a larger fraction of EID3 is primarily located in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, the inhibition seems to be independent of direct interaction of EID3 with the tested NRs, as judged from mammalian two-hybrid interaction assays and sub-cellular co-localization studies (data not shown). These data suggest that EID3 functions as a co-inhibitor of NRs, and probably other CBP/p300-dependent transcription factors, and thus could be involved in the transcriptional control of testicular tissue homeostasis. Moreover, transcriptional activation by NRs, including SF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), ER, GR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) and AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), requires the action of CBP/p300.</p><p>A sequence within the C-terminus, termed the SID, has been mapped to amino acids 2058&#x02013;2130 of CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). The SID has also been reported to interact with other nuclear factors in addition to the p160 proteins, including IRF-3, E1A, p53, Tax, Ets-2 and KSHV IRF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Proteins that bind to the SID have recently been shown to &#x02018;share a sequence motif similar to an amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix in the AD1 domain of the p160s&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Interestingly, we have localized putative amphipathic &#x003b1;-helices in EID1 (amino acids 159&#x02013;167) and EID3 (amino acids 117&#x02013;125) within the conserved EID regions. Moreover, EID1 and EID3 interacts with the SID of CBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) possibly via these amphipathic &#x003b1;-helices, thereby competing with the p160s of the same surface. This might disrupt an NR/co-activator complex at the promoter, leading to a decrease in NR target gene expression as shown in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Consistent with this idea, we have demonstrated that EID1 and EID3 prevent recruitment of CBP to a natural NR-regulated promoter using ChIP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results suggest that EID1 and EID3 interfere with the recruitment of CBP to the promoter-bound ER&#x003b1;/co-activator complex and demonstrate a functional interaction between EID1 and EID3 and CBP <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We propose a model where EID1 and EID3 act as inhibitory &#x02018;anti co-activators&#x02019; that could be critically involved in the fine-tuning of transcription, by targeting the promiscuous co-activators CBP/p300 without interfering with the present transcription factor.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Drs R.
