The function of MelR was investigated by making a targeted deletion in the melR gene of the Escherichia coli chromosome. MelR is a transcription activator essential for melibiose- dependent expression of the melAB operon which is needed for bacterial growth with melibiose as a carbon source. To investigate the interactions of MelR at the melAB promoter, both full length MelR and a shortened derivative, MelR173, containing the C-terminal DNA-binding domain, were purified as fusions to glutathione- S -transferase. Circular permutation studies show that both full-length MelR and MelR173 induce an apparent bend upon binding to target sites at the melAB promoter. Bound full-length MelR, but not MelR173, can oligomerise to form larger complexes that are likely to be involved in transcription activation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
