It requires the concerted action of an endonuclease to remove the intron and a ligase for joining the resulting tRNA halves as studied best in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Here, we report the first characterization of an RNA ligase protein and its gene from a higher eukaryotic organism that is an essential component of the pre-tRNA splicing process. Purification of tRNA ligase from wheat germ by successive column chromatographic steps has identified a protein of 125 kDa by its potentiality to covalently bind AMP, and by its ability to catalyse the ligation of tRNA halves and the circularization of linear introns. Peptide sequences obtained from the purified protein led to the elucidation of the corresponding proteins and their genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Oryza</italic> databases. The plant tRNA ligases exhibit no overall sequence homologies to any known RNA ligases, however, they harbour a number of conserved motifs that indicate the presence of three intrinsic enzyme activities: an adenylyltransferase/ligase domain in the N-terminal region, a polynucleotide kinase in the centre and a cyclic phosphodiesterase domain at the C-terminal end. <italic>In vitro</italic> expression of the recombinant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tRNA ligase and functional analyses revealed all expected individual activities. Plant RNA ligases are active on a variety of substrates <italic>in vitro</italic> and are capable of inter- and intramolecular RNA joining. Hence, we conclude that their role <italic>in vivo</italic> might comprise yet unknown essential functions besides their involvement in pre-tRNA splicing.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA ligases are engaged in a variety of inter- and intramolecular nucleic acid joining reactions such as the repair of broken tRNAs, ligation of tRNA halves and circularization of linear polyribonucleotides including excised introns. Bacteriophage T4 RNA ligase (Rnl 1) is the type member of this group whose reaction mechanisms and structural features have been intensively studied within the last 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). It catalyses the formation of a 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-phosphodiester bond between RNA strands containing a 5&#x02032; terminal phosphate and a 3&#x02032; terminal hydroxyl group. The enzymatic joining reactions involve three reversible steps. First, the enzyme reacts with ATP to form a covalently adenylated enzyme intermediate and pyrophosphate. Second, the AMP is transferred from the ligase&#x02013;adenylate to the 5&#x02032;-phosphate end of an RNA molecule to form an adenylated RNA intermediate, and finally, ligase catalyses the formation of a phosphodiester bond by the reaction of the 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl group with the adenylated 5&#x02032; RNA end and simultaneous release of AMP.</p><p>The function of T4 RNA ligase 1 <italic>in vivo</italic> is to repair a break in the anticodon of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> triggered by phage activation of a host-encoded anticodon nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). The bacterial tRNA<sup>Lys</sup>-specific enzyme cleaves its natural substrate 5&#x02032; to the wobble base, yielding 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate and 5&#x02032;-OH ends which are not substrates for T4 RNA ligase as mentioned above. Consequently, the broken ends must be modified before they can be sealed. This mission is performed by the bacteriophage T4-encoded polynucleotide kinase/3&#x02032;-phosphatase. The bifunctional enzyme converts 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate to a 3&#x02032;-phosphate and then hydrolyses the phosphate leaving a 3&#x02032;-OH group. Second, it transfers the &#x003b3;-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group at the 5&#x02032; end of the cleaved tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> to generate a 5&#x02032;-phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>).</p><p>A novel RNA ligation pathway was discovered in wheat germ extract by Konarska <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). A 73-nt long RNA oligonucleotide called &#x003a9; fragment (derived from tobacco mosaic virus RNA after RNase T1 cleavage) was circularized upon incubation with S30 wheat germ extract provided that the substrate carried 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate and 5&#x02032;-hydroxyl or 5&#x02032;-phosphate termini. Moreover, it was subsequently shown that the plant extract catalysed the formation of an unusual 2&#x02032;-phosphomonoester, 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-phosphodiester linkage in which the 2&#x02032;-phosphate is derived from the RNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Later on, it was reported that the structures of the substrates and products in the yeast ligase reaction are identical to those described for the wheat germ ligase and that yeast RNA ligase participates <italic>in vivo</italic> in the splicing of tRNA precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>Intron-containing tRNA genes were first discovered in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Subsequently, the mechanism of pre-tRNA splicing was deduced in this organism. It turned out that it differs fundamentally from the spliceosome-mediated mRNA splicing and from the self-splicing of group I or group II introns. Three enzymes participate in the tRNA splicing process. Intron-containing pre-tRNAs are first cleaved by a tRNA splicing endonuclease at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; boundaries of the intervening sequence producing paired tRNA halves with 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate, 5&#x02032;-OH ends and a linear intron. Second, the halves are joined by a tRNA ligase requiring GTP and ATP leaving a 2&#x02032;-phosphate and 3&#x02032;-OH at the splice junction. Finally, this phosphate is removed by a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent phosphotransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>The tRNA ligase protein of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> was purified by five chromatographic steps including an affinity elution. The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal end of the protein was determined and utilized for the isolation of the corresponding gene from a library of yeast DNA. The purified yeast tRNA ligase is a monomeric 92 kDa protein that contains three intrinsic activities: an N-terminal adenylyltransferase domain that resembles T4 RNA ligase 1, a central domain that resembles T4 polynucleotide kinase (without 3&#x02032;-phosphatase activity) and a C-terminal cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPDase) domain that is reminiscent of the 2H phosphotransferase enzyme superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). The multifunctional yeast tRNA ligase performs a series of reactions: (i) the 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate at the end of the 5&#x02032; tRNA half is hydrolysed by the CPDase activity to generate a 2&#x02032;-phosphate and 3&#x02032;-OH; (ii) the 5&#x02032;-OH group at the end of the 3&#x02032; tRNA half is phosphorylated by the GTP-dependent kinase activity and (iii) the ligase protein is adenylylated and the AMP is transferred to the 5&#x02032;-phosphate of the 3&#x02032; tRNA half followed by the formation of the 2&#x02032;-phosphomonoester&#x02013;3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-phosphodiester bond and the release of AMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>An RNA ligase was partially purified from wheat germ and has been shown to be associated with a 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphodiesterase and a polynucleotide kinase activity through all chromatographic steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Wheat germ and yeast tRNA ligases share many characteristic features. Both are multifunctional enzymes that harbour the same intrinsic activities within one polypeptide and generate an unusual 2&#x02032;-phosphate at the splice junction. Moreover, yeast tRNA ligase is capable of joining plant tRNA halves derived from intron excision by splicing endonuclease and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Despite this apparent overall similarity in structure and function, a search of the fully sequenced genomes of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> with the yeast sequence as query did not identify a candidate gene for tRNA ligase in either nuclear genome. In fact, to date specific proteins responsible for tRNA ligation in any archaeal or eukaryotic organism&#x02014;with the exception of yeast and its fungal relatives&#x02014;have not yet been identified nor have their genes been cloned.</p><p>Here, we report the chromatographic purification of the tRNA ligase protein from wheat germ and the identification of the coding genes in two plant nuclear genomes by means of protein sequencing of the wheat enzyme. Furthermore, we present enzymatic studies with the overexpressed recombinant tRNA ligase from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> that demonstrate the functional relationship of plant and yeast ligases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Purification of the tRNA ligase from wheat germ</title><p>All operations were carried out at 4&#x000b0;C. Buffer A [50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% Triton X-100, 4 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol (&#x003b2;-ME), 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.2 mM benzamidine, 0.4 &#x003bc;g/ml pepstatin A and 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin] was used for all chromatographic steps with the salt concentrations as indicated.</p><p><italic>Step 1</italic>. Wheat embryos (140 g) were prepared from crude wheat germs (Sigma, W-0125) by immersing the germs successively in 500 ml cyclohexan and the air-dried material was ground in an electric mill.

The S30 extract (400 ml; total protein = 60 g) was subsequently centrifuged for 90 min at 100&#x02009;000 <italic>g</italic> to remove membranes and ribosomes. The final S100 extract (280 ml; total protein = 28 g) was brought to 0.1% Polymin P (polyethyleneimine; Sigma, M&#x000fc;nchen, Germany) by the addition of 2.8 ml of 10% Polymin P, pH 7.5, and stirred for additional 10 min.

The supernatant (280 ml) was brought to 50% ammonium sulfate by the addition of 280 ml saturated ammonium sulfate solution in 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.5. After stirring for 1 h, the precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 10&#x02009;000 <italic>g</italic>. The pellet was dissolved in 1 litre of buffer A and diluted to a conductivity equivalent to that of 180 mM KCl (1600 ml; total protein = 16 g).</p><p><italic>Step 3</italic>. The diluted (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> material was loaded onto a 40 ml Heparin Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) previously equilibrated with 180 mM KCl in buffer A.

The pooled fractions from the Blue Trisacryl M column were loaded onto a 1 ml Source S15 column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with 100 mM KCl in buffer A. The column was eluted with a 10 ml linear gradient of 100&#x02013;400 mM KCl. The active fractions eluted between 180 and 240 mM KCl. They were pooled (2.5 ml; total protein = 3 mg) and directly used for the analysis by gel filtration.</p><p><italic>Step 6</italic>. The gel filtration was performed with a prepacked HiLoad&#x02122; 16/60 Superdex 200 PC column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 200 mM KCl in buffer A. The pooled fractions from the Source S15 column were applied to the Superdex 200 column and separation was performed with a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. At this step of the purification procedure, the tRNA ligase protein was identified by its ability to covalently bind AMP upon incubation with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP. Wheat germ RNA ligase eluted as an enzyme with an apparent native molecular mass of 160 kDa as deduced from comparison with standard proteins. Analysis of the protein pattern by silver staining of appropriate fractions separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE revealed the presence of various polypeptides in addition to the tRNA ligase protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and a single adenylylated protein of &#x0223c;125 kDa in the corresponding autoradiogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p><italic>Step 7</italic>.

After a brief staining with Coomassie brilliant blue, &#x0223c;5 &#x003bc;g of the 125 kDa protein was excised from the gel. Protein sequence analysis was performed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of RNA substrates</title><p>The original clone pNtY9, carrying an intron-containing tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> gene on an EcoRI fragment of 7.5 kb was isolated from a <italic>Nicotiana rustica</italic> genomic library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Subsequent PCR and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis yielded a 124 bp long fragment cloned into the SmaI site of pUC19 DNA in which the tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> gene was flanked by a T7 RNA polymerase promoter at the 5&#x02032; side and a BstNI restriction site at the 3&#x02032; side. The first base pair in the aminoacyl stem of the tRNA was exchanged from C1&#x02013;G72 to G1&#x02013;C72 in order to facilitate efficient transcription by T7 RNA polymerase.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Since wheat germ RNA ligase is active on a variety of synthetic substrates, they used a poly(A) substrate, containing 5&#x02032;-phosphate and 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate termini in their assays. In this first series, the wheat RNA ligase was partially purified and shown to be associated with 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphodiesterase activity. Later on, an improved procedure was developed for the extensive purification of wheat germ RNA ligase and it was shown that RNA ligase, cyclic phosphodiesterase and polynucleotidkinase activity co-purified through all chromatographic steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>The putative function of wheat RNA ligase <italic>in vivo</italic> remained obscure, until the cloning and identification of the first intron-containing tRNA gene in a plant nuclear genome, which codes for a functional <italic>Nicotiana</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>).

The ORF of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) was cloned into the expression vector pIVEX WG 1.3 to generate a recombinant protein with a histidine tag at the C-terminus. Incubation of the vector DNA was carried out in a 50 &#x003bc;l reaction mixture in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine. Analysis of the newly synthesized labelled proteins revealed that a single polypeptide, corresponding in size to the expected full-length recombinant tRNA ligase (&#x0223c;125 kDa), and virtually no smaller polypeptides had been produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, right panel, lane a). The His-tagged protein was purified by affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA column under native conditions. The major portion eluted in the fractions with 500 mM imidazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes d and e) and aliquots of this material were subsequently used for functional studies without further treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Recombinant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tRNA ligase has similar activities as its yeast counterpart</title><p>The ultimate function of tRNA ligase is the joining of tRNA halves in the splicing process. We have used a plant intron-containing pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> (NtY9-T7-M1) transcript as a substrate for assaying splicing activity throughout the first chromatographic steps for the purification of wheat tRNA ligase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The wheat tRNA endonuclease co-purifies together with tRNA ligase until to the Source S15 chromatography and this endogenous activity generates a sufficient amount of tRNA halves to pinpoint ligase activity. At the final purification steps, we have identified the tRNA ligase protein solely by its ability to covalently bind AMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>For our subsequent functional studies of recombinant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tRNA ligase, we have established the generation of tRNA halves at high quantities <italic>in vitro</italic> by means of recombinant splicing endonuclease from <italic>M.jannaschii</italic> and an appropriate substrate. The functional <italic>M.jannaschii</italic> endonuclease consists of four identical subunits of 21 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Like all archaeal splicing endonucleases, it recognizes a highly conserved intron structure, the so-called bulge&#x02013;helix&#x02013;bulge (BHB) motif, consisting of two bulge loops of 3 nt separated by a helical region of 4 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). The intron structure of the plant pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>, a natural substrate, chosen to date for our splicing assays exhibits similarities to the conserved archaeal intron structure, however, the two bulge loops each consist of 4 nt instead of 3 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Hence, we have constructed a chimeric intron-containing pre-tRNA as a substrate for the <italic>M.jannaschii</italic> endonuclease, containing most of the mature domain from the plant pre-tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> and the intron as well as the anticodon from <italic>Methanocaldococcus</italic> pre-tRNA<sup>Trp</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The archaeal splicing endonuclease was efficiently expressed in the RTS 100 wheat germ lysate (not shown) and the recombinant enzyme purified by Ni-NTA chromatography was active, yielding 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; tRNA halves and a linear intron upon incubation with the synthetic archeuka pre-tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These purified RNA substrates were subsequently used for ligation assays.</p><p>Appropriate amounts of tRNA halves together with the linear intron were incubated in splicing buffer under various conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In the two control assays (lanes b and c), the incubated substrates remained unaltered as expected. In all four reactions that contained RNA ligases of different origin including the newly identified recombinant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tRNA ligase, the spliced mature tRNA resulting from ligation of 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; halves was produced efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes d&#x02013;g). Moreover, the linear intron was converted to its circular form in all assays, albeit in reduced amounts in the presence of yeast tRNA ligase (lane f). In order to emphasize the different substrate specificities of plant and yeast tRNA ligases, we have carried out a time course experiment as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. The intermolecular ligation of 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; tRNA halves by plant and yeast RNA ligase proceeds by a similar kinetics whereas the intramolecular joining reaction differs considerably. After 2 min of incubation, the linear intron is converted completely to its circular form in the presence of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tRNA ligase. However, at the same time of incubation &#x0223c;95% of the linear intron has not yet been circularized in the presence of equal amounts of yeast tRNA ligase. The amount of synthesized circular intron increases up to 40% upon further incubation for 30 min.</p><p>A major feature of plant and yeast tRNA ligases is their ability to generate a 2&#x02032;-phosphate at the splice junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). We have therefore investigated the spliced tRNA and the circular intron in more detail. For this purpose, we have recovered the [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]UTP-labelled RNA products from preparative gels originating from the incubation with different RNA ligase preparations. The newly formed 2&#x02032;-phosphomonoester, 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-phosphodiester linkage is resistant to alkali and a number of ribonucleases, such as RNase T1, RNase P1 and RNase T2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Consequently, cleavage of spliced tRNA&#x02014;produced by the action of wheat, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and yeast tRNA ligase&#x02014;yields a long RNase T1-resistant 15mer-oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lanes a&#x02013;c) that spans the region around the splice junction (i.e. <graphic xlink:href="gki174s1.jpg" mimetype="image" position="anchor"/>), which does not appear in digests derived from T4-generated spliced tRNA. Instead, an 8mer oligonucleotide occurs that originates from the 5&#x02032; end of the 3&#x02032; half of archeuka pre-tRNA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating RNase T1 cleavage at the splice junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lane d). The 15mer- and 8mer-oligonucleotides were excised from the gel and subjected to further digestions with either RNase T2 or RNase P1. The occurrence of radioactive products with mobilities expected for the non-cleavable dinucleotides <graphic xlink:href="gki174s2.jpg" mimetype="image" position="anchor"/> and <graphic xlink:href="gki174s3.jpg" mimetype="image" position="anchor"/>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>, lanes a-c), confirm that all three different eukaryotic tRNA ligases have joined the tRNA halves via a 2&#x02032;-phosphomonoester, 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-phosphodiester linkage, whereas the combined action of T4 RNA ligase and T4 polynucleotide kinase/3&#x02032;-phosphatase has resulted in a normal 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-phosphodiester bond. A similar picture emerges after cleavage of the circular introns with RNase T2. The non-cleavable dinucleotide <graphic xlink:href="gki174s4.jpg" mimetype="image" position="anchor"/> is visible only in molecules produced by the eukaryotic RNA ligases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, lanes a&#x02013;c).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>After the discovery of a novel RNA ligase activity in wheat germ about 20 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), numerous efforts have been made to isolate the ligase protein. The RNA ligase was eventually purified &#x0223c;6000-fold from crude extracts of wheat germ and it was found that it sedimented as a single peak in a glycerol gradient with a coefficient of 6.2S corresponding to a protein doublet of 110 kDa in silver-stained polyacrylamide gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>We were able to purify the wheat tRNA ligase to near homogeneity by six consecutive chromatographic steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) and the amount of 5 &#x003bc;g purified protein was sufficient for subsequent sequence analyses. Moreover, the peptide sequences obtained from the wheat protein identified the corresponding proteins and their genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Oryza</italic> databases. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tRNA ligase protein of 1104 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) has a molecular mass of 123 kDa and a pI of 8.0 and the <italic>Oryza</italic> protein of 1117 amino acids has a molecular mass of 124 kDa and a pI of 8.5. Although <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Oryza</italic> represent plants of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous origin, they express 63% identity of their amino acid sequences. A number of known ESTs from other higher plants all confirm the remarkable similarity of plant tRNA ligases, whereas the overall concordance of amino acid sequences between plant and fungal tRNA ligases is not significant. This explains why previous database searches with the yeast protein sequence as query failed to identify the corresponding plant proteins. In spite of the deviation in amino acid sequences, the physical order of intrinsic enzymatic activities and the corresponding signature elements have been conserved in plant and fungal tRNA ligases supporting earlier observations about their similar activities <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>).</p><p>In the N-terminal adenylyltransferase domain of plant RNA ligases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the sequence <bold>K</bold>HS<bold>G</bold> represents the motif Lig I (KxxG) that is conserved in all RNA and DNA ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). The lysine residue forms a covalently ligase (lysyl-N)&#x02013;AMP intermediate, one of the steps required for the subsequent ligation process. A number of additional motifs are responsible for the formation of an RNA&#x02013;adenylate intermediate and for phosphodiester synthesis, two of which (i.e. Lig IIIa and Lig IV) are contained in the plant enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In the multifunctional yeast tRNA ligase, the central region harbours a polynucleotide kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) that is defined by the NTP-binding P-loop motif (GxxGxGKS) identified also in the well-studied coliphage T4 polynucleotide kinase and other phosphotransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). A putative P-loop element (i.e. GIPG<sup>S</sup>/<sub>C</sub>AKS) is present in plant tRNA ligases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) that might exert polynucleotide kinase activity. A major difference between the coliphage T4 and the yeast/plant-induced ligation process is the modification at the 3&#x02032; end that precedes joining of RNA molecules. The 3&#x02032;-phosphatase activity contained in the bifunctional T4 polynucleotide kinase enzyme converts the 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate to a 3&#x02032;-phosphate followed by removal of the phosphate group, whereas the cyclic phosphodiesterase activity (CPDase) in the C-terminal domain of the trifunctional yeast enzyme opens the cyclic terminus at the 3&#x02032; end leaving the phosphate in the 2&#x02032; position. This 2&#x02032;-phosphate is retained during the subsequent ligation process generating a 2&#x02032;-phosphomonoester, 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-phosphodiester linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). Two conserved tetrapeptides with histidine residues at the first positions are essential for CPDases as well as for CPDase activities contained in multifunctional enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) and corresponding tetrapeptides can also be detected in the C-terminal region of plant ligases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Evidence for all of the presumed activities in the newly characterized plant tRNA ligases derives from our findings that (i) the purified enzyme is adenylylated in the presence of [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), that (ii) <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized tRNA half molecules carrying 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate and 5&#x02032;-hydroxyl ends are ligated by recombinant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tRNA ligase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, lane e) and that (iii) a free 2&#x02032;-phosphate is left at the splice junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A&#x02013;D</xref>).</p><p>The major ligation reaction mechanism in vertebrates differs from that in fungi or plants. During pre-tRNA splicing in HeLa cell extract, the 3&#x02032; terminal phosphate of 5&#x02032; half molecules is incorporated into a normal 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-phosphodiester linkage at the splice junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). So far, neither the vertebrate ligase protein nor the exact mechanism of action of this ligation process is known. Recently, it has been demonstrated by Zillmann <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>) that a plant-like splicing machinery exists also in HeLa cells. However, a search of the fully sequenced human genome with the plant tRNA ligase as query did not identify a candidate gene for a putative tRNA ligase suggesting that mammalian and plant ligases have diverged as much as have the fungal and plant enzymes.</p><p>All known eukaryotic nuclear genomes code for intron-containing tRNA genes and without doubt, tRNA ligases play an essential role in pre-tRNA splicing. The question arises whether tRNA ligases are also involved in other cellular processes. An unexpected link to mRNA metabolism has been the discovery that yeast tRNA ligase is responsible for non-spliceosomal splicing of mRNA in the unfolded protein response pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). A more general task of tRNA ligases might be their participation in the repair of broken tRNAs, as is the major function <italic>in vivo</italic> of the coliphage T4-induced ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). In this connection, it should be noted that the single-stranded anticodon loop of tRNAs is the most vulnerable part for chemical and/or enzymatic hydrolysis. Interestingly, ligation of endogenous 3&#x02032; half molecules to their corresponding 5&#x02032; halves of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> (UGC) and tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> (UGG) via 2&#x02032;-phosphomonoester, 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-phosphodiester bonds has been observed in extracts of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). These tRNA halves definitely did not originate from tRNA splicing, because (i) the corresponding tRNA genes in known plant genomes are intronless and (ii) cleavage occurred within the anticodon and not at the highly conserved splice site one nucleotide 3&#x02032; of the anticodon.</p><p>In animal and plant systems, infectious pathogens are known that rely on yet undefined RNA ligases for their propagation. Hepatitis &#x003b4; virus (HDV) replicates its circular RNA genome of 1679 nt via a rolling circle mechanism. The long intermediates are cleaved to unit-length RNA molecules by an intrinsic ribozyme. Apparently, a host-specific activity present in mammalian cells is capable of joining HDV molecules in both bimolecular and intramolecular reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). Similarly, a cellular activity might be utilized during the replication of viroids, which are non-coding circular RNAs of about 300 nt that cause severe diseases in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). Like HDV, viroids replicate though a rolling-circle mechanism and the oligomeric RNAs are subsequently cleaved by specific RNases or by hammerhead ribozymes. It has been demonstrated that linear viroid RNA molecules were circularized <italic>in vitro</italic> by incubation with wheat germ or <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). Moreover, monomeric circular forms of a number of viroids were formed in transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants transformed with dimeric transcripts, indicating the activity of both, RNases and ligases in this host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>).</p><p>As mentioned above, wheat germ tRNA ligase and the recombinant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tRNA ligase catalyse not only the joining of tRNA halves but also the circularization of linear introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes d and e, and C) and of various natural and synthetic oligo-and polyribonucleotides, provided they carry 2&#x02032;,3&#x02032;-cyclic phosphate and 5&#x02032;-OH ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>). In contrast, yeast tRNA ligase shows a high degree of specificity. Joining of tRNA halves by the yeast enzyme is 10<sup>4</sup>-fold more efficient than joining of artificial oligoribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) and the products of pre-tRNA splicing in yeast nuclear extract are mature tRNAs and linear intron molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>). These earlier results are confirmed by our observation that the conversion of linear to circular introns follows different kinetics with plant and yeast RNA ligase, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The broad substrate range of plant tRNA ligase clearly suggests that the action of this enzyme is not limited to pre-tRNA splicing or tRNA repair but that it participates in other yet undetected cellular processes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Professor H.

(<bold>A</bold>) The [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]UTP-labelled spliced tRNAs (76 nt) synthesized in the presence of different RNA ligase preparations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), i.e. wheat tRNA ligase (lane a), recombinant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> tRNA ligase (lane b), recombinant yeast tRNA ligase (lane c) and a mixture of T4 RNA ligase and T4 polynucleotide kinase/3&#x02032;-phosphatase (lane d) were recovered from a preparative gel and digested with RNase T1. The labelled T1-oligonucleotides ranging in size from 1 to 15 nt were separated on a 40-cm-long 20% polyacrylamide/8 M urea gel. Oligonucleotides &#x02264;6 nt migrated with the buffer front. (<bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>) The 15mer T1-resistant oligonucleotides and the 8mer oligonucleotide were excised from the gel and digested with RNase T2 (B) or with RNase P1 (C). Analysis of labelled Nps or pNs was by thin-layer chromatography (t. l. c.) on cellulose plates in solvent A. (<bold>D</bold>) The UTP-labelled circular introns (21 nt) synthesized in the presence of different RNA ligase preparations [as described in (A)] were recovered from a preparative gel and digested with RNase T2. Analysis of Nps was by t. l. c. in solvent B. Positions of markers are indicated.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gki174f7"/></fig></sec></back></article>
