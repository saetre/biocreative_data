Nine SNPs were not sufficient to improve the discrimination power over that of nongenetic predictors for risk of cardiovascular events. Finally, in Crohn's disease, a model of five SNPs, one with a quite low odds ratio of 0.26, has an AUC of only 0.66. Our analyses and examples show that strong association, although very valuable for establishing etiological hypotheses, does not guarantee effective discrimination between cases and controls. The scientific community should be cautious to avoid overstating the value of association findings in terms of personalized medicine before their time.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent successes in the discoveries of potentially causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for complex diseases hold great promise, and commercialization of genomics in personalized medicine has already begun. A number of companies now offer, for relatively modest fees, personalized genomics services that provide individualized disease-risk estimates based on genome-wide SNP genotyping. Most companies offering such profiling make it clear that they are not a clinical service and that their calculations are not intended for diagnostic or prognostic purposes. They typically advise their clients to consult their health care provider for more information. In most cases, people would turn to their general physician <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Mitka1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as noted by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Feero1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Goetz1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, few doctors currently have enough genetics training to actually make sense of the risk calculations now commercially offered. Many physicians seem to feel the same way. In surveys in five European countries, physicians ranked the disciplines in which they felt they needed more training to overcome future challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Calefato1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-JulianReynier1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In all countries, the top ranked area was &#x0201c;genetics of common disease,&#x0201d; and ranked second was &#x0201c;approaching genetic risk assessment in clinical practice.&#x0201d;</p><p>Not only are risk results likely to be often poorly understood by the tested individuals and their physicians, but also these results are often based on risk models, such as logistic regression models, that may not be good classification models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Pepe1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the disclaimer made by the companies that their services are not intended as medical advice cannot be overemphasized. Current knowledge of the role of most genes in complex diseases is at the group level of correlations of disease status with SNPs. Most of these SNPs were discovered via genetic association studies aimed at finding variants correlated with disease risk. It is hoped that these discoveries will provide insights into the pathogenesis and etiology, and ultimately lead to developments of new treatments or preventive therapies. Assuming these SNPs will also be effective classifiers, they are now being used in individual-level risk estimation, classification, and clinical decision-making. However, for many complex diseases, such as the ones discussed here (age-related macular degeneration &#x0005b;AMD&#x0005d;, type II diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease &#x0005b;Crohn's disease&#x0005d;, and cardiovascular disease), it is arguable whether the era of genomics in personalized medicine is here yet. In this article, we discuss and explore how useful highly associated SNPs might be for individual-level risk estimation and prediction. Our focus will be on the classification accuracy of genetic testing, with an emphasis on two popular statistical methods for evaluating biomarkers. We give realistic real-data examples that illustrate that, currently, the genetic information is of limited value for personalized medicine. We also discuss and apply risk-based and classification-based analysis approaches to our AMD data.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Two Statistical Methods</title><p>There are two basic statistical approaches for evaluating markers. The risk-based approach models the risk as a function of marker(s), often with adjustment for covariates, and is commonly applied in genetic studies. In case-control studies, this is done with logistic regression, and the markers with the strongest effect on disease risk are those associated with the smallest <italic>p</italic>-values and most extreme odds ratios (ORs). The other method, the classification-based approach, evaluates markers based on how well they can discriminate between cases and controls. The performance is evaluated by various measures, such as the proportion of positive test results among cases or the true positive fraction (TPF, or sensitivity) and the proportion of positive test results among controls or the false positive fraction (FPF, or 1&#x02212;specificity). A perfect classifier will assign a positive test result to everyone with the condition (TPF&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;sensitivity&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1) and a negative test result to everyone without the condition (FPF&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0, specificity&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1). Often more than one possible grouping into cases and controls is possible based on a classifier. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a plot of all (FPF, TPF) pairs for each possible grouping. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a popular measure of the discrimination power of a classifier. It is the probability that given two random individuals, one who will develop the disease and the other who will not, the classifier will assign the former a positive test result and the latter a negative result. Theoretically, the AUC can take values between 0 and 1, but the practical lower bound is 0.5; a perfect classifier has an AUC of 1. Classifiers with an AUC significantly greater than 0.5 have at least some ability to discriminate between cases and controls. However, for screening of individuals with an increased risk of disease, it is suggested that the AUC be &#x0003e;0.75, and for presymptomatic diagnosis of the general population, the AUC should be &#x0003e;0.99 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Janssens1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. When prognosis is the goal, one typically also evaluates the classification model by two additional measures: (1) the proportion of individuals who will develop the disease among those with a positive test result, or the positive predictive value (PPV), and (2) the proportion of individuals who will not develop the disease among those with negative test result, or the negative predictive value (NPV) (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s10a">Box 1</xref>). We note in passing that there are other methods that model classification performance and have been applied in genetic studies, including, for example, genetic algorithms, generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction, and random forests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Dunai1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Jakobsdottir1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Various TPF and FPF pairs and various values of the AUC can correspond to the same OR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000337-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, the OR by itself cannot give a meaningful indication of the probability of being correctly classified as case (TPF) or of the probability of being wrongly classified as a case (FPF), and alone its value is essentially useless to the individual.</p><p>The clinical utility of predictive genetic profiling for complex diseases rests on at least two conditions: (1) preventive means with high efficacy in the general population are available, and (2) these preventive means will also be effective in the genetically high-risk cohorts. Additionally, it is worth noting that for many complex diseases, known preventive lifestyle changes are broadly beneficial: weight loss, smoking cessation, blood pressure control, regular exercise, diets enriched with fruits and vegetables, etc., so to many individuals, it might be wasteful to spend &#x00024;1,000 to find out they are genetically at increased risk for some condition only to have their doctor tell them all they can do is to lose weight and stop smoking. On the other hand, if the person is more likely to make lifestyle changes and stick to them, then the benefits can be great, both for the individual and the population as whole. Of course, the flip side is what the actions will be if the genetic test suggests lower than average risk for one or more specific conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Reclassification</title><p>The AUC attempts to measure the ability of a model to discriminate between cases and controls for a set of cutoff values that separate the two groups. However, on an individual basis, we also want the model to provide the best possible estimation of that person's risk. One way to compare the accuracy of individual-level risk estimates of different risk models is to use the reclassification table approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Cook1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Pencina1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In this approach, one measures how often subjects are estimated to be in different risk strata when different risk models are applied and whether the reclassification more accurately stratifies individuals into higher or lower risk strata. A marker that has a modest or no effect on the AUC can improve risk classification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Cook1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, suppose we are comparing two risk models that differ regarding a single individual's membership in the 20&#x00025;&#x02013;30&#x00025; risk stratum versus the 10&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025; risk stratum. If both models achieve the best discrimination by classifying everyone below the 40&#x00025; risk threshold as controls and everyone above as cases, then the TPF and FPF will not be altered due to this person's reclassification, but one model is more accurate than the other in terms of the true value of the individual's risk estimate.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Examples</title><p>We now provide several examples, from the literature as well as from our own data, illustrating that although a set of SNPs can be strongly associated with disease risk with extremely small <italic>p</italic>-values, that same set of SNPs may not necessarily have high discrimination ability or may not dramatically improve the discrimination ability of a classification model constructed using &#x0201c;conventional&#x0201d; nongenetic risk factors without the SNPs.</p><sec id="s7a"><title>Risk of Cardiovascular Events</title><p>In a recent replication study of nine SNPs associated with levels of either low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, Kathiresan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Kathiresan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> created a genotype score on the basis of the total number of unfavorable alleles at these risk SNPs, and investigated the classification accuracy of the genotype score and the effect on reclassification beyond standard risk factors for cardiovascular events.

If we now look at the integrated predictiveness and classification plot for the three-factor model, we see that the TPF and FPF pair 74&#x00025; and 31&#x00025; corresponds to the 35&#x00025; risk percentile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000337-g004">Figure 4</xref>, bottom panel), which then corresponds to choosing an AMD risk of 4&#x00025; as the cutoff point for classifying individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000337-g004">Figure 4</xref>, top panel). Those with risk greater than 4&#x00025; are assumed to be at high risk and are classified as cases, and those with lower risk are classified as controls. To illustrate this, suppose we have a population of size 1,000 and a prevalence of 5.5&#x00025; (which is the prevalence of advanced AMD in the U.S. in white individuals 65 y or older according to Friedman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Friedman1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and the U.S. 2000 census data&#x02014;see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000337.s001">Text S1</xref> for further details). If the prevalence is 5.5&#x00025;, there would be 55 cases in our population. Of those 55 cases, 74&#x00025;, or 41, would be correctly considered to be at high risk of AMD, and 31&#x00025;, or 293, of the true 945 controls would be wrongly assumed to be at high risk. Therefore, out of the 334 (41&#x0002b;293) individuals in the high-risk group, 88&#x00025; should actually be in the low-risk group, or in other words, the PPV would be only 12&#x00025; (i.e., 100&#x00025;&#x02212;88&#x00025;). When designing a clinical trial to test preventive therapies in high-risk cohorts based on genotyping alone, it may or may not be cost effective to have 12&#x00025; (instead of 5.5&#x00025;) of the study cohort as true cases. However, as a clinical test, it may be considered unethical to needlessly alarm 88&#x00025; of the high-risk cohort, especially when limited treatment and preventive options are available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Young1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pgen-1000337-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000337.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Integrated predictiveness and classification plot for the three-factor model.</title><p>The light-gray lines show how the plots are used in the examples given in the text: the dashed lines are for the first example with TPF&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;74&#x00025;, FPF&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;31&#x00025;, risk percentile&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;35&#x00025;, and AMD risk threshold&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4&#x00025;; and the dotted lines are for the second example with AMD risk threshold&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;25&#x00025;, risk percentile&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;85&#x00025;, TPF&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;17&#x00025;, and FPF&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5&#x00025;.

Our case-control data presented here do not fully measure the ability of genetic data to predict future disease status (prognosis) for several reasons: (1) AMD prevalence increases with age, (2) females have higher prevalence in all age groups compared to males, (3) females live longer, (4) the FPF derived from case-control data is overestimated because some controls will develop AMD as the cohort ages, (5) the case/control counts are unbalanced, so our sample may not be optimal for estimating the classification accuracy of the markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Janes1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, and (6) the estimates of the ORs, and estimates from most other AMD case-control studies, are based on the comparison of extreme phenotypes: a group of individuals with advanced AMD are contrasted with a control group of individuals with no or very minimal clinical findings. Therefore, they very likely overestimate the RR and the discrimination power for individuals with intermediate clinical findings. Even accounting for all these issues in an optimistic manner, the overall conclusions of our analysis are unlikely to change dramatically. Proper analyses of longitudinal cohort data using survival analysis techniques could lead to a more precise assessment of the potential value of genetic data in predicting lifetime AMD status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Moskowitz1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Pepe3">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The major achievements that have been made in understanding the genetics of AMD are well known, and the AMD discoveries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Edwards1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Rivera1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> are widely mentioned as the first &#x0201c;proof&#x0201d; that genome-wide association analysis works (although the majority of the AMD studies were not genome-wide association studies, but rather targeted searches following up regions of linkage).

However, as we discuss here using real data and theoretical examples, strong association does not necessarily guarantee good classification or discrimination ability. Before using association results for classification and risk estimation purposes, we need to establish their effectiveness formally using appropriate measures and, ideally, appropriate study designs. Additionally, when evaluating the improvement in the predictive value by adding a marker to a prediction model, we may need to use additional measures besides the AUC, such as reclassification tables.</p><p>In our examples, we saw that the addition of nine highly significant risk SNPs to the risk model could not improve the discrimination power for cardiovascular events beyond standard risk factors. For type 2 diabetes, the classification rule based on 12 SNPs gave an AUC of only 0.64, a value that is well below the guidelines of 0.75 and 0.99 cutoffs for screening and prognosis purposes, respectively. For Crohn's disease, a classification model based on five SNPs gave an AUC of only 0.66, and for prostate cancer, a model of two SNPs achieves an AUC of only 0.56. Both values are well below the 0.75 and 0.99 cutoffs. For AMD, the AUC of a model with three SNPs was 0.80, but the proportion of positive test results among affected individuals was only 30&#x00025;, 12&#x00025;, and 3&#x00025;, depending on assumed prevalence (15&#x00025;, 5.5&#x00025;, and 1.5&#x00025;, respectively). The results of these four examples, although somewhat disappointing, are not surprising given the theoretical results of Janssens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Janssens1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000337-Janssens2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> that indicate that achieving a high AUC requires a much larger number of genetic variants than we have to date. For example, Janssens et al. demonstrated that for genetic profiling, on average 80 common variants with ORs of 1.25 each were needed to develop a model useful for identification of high-risk individuals (AUC&#x0003e;0.80).</p><p>Even though our examples illustrate that highly associated SNPs may not be effective as classifiers, it should not be concluded that the association findings are not important nor that association studies are not valuable. In many cases, the association discoveries have and will continue to result in new etiological hypotheses previously not considered.
