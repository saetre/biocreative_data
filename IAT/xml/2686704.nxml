The biosynthesis of testosterone in Leydig cells is strictly dependent on luteinizing hormone (LH). On the other hand, it can be directly inhibited by excessive glucocorticoid (Corticosterone, CORT, in rats) which is beyond the protective capability of 11beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) and type 2 (11beta-HSD2; encoded by gene Hsd11b2 in rats) in Leydig cells. Our previous study found that LH increases 11beta-HSD1 expression in rat Leydig cells, but the effect of LH on the expression and activity of 11beta-HSD2 is not investigated yet.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The Leydig cells were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats (90 days of age). After Leydig cells were incubated either for 24 h with various concentrations of LH (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 ng/mL) or for different time periods (2, 8, 12 and 24 h) with 20 ng/mL LH, the mRNA expression of 11beta-HSD2 was measured by real-time PCR. 11beta-HSD2 protein levels in Leydig cells were assayed by Western Blot and 11beta-HSD2 enzyme activity was determined by calculating the ratio of conversion of [3H]CORT to [3H]11-dehydrocorticosterone by 24 h after stimulation with 20 ng/ml LH. Four reporter gene plasmids containing various lengths of Hsd11b2 promoter region were constructed and transfected into mouse Leydig tumor cells to investigate the effect of LH on Hsd11b2 transcription. A glucocorticoid-responsive reporter gene plasmid, GRE-Luc, was constructed. To evaluate influence of LH on intracellular glucocorticoid level, rat Leydig cells were transfected with GRE-Luc, and luciferase activities were measured after incubation with CORT alone or CORT plus LH.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We observed dose- and temporal-dependent induction of rat 11beta-HSD2 mRNA expression in Leydig cells subject to LH stimulation. The protein and enzyme activity of 11beta-HSD2 and the luciferase activity of reporter gene driven by promoter regions of Hsd11b2 were increased by LH treatment. LH decreased the glucocorticoid-induced luciferase activity of GRE-Luc reporter gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the present study suggest that LH increases the expression and enzyme activity of 11beta-HSD2, and therefore enhances capacity for oxidative inactivation of glucocorticoid in rat Leydig cells in vitro.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In the male, the Leydig cell, in the interstitium of testis, is the primary source of sexual steroid hormone testosterone, which stimulates differentiation of the male phenotype and spermatogenesis in the testes. Leydig cells are mainly stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH), the gonadotropic hormone secreted by pituitary gland. On the other hand, many studies had established that the high level of glucocorticoid, which could be caused pathologically by Cushing's syndrome or psychologically by stress, results in the decrease in testosterone secretion, whereby reduced libido and fertility are brought on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, our previous study found that the endogenous glucocorticoid (Corticosterone, CORT, in rats) at physiological level is also able to suppress the secretion of testosterone in rat Leydig cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In our another study, it was shown that administration of stress level of glucocorticoid induces apoptosis of Leydig cells <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It suggests that glucocorticoid could decrease testosterone production by Leydig cells through reducing the number of Leydig cells as well as inhibiting the expression of testosterone biosynthesis enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The adverse effect of glucocorticoid on testosterone biosynthesis is a direct glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mediated process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The intracellular concentration of glucocorticoid, which determines the extent of GR activation, is regulated by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11&#x003b2;-HSD) in Leydig cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. To date, two isoforms of 11&#x003b2;-HSD are identified. 11&#x003b2;-HSD Type I (11&#x003b2;-HSD1) is a NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH dependent oxidoreductase with low affinity (km = 2 &#x003bc;M) for glucocorticoid, reversibly converting biologically active glucocorticoid (corticosterone in rats) to inactive 11-keto steroid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Its direction of enzyme activity is determined by redox potential in different cell types and differentiation stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In rat Leydig cells, 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 is a predominant oxidase, playing a protective role in the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoid on steroid biosynthesis of Leydig cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].11&#x003b2;-HSD Type II (11&#x003b2;-HSD2; encoded by rat gene <italic>Hsd11b2</italic>) is a NAD<sup>+ </sup>dependent oxidase with high-affinity (Km = 15 nM), inactivating glucocorticoid to its inert metabolite (11-dehydrocorticosterone in rats) unidirectionally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Both of two isoforms of 11&#x003b2;-HSD are expressed in rat Leydig cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although the expression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 is 1000-fold lower relative to 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 in rat Leydig cells, the former is still thought of as an important factor, at least equivalent to 11&#x003b2;-HSD1, of modulating the intracellular level of glucocorticoid due to its high affinity for substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In a word, the excessive glucocorticoid directly inhibits testosterone biosynthesis when it exceeds the capacity of oxidative inactivation by 11&#x003b2;-HSD in Leydig cells. In light of the important role of 11&#x003b2;-HSD in modulating glucocorticoid-mediated suppression of testosterone secretion, our previous study had been performed to investigate whether the expression and activity of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 is regulated by LH, the primary trophic and stimulating hormone for Leydig cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The results showed that although LH increases the expression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 mRNA and protein compared with control cells, the net oxidative activity of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 was reduced. A study had shown that gonadotropic hormone which can be used as a functional homologue of LH in teleosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] could increase expression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 in Tilapia testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], but whether LH could regulates its expression in mammalian Leydig cells and whereby affects the intracellular concentration of glucocorticoids is unknown. The present study is designed to investigate the effect of LH on expression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 in rat Leydig cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and animals</title><p>Corticosterone (C2505), Luteinizing hormone (L5259), bovine lipoprotein (L3626), Percoll (P1644) and DMEM-Ham's F12 (D2906) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical (St. Louis, Missouri, USA).

The rationale is that the transcriptional activity of GRE-Luc which contains two copies of a consensus GRE upstream of the luciferase gene is subject to the extent of GR activation, i.e. intracellular glucocorticoid concentration set by the total oxidative activity of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 and 11&#x003b2;-HSD2, thus the effect of LH on the transcriptional activity of GRE-Luc is indicative of the oxidative capacity of Leydig cells for glucocorticoid. Rat Leydig cells were isolated and cultured in 24 well culture plates (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>/well) in fresh medium for 48 h. Then, 1.0 &#x003bc;g of GRE-Luc and 0.01 &#x003bc;g of pRL-TK (Promega) reporter plasmid were transiently transfected into the Leydig cells using Lipofectamine&#x02122; 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After another 48 h of culture, the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of LH (20 ng/mL) for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells pretreated with LH were treated with CORT (50 nM) plus LH (20 ng/mL) and the other cells not pretreated with LH were treated with CORT (50 nM) or LH (20 ng/mL) for 24 h. At the end of all treatments, Dual Luciferase Assays were performed as described above. The transfected cells treated with vehicles (PBS for LH; DMSO for CORT) served as controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Results are presented as means &#x000b1; SE of three independent experiments.

A direct glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated inhibition of testosterone biosynthesis by excess glucocorticoid has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Some of the solid evidences came from the studies on stress and Cushing's syndrome, in which elevated circulating concentration of glucocorticoid are normally associated with diminished testosterone secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The recent studies had found that the intracellular level of glucocorticoid is under control by 11&#x003b2;-HSD oxidase activity in Leydig cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Thus far, two distinct forms of 11&#x003b2;-HSD have been identified: 11&#x003b2;-HSD1, which usually is expressed in glucocorticoid target tissue, shows both oxidative and reductive activities and has a relatively low affinity for glucocorticoid substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; whereas, 11&#x003b2;-HSD2, which usually is expressed in mineralocorticoid target tissue, is an exclusively oxidative isoform with a high affinity for glucocorticoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Firstly, the presence of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 in Leydig cell was identified in 1989 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The results of most previous studies demonstrated that 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 is primarily an oxidase and plays a gatekeeper role of oxidatively inactivating glucocorticoids. Lately, the expression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 was also detected in rat adult Leydig cells using sensitive real-time PCR and new antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It is supposed that 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 functions as a protective factor in Leydig cells as well as 11&#x003b2;-HSD1, catalyzing a net oxidative reaction, although its expression is 1000-fold lower than that of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1. One reason is that 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 has a lower Km (15 nM), which is within the range of physiological concentration of glucocorticoid, compared with 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 (Km = 6 &#x003bc;M). Another is that suppression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 expression with transfection of antisense oligonucleotides decreased the oxidase activity of Leydig cell by almost 50%.</p><p>We had investigated the effect of LH on the expression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 at the time when 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 was not identified in Leydig cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It had been reported that gonadotropic hormone could increase11&#x003b2;-HSD2 expression in Tilapia testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], but the relevant mammalian study is not present yet. The results of this present study showed that LH treatment induced expression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 mRNA and protein in rat Leydig cells. These results were further confirmed by determining the effect of LH on the transcriptional activity of rat gene <italic>Hsd11b2 </italic>promoter. The luciferase reporter gene assays revealed that 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 promoter-driven transcription increased by more than 100% with LH treatment, consistent with the expression of mRNA and protein. We also found that the -138/+45 fragment, which contains a GC-rich region, is crucial for basic transcriptional activity similar to the results of other studies on human <italic>HSD11B2 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Along with serial deletions of the region between -1740 and -138, the transcriptional activity gradually decreased. This result suggests that several transcription factors may be involved in the LH-regulated expression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD2. This hypothesis needs further investigation in the future.</p><p>Actually, some <italic>in vivo </italic>studies had also suggested there is a correlation between the expression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 and serum concentration of LH. The study from Ge RS et al. indicated that 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 mRNA and enzyme activity increase continuously and significantly during postnatal development of rat Leydig cells which is accompanied by a gradual increase in serum LH concentration from puberty to maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Wagner A and Claus R found that changes in expression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 appear to parallel with changes in serum concentration of LH in pig Leydig cells after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, It was shown that GnRH-immunization significantly depresses the plasma concentration of LH as well as 11&#x003b2;-HSD oxidative activity in the boar testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The data mentioned above and the results of the present study suggest that LH may play an important role in developmental expression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 and thereby affecting the intracellular glucocorticoid concentration.</p><p>Our previous study revealed that although LH increased the expression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 in cultured Leydig cells, the reducase activity of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 increased slightly and the oxidase activity declined unexpectedly. It has been established that Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which generates NADPH through catalyzing glucose-6-phosphate oxidation, is the determinant of the reaction direction of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moreover, glucose availability may also be involved in determining the reaction direction of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1. Hardy et al. observed that the oxidative and reductive components of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 activity are unstable <italic>in vitro</italic>. Preparations of freshly isolated Leydig cells display high levels of oxidase activity and lower reductase, but the former declines and the latter rises during incubation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Eliminating the energy sources glucose and pyruvate from the culture medium prevented the changes in oxidoreductase activities, and the 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 oxidase remained predominant in Leydig cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Similar phenomenon was observed in rat H4IIE hepatoma cells transfected with mouse 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Transmembrane glucose uptake mediated by a family of glucose transporters (GLUTs) controls the rate of intracellular glucose availability and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. GLUT8 is highly expressed in rat Leydig cells and positively regulated by hCG which shares the same receptor with LH in Leydig cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus, we supposed that LH-induced increase in glucose availability may be involved in the mechanism for LH-induced change in the enzyme activity of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1. Given that LH reduces the oxidase activity of 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and increases the expression and enzyme activity of 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 simultaneously, it is unknown what happens to capacity for oxidative inactivation in Leydig cells. To probe the effect of LH on the level of intracellular glucocorticoid receptor activation, the luciferase reporter gene bioassay system was utilized, which had been employed in many studies for the same sake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The inducible transcriptional activity of GRE-Luc lies on the extent of the binding of active GR and GRE in the artificial promoter of luciferase gene. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, physiological level of CORT (50 nM) could activate GR signaling pathway, which is consistent with our earlier data that endogenous CORT is capable of inhibiting the steroidogenic capacity of purified rat Leydig cells <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and LH abated the glucocorticoid-induced luciferase activity, i.e. the intracellular concentration of glucocorticoid despite the predominant 11&#x003b2;-HSD1 activity may shift from oxidase to reducase activity hypothetically due to the elevated glucose uptake and NADPH/NADP ratio resulting from treatment with LH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Although glucocorticoid exerts adverse effect on testosterone secretion in Leydig cells, some studies suggest that it may be an important factor for Leydig cell development. For example, GR is expressed in Leydig cells at all three stages of pubertal development (mesenchymal-like progenitors, PLC, on day 21, immature Leydig cells, ILC, on day 35, and adult Leydig cells, ALC, on day 90.) and the numbers of dexamethasone-binding sites are higher in ILC and ALC compared with PLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In controlling the inhibitive effect of glucocorticoid on testosterone secretion during Leydig cell development, LH-induced expression of 11&#x003b2;-HSD2 could play a key role. Interestingly, it was found that glucocorticoid increases the ability of Leydig cell precursors to respond to LH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Therefore, Leydig cells may control intracellular glucocorticoid concentration through a LH-mediated negative feedback mechanism during development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, LH increases the expression and enzyme activity of 11beta-HSD2, and therefore enhances capacity for oxidative inactivation of glucocorticoid in rat Leydig cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, this study together with other published data has revealed an integrated relationship between LH and glucocorticoid in Leydig cells, which may help us deepen our understanding of the intricate mechanism for regulation of testosterone secretion in Leydig cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HBG conceived and designed the study.
