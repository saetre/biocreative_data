Recently, it was found that NPM gene is located at the breakpoints of the t(2:5), t(3:5) and t(5:17) chromosome translocation. To understand the human NPM gene's structure and regulation, four genomic clones were isolated from the human chromosome 5 library and their DNA sequences analyzed. The human NPM gene has 12 exons of sizes ranging from 58 to 358 bp. The chromosome breakpoint for t(2:5) and t(5:17) translocation is within intron 4 and the breakpoint for t(3:5) translocation is within intron 6. The initiation site is located 96 bp upstream from the ATG site. A typical TATA box (at -25 nt) and a GC box (at -65 nt) were identified in the promoter region. We identified two gel-shift bands (A and B) with DNA fragment E (-741/-250 nt) by EMSA. A DNA footprint was observed at (-371/-344 nt) with the nuclear extract. A double stranded DNA with the footprint sequence (-371/-344 nt) competed the formation of gel-shift bands A and B in EMSA suggesting that proteins A and B bind to the footprint region. We confirmed that protein A is transcription factor YY1. These results suggest that YY1 may play a role in NPM gene expression. This is the first report on human NPM gene structure and sequence.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
