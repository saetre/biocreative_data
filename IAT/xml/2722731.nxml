Novel candidate genes have been identified for various complex diseases using genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We conducted a GWAS in 492 Mexican children with asthma, predominantly atopic by skin prick test, and their parents using the Illumina HumanHap 550 K BeadChip to identify novel genetic variation for childhood asthma. The 520,767 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) passing quality control were tested for association with childhood asthma using log-linear regression with a log-additive risk model. Eleven of the most significantly associated GWAS SNPs were tested for replication in an independent study of 177 Mexican case&#x02013;parent trios with childhood-onset asthma and atopy using log-linear analysis. The chromosome 9q21.31 SNP rs2378383 (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7.10&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> in the GWAS), located upstream of <italic>transducin-like enhancer of split 4 (TLE4)</italic>, gave a p-value of 0.03 and the same direction and magnitude of association in the replication study (combined p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6.79&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>). Ancestry analysis on chromosome 9q supported an inverse association between the rs2378383 minor allele (G) and childhood asthma. This work identifies chromosome 9q21.31 as a novel susceptibility locus for childhood asthma in Mexicans. Further, analysis of genome-wide expression data in 51 human tissues from the Novartis Research Foundation showed that median GWAS significance levels for SNPs in genes expressed in the lung differed most significantly from genes not expressed in the lung when compared to 50 other tissues, supporting the biological plausibility of our overall GWAS findings and the multigenic etiology of childhood asthma.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Asthma is a leading chronic childhood disease with a presumed strong genetic component, but no genes have been definitely shown to influence asthma development. Few genetic studies of asthma have included Hispanic populations. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study of asthma in 492 Mexican children with asthma, predominantly atopic by skin prick test, and their parents to identify novel genetic variation for childhood asthma.

This suggests that chromosome 9q21.31 may underlie ethnic differences in childhood asthma and that future replication would be most effective in populations with Native American ancestry.

The GWAS included 492 Mexican case-parent trios. Given the moderate GWAS sample size, no SNP met genome-wide significance. However, the ranking of GWAS SNPs highlighted a potentially important candidate region for childhood asthma susceptibility, chromosome 9q21.31. Several chromosome 9q21.31 SNPs with small GWAS p-values were located in <italic>TLE4</italic> and its upstream region, and two of these SNPs (rs2378383 and rs2378377) were tested for replication in an independent study of 177 case-parent trios of Mexican ethnicity. Despite the small sample size for replication, both SNPs gave p-values close to 0.05 and the same direction and magnitude of association as the GWAS. Neither rs2378383 nor rs2378377 have a known impact on <italic>TLE4</italic> expression, but given their location upstream of <italic>TLE4</italic>, it is possible that these SNPs reside in a <italic>TLE4</italic> regulatory region.</p><p>Ancestry analysis in this chromosomal region provided supportive evidence that rs2378383 (G) is associated with a decreased risk of childhood asthma in Mexicans. Ancestry and transmission-based association analyses provide complementary but not completely independent lines of evidence. At each SNP, the log-linear method only used parents who were heterozygous in genotype, while ancestry analysis used all parents who are heterozygous in ancestry, including parents who are homozygous in genotype. We did not <italic>a priori</italic> expect that ancestry analysis results would corroborate log-linear association results.</p><p>Our ancestry analysis uses the same principles that underlie admixture mapping and relies on the key assumption of different risk allele frequencies between the ancestral populations, primarily Native American and European in this study. Under this assumption, individuals with disease in the admixed population would be expected to share an excess of ancestry from the population with the highest risk allele frequency at the disease locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Zhu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, individuals with disease in the admixed population would be expected to share a shortage of ancestry from the population with the highest protective allele frequency at the disease locus. At chromosome 9q21.31, there was less Native American ancestry than expected, suggesting that the Native American ancestral population had a higher frequency of the protective rs2378383 allele (G).</p><p>Ancestry analysis implicated chromosome 9q21.31 as a chromosomal region that may underlie ethnic differences in childhood asthma. Complex diseases with differing disease prevalence rates in the ancestral populations are most suitable for ancestry analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Smith1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Prevalence rates of childhood asthma in the true ancestral Native American, European, and African populations are unknowable, but it is interesting to note that Mexicans have the highest Native American ancestry and the lowest asthma prevalence rate among Hispanic populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Hunninghake1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Differing frequencies of genetic risk factors in the ancestral populations presumably contribute to the differing prevalence rates of childhood asthma in modern populations. Our study found an association between Native American ancestry and a lower disease risk. Similarly, Native American ancestry was associated with milder asthma in a previous study of subjects of Mexican ethnicity from the GALA study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Salari1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings collectively suggest that the Native American ancestral population had higher frequencies of alleles that decrease prevalence and severity of asthma in the modern Mexican population. A comparison of asthma prevalence and severity among modern Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans would further support this interpretation, but such data are scarce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Salari1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The evidence for locus-specific ancestry around rs2378383 has implications for replication. Because rs2378383 (G) occurs at relatively low frequency in European, African and East Asian populations, genetic association studies in these populations are likely to suffer from lack of power at this locus. In contrast, the G allele occurs at moderate frequency in the Native American populations surveyed in HGDP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Li1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Such disparate allele frequencies facilitate ancestry analysis in the region and improve the statistical power of transmission-based tests, as there are many more heterozygous parents in the Mexican population than a European, African or East Asian population. In fact, we obtained association results for SNPs in the chromosome 9q21.31 region from previous GWASs and found that SNPs in this region had only nominal evidence for association with asthma in the GWASs in white populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Moffatt1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Himes1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

The examination of GWAS in the context of genome-wide expression illustrated the biological plausibility of our GWAS findings and showed consistency with the involvement of multiple genes. Genes expressed in the lung show association signals that differ most significantly from the association signals from genes not expressed in the lung when compared to 50 other human tissues. The lung represents a major pathogenic site for asthma, and this finding implies that multiple genes expressed in the lung are collectively associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. Some of the other implicated tissues may represent false positives, but several of the highlighted tissues are biologically plausible for childhood asthma, including trachea, bronchial epithelium, smooth muscle, and immune tissues such as thymus, tonsil, and lymph node.</p><p>Other GWASs have implicated different susceptibility loci.

In our study, no SNPs met genome-wide significance, and no replication SNPs met the significance threshold when using a conservative Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Despite this limitation, top GWAS findings, replication in an independent population, and ancestry analysis taken together implicate a novel region for association with asthma in Mexican children.</p><p>This study has several strengths.

Also, disease misclassification is minimal. Although bronchial hyper-reactivity was not tested, children with asthma were given reliable diagnoses based on clinical grounds by pediatric allergists at a pediatric allergy specialty clinic. The allergy clinic is a tertiary referral clinic, so the children with asthma were previously seen by a generalist and a pediatrician over time for recurrent asthma symptoms.

Further, the asthmatic children were predominantly atopic to aeroallergens based on skin prick testing limiting heterogeneity of the disease phenotype.</p><p>The GWAS and replication association results and the supporting ancestry analysis implicate chromosome 9q21.31 as a novel susceptibility locus for childhood asthma in the Mexican population. This region contains a biologically plausible novel susceptibility gene for childhood asthma, <italic>TLE4</italic>, but further work is needed to decipher whether <italic>TLE4</italic> or a nearby gene explain the signals from the chromosome 9q21.31 region. Further, childhood asthma is a complex disease with a proposed multigenic etiology, but most single studies will not have sufficient power to examine such complex relationships. Identification of important interacting risk factors in childhood asthma and other complex diseases will require very large sample sizes. This work identifies chromosome 9q21.31 (including <italic>TLE4</italic>) as a novel candidate susceptibility locus for childhood asthma, suggests that this region may underlie ethnic differences in childhood asthma, and emphasizes the presence of multiple genetic risk factors in the complex mechanism leading to childhood asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Mexican National Institute of Public Health, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Frederico Gomez, and the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).

Statistical power to detect associations in the replication study of 177 case-parent trios was calculated for each selected SNP using QUANTO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hydra.usc.edu/gxe">http://hydra.usc.edu/gxe</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Gauderman1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. The MAFs and RR estimates observed from the GWAS with a log-additive model were specified in the power calculation for each selected SNP.</p><p>Genotyping for replication SNPs was performed on the Applied Biosystems (ABI, Foster City, California) PRISM 7500 Real-Time PCR System using primers and probes from ABI's Assay-by-Demand. The assay was performed under universal conditions, with each reaction containing 3.75 ng DNA, 0.125 &#x000b5;L 40X Assay Mix and 2.5 &#x000b5;L TaqMan Universal PCR master mix brought to a final volume of 5 &#x000b5;L with sterile water. Thermal cycling conditions began at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes and then proceeded with 60 cycles of 92&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds and 60&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes. After the PCR reaction, plates were scanned by the ABI PRISM 7500 PCR system to determine genotypes by allelic discrimination.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Statistical analysis of genotype data</title><p>The log-linear likelihood approach was used to examine associations of individual SNPs with childhood asthma in the GWAS and replication study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Weinberg1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Wilcox1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

An asymmetry of allele distributions implies that the variant under study is associated with disease within families. This inference requires the assumption of Mendelian inheritance, such that the allele under study is not related to the parents' fertility or to the offspring's survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Wilcox1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.

Unlike other transmission-based methods, the log-linear method provides risk estimates to assess the direction and magnitude of association.</p><p>Robustness to population stratification is a well-known property of the case-parent trio design and transmission-based methods. The log-linear method achieves robustness to population stratification by stratifying on the six possible parental mating types, which are defined by the number of copies of the allele carried by each of the two parents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Wilcox1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The assumption of HWE is not required for the log-linear method, but we tested for HWE in parents as a check for genotyping error.</p><p>The log-linear method was implemented using the LEM computer program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-vanDenOord1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> with a one degree-of-freedom log-additive risk model specified.

P-values were generated to assess statistical significance, and the RR of carrying one copy of the risk allele was calculated to assess the direction and magnitude of association. For the most significantly associated GWAS SNPs, pair-wise LD was assessed in the parents using PLINK (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/">http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Purcell1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> or HAPLOVIEW (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/">http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Barrett1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

Data from the GWAS population were stratified by current parental smoking (yes/no) and residential ambient ozone exposure (stratified at the median of 67 ppb annual average of the daily maximum 8 hour averages), and the log-linear method was used to test for genetic associations in each stratum.</p><p>Additional analyses were conducted in the GWAS population using the skin prick testing data. The genome-wide association scan was repeated in the subset of trios with children classified as atopic (one or more positive skin tests) in an effort to reduce phenotypic heterogeneity and thus reduce genetic heterogeneity. Then, an extension of the log-linear method for quantitative traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Kistner1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> was used to test for associations of interesting SNPs with the number of positive skin tests to a battery of 24 aeroallergens as a measure of atopy.

HapMap (phase 3) genotype data from 109 individuals from the United States with northern and western European descent and 108 individuals from Nigeria were included to represent ancestral European and African individuals, respectively.

Our goal was to elucidate the pattern of ancestry segregation near the replicated chromosome 9q SNP (rs2378383). SNPs along chromosome 9q were analyzed to more accurately infer ancestry, but since we were only interested in examining the pattern of ancestry segregation at rs2378383 <italic>a priori</italic>, a multiple testing correction was not applied. A trio-based ancestry analysis test was implemented similar to that described in Clarke and Whittemore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Clarke1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, which parallels the transmission disequilibrium test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Spielman1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Because the African ancestry in this population is quite low (&#x0003c;5&#x00025;), we tested Native American versus non-Native American ancestry. At each SNP, parents were considered to have no Native American ancestral alleles if their posterior Native American ancestry was less than 0.1, one ancestral allele if between 0.4 and 0.6, and two ancestral alleles if greater than 0.9. Conservative thresholds were set to minimize misclassification. Parents with intermediate ancestry estimates falling outside the specified ranges were excluded, resulting in a 10&#x00025; missing rate. For parents who were heterozygous in ancestry, the null hypothesis that the Native American allele is transmitted to the children with probability equal to &#x000bd; was tested at each SNP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Clarke1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Genome-wide expression data</title><p>The Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation maintains a freely accessible database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://symatlas.gnf.org">http://symatlas.gnf.org</ext-link>) of genome-wide expression profiles of the protein-encoding transcriptome in many diverse human and mouse tissues and cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Su1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. As reported, tissue samples were predominantly obtained from the normal physiological state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Su1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

We obtained the expression data for the 44,775 transcripts in 51 diverse human tissues and mapped these transcripts to 15,047 unique genes after accounting for multiple transcripts per gene and mapping to current nomenclature.</p><p>Gene expression patterns in the Novartis data were examined in the context of GWAS results. Of the 15,047 genes with expression data, 12,199 genes had at least one genotyped GWAS SNP mapping within the gene, and an additional 2,131 genes had at least one genotyped SNP mapping near the gene for a total of 14,330 genes. SNPs mapping within the 5&#x02032;- most extent to the 3&#x02032;- most extent over all isoforms for a gene or within a larger region expanded by 50 kb in both directions were considered. This broader region was considered in order to capture potential regulatory regions. For each gene, one false discovery rate q-value was calculated using the log-linear p-values of SNPs mapping within or near the gene based on a method for combining p-values by Peng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000623-Peng1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Genes were then categorized as expressed or not expressed in each of the 51 tissues examined. The expression threshold was the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile of normalized intensity values for each tissue. The global median q-values across genes expressed versus genes not expressed were calculated for each tissue, and a two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test was conducted to generate a test of significance for this difference in median q-values.</p><p>Gene expression patterns are correlated across different tissues. We performed a two-dimensional hierarchical clustering to describe the correlation of expression patterns using Spearman's correlation coefficient across genes and across tissues. Genes and tissues with similar gene expression patterns were grouped into clusters using Ward's distance as the linkage function to be optimized. Partek Genomics Suite 6.08.1010 (Partek Inc., St. Louis, Missouri) software was used to perform this analysis using the continuous expression values in the 15,047 genes with expression data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000623.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>LD structure of SNPs in or near <italic>TLE4</italic>.</p><p>(0.08 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000623.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000623.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Two-dimensional cluster analysis of genome-wide expression data.</p><p>(3.72 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000623.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000623.s003"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Q-values for the 3,618 genes classified as expressed in lung tissue.</p><p>(2.99 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000623.s003.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the children with asthma and their parents for participating in our study.
