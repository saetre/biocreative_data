Induction of ER chaperone GRP78/BiP increases protein folding capacity; as such it represents a major survival arm of UPR. Considering the central importance of the UPR in regulating cell survival and death, evidence is emerging that cells evolve feedback regulatory pathways to modulate the key UPR executors, however, the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we report the fortuitous discovery of GRP78va, a novel isoform of GRP78 generated by alternative splicing (retention of intron 1) and alternative translation initiation. Bioinformatic and biochemical analyses revealed that expression of GRP78va is enhanced by ER stress and is notably elevated in human leukemic cells and leukemia patients. In contrast to the canonical GRP78 which is primarily an ER lumenal protein, GRP78va is devoid of the ER signaling peptide and is cytosolic. Through specific knockdown of endogenous GRP78va by siRNA without affecting canonical GRP78, we showed that GRP78va promotes cell survival under ER stress. We further demonstrated that GRP78va has the ability to regulate PERK signaling and that GRP78va is able to interact with and antagonize PERK inhibitor P58<sup>IPK</sup>. Our study describes the discovery of GRP78va, a novel cytosolic isoform of GRP78/BiP, and the first characterization of the modulation of UPR signaling via alternative splicing of nuclear pre-mRNA. Our study further reveals a novel survival mechanism in leukemic cells and other cell types where GRP78va is expressed.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Major advances have been made during the past decade in the understanding of how cells respond to impairment or saturation of the protein maturation machinery of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathways are activated to reduce the unfolded protein load and at the same time increase protein folding capacity. The initiation of UPR is primarily regulated by the ER-transmembrane sensor proteins PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Rutkowski1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Ron1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon ER stress, PERK activation leads to phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2&#x003b1;, which inhibits global protein biosynthesis while activating the translation of the transcription factor ATF4. Along with activated ATF6 and IRE1/XBP-1, ATF4 activates transcription of ER chaperones and folding enzymes, thus improving the protein processing capacity and alleviating protein aggregation in the ER.</p><p>A major ER chaperone is the 78 kDa glucose regulated protein GRP78, also referred to as BiP (immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Lee1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Li1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. GRP78 belongs to the HSP70 protein family and is encoded by a single copy gene in both the human and mouse genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Ting1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to the cytosolic counterparts of the HSP70 protein family, the amino-terminus of GRP78 contains a signal peptide that targets it to the ER and its carboxy-terminus contains the ER retention signal motif KDEL. The induction of GRP78 has been widely used as a sentinel marker for ER stress and UPR activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Lee2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. As an ER resident protein, GRP78 facilitates protein assembly, prevents intermediates from aggregation and targets misfolded proteins for degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-OkudaShimizu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Ushioda1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

GRP78 also interacts with pro-apoptotic molecules at the ER, blocking their activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Rao1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Fu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. When unfolded proteins pull GRP78 away from them, these pathways are activated, triggering the UPR, and if the stress is too severe, apoptosis. Therefore, as a key UPR regulator and target, GRP78 is postulated to play pivotal roles in pathological processes, however, the precise mechanisms remain to be determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Lee3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Wang1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Considering the central importance of UPR in regulating cell survival and death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Rutkowski1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Ron1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Rutkowski2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Lin1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, the prediction is that cells will evolve feedback regulatory pathways to modulate the key UPR executors. One such example is the ER stress induction of the DnaJ family protein P58<sup>IPK</sup>, first discovered as an inhibitor of the eIF2&#x003b1; protein kinase PKR in the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Lee4">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. P58<sup>IPK</sup> serves as a negative feedback of UPR signaling by binding to the cytosolic domain of PERK and inhibiting its kinase activity, thereby terminating PERK activation in the late phase of the UPR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-vanHuizen1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. As part of a protein complex with HSP70 at the cytosolic face of translocons, P58<sup>IPK</sup> has been implicated as a mediator of co-translational ER protein degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Oyadomari1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

We discovered that the human and mouse <italic>Grp78</italic> allele contains conserved non-canonical splice sites and ER stress enhances the production of a variant form of GRP78 through retention of the first intron and internal translation initiation, referred to below as GRP78va. Among the various types of alternative pre-mRNA splicing, intron retention is relatively rare and few examples of biological consequence are documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Ast1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Lacking the ER signal sequence, GRP78va is cytosolic and is notably elevated in human leukemic cell lines subjected to ER stress. The transcript of GRP78va is also present in AML, CML and ALL patients, but not in normal controls. GRP78va is a promoter of cell survival under ER stress. Through overexpression and siRNA knockdown studies, we further demonstrated that GRP78va has the ability to regulate PERK signaling and is able to interact with and act as an antagonist of PERK inhibitor P58<sup>IPK</sup>. Collectively, these studies provide the first evidence of the modulation of UPR signaling via alternative splicing of nuclear pre-mRNA and reveal a fundamentally new concept for a survival mechanism in leukemic cells and other cell types where GRP78va is expressed.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of a novel splicing variant of <italic>Grp78</italic> in mouse and human</title><p>GRP78 is a highly conserved ER chaperone protein.

The repression of NMD stabilizes the target mRNAs, including the UPR factors ATF4, ATF3 and CHOP, and thereby arguments the cellular stress response. With the introduction of a premature stop codon by intron 1 retention, <italic>Grp78va</italic> mRNA is a potential NMD target. Upon ER stress, inhibition of NMD could lead to stabilization of <italic>Grp78va</italic> mRNA and translation of functional GRP78va protein. Since GRP78va initiates by an internal AUG that is also contained in the canonical GRP78 transcript, the issue arises whether internal initiation might also occur. In our experimental design, the siRNA against GRP78va specifically targets the retained intron 1 of the <italic>Grp78va</italic> transcript, thereby affecting only translation from the <italic>Grp78va</italic> transcript but not internal initiation from the fully spliced, canonical <italic>Grp78</italic> transcript. We observed that the decrease in GRP78va protein level generally corresponds with the decrease in the <italic>Grp78va</italic> transcript level in the siGrp78va-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006868.s006">Figure S5</xref>), suggesting that the majority of GRP78va results from <italic>Grp78va</italic> mRNA translation. At the post-translational level, HA-GRP78va, was stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor MG115, whereas endogenous GRP78 was not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006868.s009">Figure S8A</xref>), consistent with a much shorter half life for GRP78va compared to canonical GRP78, as determined by the cycloheximide chase experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006868.s009">Figure S8B</xref>). Analysis of the protein amino acid sequence revealed a potential PEST-rich region at the carboxy-terminus of GRP78va (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006868.s009">Figure S8C</xref>). PEST sequences are present in regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors, protein kinases or phosphatases and cyclins, and often locate at carboxy-terminus in these proteins, serving as a proteolytic signal contributing to rapid degradation of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Rechsteiner1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Rogers1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. While canonical GRP78 also contains the same PEST sequence, the ER compartment where it is localized likely protects it from recognition and degradation by ubiquitin-proteasome system. Here we report that with the proper PCR primers, the alternatively spliced <italic>Grp78va</italic> transcript is readily detectable in mouse embryos, specific adult tissues, as well as peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from leukemic patients. The GRP78va expression pattern matches well with predictions from the genome-wide exon junction microarray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Johnson1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and is represented, albeit rarely, in the current expressed sequence tag (EST) database which tends to bias against less abundant alternative forms. While GRP78va may have diverse cellular function which awaits future investigation, here we establish that GRP78va exhibits anti-apoptotic activity against ER stress.</p><p>How might GRP78va protect cells from ER stress induced cell death? In contrast to canonical GRP78, GRP78va is cytosolic due to the lack of the amino-terminal ER signal sequence. Based on previous studies of GRP78 mutants, the GRP78va isoform corresponds to the protein initiating at Met-148/153 which showed greater ATP binding than the wild-type GRP78 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Gaut1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the conservation of both the ATP binding and the peptide binding domains in GRP78va suggests that it can act as a cytosolic counterpart of canonical GRP78, interacting with client proteins playing critical roles in cell survival. One key function of the ER localized canonical GRP78 is its ability to regulate ER stress signaling by maintaining ER transmembrane sensors PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 in their inactive state in non-stressed cells. As a first test of GRP78va function, we examined whether it affects ER stress signaling pathways. Using both overexpression and knockdown approaches, we discovered that GRP78va selectively upregulates PERK signaling. Further, point mutation of GRP78va defective in ATP binding greatly diminished its regulatory effect on induction of eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation, suggesting that GRP78va acts through its interaction with cytosolic client protein(s) capable of modulating PERK activity.</p><p>Here we identified P58<sup>IPK</sup> as the first client protein of GRP78va. There are some discrepancies in literature regarding the subcellular localization of P58<sup>IPK</sup>, as its activity has been documented in both the cytosolic and the ER compartments. P58<sup>IPK</sup> was originally discovered as a cytosolic protein but later discovered to possess a weak ER signal peptide sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Lee4">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Rutkowski3">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Yan1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. There are precedents in literature where an ER protein can also localize in the cytosol. Potential mechanisms include inefficient translocation due to weak signal peptide sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Levine1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, retrotranslocation from the ER lumen to the cytosol after peptide cleavage inside the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Afshar1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>; after signal peptide cleavage but prior to ER insertion, translocation can be aborted and the product released into the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Garcia1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>; and retrotranslocation from the ER lumen to the cytosol via ERAD but escapes proteasome degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Duriez1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

Further, as the minor cytosolic population of P58<sup>IPK</sup> is able to inhibit the low abundance PERK or PKR kinase, this inhibition could be suppressed by low amount GRP78va through antagonizing the cytosolic P58<sup>IPK</sup>. In addition, the distribution of P58<sup>IPK</sup> between the ER and cytosol could be different in different cell types, such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) versus human cancer cells, or under different cellular conditions, such as normal physiological versus pathological conditions. Future investigations will be required to resolve how these factors contribute to P58<sup>IPK</sup> subcellular localization and function.</p><p>Our results also predict that other cytosolic co-chaperone proteins might associate with GRP78va and assist its function. It is known that Hsp70 proteins employ DnaJ family proteins as co-chaperones, which preferentially bind to the ATP form of their partner Hsp70 and stimulate the ATPase activity to stabilize Hsp70-polypeptide complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Qiu1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Fan1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. DnaJ/Hsp40 chaperone proteins interact with the conserved ATPase domain of HSP70 proteins through their conserved J-domain. As the ER lumenal HSP70 chaperone, GRP78 is known to interact with a group of DnaJ/Hsp40 proteins in the ER lumen, such as ERdjs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Shen1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Kurisu1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Since GRP78va retains most part of ATPase domain of canonical GRP78, it is expected to potentially bind other cytosolic chaperones, such as DnaJ/Hsp40 proteins besides P58<sup>IPK</sup>. Further experiments are necessary to characterize the cytosolic co-chaperone proteins of GRP78va. It is also tempting to speculate that GRP78va might act as a cytosolic chaperone collaborating with its cytosolic co-chaperones to promote the folding of nascent cytosolic polypeptides, since it corresponds to the GRP78 mutant initiated from Met-148 in previous study and exhibits strong ATP binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Gaut1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, implicating that GRP78va has the ability to bind to client proteins.</p><p>Induction of GRP78 and activation of PERK signaling represents two major pro-survival pathways in the UPR. GRP78 promotes ER protein folding and efficient degradation of aggregated proteins through ERAD, which alleviates the unfolded protein load in the ER and increases cell survival. Likewise, PERK-mediated eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation is protective by attenuating the protein biosynthesis and consequently reducing the total protein load on the ER. Thus, both GRP78 upregulation and PERK activation promote cell survival and adaptation to pathophysiological stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Li1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Lee3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Bi1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Blais1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Ranganathan1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Li2">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. P58<sup>IPK</sup> is inducible by ER stress. The cells employ the cytosolic population of P58<sup>IPK</sup> to inhibit PERK activity, allowing the cells to recover from global translational inhibition. Our data suggests that ER stress also induces GRP78va as a cytosolic counterpart of GRP78, and a potential feedback mechanism to regulate P58<sup>IPK</sup>. Through complex formation with cytosolic P58<sup>IPK</sup>, GRP78va may act as an antagonist of P58<sup>IPK</sup>. Thus, when GRP78va is overexpressed, the level of P58<sup>IPK</sup> was decreased and PERK signaling was enhanced. Therefore, GRP78va has the ability to function as a novel regulator of PERK signaling under ER stress and this regulation may play an important role especially in cancer cells where GRP78va is highly expressed. However, since sustained PERK activation could be harmful <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Ladiges1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref> and persistent ER stress attenuates survival pathways mediated by IRE1 and ATF6 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Lin1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, this may explain why GRP78va expression might be stringently regulated at the transcript stability level, as well as at the post-translational level.</p><p>Aberrant splicing has been found to be associated with various diseases, including cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Pajares1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, through microarray and biochemical analysis, we discovered that leukemic cell lines and leukemia patients expressed high levels of GRP78va. Evidence suggests that alteration of phosphorylation and/or expression of proteins that recognize splice sites and assembly of the splicesome in leukemia can be caused by aberrant BCR/ABL fusion protein, deregulated expression of DNA topoisomerase I or the hematopoietic transcription factor Spi-1/PU.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Salesse1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006868-Theoleyre1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, a higher incidence of intron retention of <italic>Grp78</italic> in leukemic patients may be due to alteration of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery.
