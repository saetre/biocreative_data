The identity of this conductance is unknown, but SLC26A9, a member of the SLC26 family of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-interacting transporters, is found in the human airway and exhibits chloride channel behavior. We sought differences in the properties of SLC26A9 and CFTR expressed in HEK 293 (HEK) cells as a fingerprint to identify HBE apical anion conductances. HEK cells expressing SLC26A9 displayed a constitutive chloride current that was inhibited by the CFTR blocker GlyH-101 (71 &#x000b1; 4%, 50 &#x000b5;M) and exhibited a near-linear current&#x02013;voltage (I-V) relation during block, while GlyH-101&#x02013;inhibited wild-type (wt)CFTR exhibited a strong inward-rectified (IR) I-V relation. We tested polarized HBE cells endogenously expressing either wt or &#x00394;F508-CFTR for similar activity. After electrical isolation of the apical membrane using basolateral &#x003b1;-toxin permeabilization, wtCFTR monolayers displayed constitutive chloride currents that were inhibited by GlyH-101 (68 &#x000b1; 6%) while maintaining a near-linear I-V relation. In the absence of blocker, the addition of forskolin stimulated a current increase having a linear I-V; GlyH-101 blocked 69 &#x000b1; 7% of the current and shifted the I-V relation IR, consistent with CFTR activation. HEK cells coexpressing SLC26A9 and wtCFTR displayed similar properties, as well as forskolin-stimulated currents that exceeded the sum of those in cells separately expressing SLC26A9 or wtCFTR, and an I-V relation during GlyH-101 inhibition that was moderately IR, indicating that SLC26A9 contributed to the stimulated current. HBE cells from CF patients expressed SLC26A9 mRNA, but no constitutive chloride currents. HEK cells coexpressing SLC26A9 with &#x00394;F508-CFTR also failed to exhibit SLC26A9 current. We conclude that SLC26A9 functions as an anion conductance in the apical membranes of HBE cells, it contributes to transepithelial chloride currents under basal and cAMP/protein kinase A&#x02013;stimulated conditions, and its activity in HBE cells requires functional CFTR.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Airway surface liquid (ASL) composition and volume are tightly regulated to maintain mucociliary clearance and healthy lung function. Contributions to the ASL composition and thickness come from both surface epithelia and submucosal glands, with the glands thought to be the predominant source of secreted fluid and peptides for innate defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wine, 2006</xref>). Electrolyte transport across the surface epithelium, together with accompanying osmotic water flow, determines the height of the ASL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tarran et al., 2001</xref>), and this in turn determines the efficiency of mucociliary clearance. Several recent studies have implicated basal or constitutive CFTR activity in calcium-mediated gland secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Song et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ishibashi et al., 2008</xref>), modulation of ASL pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Song et al., 2006</xref>), and surface epithelial electrolyte transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Evidence for constitutive activity of CFTR in airway epithelia has a long history: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Smith and Welsh (1992)</xref> noted a substantial baseline (non-cAMP&#x02013;stimulated) apical anion efflux in their studies to evaluate the bicarbonate permeability of CFTR. Since then, constitutive currents have been noted in human bronchial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Coakley et al., 2003</xref>) and nasal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Paradiso et al., 2003</xref>) epithelial cultures, as well as the serous cell model of Calu-3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krouse et al., 2004</xref>). These studies attributed the basal chloride currents to constitutive CFTR activity, due primarily to their absence in cystic fibrosis (CF) epithelia.</p><p>After the discovery of the higher specificity CFTR channel blockers CFI172 and GlyH-101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Muanprasat et al., 2004</xref>), several studies have confirmed that basal chloride currents were sensitive to these agents, reinforcing the hypothesis of constitutive CFTR activity. In addition, a role for basal anion secretion in maintaining the ASL pH was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Song et al. (2006)</xref> because the unstimulated tracheal surface epithelium was able to alkalinize acidic droplets, and the specific CFTR channel blockers CFI-172 and GlyH-101 inhibited this alkalization. Interestingly, the alkalization was not improved with forskolin stimulation. In the same study, porcine and human submucosal gland secretions stimulated with pilocarpine were significantly acidified when treated with CFTR inhibitors. Porcine small airways also displayed constitutive chloride conductances that were GlyH-101 inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2005</xref>); therefore, the sensitivity of constitutive chloride secretion to specific CFTR inhibitors and its absence in CF airways has led to the hypothesis of constitutive CFTR activity. However, the absence of a consistent model for this regulatory mode of CFTR and the role of CFTR as a regulator of other transport pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schwiebert et al., 1999</xref>) suggest that another anion channel may contribute to constitutive secretion across airway epithelia.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ko et al. (2004)</xref> identified two electrogenic members of the SLC26 family, SLC26A3 and SLC26A6, which interact with CFTR when expressed in oocytes and HEK 293 cells. This has led to a model of reciprocal regulation mediated by a physical interaction between the R domain of CFTR and the STAS domain of the SLC26A family of anion transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dorwart et al., 2008</xref>). The PDZ domains of these proteins are also believed to tether the transporters in close proximity. Coexpression of the STAS domain alone with CFTR increased its open probability, and, in a reciprocal manner, coexpression of CFTR with SLC26A3 increased its HCO<sub>3</sub>-Cl exchange activity. Although electrogenic, these exchangers did not generate measurable Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current when they were expressed in HEK 293 cells, not an uncommon finding for the low turnover rates found in exchange transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hille, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The identification of the lung-specific SLC26A9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lohi et al., 2002</xref>) suggests a potential mechanism for airway anion transport that may be coordinated with the activity of CFTR, based on the model above. The behavior of SLC26A9 alone has been reported by two groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xu et al. (2005)</xref> stably expressed SLC26A9 in HEK 293 cells and observed Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> exchange activity, with some Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-independent HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> efflux. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dorwart et al. (2007)</xref> transiently expressed SLC26A9 in oocytes and HEK 293 cells and reported large Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> currents consistent with channel behavior, but minimal HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> permeability. These results seem divergent, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Romero et al. (2006)</xref> has suggested a model of SLC26A9 having both Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel and electrogenic exchange activities, based on preliminary observations in oocytes. The possibility that SLC26A9 is a CFTR-regulated chloride channel raises several significant questions: Does SLC26A9 contribute to basal and/or cAMP/PKA-stimulated anion currents in airway epithelia? Is it sensitive to CFTR inhibitors? Does its activity depend on functional CFTR? In the studies reported here, we used the HEK 293 expression system and human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells from both non-CF and CF donors to address these questions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK 293 cells were propagated in Falcon culture flasks (75 cm<sup>2</sup>) in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000b0;C. The cells were fed twice per week with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine. Cells were removed from flasks after treatment with TrypLE Express and aliquoted into 6-well plates at high density to achieve 98% confluence within 24 h, per the standard Lipofectamine 2000 transfection protocol (Invitrogen; see below). Transfection media were replaced with normal media after 14 h, and transfected cells were removed from the 6-well plates after 24 h and plated to glass coverslips to be used for patch clamping within 18&#x02013;36 h. Both the 6-well plates and the glass coverslips were coated with poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine to promote cell adhesion. All cell culture medium was obtained from Invitrogen.</p><p>HBE cells were cultured from excess pathological tissue after lung transplantation and organ donation under a protocol approved by the University of Pittsburgh Investigational Review Board, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Devor and Pilewski, 1999</xref>). In brief, cells were propagated in flasks to 80&#x02013;90% confluency, and then transferred to 0.33-cm<sup>2</sup> Costar Transwell filters. Apical media were removed 24 h after seeding, and the filters were grown at an air&#x02013;liquid interface thereafter. Basolateral media were changed twice weekly. Three different wild-type (wt)CFTR patient samples were used for short circuit current measurements, and the CF HBE cells used were obtained from patients with severe disease and were at least heterozygous for the &#x00394;F508 CF mutation. Filters that had been grown at an air&#x02013;liquid interface for at least 2 wk before testing demonstrated active cilia.</p></sec><sec><title>Constructs and transfections</title><p>HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected 24 h after plating with either SLC26A9 or CFTR, or both. SLC26A9 expressed in a pcDNA 3.1 vector was provided by S. Muallem (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), and the entire construct was sequenced to verify that it corresponded to the published 4,815-bp isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lohi et al., 2002</xref>) of human SLC26A9 (NM_052934). SLC26A9 with a myc epitope at the N terminus was prepared by excising the cDNA encoding SLC26A9 from pcDNA 3.1 and cloning it into a pcDNA 3 Myc vector (Invitrogen). Both wt and &#x00394;F508 CFTR expressed in pcDNA3.1 vectors were as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). pMAX green fluorescent protein (GFP; Amaxa) was used in all transfections to balance total cDNA and identify transfected cells. Transfections were performed using the standard Lipofectamine 2000 protocol (Invitrogen), with 2 &#x000b5;g of total cDNA and 6 &#x000b5;l Lipofectamine 2000 in 2 ml Optimem per well of a 6-well plate. Quantities of cDNA typically used were 0.5 &#x000b5;g for SLC26A9, 1.0 &#x000b5;g for CFTR, and sufficient pMax GFP to bring the total cDNA per transfection to 2.0 &#x000b5;g.</p><p>Several preliminary concentrations of SLC26A9 cDNA alone and in combination with 1 &#x000b5;g CFTR cDNA were tested in HEK 293 cells to obtain readily measurable currents for either channel at the lowest cDNA dose. Increasing the quantity of SLC26A9 cDNA from 0.1 to 2.0 &#x000b5;g increased the magnitude of the constitutive (basal) currents (not depicted); doses higher than the 0.5 &#x000b5;g used, when coexpressed with CFTR, produced reductions in membrane resistance (Rm) during forskolin stimulation to levels (&#x0003c;10 times the pipette access resistance) that may compromise voltage clamping (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and immunoprecipitation (IP)</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from either HEK 293 cells grown in T25 flasks within 36&#x02013;48 h after transfection, or from HBE cells grown on filter supports at air&#x02013;liquid interface for at least 2 wk, using the RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Applied Biosystems). HEK cells were dissociated from the flask after a 5-min exposure to TrypLE Express, pelleted, and then processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For HBE filters, monolayers were rinsed with 37&#x000b0;C PBS (calcium and magnesium-free) and incubated with fresh PBS on both the apical and basolateral sides for 5 min to disrupt the tight junctions. After aspiration of the apical PBS, 0.25% trypsin EDTA (Invitrogen) was added, and monolayers were incubated for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Cells were extracted from the filter with vigorous pipetting, pelleted, and then processed according to the kit protocol. Three filters were dissociated per sample. Isolated RNA was DNase treated and then stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Two-step RT-PCR was performed using a RETROscript kit (Applied Biosystems). For generation of cDNA, &#x0223c;2 &#x000b5;g of the previously harvested total RNA was reverse transcribed using Oligo(dT) primers at an incubation temperature of 42&#x000b0;C, per the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNA was stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until PCR was performed. Both total RNA and cDNA were used within 1 mo of harvesting and reverse transcription, respectively.</p><p>The PCR steps were performed with the following primers: 5&#x02032;-GAGCAGAGCCCTTTCACACACCTCAGG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GCCTATCATGTCCTTCCACTGTGAGACCAC-3&#x02032; for SLC26A9; 5&#x02032;-AGGAGGCAGTCTGTCCTGAA-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CACTGCTGGTATGCTCTCCA-3&#x02032; for CFTR; and a commercial RT-PCR primer kit to detect human &#x003b2;-actin (Invitrogen) as a control. The SLC26A9 primers cover the region corresponding to both sets of primers used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lohi et al. (2002)</xref> and include both the 5&#x02032; UTR and the N-terminal coding region of the mRNA; they amplify an 1,100-bp product. The CFTR primers amplify a 237-bp product, and the &#x003b2;-actin primers identify a 353-bp product. The PCR reaction was performed according to the RETROscript kit protocol with an annealing temp of 55&#x000b0;C for both CFTR and &#x003b2;-actin, and 62&#x000b0;C for SLC26A9. A Robocycler with a temperature gradient block was used to perform all the reactions simultaneously using two separate annealing temperatures. 35 cycles were run.</p><p>For coimmunoprecipitation studies, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with wtCFTR &#x000b1; Myc-SLC26A9. After 48 h, cells were briefly treated with 10 &#x000b5;M forskolin, and then lysed (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors). After disruption of the cells, 500 &#x000b5;g of total proteins was subjected to IP with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (University of Iowa Hybridoma Center), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). Precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were performed using anti-CFTR antibody (no. 217; Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cftrfolding.org/CFFTReagents.htm">http://www.cftrfolding.org/CFFTReagents.htm</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Whole cell patch clamping</title><p>All whole cell patch clamping was performed using a 200B Axopatch amplifier controlled by Clampex 8.1 software through a Digidata 1322A acquisition board (all from MDS Analytical Technologies). Bath solutions containing the different blockers and/or stimulants to be applied were distributed among eight separate reservoirs of a Valvelink 8 pressurized perfusion system (Automate Scientific). Reservoir selection was also controlled by the Clampex 8.1 software to ensure consistent timing for all experiments. The output line from the perfusion system was run through a heated, circulating water bath and applied to the imaging chamber at 2.0 ml/m and 37&#x000b0;C. The delay between valve selection and appearance of the solution at the 300-&#x000b5;l chamber was 20 s.</p><p>The imaging chamber was mounted on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with standard illumination and a 150-W Xenon lamp and GFP filter cube (Ex 485/Em 550). The fluorescent light source was applied with a manual shutter to permit selection of GFP-labeled cells viewed through a 40&#x000d7; objective. Once a cell was selected, the shutter was closed and the remainder of the experiment was performed under standard (transmitted light) illumination. The cells selected displayed a consistent shape and fluorescence intensity, as suggested in published guidelines for use of the HEK 293 expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas and Smart, 2005</xref>). Seal formation was monitored using the seal test mode of Clampex. Seal resistances exceeded 8 G&#x003a9;, and pipette capacitance was compensated. After rupture of the seal membrane, whole cell parameters were verified using the membrane test mode of Clampex before the start of each experiment.</p><p>All experiments used a standard protocol that alternated an I-V step measurement with a voltage clamp interval at a holding potential of &#x02212;40 mV. The I-V measurement stepped the holding potential from &#x02212;100 to +100 mV in 20-mV steps, 206 samples per step at a 50-&#x000b5;s sampling interval for a total measurement time of 120 ms. The voltage clamp measurements were collected at 200-&#x000b5;s intervals, and both measurements were filtered at 1 KHz through the Axopatch amplifier filter. Each experiment started with a 60-s drug-free voltage clamp to ensure the cells were stable. After this interval, all protocols alternated I-V measurements with 90-s voltage clamp intervals. Single-drug protocols applied drug for 3 min, followed by a 3-min washout period for a total protocol of 7 min, while two-drug protocols included a second 3-min drug application for a total protocol of 10 min. The alternating measurements were automated using the sequence key function in Clampex to minimize gaps.</p><p>NMDG-Cl was used for both the bath and pipette solutions to isolate chloride currents. The osmolarity of both solutions was measured, and NMDG glutamate was added to the bath solution (in mM: 140 NMDG-Cl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 glucose, to pH 7.3 with Tris) to generate a 25-mOsm gradient that obviated cell swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Worrell et al., 1989</xref>).

All experiments were performed at 37&#x000b0;C. Transepithelial resistance was measured by applying a 2.5-mV bipolar pulse every 100 s and calculated using Ohm's law. The I-V relation of &#x003b1;-toxin&#x02013;permeabilized monolayers was measured by applying a bipolar pulse of increasing voltage steps from 10 to 70 mV at 5-s intervals per step. Each voltage step lasted 2 s, and the monolayer was short circuited (0 mV) between steps. Transepithelial resistance measurements were suspended during I-V measurements. Due to the large currents recorded during the I-V measurements, electrode stability was closely monitored.</p><p>For intact monolayer experiments, the bathing Ringer's solution was composed of 120 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 3.3 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.8 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM glucose. Chambers were constantly gassed with a mixture of 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>, which maintained the pH at 7.4. Solutions used during &#x003b1;-toxin permeabilization experiments were bicarbonate free, and a chloride gradient was established to generate a driving force for transepithelial chloride flow. For experiments using a mucosal to serosal gradient, the mucosal solution was composed of 115 mM NaCl, 25 mM Na-gluconate, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 mM glucose, and the serosal solution consisted of 70 mM NaCl, 70 mM Na-gluconate, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 mM glucose, both at pH 7.4. To generate a serosal to mucosal gradient, the bathing solutions (above) were reversed. The mucosal solution for either gradient direction also included 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> to maintain tight junction integrity.</p><p>Basolateral membrane permeabilization was accomplished using 1 &#x000b5;g/ml of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> &#x003b1;-toxin. Because the toxin pores are large enough to permit the flow of calcium and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhakdi et al., 1993</xref>), and preliminary experiments demonstrated a loss of forskolin-stimulated response in the absence of added ATP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200810097/DC1">Supplemental text</ext-link>), basolateral solutions were nominally calcium free and 1 mM Na-ATP was added to the basolateral solution. In addition, ouabain was added to the basolateral solution after permeabilization commenced to inhibit the NaK-ATPase and limit ATP consumption.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>I-V relations are plotted as the average value of the current for the duration of each holding potential.

For whole cell I-V data with a chloride equilibrium potential of 0 mV (symmetrical chloride concentrations), the nonlinearity of the I-V relation was quantified by calculating the ratio (R<sub>IV</sub>) of currents measured at the &#x000b1;60-mV step (Vstep) potentials:<disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="200810097eqn001.jpg"/></disp-formula></p><p>For HBE monolayer data, the chloride equilibrium potential was approximately &#x000b1;10 mV based on the gradient direction.

These experiments were performed using the short-circuit technique under standard conditions for HBE monolayers that included a bicarbonate-buffered Ringer's solution in both mucosal and serosal compartments and continuous aeration with a CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> mix to maintain pH. After amiloride inhibition of ENaC currents, HBE monolayers exhibited an average basal current of &#x02212;13.7 &#x000b1; 1.2 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Apical addition of 50 &#x000b5;M GlyH-101 rapidly inhibited 44 &#x000b1; 4% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) of this basal current (gray curve). The addition of forskolin to the GlyH-101&#x02013;blocked monolayer produced a small increase in Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> secretion (&#x00394;Isc = &#x02212;4.1 &#x000b1; 1.5 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>) that was completely inhibited by basolateral addition of bumetanide; basolateral addition of 4,4&#x02032;-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2' disulfonic acid (DIDS) had little or no effect on the residual current. By comparison (black curve), forskolin stimulated a larger Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> secretory current (&#x00394;Isc = &#x02212;17.7 &#x000b1; 5.6 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>; <italic>n</italic> = 4) in the absence of GlyH-101 that was substantially inhibited by basolateral addition of bumetanide. Unlike the GlyH-101&#x02013;blocked monolayer, however, basolateral addition of DIDS blocked a portion of the current remaining after bumetanide inhibition, reducing the final current to a level comparable to GlyH-101&#x02013;inhibited monolayers. These results indicated that GlyH-101 significantly inhibited the constitutive current present before forskolin addition, confirming prior observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, they suggested that a portion of the anion secretory response in HBE monolayers after NKCC1 block by bumetanide may be due to bicarbonate secretion, as basolateral DIDS is expected to inhibit multiple basolateral bicarbonate entry processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Devor et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fischer and Widdicombe, 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Short-circuit current measurements in HBE monolayers reveal GlyH-101 inhibition of basal anion secretion.

Unlike most blockers of CFTR, this negatively charged glycine hydrazide occludes the extracellular vestibule of the open CFTR pore, which results in a strong inward rectification (IR) of the CFTR I-V relation in the presence of blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sheppard, 2004</xref>). Another commonly used CFTR channel blocker is glibenclamide; the strong OR I-V characteristic observed during glibenclamide inhibition of CFTR has been attributed to the interaction of this negatively charged blocker with the intracellular face of the channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schultz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sheppard, 2004</xref>).

The current rundown and stabilization was unaffected by the application of forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Strikingly, we found that GlyH-101 was also a potent inhibitor of the constitutive activity of SLC26A9 at a concentration (50 &#x000b5;M) typically used to inhibit CFTR, blocking 71 &#x000b1; 4% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) of the constitutive current.

These I-V ratios suggest that the interaction of GlyH-101 with SLC26A9 is mechanistically different from that with CFTR. Although glibenclamide did not significantly inhibit SLC26A9 currents at a holding potential of &#x02212;40 mV, the R<sub>IV</sub> during its application dropped slightly, but significantly, from 1.06 &#x000b1; 0.07 to slightly IR (0.95 &#x000b1; 0.02; <italic>n</italic> = 6; paired <italic>t</italic> test; P &#x0003c; 0.05). Thus, it is possible that glibenclamide has a weak interaction with SLC26A9 that might reach statistical significance at a higher concentration and/or longer duration of application. In contrast, glibenclamide inhibition of forskolin-stimulated HEK 293 cells expressing wtCFTR displayed the expected strong OR R<sub>IV</sub> (1.84 &#x000b1; 0.02; discussed in detail below). The inhibitory actions of both blockers were compared against untreated or forskolin-treated controls at time points after the initial current rundown, and both blockers were prepared in the same concentration of vehicle (0.1% DMSO). Under the conditions used here, the inhibition of current and shift in R<sub>IV</sub> indicate that GlyH-101 significantly inhibits SLC26A9, whereas glibenclamide does not. Most importantly, the shift in R<sub>IV</sub> on the application of either blocker to SLC26A9 is significantly different from the shift in R<sub>IV</sub> during their inhibition of CFTR, providing a fingerprint to uniquely identify the two channels.</p></sec><sec><title>Coexpression of SLC26A9 and wtCFTR enhances the response to forskolin</title><p>Cells coexpressing SLC26A9 + wtCFTR had a basal current of &#x02212;21 &#x000b1; 3 pA/pF with an Rm of 218 &#x000b1; 21 M&#x003a9; (<italic>n</italic> = 56) on establishment of the whole cell mode; these values were not statistically different from cells expressing SLC26A9 alone (above).

As reported above and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>, cells expressing SLC26A9 alone demonstrated a slight IR during application of either blocker, whereas cells expressing CFTR alone demonstrated strong IR (GlyH-101) and OR (glibenclamide) I-V relations during inhibition. In addition, the R<sub>IV</sub> values during blocker inhibition of coexpressors before forskolin stimulation were the same as for SLC26A9 alone (0.84 &#x000b1; 0.04, <italic>n</italic> = 3 for GlyH-101; 1.03 &#x000b1; 0.07, <italic>n</italic> = 6 for glibenclamide), as was also shown for the current magnitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). In the presence of forskolin, the R<sub>IV</sub> values for the blocked currents were intermediate between the values measured for SLC26A9 alone and wtCFTR alone, suggesting that both channels were contributing to the total stimulated current observed in the coexpressors. Similarly, although GlyH-101 inhibited 90 &#x000b1; 2% of the forskolin-stimulated CFTR-alone current, it was less effective on the constitutive SLC26A9 current (71 &#x000b1; 4%) and the forskolin-stimulated current in the coexpressors (65 &#x000b1; 3%). These results are consistent with a physical interaction between stimulated CFTR and SLC26A9, as was demonstrated for wtCFTR and SLC26A3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ko et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2004</xref>). Reversing the order of treatment (blocker for 3 min, then forskolin stimulation for 3 min in the continued presence of blocker) resulted in the same final R<sub>IV</sub> values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).</p><p>With clearly defined R<sub>IV</sub> values for SLC26A9 and CFTR expressed alone and together, we tested the effect of GlyH-101 inhibition on the poststimulation current evident in the coexpressors after forskolin washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>, HEK 293 coexpressors were first stimulated with forskolin for 3 min, and then perfused with forskolin-free solution for 3 min to establish the poststimulation current (295 &#x000b1; 57% of basal current; <italic>n</italic> = 11). Cells were then treated with GlyH-101 for 3 min, which significantly blocked the poststimulation current (73 &#x000b1; 10%; <italic>n</italic> = 3; P &#x0003c; 0.05). Washout of the blocker resulted in a small recovery of the poststimulation current, reminiscent of the partial reversal of the GlyH-101 block in cells expressing SLC26A9 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). The R<sub>IV</sub> during block of the poststimulation current was 0.83 &#x000b1; 0.03 (<italic>n</italic> = 3), identical to the value obtained for GlyH-101 block in cells expressing SLC26A9 alone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Thus, the action of GlyH-101 on the poststimulation current in coexpressors was the same as its action on the constitutive current of SLC26A9 alone: 70% inhibition with an R<sub>IV</sub> of 0.83. These results suggest that the enhanced poststimulation current was due to SLC26A9, rather than to a continued activation of CFTR in the absence of forskolin. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>, the poststimulation current of the coexpressors was significantly greater than in cells expressing SLC26A9 alone. Either forskolin stimulation in coexpressors recruited additional SLC26A9 channels to the plasma membrane, or the open probability of SLC26A9 increased in the presence of phosphorylated CFTR and persisted after CFTR itself had inactivated. Any change in the properties of SLC26A9 required an interaction with CFTR because forskolin had no impact on the extended currents of SLC26A9 expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>GlyH-101 blocks the poststimulation current in HEK cells coexpressing SLC26A9 and wtCFTR.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, HBE monolayers exhibit a basal current after inhibition of sodium transport and in the absence of cAMP/PKA stimulation. Previously, this basal current has been attributed to a constitutive activity of CFTR, in part because it is absent in HBE cells from CF patients. Interestingly, and also in support of a basal activation of CFTR, it was demonstrated that this basal activity was inhibited by GlyH-101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Song et al., 2006</xref>), and that this inhibition had an impact on ASL composition.

With a mucosal to serosal chloride gradient of 48 mM (Eq<sub>Cl</sub> = &#x02212;13 mV), constitutive chloride currents from mucosa to serosa were evident after permeabilization, and forskolin stimulation tripled the current.

GlyH-101 was equally effective at inhibiting the constitutive current before forskolin stimulation (red trace).

To probe for a basal current suggestive of SLC26A9 expression at the apical membrane, we applied the &#x003b1;-toxin permeabilization protocol to CF HBE. In the presence of a mucosal to serosal chloride gradient, the CF epithelia had an initial basal current of &#x02212;5.67 &#x000b1; 0.56 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 6) that shifted to 2.38 &#x000b1; 0.51 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup> after permeabilization, significantly less basal current than observed in normal HBE (16.3 &#x000b1; 1.0 &#x003bc;A/cm<sup>2</sup>). This basal current was unaffected by either GlyH-101 (107 &#x000b1; 10% of basal; <italic>n</italic> = 3) or glibenclamide (105 &#x000b1; 6% of basal; <italic>n</italic> = 3), and the I-V relation during blocker addition remained mildly IR for both (0.94 &#x000b1; 0.02 and 0.93 &#x000b1; 0.03, respectively). The addition of forskolin was without effect on the current, as expected for a lack of functional CFTR at the apical plasma membrane. Thus, the CF monolayers did not appear to express conductive SLC26A9 or CFTR at the apical membrane.</p><p>To test whether defective CFTR could suppress or modify the expression of SLC26A9 at the plasma membrane, we coexpressed SLC26A9 and &#x00394;F508 CFTR in HEK 293 cells. These &#x00394;F508 CFTR coexpressors had a basal current of &#x02212;29 &#x000b1; 5 pA/pF (<italic>n</italic> = 5), but their I-V relations matched the R<sub>IV</sub> properties measured for endogenous chloride channels in HEK cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table III</xref>). This basal current rapidly ran down (50 &#x000b1; 9% in 3 min), consistent with observations in HEK cells expressing GFP alone (Supplemental text).

The same phenomenon was observed in the HEK cells coexpressing SLC26A9 with &#x00394;F508 CFTR, even though the cells were exposed to forskolin for 3 min. In contrast, cells expressing wtCFTR alone transitioned from an OR R<sub>IV</sub> to a linear relation with current stimulation on exposure to forskolin. Thus, the linear R<sub>IV</sub> fingerprint, typical of SLC26A9 alone or in combination with wtCFTR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), was not evident when the channel was coexpressed with &#x00394;F508 CFTR.</p><table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><label>TABLE III.</label><caption><p>Endogenous channel R<sub>IV</sub> fingerprint is evident in SLC26A9 + &#x00394;F508CFTR coexpressing HEK 293 cells</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Construct</td><td colspan="3" align="center" rowspan="1">Time</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 s</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">240 s</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">420 s</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GFP(&#x000b1; fsk, n.s.)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn5">a</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.27 &#x000b1; 0.09</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.28 &#x000b1; 0.09</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.29 &#x000b1; 0.11</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">wtCFTR (no fsk)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.27 &#x000b1; 0.15</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.36 &#x000b1; 0.11</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">nt<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn6">b</xref></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">wtCFTR(3 min fsk at 240 s)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.30 &#x000b1; 0.05</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.98 &#x000b1; 0.01<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn7">c</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.95 &#x000b1; 0.01<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn7">c</xref></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SLC26A9 + &#x00394;F508CFTR(3 min fsk at 240 s)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.20 &#x000b1; 0.05</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.20 &#x000b1; 0.07</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.27 &#x000b1; 0.08</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn5"><label>a</label><p>GFP-alone constructs did not demonstrate significant differences in R<sub>IV</sub> in the presence or absence of forskolin stimulation, and the data are pooled.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn6"><label>b</label><p>nt, not tested.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn7"><label>c</label><p>P &#x0003c; 0.01 compared to same time point in other constructs.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>SLC26A9 immunoprecipitates wtCFTR</title><p>To confirm an interaction between SLC26A9 and wtCFTR in vivo, coimmunoprecipitation was performed on HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with wtCFTR &#x000b1; myc-tagged SLC26A9.

However, a mechanism for basal CFTR activity in the absence of added agonists has not been forthcoming. Our results have demonstrated that SLC26A9 exhibits the properties previously attributed to the constitutive activity of CFTR: it is active in the absence of cAMP/PKA-dependent agonists, it conducts chloride and contributes to transepithelial chloride currents, it displays linear I-V characteristics, and it is significantly inhibited by the CFTR pore blocker, GlyH-101. Furthermore, SLC26A9 appears to require functional CFTR to maintain significant activity at the apical membrane of airway epithelia. Finally, our results in the HEK 293 expression system show that the coexpression of SLC26A9 and wtCFTR confers enhanced forskolin-stimulated chloride currents, suggestive of a reciprocal regulatory interaction, as demonstrated between other SLC26A family proteins and CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ko et al., 2004</xref>).</p><sec><title>Establishing a pharmacological fingerprint for SLC26A9</title><p>Determining a means for differentiating the contributions of SLC26A9 and CFTR to the chloride secretory currents was essential, as there was no definitive identifying feature in the constitutive activity of SLC26A9 expressed in HEK 293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) that could be used to differentiate it from CFTR in HBE monolayers. Because GlyH-101 was known to inhibit basal currents in airway epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Song et al., 2006</xref>), we evaluated its ability to interact with SLC26A9. GlyH-101 proved to be an effective inhibitor of SLC26A9, although the difference in the magnitude of inhibition, while statistically significant, was not sufficiently selective to permit differentiation of the contributions of SLC26A9 and CFTR to the currents across airway epithelia. However, the I-V relations during block were markedly different. The typical strong IR I-V relation seen during GlyH-101 inhibition of CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Muanprasat et al., 2004</xref>) was nearly absent during its inhibition of SLC26A9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). We calculated the ratio of the currents (R<sub>IV</sub>) to quantify the degree of nonlinearity in the I-V relations. The R<sub>IV</sub> values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref> document the significant differences noted for SLC26A9 and CFTR. Thus, measurement of R<sub>IV</sub> during blocker application provided the needed fingerprint to examine the behavior of HEK 293 cells coexpressing SLC26A9 and CFTR, and ultimately HBE.</p></sec><sec><title>Coexpression of SLC26A9 with CFTR in HEK 293 cells</title><p>Cells coexpressing SLC26A9 and CFTR had both constitutive currents and enhanced currents in response to cAMP stimulation, as quantified during and after exposure to the cAMP agonist, forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Before forskolin stimulation, the magnitude of the constitutive current and the GlyH-101 inhibition fingerprint in coexpressors were indistinguishable from the responses measured for SLC26A9 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), suggesting that the channels were acting independently in the absence of cAMP/PKA stimulation. In studies of the interaction between the electrogenic exchanger SLC26A3 or A6 and CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dorwart et al., 2008</xref>), pH measurements indicated that the exchangers were functional in the absence of stimulation, and CFTR activation enhanced not only the open probability (Po) of CFTR, but also the anion exchange rate of these SLC26A transporters. In our studies, the magnitude of the currents observed during forskolin stimulation in the coexpressors exceeded the sum of the currents measured from SLC26A9 and CFTR expressed separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>), suggesting that activation of CFTR indeed promoted functional channel interactions. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11</xref>) confirmed a physical interaction between these proteins in vivo. Thus, our results were consistent with these earlier observations.</p><p>To identify whether the activity of both channels increased during their stimulation-induced functional interaction, as noted above for SLC26A3/6, we looked to the blocker results. Interestingly, binding of the STAS domain of these SLC26A transporters to the phosphorylated R domain was shown to increase the Po of CFTR 2.2-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ko et al., 2004</xref>). This magnitude of increase in CFTR activity alone could account for the enhanced forskolin-stimulated current of the SLC26A9 and CFTR coexpressors. Application of GlyH-101 during the forskolin-stimulated current plateau shifted the I-V relation from linear to IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), but cells coexpressing SLC26A9 + CFTR demonstrated significantly less nonlinearity than cells expressing CFTR alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, B and D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Also, the magnitude of current inhibition in the coexpressors (65%) was significantly less than that observed for inhibition of CFTR alone (90%), and was not different from the inhibition of SLC26A9 alone (71%). These results indicated that current flowed through both SLC26A9 and CFTR during stimulation. If the enhanced response of the stimulated coexpressors was due entirely to an increase in the Po of CFTR, we would expect the magnitude of GlyH-101 inhibition and its R<sub>IV</sub> properties to mirror the properties observed for CFTR alone because the prestimulation current for SLC26A9 was relatively small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Rather, the GlyH-101 inhibition results support a role for increased activity of SLC26A9 during CFTR stimulation.</p><p>Additional evidence that SLC26A9 activity was modified by an interaction with stimulated CFTR was provided by the enhanced poststimulation currents that persisted after forskolin washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>, GlyH-101 effectively blocked the poststimulation current, and the inhibition magnitude and kinetics were similar to its actions on SLC26A9 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Furthermore, the R<sub>IV</sub> for this inhibition was identical to that of SLC26A9 alone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), suggesting that the enhanced poststimulation current was due entirely to SLC26A9. This current could result from increased SLC26A9 activity (Po) maintained by a continued interaction with CFTR after R domain dephosphorylation, or from the recruitment of additional SLC26A9 channels to the membrane during forskolin stimulation in the presence of CFTR. Either mechanism depends on CFTR stimulation, so that a lack of functional CFTR would impact SLC26A9 currents at the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>HBE responses reflect SLC26A9 properties</title><p>HBE cells harvested from both non-CF and CF donors expressed mRNA for both SLC26A9 and CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). To probe the I-V relations of the monolayers against the blocker fingerprint identified in HEK 293 cells, it was necessary to electrically isolate the apical membrane. We optimized an &#x003b1;-toxin permeabilization protocol (Supplemental text) that left the basolateral membrane completely permeable to chloride, as assessed by reversing the chloride gradient direction, while leaving the monolayers responsive to forskolin stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>). Similar to the intact monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), GlyH-101 blocked the constitutive chloride current in permeabilized HBE monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 A</xref>), and the R<sub>IV</sub> during inhibition remained linear (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). After GlyH-101 inhibition, the addition of forskolin resulted in only a small increase in current, but the R<sub>IV</sub> nonetheless shifted significantly to IR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>), consistent with activation of CFTR and confirming that the properties of the constitutive current were like those of SLC26A9.</p><p>The degree of nonlinearity was mild and more closely matched the results from HEK cells coexpressing SLC26A9 and wtCFTR than those expressing CFTR alone. The reduced degree of nonlinearity for all monolayer R<sub>IV</sub> measurements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>) as compared with the same protocols in HEK 293 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>) appears to reflect the I-V properties of the paracellular pathway because values quite similar to those observed in the HEK coexpressors were noted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables I</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">II</xref>) after subtraction of the estimated paracellular current component. In particular, the shift toward IR observed on the addition of forskolin to GlyH-101&#x02013;inhibited monolayers was amplified after adjustment for G<sub>P</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential blocker variability</title><p>One concern with the use of blocker response as a channel identifier in these assays is that the blocker effectiveness could be modified by the interaction between CFTR and SLC26A9. First, we note that earlier studies using glibenclamide demonstrated that it was equally effective at inhibiting the forskolin-stimulated currents in HEK cells expressing CFTR alone as in cells coexpressing electrogenic SLC26A transporters and CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ko et al., 2004</xref>), and at the same concentration used in our studies. Second, we demonstrated that GlyH-101 inhibition of the poststimulation current in HEK 293 cells coexpressing both CFTR and SLC26A9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>) results in the same R<sub>IV</sub> and magnitude of inhibition as seen in cells expressing SLC26A9 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), even though this current required CFTR stimulation. Thus, the properties of GlyH-101 inhibition of SLC26A9 would not appear to be altered by its functional interaction with CFTR. Third, the changes in R<sub>IV</sub> in HEK 293 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>) and HBE monolayers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>) support a shift toward greater IR upon activation of CFTR in the presence of GlyH-101, consistent with CFTR contributing the greater nonlinearity. Finally, the R<sub>IV</sub> values measured in HEK cells coexpressing SLC26A9 plus CFTR are the approximate averages of the values measured in the cells expressing the channels individually for both glibenclamide and GlyH-101 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Thus, our data supports the concept that a summation of the voltage-dependent properties of the blocker effects provides the simplest explanation for the aggregate R<sub>IV</sub> behavior of the coexpressed channels, rather than modification of blocker efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x00394;F508-CFTR alters SLC26A9 behavior</title><p>Permeabilized &#x00394;F508-CFTR HBE monolayers lacked both constitutive currents and a response to forskolin, as in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Smith and Welsh, 1992</xref>). The addition of blockers did not affect the magnitude of the small transepithelial current observed after permeabilization or the associated R<sub>IV</sub>. Thus, although the RT-PCR results indicated that CF HBE expressed SLC26A9 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>), the absence of CFTR at the apical membrane correlated with a lack of constitutive current. Similarly, HEK 293 cells coexpressing &#x00394;F508-CFTR and SLC26A9 failed to demonstrate the R<sub>IV</sub> fingerprint identified in cells expressing SLC26A9 and/or wtCFTR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables I</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">III</xref>), although they displayed a small, transient basal current that bore the fingerprint of endogenous chloride channels. Forskolin had no effect on the R<sub>IV</sub> as well, in contrast to cells expressing wtCFTR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table III</xref>). Thus, the HEK 293 system confirmed that coexpression of SLC26A9 with &#x00394;F508-CFTR suppressed the function of both proteins at the plasma membrane.</p><p>These results suggest that &#x00394;F508 CFTR has a negative impact on the overall activity of SLC26A9. Positive regulation of SLC26A9 and other SLC26A family members through an interaction with wtCFTR has been discussed above; this positive interaction is thought to occur at the plasma membrane because it is facilitated by the presence of Class I PDZ motifs in both proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ko et al., 2004</xref>). Because &#x00394;F508 CFTR does not traffic to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cheng et al., 1990</xref>), its interaction with SLC26A9 might be expected to occur at the level of the ER, and our coimmunoprecipitation results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Fig. 11</xref>) confirm that SLC26A9 associates with both immature and mature CFTR. Because immature &#x00394;F508 CFTR is delivered to the proteasome for degradation and SLC26A9 appears to be associated with it, SLC26A9 may also be sequestered in the ER and targeted for degradation. Finally, although expression of SLC26A9 alone in HEK 293 cells produced constitutive currents, this may occur because high levels of expression overwhelm the cell's endogenous traffic regulatory and/or quality control mechanisms. The question of whether SLC26A9 can function as a chloride channel in the absence of endogenously expressed wtCFTR will be explored in future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential functions of SLC26A9 in the airway epithelia</title><p>Constitutive chloride conductances with properties similar to SLC26A9 have been demonstrated in various native tissues, such as human trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Smith and Welsh, 1992</xref>), bronchus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Coakley et al., 2003</xref>), and nasal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Paradiso et al., 2003</xref>) surface epithelium, porcine trachea and small airway epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), porcine and human submucosal glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Song et al., 2006</xref>), and the serous cell submucosal gland cell line Calu-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krouse et al., 2004</xref>). In all cases, these currents have been attributed to spontaneous activity of CFTR. These observations, combined with our findings, suggest that SLC26A9 contributes significantly to constitutive anion secretion by both airway gland and surface epithelia, and thus may be an important modulator of ASL volume and pH regulation. The absence of constitutive currents in tissues from CF patients, together with our data suggesting that SLC26A9 is not functional at the plasma membrane when coexpressed with &#x00394;F508-CFTR, implies that SLC26A9 contributes to the airway pathology observed in CF.</p><p>Members of the SLC26A family are found in all epithelia known to express CFTR, and they demonstrate a diverse range of functions that appear to be specific for the physiological requirements of the organ systems where they are expressed: bicarbonate transport in the pancreas and intestine, acid regulation in the gastric parietal cells, and as demonstrated here, constitutive chloride secretion in the airway. As a family of transport proteins whose functions coordinate with the activity of CFTR, they support the hypothesis of CFTR as a transmembrane conductance regulator.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material Index</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200810097_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jgp.200810097_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Drs.
