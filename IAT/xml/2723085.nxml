These DNA lesions can be repaired by various repair mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. For example, the most frequent DNA lesions are efficiently removed by pathways called base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, some unrepaired DNA lesions can remain at replication because of limited capacity of DNA repair systems. These lesions induce gaps in the newly synthesized strand. The gaps are filled by postreplication repair (PRR) system and this repair system is conserved from yeast to mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genes belonging to the Rad6 epistasis group play an important role in the PRR pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In this pathway, Rad6 and Rad18 are the most important genes. Rad6 is an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and Rad18 is a single-stranded DNA binding protein and has ubiquitin-ligase (E3) activity. Rad18 forms a specific complex with Rad6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Human homolog of yeast <italic>Rad18 </italic>gene is mapped on chromosome 3p24-25 and it has been shown that human Rad18 protein interacts with the human homologs of the Rad6 protein (HHR6A and HHR6B) and is involved in PRR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Rad18 or Rad6 mutations cause higher sensitivity to various mutagens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Inactivation of Rad18 in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to increasing sensitivity to various DNA-damaging agents and to increasing sister-chromatic exchange. Rad18 contributes to maintenance of genomic stability through PRR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, the status of <italic>Rad18 </italic>in human cancers is still unknown.</p><p>In the present study, we analyzed the expression and the mutation of <italic>Rad18 </italic>in human cancer cell lines and NSCLC tissues and also assessed whether there is some functional difference due to the SNP of <italic>Rad18</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>Twenty-nine digestive carcinoma cell lines and five lung carcinoma cell lines were used in this study.

The following features were looked at: sex, age, and pathological status (size, histological type, T stage, lymph node metastasis, pStage). UICC Tumor-Node-Metastasis Classification of Malignant Tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] was used to classify pathological status.

After electrophoreses, gels were stained using Silver Stain Plus Kit according to the instruction manual (BioRad). All samples were screened for the presence of an aberrant band compared with reference sample. Samples with abnormal SSCP bands were directly sequenced by ABI 310.

Genetic instability can be divided in two. One is chromosomal instability and the other is microsatellite instability (MSI). It is reported that chromosomal instability is frequently found in lung cancer but microsatelite instability is rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Though 60% of non small cell lung cancer has loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 3p and it is suggested that several tumor suppressor genes might be mapped in this region, a clear relation between lung cancer development and a single gene mutation has not been reported to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Concerning microsatellite instability, using microsatellite markers located at 3p or targeting human mismatch repair gene, hMLH1, has been analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. They concluded that MSI is not frequently found in lung cancer tissue or pleural effusion of lung cancer patients.</p><p>We focused on Rad18 which functions as a PRR system and mapped on 3p25. Within the cell lines and lung cancer tissues that we examined, no <italic>Rad18 </italic>mutation was detected but a homozygous deletion in PC3 (lung cancer cell line). This result suggests that there might be no relation between Rad18 mutation and lung cancer development. During the SSCP analysis, we found a SNP (Gln 302 Arg) which was relatively frequent in lung cancer tissues. Recently, a report that the same SNP of <italic>Rad18 </italic>is associated to the risk of lung cancer was published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Different to our study, this report was focused only on the SNP and the mutation analysis of the entire Rad18 gene was not evaluated. They used only genomic DNA extracted from a formalin embedded lung cancer tissue which was PCR amplified and checked only the status of codon 302 SNP and concluded that this SNP is the risk of lung cancer development. The total number of the lung cancer sample was quite large and the frequency of SNP and lung cancer development was statistically different. If this single nucleotide change (which changes the amino acid sequence) is the cause of lung cancer, this is no more a "polymorphism" but a "mutation". And if this nucleotide change is a "mutation", there should be a difference in the function between these two different proteins. Based on the function of Rad18, as a key protein of PRR system, the sensitivity to the DNA damaging reagents (cisplatin and CPT-11) were examined according to the reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, when Rad18 is null, it is reported that the growth of the cells won't change but the abnormal morphologies with nuclear segregation will occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus we investigated the differences of cell morphology, cell growth and sensitivity to anti-drug agents. Unfortunately, we could not find a difference from both clinical samples and in vitro study. Furthermore, no difference was observed in DNA repair function. Different to the report, we used mRNA and analyzed the whole open reading frame of <italic>Rad18 </italic>gene and also examined the expression level, in vitro analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>From all these results, we came to a conclusion that, there is no relation between Rad18 and lung cancer development. Still there is a possibility that PRR system might be involved in cancer development. As Rad18 interacts with Rad6 and function as a ubiquitin enzyme to activate PCNA, if these key proteins were involved in cancer, the PRR system will not function and might lead to cancer development. Further analysis of this system is required to clear whether there is a relation between PRR and cancer development.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TN was involved in the molecular genetic study, immunoassays, sequence alignment and statistical analysis.
