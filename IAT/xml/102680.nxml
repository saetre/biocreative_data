In the T-ag-immortalized AT-1, AT-2 and HL-1 cardiomyocytes, normal cellular proteins associating with T-ag and p53 were identified, isolated and microsequenced. Peptide sequencing revealed that proteins of 90, 100 and 160 kDa were homologs of MRE11, NBS1 and RAD50, respectively. These three proteins play critical roles in the detection and repair of DNA double-strand breaks, activation of cell cycle checkpoints and telomere maintenance. In this report, we describe the cDNA cloning and double-strand sequencing of the rat homologs of <italic>MRE11</italic>, <italic>NBS1</italic> and <italic>RAD50</italic>. We also determined the mRNA and protein levels of <italic>MRE11</italic>, <italic>NBS1</italic> and <italic>RAD50</italic> at different stages of heart development and in different tissues. <italic>MRE11</italic> mRNA was only detected in the immortalized cardiomyocytes and in the testes. Although the 90 kDa MRE11 protein was seen in most samples examined, it was only detected at extremely low levels in proliferating cardiomyocytes (normal and immortalized). The 6.0 kb <italic>MRE11</italic>-related mRNA transcript (<italic>MRT</italic>) was seen in all samples examined.

We propose that SV40 large T antigen&#x02019;s interaction with the MRE11-NBS1-RAD50 pathway and with p53 ablates critical cell cycle checkpoints and that this is one of the major factors involved in the ability of this oncoprotein to immortalize cardiomyocytes.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x8bf6c18.0x8bfcb80" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession nos AF218574&#x02013;AF218576</p></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The heart is the first organ to form during embryogenesis. During fetal development, growth of the heart results from proliferation of differentiating cardiomyocytes. In mammals, cardiomyocyte proliferation occurs during fetal and early postnatal development, ceasing irreversibly in mice and rats at approximately postnatal day three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c3">3</xref>) and possibly by the third week in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c4">4</xref>). After this period, the increasing functional demand placed on the heart by the growing organism is met by cardiac muscle cell enlargement (hypertrophy) rather than proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c3">3</xref>). Because adult mammalian cardiomyocytes cannot divide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c6">6</xref>), cardiac injury results in loss of functional muscle tissue with attempted compensation occurring by hypertrophy of the remaining myocytes and proliferation of non-myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c6">6</xref>). However, mammalian cardiomyocyte proliferation has been induced by the expression of the SV40 large T antigen (T-ag) oncoprotein, as shown in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c9">9</xref>), cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c11">11</xref>) and human fetal cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c12">12</xref>). In transgenic mice, cardiomyocyte proliferation was also induced by the expression of c-<italic>MYC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c13">13</xref>), calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c14">14</xref>) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c15">15</xref>). These examples of induced cardiomyocyte proliferation support the possibility of stimulating cardiac myocyte proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic> subsequent to cardiac trauma as a means of replacing lost functional cardiac tissue. Thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) by which T-ag, or any factor, induces cardiomyocyte proliferation could be of great potential therapeutic value.</p><p>Extensive research indicates some of the transforming activity of T-ag resides in its ability to physically complex with and repress the activity of pRb and p53, two tumor suppressor proteins involved in the control of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c17">17</xref>). In a similar manner, both the adenovirus E1a and E1b proteins and the oncogenic human papilloma virus E7 and E6 proteins induce cell proliferation by complexing with pRb and p53, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c18">18</xref>). By binding pRb, T-ag induces the release of the E2F transcription factor, which activates promoters of genes required for S phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c19">19</xref>). However, induced proliferation of terminally differentiated cells forces inappropriate DNA synthesis, resulting in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c20">20</xref>). By complexing with p53, T-ag and E1b block the apoptotic function of p53 and allow proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c18">18</xref>). T-ag-induced proliferation is also related to its ability to associate with p300 and CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c21">21</xref>). Thus, T-ag can induce proliferation, in many cases, by physically associating with endogenous cellular proteins involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis. To further investigate possible molecular controls of proliferation of cardiomyocytes, we identified other endogenous cellular proteins associating with p53 and T-ag in cardiomyocytes.</p><p>For this study T-ag-immortalized AT-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c23">23</xref>), AT-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c25">25</xref>) and HL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c26">26</xref>) cardiomyocyte cell lines were used. These were derived from proliferating atrial cardiomyocytes of transgenic mice expressing T-ag in the atrium of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c9">9</xref>). We immunoprecipitated proteins from AT-1 and AT-2 cardiomyocytes using anti-T-ag and anti-p53 antibodies. We identified, isolated and microsequenced proteins of 90, 100 and 160 kDa. Partial peptide sequences revealed these proteins were the rat homologs of MRE11, NBS1 and RAD50, respectively. In this report, we describe the cloning, sequencing and developmental expression of these genes in the heart and discuss their possible involvement in the immortalization of cardiomyocytes by T-ag.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Nucleotide sequences of the rat <italic>MRE11</italic>, <italic>NBS1</italic> and <italic>RAD50</italic> homologs were deposited in GenBank&#x02122;&#x0002f;EBI Data Bank with accession nos AF218574, AF218575 and AF218576, respectively.</p><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Antibodies PAb 101 and PAb 419 were from American <italic>Type Culture</italic> Collection (Rockville, MD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c28">28</xref>) and PAb 421 was from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA) and was also generously provided by Dr Ed Harlow (Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Charlestown, MA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c28">28</xref>).

In response to DNA damage, mammalian cells withdraw from the cell cycle to allow for DNA repair. Within 30 min of DNA DSBs, nuclear foci appear which contain BRCA1, NBS1, MRE11 and RAD50 proteins and the foci remain until the bulk of the DSBs are repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c62">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c64">64</xref>).

To examine their potential role in regulating cardiomyocyte proliferation, we cloned and characterized the rat homologs of <italic>MRE11</italic>, <italic>NBS1</italic> and <italic>RAD50</italic>.</p><p>Because MRE11 protein was immunoprecipitated from AT-1 and AT-2 cells by antibody PAb 421, it was assumed that western blot analysis would detect MRE11 protein in AT-1 and AT-2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd448f1">1</xref>). However, MRE11 protein was undetectable in AT-1 or AT-2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd448f4">4</xref>B). This indicates MRE11 protein was present at very low levels in AT-1 and AT-2 cells. It also suggests that most of the MRE11 protein was in complexes that could be immunoprecipitated by antibody PAb 421. The very low levels of MRE11 protein in the AT-1 and AT-2 cells was also surprising as these cells contained the highest levels of <italic>MRE11</italic> mRNA observed in any tissue examined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd448f3">3</xref>). The presence of at least some MRE11 protein would seem necessary, as the loss of MRE11 from embryonic stem cells is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c66">66</xref>). In the samples examined in the present study, in addition to the very low levels of MRE11 in the AT-1, AT-2 and HL-1 cells, MRE11 protein was either not present or present at undetectable levels in proliferating cardiomyocytes from fetal-day 17 heart tissue and the adult rat brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd448f4">4</xref>). Thus in both examples of proliferating cardiomyocytes examined, i.e. fetal cardiac tissue and T-ag-immortalized cardiomyocytes, MRE11 protein was present at very low levels, if at all. However, MRE11 is compatible with proliferation because in embryonic stem cells, primary human fibroblasts and immortalized cells, MRE11 protein is readily observed by both immunoprecipitation and <italic>in situ</italic> immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c66">66</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c68">68</xref>). However, the very low level of MRE11 protein seen in the present study in both examples of proliferating cardiomyocytes suggests low levels of MRE11 may be necessary to allow proliferation of cardiomyocytes. A role for MRE11 in controlling proliferation is supported by the recent observation that in cells subjected to ionizing radiation, MRE11 is necessary for the suppression of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c67">67</xref>). This is also supported by the recent finding that ATM cannot suppress DNA synthesis without MRE11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c65">65</xref>) and NBS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c70">70</xref>).</p><p>NBS1 also seems to be involved in the control of the cell cycle because cultured cells from Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) patients, who have a mutation in <italic>NBS1</italic>, have a perturbed G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S cell cycle checkpoint, and NBS cells fail to halt DNA synthesis after ionizing radiation-induced DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c72">72</xref>). In addition, the normal up-regulation of p53 protein levels observed in response to ionizing radiation is reduced in NBS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c72">72</xref>). The involvement of NBS1 protein with cell cycle regulation is also supported by the presence of a forkhead-associated domain and a breast cancer C-terminal domain, both of which are commonly found in cell cycle regulatory and DNA repair proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c35">35</xref>). Because the MRE11 and NBS1 proteins function together in DSB repair, it was expected that NBS1 protein would also be present at low levels in the T-ag-immortalized cardiomyocytes, similar to the low levels of MRE11 observed. However, NBS1 protein was extremely abundant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd448f7">7</xref>B). The increased levels of NBS1 protein may result from the stabilization of NBS1 by T-ag in a manner similar to the stabilization and increased levels of p53 commonly seen in other T-ag-immortalized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c73">73</xref>). NBS1 protein stabilization is also suggested by the observation that although AT-1, AT-2 and HL-1 cells had the highest levels of NBS1 protein, they had the lowest levels of <italic>NBS1</italic> mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd448f6">6</xref>A and B). The data presented here suggest that although NBS1 protein was observed at very high levels in the AT-1, AT-2 and HL-1 cells, the usual function of NBS1 in halting cell cycle progression was blocked by the presence of T-ag.</p><p>A different possible role for the MRE11<italic>-</italic>NBS1<italic>-</italic>RAD50 complex in cell immortalization is suggested by the role of this complex in telomere maintenance. In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, MRE11<italic>,</italic> XRS2 and RAD50 are essential for maintaining normal telomere ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c75">75</xref>). This is seemingly a necessary requirement for continued cell proliferation as most immortalized mammalian cells have lengthened or stabilized telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd448c77">77</xref>). Although T-ag clearly perturbs the MRE11<italic>-</italic>NBS1<italic>-</italic>RAD50 and p53 pathways in immortalized cardiomyocytes, it remains to be determined if this interaction affects the potential role of the MRE11-NBS1-RAD50 protein complex in maintaining telomeres in mammalian cells.</p><p>We propose that SV40 large T antigen&#x02019;s interaction with the MRE11-NBS1-RAD50 pathway ablates critical cell cycle checkpoints and this is one of the major factors involved in the ability of this oncoprotein to immortalize cardiomyocytes.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd448f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> SV40 large T antigen- and p53-associated proteins in cultured SV40 large T antigen-transformed AT-1 murine cardiomyocytes.
