Although the pathogenesis of sporadic PD is unknown, the identification of the mendelian genetic factor PINK1 has provided new mechanistic insights. In order to investigate the role of PINK1 in Parkinson's disease, we studied PINK1 loss of function in human and primary mouse neurons. Using RNAi, we created stable PINK1 knockdown in human dopaminergic neurons differentiated from foetal ventral mesencephalon stem cells, as well as in an immortalised human neuroblastoma cell line. We sought to validate our findings in primary neurons derived from a transgenic PINK1 knockout mouse. For the first time we demonstrate an age dependent neurodegenerative phenotype in human and mouse neurons. PINK1 deficiency leads to reduced long-term viability in human neurons, which die via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Human neurons lacking PINK1 demonstrate features of marked oxidative stress with widespread mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal mitochondrial morphology. We report that PINK1 plays a neuroprotective role in the mitochondria of mammalian neurons, especially against stress such as staurosporine. In addition we provide evidence that cellular compensatory mechanisms such as mitochondrial biogenesis and upregulation of lysosomal degradation pathways occur in PINK1 deficiency. The phenotypic effects of PINK1 loss-of-function described here in mammalian neurons provides mechanistic insight into the age-related degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons seen in PD.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative motor disorder in the Western world. The disease is characterised clinically by resting tremor, rigidity and slowness of movement (bradykinesia) with symptoms being partially alleviated by administration of exogenous dopamine (L-dopa). Upon neuropathological examination, the brains of patients with PD show marked loss of pigmented dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), and other brain regions. In addition, surviving neurons frequently contain Lewy bodies (LBs) which are intracytoplasmic proteinaceous inclusions, predominantly composed of aggregated &#x003b1;-synuclein. PD is a progressive, incurable and age-related disease, affecting &#x0223c;1.8&#x00025; individuals by the age of 65 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-deRijk1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The majority (&#x0003e;85&#x00025;) of PD cases are sporadic, and the underlying molecular causes unknown. Insight into the mechanisms of PD pathogenesis has come from the identification of mutations in genes associated principally with familial forms of PD. Inherited forms of PD have been linked to mutations in six different genes with seemingly diverse functions. These encode the synaptic protein &#x003b1;-synuclein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Polymeropoulos1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>; an E3 ubiquitin ligase, parkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Kitada1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>; a putative antioxidant chaperone, DJ-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Bonifati1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, a mitochondrial kinase, (PTEN)-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Valente1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, a mitochondrial serine protease, OMI/HTRA2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Strauss1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Zimprich1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

Whilst yielding important insights they do not recapitulate the human disease, that is, in ageing human dopaminergic neurons.

We report the spatio-temporal expression of PINK1 in human dopaminergic neurons, and the effects of PINK1 deficiency including chronic mitochondrial dysfunction, an increase in oxidative stress, and lysosomal pathology. These phenotypic effects may all contribute to the marked decrease in long term viability of PINK1 deficient neurons and enhanced basal and stress-induced caspase-3 activation leading to apoptosis.

Briefly, nuclear size, morphology and cell density measurements are made on nuclei automatically identified in fluorescence channel 1. The BioApplication then measures nuclear intensity in channel 2 and the intensity of lysosomal stain in the cytoplasmic region in channel 3. Upper and lower thresholds are automatically set for nuclear morphology/size, cell membrane permeability and lysosomal mass from user-configurable reference wells (control or wild type neurons). The percentage (indices) of cells in each well that are outside of these thresholds is ascertained. The Cytotoxicity Index is the maximal of nuclear morphology index, membrane permeability index, lysosomal mass index and cell density index, for each well. A mean CI is calculated based on three replicate wells per clone/genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2c3"><title>Counting apoptotic nuclei</title><p>Human neurons were differentiated using the Pre-D protocol on poly-L-lysine glass coverslips (Biocoat) pre-coated in laminin.

We produced stable knockdown models of PINK1 using small interfering RNAs in two complementary cell lines&#x02013;human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y and a novel human NSC line capable of high levels of DAergic differentiation. In addition, we used primary neuronal cultures from PINK1 knockout mice to corroborate our findings and control for potential non-specific effects of RNAi. Human neurons are generated from immortalised human fetal ventral mesencephalic neural stem cells (NSCs) which maintain a stable karyotype in culture, stable growth rates and readily differentiate into function neurons&#x02013;thus providing advantages over commonly used &#x0201c;cancer&#x0201d; cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Donato1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Differentiated NSCs cultures contain a high percentage of DAergic neurons which express typical neuronal markers and display characteristic action potentials.

This suggests PINK1 is not necessary for development which is in-line with the progression of the PINK1 mutation onset of PD. Endogenous PINK1 was expressed within soma and neurites of post-mitotic dopaminergic neurons, although it was not expressed exclusively in these subtypes.

Interestingly, no basal increase in cell death and apoptosis was observed with PINK1 deficient differentiated human neurons or primary mouse neurons at early time points. However, molecular differences do exist between control and PINK1 kd cells at this early stage, specifically in their ability to handle mitochondrial stress. We find that PINK1 deficient cells are acutely sensitive to the toxin STS, which triggers mitochondrial apoptosis via opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) and subsequent cytochrome c release. In SHSY5Y cells lacking PINK1, Bax translocation to the mitochondria and cytochrome c release to the cytoplasm occurs earlier than in controls, and results in elevated levels of caspase activation (caspase-3 and caspase-9). In turn, increased levels of PARP cleavage and nuclear fragmentation are observed in PINK1 kd cells.

Our model shows some similarities to toxin based models of PD: the administration of MPTP to mice results in dopaminergic neuronal loss mediated by Bax translocation to the mitochondria, cytochrome c release, and activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3.

Silencing of TRAP1 in tumor cells also causes mitochondrial swelling, loss of &#x003c8;m, rapid increase in intracellular ROS generation and release of cytochrome C, identical to the effects of PINK1 knockdown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Pridgeon1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Hua1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Rescue experiments placed TRAP1 downstream of PINK1, with phosphorylation of TRAP1 required for its protective activity, which indirectly prevents the release of cytochrome C and ROS generation in response to apoptogenic agents such as hydrogen peroxide. The role of a putative PINK1-TRAP1 interaction in dopaminergic neurons has yet to be investigated, but could provide a key to selective degeneration of these cells if heavily utilised as a protective pathway during stress.</p><p>The primary mechanism for detoxification of ROS in the cytoplasm is the oxidation of reduced glutathione (GSH), which is regenerated harmlessly to the reduced species by the flavoenzyme glutathione reductase. We show that there is a significant decrease in steady state levels of total glutathione in primary human neurons lacking PINK1, which is likely to greatly impair their antioxidant defences. Evidence for decreased total GSH levels in the brains of patients with idiopathic PD has been widely reported and may occur as a result of decreased GSH synthesis, which is ATP dependent and thus compromised as a result of failing membrane potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Bharath1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Chronic inhibition of glutathione synthesis in dopaminergic neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> using buthionone-S-sulfoximime (BSO) reduced long term neuronal viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Chinta1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Numerous studies in rodents have demonstrated that glutathione deficiency by BSO administration results in mitochondrial swelling with vacuolization and rupture of the cristae and mitochondrial membranes seen by EM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Jain1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. This may explain our observations of altered mitochondrial morphology in PINK1 deficient human neurons (see below). The importance of glutathione in recessive PD has already been explored: depleting parkin null flies of glutathione-S-transferase enzyme exacerbated the neurodegenerative phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Greene1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversely, re-introduction of GST was found to rescue the mitochondrial swelling and neuronal loss in parkin knockouts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Whitworth1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Clearly, there exists a complex interrelationship between glutathione levels, respiratory chain impairment, mitochondrial morphology, and cell viability within neurons which both PINK1 and parkin co-operate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Park1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Altered mitochondrial integrity and proliferation</title><p>Interestingly a disrupted mitochondrial morphology was seen in aged human neurons lacking PINK1. Neuronal mitochondria appeared enlarged, with disrupted cristae and greatly reduced matrix volume. This finding corroborates the striking muscle phenotype in PINK1 and parkin knockout fly models, where myofibrils contain vacuolated, swollen and dysmorphic mitochondria, with disorganised christae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Clark1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Park1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Yang1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Enlarged mitochondria were also seen in surviving dopaminergic neurons, the frequency of which increased with age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Park1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Using genetic complementation experiments PINK1 was subsequently shown to function &#x02018;up-stream&#x02019; of parkin to regulate mitochondrial integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Park1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, it was found that loss-of-function of the mitochondrial fission-promoting component Drp1, caused lethality in PINK1 or parkin knockout flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Poole1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversely, over-expression of Drp1 or mutations in mitochondrial fusion-promoting proteins (Mitofusin2 and OPA1) suppressed the PINK1 and parkin null phenotype. These experiments suggest that these PD genes co-operate to regulate mitochondrial dynamics and that mitochondrial fission (splitting) is stimulated in response to inactivation of the PINK1-parkin pathway.</p><p>We provide interesting evidence for mitochondrial proliferation in PINK1 knockdown neurons, including increases in mean mitochondrial number per neuron, increased Mitotracker uptake, enhanced expression of respiratory chain complex subunits and elevated citrate synthase activity. Despite an increase in mass, no significant change in respiratory chain activity was detected in neurons lacking PINK1, implying that oxidative phosphorylation may be impaired in the increased numbers of mitochondria in these cells. It is established that increased levels of intracellular ROS may mediate changes in mitochondrial abundance and mtDNA copy number which occur during the ageing process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Lee1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. The oxidative stress induced proliferation of mitochondria may initially be beneficial to compensate for dysfunctional mitochondria, and to supply ATP needed for cell survival. However increased numbers of mitochondria will also result in a further excess of ROS, which in the presence of insufficient antioxidant defense mechanisms, will produce more oxidative damage to cells. Increased oxidative damage will render neurons susceptible to death by apoptosis from mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation and cytochrome c release, or by necrosis due to insufficient ATP production. An increase in mitochondrial proliferation has so far not been reported in any other PD model.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>PINK1 deficiency and lysosomes</title><p>We also report here a novel phenotype in the surviving neurons of PINK1 deficient neurons which resembles the pathology observed in lysosomal storage diseases. Large intracellular bodies comprised of multivesicular &#x02018;aggregates&#x02019; were detected in ageing PINK1 kd neurons, which were lysosomal in nature. PINK1 has not previously been implicated in lysosomal dysfunction but endogenous PINK1 expression has been detected in microsomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Petit1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Lysosomes are present within autophagosomes, the multilamellar bodies responsible for proteolytic degradation of macromolecules and thought to be crucial in the clearance of amyloidogenic proteins such as &#x003b1;-synuclein and huntingtin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-MartinezVicente1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Autophagy involves the non-selective degradation of proteins and organelles by lysosomes. However selective autophagy for certain damaged organelles such as mitochondria may occur in response to ROS. Moreover it has been proposed that mitochondria may act as a major source of the ROS signal required to activate autophagy. In our model of PINK1 deficiency we see an increase in autophagolysosomes suggesting an upregulation of autophagy. This may be occurring as a response to remove oxidatively damaged proteins and/or structurally abnormal mitochondria. The concurrent increase in cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS production may act as a signal for this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-ScherzShouval1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. The lysosomal pathology we find in neurons resembles that seen in SHSY5Y cells over-expressing mutant &#x003b2;-synuclein protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002455-Wei1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. &#x003b2;-synuclein is thought to be neuroprotective by interacting with and preventing the formation of &#x003b1;-synuclein inclusions. Pharmacological prevention of autophagy exacerbated cell death and &#x003b1;-synuclein toxicity, suggesting that they may fulfil a protective function in neurons. Enhancing formation of lysosomal clearance mechanisms in PD may therefore be a viable therapeutic strategy.</p><p>In summary, to study the role of PINK1 in PD, we have generated models of PINK1 loss of function in human and mouse neurons. PINK1 is up-regulated during neuronal differentiation and plays a major role in the neuroprotection of mature neurons. Neurons that lack PINK1 function are prone to apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Moreover loss of PINK1 function results in increased levels of oxidative stress and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction directly leads to the increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Further characterisation of the molecular events within mitochondria that lack PINK1 will enable a better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms that cause the phenotype of PINK1 loss-of-function. Persistent mitochondrial dysfunction over time ultimately results in structural changes of the mitochondria which are reminiscent of PINK1 knockout fly models, but to date have not been detected in mammalian models.</p><p>To our knowledge this is the first study to provide a functional role for PINK1 in human neurons, and specifically midbrain derived neurons. Modelling human neurodegenerative disease may only be successfully achieved through recapitulation of the ageing process. Under these circumstances we find an age-specific phenotype for loss of PINK1 function. This provides unique insights into the pathogenesis of sporadic PD in which the phenotype of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis has been well established. Further it suggests a convergence of the molecular pathways of PINK1-associated PD and sporadic PD.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002455.s001"><label>Methods S1</label><caption><p>Supplementary Methods.</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002455.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002455.s002"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002455.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002455.s003"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>A) Graph showing the increase in mRNA of different markers of dopamine neurons following differentiation of NSCs to neurons, using the pre-D method.
