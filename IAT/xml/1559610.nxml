During development, wound repair and disease of the airway epithelium, significant changes in extracellular matrix proteins may directly affect cell migration, differentiation and events mediated by intercellular communication. We hypothesized that alterations in cell matrix, specifically type I collagen and laminin &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;3&#x003b3;2 (LM-332) proteins within the matrix, directly affect intercellular communication in ciliated rabbit tracheal epithelial cells (RTEC).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Functional coupling of RTEC was monitored by microinjection of the negatively charged fluorescent dyes, Lucifer Yellow and Alexa 350, into ciliated RTEC grown on either a LM-332/collagen or collagen matrix. Coupling of physiologically significant molecules was evaluated by the mechanism and extent of propagated intercellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>waves. Expression of connexin (Cx) mRNA and proteins were assayed by reverse transcriptase &#x02013; polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>When compared to RTEC grown on collagen alone, RTEC grown on LM-332/collagen displayed a significant increase in dye transfer. Although mechanical stimulation of RTEC grown on either LM-332/collagen or collagen alone resulted in intercellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>waves, the mechanism of transfer was dependent on matrix: RTEC grown on LM-332/collagen propagated Ca<sup>2+</sup>waves via extracellular purinergic signaling whereas RTEC grown on collagen used gap junctions. Comparison of RTEC grown on collagen or LM-332/collagen matrices revealed a reorganization of Cx26, Cx43 and Cx46 proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Alterations in airway basement membrane proteins such as LM-332 can induce connexin reorganizations and result in altered cellular communication mechanisms that could contribute to airway tissue function.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The normal tracheal airway epithelial layer is composed primarily of pseudostratified ciliated, basal and secretory cells that maintain contact with each other and to a thin basement membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Molecules comprising the airway extracellular matrix (ECM) consist of fibrous (e.g., collagens and elastin) and structural proteins (e.g., fibronectin and laminins) embedded in a hydrated polysaccharide gel containing several glycosaminoglycans (e.g., hyaluronic acid). Laminins are one of many basement membrane ECM molecules that can contribute to cell support and signalling of the airway epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Laminin was initially coined as a term to describe a single ECM protein but has come to encompass a family of heterotrimeric ECM proteins made up of single &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; chains. To date, there are five &#x003b1;, three &#x003b2; and three &#x003b3; chains that are known to form at least 16 laminin trimers and a variety of proteolytic fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Laminins can be produced by lung epithelial cells, including bronchial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A variety of laminins are expressed by lung epithelial cells during development and in adult tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], including LM-332 (formerly Laminin-5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Differential LM-332/integrin interaction has been shown to be involved in airway epithelial wound responses in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It is possible that the remodeling of ECM, including LM-332, by protein cleavage or structural changes can expose and/or eliminate ECM receptor binding sites and promote changes in signalling and cellular activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], however, direct studies on the effects of LM-332 on signalling of conducting airway cells are limited. In addition to ECM rearrangements, breach of the epithelial layer causes a redistribution of intercellular connections that are restored after reformation of the pseudostratified epithelial layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As a part of normal airway defense, epithelia coordinate cellular responses to prevent damage/toxicity. Airway epithelial cells rely on paracrine signalling and gap junctional communication to coordinate defence-related activities. Gap junctions are formed at points of cell-cell contact where each cell contributes a hexameric hemi-channel made up of connexins (Cx) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Connexin proteins can convey unique permeability properties upon the gap junction channels, thus, alterations in connexin expression patterns can directly change the types of cell-cell communication between neighbouring cells, and contribute to local tissue response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Direct studies on the effect of LM-332 on intercellular signalling of conducting airway epithelial cells have not been performed.</p><p>There is a complex pattern of connexin isoform expression in airway epithelial cells with at least eight different connexins expressed at various stages of differentiation and development: Cx26, Cx30.3, Cx31.1, Cx32, Cx37, Cx40, Cx43, and Cx46 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Changes in connexin expression in upper airway epithelial cells have been associated with developing or post-injury airways <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, functional gap junctional intercellular communication has been traditionally monitored by transfer of low molecular weight fluorescent dyes, or by measurement of electrical conductance. Although these techniques are recognized as valuable experimental tools to identify cellular coupling, they do not always reflect transfer of physiologically significant molecules through gap junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. An alternative way to demonstrate gap junctional coupling in cultured airway epithelial cells is through monitoring of coordinated intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) changes in response to mechanical stimulation of a single cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, diffusion of second messenger molecules/ions through gap junctions is not the only way Ca<sup>2+ </sup>waves can be propagated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Following mechanical stimulation, cultured conducting airway epithelial cells can release nucleotides (e.g., ATP or UTP) into extracellular spaces resulting in the activation of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signalling pathways via plasma membrane purinergic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These pathways need not be mutually exclusive: we have shown in primary cultures of rat alveolar epithelial cells that addition of LM-332 to collagen matrices alters the mechanism of coordinating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>changes among neighbouring cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These changes in the coordination of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>waves were accompanied by alterations of connexin isoform expression patterns and affected by cellular differentiation.</p><p>In this study we grew ciliated rabbit tracheal epithelial cells (RTEC) on substrates of LM-332/collagen or collagen alone and monitored functional dye coupling, propagation of intercellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>waves following mechanical stimulation, and alterations in connexin isoform expression. We found that, independent of the matrix substratum, ciliated RTEC were functionally coupled by low molecular weight dyes, although the incidence of dye coupling was increased by LM-332. Ciliated RTEC propagated intercellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>waves in response to mechanical stimulation on both matrices tested. However, cells grown on LM-332/collagen matrix propagated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>waves via an extracellular nucleotide pathway whereas cells grown on collagen alone propagated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>waves via gap junctions. Direct immunocytochemical staining of connexins showed a cellular rearrangement of at least three isoforms, Cx26, Cx43 and Cx46, in response to LM-332/collagen matrix. We suggest that similar changes of extracellular matrix proteins <italic>in vivo </italic>(e.g., during development, wound repair or disease) lead to changes in intercellular signalling that are important in coordinating upper airway epithelial tissue function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Dulbeco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM), Hanks' Balanced Saline Solution, penicillin, streptomycin and amphotericin were from Gibco BRL (Grand Island, NY).

Eppendorf femptotips (Brinkmann, Westbury, NY) were backfilled with 10 mM Tracer dye (LY or Alexa 350) in 200 mM KCl. Dye was microinjected with an Eppendorf Micromanipulator 5171/Transjector 5426 into the cytoplasm of individual ciliated cells. Subsequent dye transfer was monitored on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope (Melville, NY) with 20&#x000d7; objective in phase contrast during injections and in epifluorescence mode for dye coupling analysis. Cells were considered to be functionally coupled if two or more neighbouring cells displayed fluorescence within 5 min of dye injection. Dye coupling plots in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> display percent of experiments with functional coupling (i.e., dye present in more than 2 adjacent cells 5 min following microinjection). Images were captured 5 min post-injection with a CoolSnap camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) onto a Apple Macintosh G4 computer (Cupertino, CA). Stock solutions of gap27 were made initially at 10 mg/ml in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). Stock was diluted to a working concentration of 0.25 mg/ml (190 &#x003bc;M) in HBSS prior to experimentation. To obtain gap junction block, cells were incubated for a minimum of 45 min and up to 120 min.

Fura-2 fluorescence was observed on an Olympus IX70 microscope after alternating excitation at 340 and 380 nm by a 75 W Xenon lamp linked to a Delta Ram V illuminator (Photon Technologies Incorporated (PTI), Monmouth Junction, New Jersey) and a gel optic line. Images of emitted fluorescence above 505 nm were recorded by an ICCD camera (PTI) and simultaneously displayed on a 23" colour monitor. The imaging system was under software control (ImageMaster, PTI) on an IBM clone computer. A change in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>was considered positive if the cell increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>to 200 nM or more, a two to four fold change over resting values. Intercellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>waves were induced by mechanical stimulation of a single ciliated RTEC under piezo-electric control and performed with a glass micropipette (approx. 1 &#x003bc;m tip diameter) positioned near the apical membrane. The pipette was deflected downward for 150 msec to deform the cell membrane. If cell membranes were broken (as measured by loss of fura-2 dye) the experiment was not included in data analysis to prevent analysis of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>wave propagation due to extracellular diffusion of intracellular contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Because the stimulated cell was included in analysis, a Ca<sup>2+ </sup>wave of one cell represented no intercellular communication. In these experiments, the field of view varied, and was limited to between 20 and 40 cells (depending on individual culture). On occasion, wave propagation would encompass more than 20 cells (or exit the field of view). Ca<sup>2+ </sup>wave propagation was given a total score of 20 cells in these cases. Because maximum numbers were imposed on cell counts, the number of cells participating in a Ca<sup>2+ </sup>wave propagation in unblocked conditions are underrepresented. Each experimental paradigm was repeated on a minimum of 3 separate RTEC cultures (except gap26 inhibition studies).</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of connexin mRNA</title><p>To assay potential differences in mRNA expression of RTEC cells used in dye transfer and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>imaging studies, tracheal explants were removed from 7&#x02013;10 day old RTEC cultures and discarded.

Microinjection of LY into ciliated RTEC grown on collagen matrices resulted in successful coupling in only 7.7% of the experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,I</xref>) whereas ciliated RTEC grown on LM-332/collagen matrix displayed a significant increase in LY dye coupling (36.4% of the experiments; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,I</xref>).

On collagen matrices, mechanically induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>waves are restricted by gap junction inhibitors and not affected by nucleotidases ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). To determine if the addition of LM-332 to a collagen matrix altered coordination of second messenger signalling between RTEC cells, we repeated these experiments with RTEC grown on LM-332/collagen matrices. Similar to RTEC grown on collagen, mechanical stimulation of a single ciliated RTEC resulted in an immediate increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>in the stimulated cell that was propagated to surrounding cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). On average, 15.7 &#x000b1; 0.9 cells participated in the mechanically-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>wave (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), a number not significantly different to that observed in cells grown on collagen matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, in contrast to results from RTEC grown on collagen, gap27 did not significantly lower the size of the mechanically-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>wave (11.8 &#x000b1; 1.3 cells; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). A second connexin mimetic peptide, gap26, also had no effect on RTEC Ca<sup>2+ </sup>wave propagation (15.3 &#x000b1; 2.4 cells; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). An additional difference in the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>wave propagation on LM-322/collagen matrices was the occasional initiation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>changes in a participating cell at areas independent of cell-cell contact with an RTEC showing increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>(data not shown), suggesting an extracellularly-mediated signalling event. RTEC cultures grown on LM-332/collagen matrix displayed increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>in response to external application of ATP or UTP (data not shown). In order to determine if purine release was a component of intercellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>wave propagation, mechanical stimulation was repeated in the presence of the nucleotidase, apyrase. The addition of 50 U/ml apyrase significantly reduced the number of cells participating in a mechanically-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>wave in RTEC grown on LM-332/collagen matrices to 3.0 &#x000b1; 0.7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).

Such communication is sensitive to changes in the local environment. In this study we used fluorescent dye transfer and intercellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>wave coupling assays to elucidate alterations in cell-cell signalling of ciliated RTEC grown on either a collagen or a LM-332/collagen matrix. Diffusion of negatively charged low molecular weight dyes between cells was significantly increased in the RTEC grown on LM-332/collagen matrices. In contrast to the significant increases in dye coupling, gap junctional coupling for physiologically-relevant second messenger molecules that help to coordinate intercellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>waves was severely restricted when cells were grown on the LM-332/collagen matrix. Direct analysis of three connexin isoforms &#x02013; Cx26, Cx43 and Cx46 &#x02013; displayed a spatial redistribution coincident with matrix and functional/physiological coupling changes. Taken together, ciliated epithelial cells have distinct intercellular signalling pathways that are responsive to alterations of ECM proteins such as those occurring during development, or in response to wounding or disease.</p><p>Molecules comprising the airway ECM consist of both fibrous (e.g., collagens and elastin) and structural (e.g., fibronectin and laminins) proteins. Laminins are one of many basement membrane extracellular matrix molecules that can contribute to cell support and signalling of the developing airway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The laminin isoform LM-332 can be remodelled in the conducting airway during injury or disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. We have shown that LM-332 has profound effects on cell signalling, development and morphology in primary cultured alveolar epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In the bronchial airway epithelium, LM-332 can contribute to hemidesmosome formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], however, specific effects of LM-332 on cellular physiology of conducting airway epithelial cells remain ill-defined.</p><p>Direct cellular coupling through gap junctions has been traditionally monitored by transfer of low molecular weight fluorescent dyes or by measurement of electrical conductance. Both ciliated and aciliated RTEC have been shown to be electrically coupled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Initial experiments reported herein focussed on the effects of LM-332 on cell-cell coupling between RTEC using fluorescent tracer molecules. In our findings, RTEC grown on collagen were poorly coupled with LY and showed a low but significantly higher coupling with Alexa 350. When RTEC were grown on collagen matrices that included LM-332, significant increases in both LY and Alexa 350 dye transfer were observed. These shifts in dye coupling in response to LM-332 matrices are similar to increased gap junctional permeability of calcein (MW 622 Da; net charge = -3) in keratinocytes grown on LM-332 and collagen matrices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The fact that increase in gap junctional permeability to fluorescent markers after growth on LM-322 occurs across cell types may represent a general response to altered matrices.</p><p>Although dye coupling techniques are recognized as valuable experimental tools to identity functional gap junctions, it has become increasingly clear that gap junctions made of different connexin isoforms can also allow the differential transfer of physiologically relevant molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. To evaluate potential differences in the transfer of physiologically significant molecules, we initiated mechanically-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>waves between RTEC grown on collagen or LM-332/collagen matrices and used specific inhibitors to identify intercellular signalling pathways. A role for gap junctions in mechanically induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>waves in RTEC grown on collagen matrices has been firmly established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In this model, mechanical stimulation induces both the opening of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>channels in the plasma membrane and an increase in 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) concentrations in the stimulated cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] that can further increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>of the stimulated cell through release of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>from intracellular stores. The changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>in adjacent cells is through a gap junctional mediated, IP<sub>3</sub>-dependent Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. A role for paracrine signalling via mechanically-induced ATP or UTP release in primary cultured mouse and human airway cells has been established also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In this model, mechanical stimulation induces release of nucleotide triphosphate that diffuses in the extracellular environment and binds to purinergic receptors on adjacent cells, activating cellular signals that lead to increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.</p><p>In this study we show that when RTEC are grown on a LM-332/collagen matrix, mechanically-stimulated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>waves are conserved. However, inhibitor studies are consistent with a shift in the mechanism of coordination of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>changes to a paracrine/purinergic signalling pathway. Although cultured RTEC cells grown on collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] or LM-332/collagen (data not shown) can respond to extracellular ATP or UTP by increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, it is only the RTEC grown on LM-332/collagen that utilize purinergic signalling in response to mechanical stimulation to coordinate [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>changes. This pronounced switch in communication mechanisms in RTEC cultures in response to LM-332 suggests that differences in mechanically-induced Ca<sup>2+ </sup>communication between rabbit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and mouse or human airway epithelial cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] may not be due to species-specific differences in airway signalling. Given the extensive remodelling of matrix during development, wound response and disease, mechanisms of cellular communication might also be "remodelled" at these crucial times for coordinated airway epithelial tissue function.</p><p>In an attempt to determine specific changes in gap junctions that contributed to the observed alterations in dye and second messenger coupling in RTEC, we examined directly the expression and spatial organization of three connexin isoforms: Cx26, Cx43 and Cx46. All of these isoforms showed mRNA and protein expression in RTEC after growth on either matrix, however, spatial distribution of each of these connexin isoforms was dependent on matrix. On LM-332/collagen matrices Cx26 and Cx43 isoforms were more prominent and Cx46 was less prominent at the cell membrane. These results are not entirely consistent with our previous report that examined connexin isoforms in RTEC grown on collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Using rabbit polyclonal antibodies we detected only a slight pericellular Cx26 staining pattern, an extensive pericellular staining of Cx32, and a lack of Cx43 isoform staining. Our experience with multiple antibodies for connexin isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] allowed for a more direct probe of connexins in RTEC reported herein. The establishment of Cx26 or Cx43 gap junctions at the plasma membrane in RTEC grown on LM-332/collagen matrices may account for increased dye coupling; both Cx26 and Cx43 have been shown to increase LY transfer in transfected HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. In contrast, in experiments directed at testing isoform second messenger transfer through gap junctions, neither Cx26 nor Cx43 was as efficient as Cx32 in allowing transfer of IP<sub>3 </sub>after microinjection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Similar to what is shown here, increases in dye transfer do not necessarily correspond to second messenger transfer via gap junctions. Because gap junctions made of Cx32 allow for transfer of IP<sub>3 </sub>and Cx32-specific antibodies can directly inhibit Ca<sup>2+ </sup>wave propagation in RTEC grown on collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], we suspect changes of this connexin isoform also occur after RTEC are grown on LM-332/collagen matrices. Additionally, we cannot rule out that Cx46 rearrangements shown herein contribute to the observed changes in second messenger coupling. As noted for dye coupling experiments above, there is precedence also for the regulation of connexin expression in response to LM-332 in the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In primary cultured alveolar epithelial cells, LM-332/collagen induced a similar change in mechanism of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>communication to that observed in RTEC cultures presented in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In addition, an upregulation of Cx26 and a downregulation of Cx43 were reported in these cells, as well as significant changes in cell morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In RTEC, no apparent changes in cellular morphology, connexin protein or mRNA expression were noted when LM-332 was included in the collagen matrix. The observed LM-332 induced changes were more similar to those seen in transfected CHO cells, where a distinct translocation of Cx43 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane occurred in the presence of LM-332 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>In summary, the observed connexin re-organization in RTEC grown on collagen or LM-332/collagen matrices does not inhibit fully cellular coupling as demonstrated by the LY and Alexa 350 dye transfer, but shifts the ways in which the cells communicate an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. It should not be discounted that a subtle change in the pattern of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signalling can have a significant change on the cellular physiology of the signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. In addition to the effects of changes in Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signalling on cellular physiology, the direct transfer of several other second messenger/small metabolites could also be altered after connexin re-organization. ATP, ADP, glutathione, glutamate, IP<sub>3</sub>, cAMP, cGMP have all been shown to have altered permeability through gap junctions made up of different connexin isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Thus, the documented changes in LM-332 during wounding, development or pathology could directly affect intercellular communication within the conducting airway epithelium to coordinate a variety of tissue responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>LM-332 alters cellular signalling and gap junction permeability in rabbit tracheal epithelial cells that are associated with a change in connexin isoform organization. Unlike previous reports in rat alveolar epithelial cells, changes in permeability and connexin isoform expression occurred without obvious changes in cell morphology.
