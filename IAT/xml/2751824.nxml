Despite the availability of genome-wide protein-protein interaction studies, determining the connectivity between proteins within a complex remains a major challenge. Here we demonstrate a method that is able to predict the relationship of proteins within a stable protein complex. We employed a combination of computational approaches and a systematic collection of quantitative proteomics data from wild-type and deletion strain purifications to build a quantitative deletion-interaction network map and subsequently convert the resulting data into an interdependency-interaction model of a complex. We applied this approach to a data set generated from components of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Rpd3 histone deacetylase complexes, which consists of two distinct small and large complexes that are held together by a module consisting of Rpd3, Sin3 and Ume1. The resulting representation reveals new protein-protein interactions and new submodule relationships, providing novel information for mapping the functional organization of a complex.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most proteins exert their function together with other proteins by forming distinct complexes which are responsible for specific processes in a cell. Therefore, knowing how proteins associate into stable protein complexes is an essential part of understanding cellular activity. Proteins within each complex can be distinguished as different classes, and therefore are designated as core (always present in each isoform of a complex), module (shared functional subunits of different complexes) or attachment proteins (present only in some purifications) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Gavin1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Pang1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. We recently demonstrated that quantitative proteomics can be used to separate the proteins in those three classes as well as to generate probabilistic protein interaction networks that provide the degree of association between proteins within the respective protein complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Sardiu1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. However, most protein complexes are stable complexes in which the proteins are recovered at equal abundance levels, hence determining the connectivity between proteins in those complexes solely from quantitative proteomics experiments remains a major challenge.</p><p>To address this task, we developed a new approach and applied it to a dataset aimed to characterize the histone deacetylase (HDAC) Rpd3 complexes in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Histone deacetylation is a critical process in transcriptional regulation and Rpd3 is known to be involved in both activation and repression of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Shahbazian1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The yeast HDAC Rpd3 is a homologue of Class I human HDACs and is known to function in two separate complexes termed Rpd3 Small(S) and Rpd3 Large(L) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Carrozza1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Keogh1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The proteins in these complexes were recently defined. The Rpd3S complex, which suppresses spurious intergenic transcription initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Carrozza1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, consists of Eaf3, Rco1, Rpd3, Sin3 and Ume1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Keogh1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Carrozza2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Rpd3, Sin3 and Ume1 have also been shown to belong to the Rpd3L complex along with additional components that are Pho23, Sds3, Sap30, Dep1, Rxt2, Rxt3, and Cti6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Carrozza1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, HDAC inhibitors have emerged as important therapeutic targets for the treatment of cancer and other human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Bolden1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Despite the importance of the Rpd3 complexes, little is known about the interactions of proteins within the complexes. Here we show that quantitative proteomics coupled with hierarchical clustering analysis and probabilistic methods can be used to build a deletion-interaction network and suggest a model of a multiprotein complex. Although a quantitative analysis of the intact complex was not sufficient, we show that a systematic comparison of quantitative deletion strain purifications to its wild-type counterpart allowed us to predict the interactions between the proteins within the Rpd3 complexes. We developed computational methods to calculate these interactions from which we assembled an interdependency-interaction model of these important regulatory complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Data generation for the wild-type histone deacetylase complex</title><p>A total of 11 different Rpd3 subunits were TAP-tagged (hereafter referred to as &#x0201c;baits&#x0201d;), expressed and purified by affinity purification, and analyzed by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Florens1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Florens2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> leading to the identification of 534 non-redundant (NR) proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007310.s006">Table S1</xref>). Relative protein levels were estimated by calculating distributed normalized spectral abundance factors (dNSAF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Liu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The non-specific binders were extracted from the dataset by comparing the dNSAF value in each of the individual purifications with the dNSAF value from the negative control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007310.s001">Figure S1</xref>). If the dNSAF value in the purification was lower than the dNSAF in the negative control, the protein was considered non-specific to that particular purification and the dNSAF was replaced by 0, otherwise the dNSAF value remained unchanged. After removing the proteins shown to be non-specific to all 11 purifications, 429 proteins remained for further analysis. Next, to reduce the dataset to the most information rich group of proteins we applied singular value decomposition (SVD) to the dataset, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Sardiu1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007310.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

We next applied the Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities which determine the preference between a prey and a particular bait relative to all other baits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Sardiu1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Thereby preys that appear at similar relative abundance levels in all baits receive similar moderate probabilities, independent of their higher or smaller relative abundance level. For example, module proteins, which have the highest relative abundance in the dataset, still have similar posterior probabilities as stable core proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007310.s009">Table S4</xref>). On the other hand, preys that vary in abundance between the baits will yield higher or lower probabilities respectively, depending on its relative change to all baits. Consequently, the probabilities emphasize the relationship of two proteins in a complex independent of its stoichiometry. While this analysis is able to determine <italic>bona fide</italic> protein interactions and to separate the subunits of the two complexes, on stable complexes like Rpd3 all probabilities in the wild-type network have similar values, therefore reflecting the stability of the complex as a whole and not the pairwise relationship between the proteins.</p><p>Instead, we took advantage of a proteomics dataset generated from systematic deletion mutants, a similar approach to those used previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Mitchell1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-vandePeppel1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, Mitchell <italic>et al.</italic> confirmed that when used in combination with deletion strains, TAP purification experiments are sufficient to negate interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Mitchell1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, Collins <italic>et al.</italic> developed a method for calculating an interaction score for protein pairs based upon the presence and absence of the corresponding proteins in affinity purification mass spectrometry experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Collins1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies demonstrate that the absence of preys in affinity purification mass spectrometry experiments can be used to generate novel insights into protein complexes.</p><p>In the current study, individual components of the Rpd3 complexes are deleted from the genetic background of a strain in which Rpd3 is TAP tagged, resulting in a series of deletion mutants. The first data set includes information obtained from purifying the complexes using Rpd3-TAP in strains individually deleted for 11 different subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007310.s007">Table S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Carrozza1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Carrozza2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> as well as a rpd3&#x00394; complex purified through Sin3-TAP. In order to measure the effect of the deletion on the complexes, we used the concept of information theory (<italic>I</italic>) based entropy (<italic>H</italic>), as a measure of information within a data set <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Doyle1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Reva1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>information content</italic> is a numerical measure of disorder (i.e. unperturbed system) over order (i.e. less complex system by deleting subunits from the network). We first calculated the entropy (<italic>H<sub>before</sub></italic>) for wild-type Rpd3-TAP and Sin3-TAP purifications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007310-t001">Table 1</xref>). The entropies were then calculated for each of the deletion strain purifications (<italic>H<sub>after</sub></italic>). The effect of the deletion (<italic>I</italic>) was calculated by subtracting the entropy calculated in a single deletion strain (<italic>H<sub>after</sub></italic>) from the entropy calculated in wild-type Rpd3-TAP or Sin3-TAP (<italic>H<sub>before</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007310-t001">Table 1</xref>). Note that only the subunits of the Rpd3 complexes were included in the entropy calculations. In principle, the higher the difference in entropies, the more information was lost after the system was perturbed and the lower the difference, the less information was lost. It is important to note that <italic>H<sub>after</sub></italic> will decrease not only when proteins are no longer detected after gene deletion, but also when proteins' dNSAF values decrease after gene deletion. The greatest <italic>I</italic> value was observed when Sin3 was deleted. The next largest <italic>I</italic> values were obtained when Rpd3, Dep1 and Sds3 were deleted. Therefore, with the exception of Rpd3, these high differences between H<sub>before</sub> and H<sub>after</sub> correlate well with the numbers of subunits lost in the Sin3, Dep1 and Sds3 deletion strains (using Rpd3-TAP). It should be noted that a different TAP-tag strain had to be used for the Rpd3 deletion (i.e. Sin3-TAP instead of the Rpd3-TAP), therefore its <italic>I</italic> value cannot be directly compared to the I values obtained from deletion strain purifications generated with the Rpd3-TAP. These results suggest that deletions of these four proteins have the largest impact on the Rpd3 complexes, indicating their key roles for the complex integrity.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0007310-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007310.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Quantitative evaluation of the effect of the systematic deletion of subunits on the RPD3 complexes using Information Theory based entropy.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0007310-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0007310.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Proteins<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">(a)</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>H<sub>before</sub></italic><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">(b)</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>H<sub>after</sub></italic><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt103">(c)</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>I</italic><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt104">(d)</xref></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rpd3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.437270</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.518056&#x0002a;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.92651&#x0002a;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sin3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.444566&#x0002a;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0043</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.43297</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dep1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.562972</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.874298</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sds3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.573129</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.864141</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sap30</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.656705</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.780565</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rxt2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.144370</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.2929</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pho23</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.169685</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.267585</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cti6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.244256</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.193014</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Eaf3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.328062</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.109208</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rco1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.257346</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.179924</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ash1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.241281</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.195989</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ume6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.177981</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.259289</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><label>(a)</label><p>Components of the RPD3 complexes used as deletion strains;</p></fn><fn id="nt102"><label>(b)</label><p>entropy calculated for the wild-type Rpd3-TAP and Sin3-TAP (&#x0002a;);</p></fn><fn id="nt103"><label>(c)</label><p>entropy of Sin3-TAP in rpd3&#x00394; (&#x0002a;) and Rpd3-TAP (rows 3&#x02013;13) for each of the different 11 subunits deletion strains, as listed in <sup>(a)</sup>;</p></fn><fn id="nt104"><label>(d)</label><p>effect of the deletion (<italic>I</italic>) calculated by subtracting the entropies in the deletion strain purifications from the wild-type Sin3-TAP (&#x0002a;) or Rpd3-TAP (rows 3&#x02013;13) entropies.

We limited the analysis to 40 out of initially 80 proteins determined by SVD, since the remaining proteins were not detected in the wild-type Rpd3-TAP analysis.

To begin, in sin3&#x00394; Rpd3-TAP, all the proteins from the large and small complexes were not detected indicating that Rpd3L and Rpd3S might not assemble, or alternatively that Rpd3 simply cannot join the complex that is still forming in the absence of Sin3.

The presence of the TCP-1 ring complex in Rpd3-TAP purifications but not in purifications using any of the other subunits as baits is in agreement with previous studies in mammals since it has been shown that the interaction of TCP-1 with HDAC3, a homolog to yeast Rpd3, is required for the proper folding of HDAC3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Guenther1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In all other deletions, Rpd3, Sin3, and Ume1 remained and these three proteins were in close proximity on the dendogram confirming that they form a module in both the large and small complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007310-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

Hence when one of the components of such pairs is deleted from the complex, the other subunit(s) should be either not recruited or maintained with a lower probability of interaction.

As mentioned before, Sin3, Rpd3, and Ume1 form a module that is shared between both the large and small complexes, for which Sin3 could act as a scaffold of this module. To begin with the small complex, in rco1&#x00394; and eaf3&#x00394;, Eaf3 is not detected in either, but Rco1 is present in eaf3&#x00394;, with a lower dNSAF value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007310-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and diminished probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007310-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that Rco1 recruits Eaf3 to the small complex, and Eaf3 helps stabilize Rco1 in the small complex. Next, when considering the Rpd3L subunits, in dep1&#x00394; and sds3&#x00394;, most of the components unique to the large complex are not detected, suggesting that Dep1 and Sds3 proteins are key components in the organization of the large complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007310-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007310-g004">4</xref>). Even the module was affected in dep1&#x00394; and sds3&#x00394; by exhibiting lower probabilities than in wild-type and in the other deletion strains, indicating that the interaction of Rpd3-TAP with the module components is higher in the presence of both Dep1 and Sds3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007310-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This observation is supported by the fact that the deletion of both Dep1 and Rpd3 lead to similar phenotypes (i.e. enhanced teleomeric silencing and derepressed INO1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Carrozza2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To further decipher the relationship between these subunits, we examined another proteomic dataset generated from the chromatographic fractionation of the Rpd3L and Rpd3S complexes isolated from wild-type and four deletion strains followed by Rpd3-TAP purification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007310.s008">Table S3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Carrozza1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In this dataset, Dep1 is diminished in ranking in the Sds3 deletion, Sds3 is not detected in the Dep1 deletion, and both proteins have higher ranks (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) in Rxt2 and Pho23 deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007310-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) suggesting that indeed Dep1 depends on Sds3 to interact with Rpd3-TAP and not on Rxt2 or Pho23. Also it can be observed that Ume1 is not detected in sds3&#x00394; of the Rpd3L complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007310-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, Ume1 was affected more in the Dep1 deletion than in the Rxt2 and Pho23 deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007310-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, from the probabilistic deletion network analysis, Ume1 has the lowest probability with Rpd3-TAP in the Sds3 and Dep1 deletions. These results indicate that Sds3 helps stabilize Ume1 in the large complex. In summary, the data suggests that while Sin3 could be the scaffold for the module present in both protein complexes, Dep1 and Sds3 are key proteins in the assembly of the large complex.</p><p>In sap30&#x00394;, only one protein of each subcomplex, Sds3 and Rxt2, are present at a lower probability with Rpd3-TAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007310-g004">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that those proteins might be the connection to the module. The protein Cti6 appears to have a direct or indirect (through other absent proteins) connection with Dep1, Sap30 and Sds3 in the large complex since it was not detected in these deletion strains. This can be also observed from the ranked deletion matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007310-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) where Cti6 was not detected in dep1&#x00394; and was lower in sds3&#x00394; compared to rxt2&#x00394; and pho23&#x00394;. Regarding the second subcomplex, only Rxt2 was present with a lower probability in pho23&#x00394; while Pho23 and Rxt3 were absent from all other subcomplex deletions, indicating that Rxt2 is the protein that brings Rxt3 and Pho23 to the complex. Finally, in cti6&#x00394;, all the components of the large complex were present except for Ash1 and Ume6. Based on this, we believe that Ash1 interacts with Cti6 to recruit the Rpd3L complex to carry out its function as sequence specific repressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Carrozza1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on the deletion network results, we propose a protein interdependency-interaction model of the Rpd3 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007310-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

First, in yeast, we determined whether our results correlated to the effect of the different Rpd3 complex components on gene transcription.

Interestingly, within the two complexes, proteins identified to be in proximity within the same subcomplex or to be members of the small complex based upon our analysis showed similar effects on gene expression (i.e., the expression profiles of the deletion strains cluster together). For instance, Eaf3 and Rco1, components of the Rpd3S complex, tightly cluster based on the correlation of its expression profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Keogh1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, deletions of Dep1 and Sds3 exhibited a similar effect on the global gene expression profiles followed by Sap30, an order of severity that is identical to our deletion network analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Keogh1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The loss of Rxt2 and Pho23 lead to the same effect on the gene profiles, again suggesting that they are in the same module. Lack of Rpd3 and Sin3, two proteins that were identified as being tightly associated in the current study, also led to very similar global gene expression changes. Additional studies support the potential role of Sin3 as the scaffold for both the large and small complexes.

Binning is an established approach for ranking data which has been used in many biological applications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007310-Yildirim1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The entire normalized dataset extends over three orders of magnitude (0.1 to 0.001). The 5 bins were created as follows: bin 1: 0.1 to 0.04; bin 2: 0.039&#x02212;0.01; bin 3: 0.01&#x02212;0.004, and bin 4: 0.0039&#x02212;0.001. All remaining proteins which were not detected in the purifications were included in bin 5. The abundances of the proteins in the matrix were replaced by their corresponding ranking values.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007310.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>General strategy for assembling intensity based local protein interaction network. Eleven unique bait proteins were TAP tagged and their respective protein interactions determined by multidimensional protein identification technology. For each identified non-redundant protein, spectral counts were converted to the distributed normalized spectral abundance factors. After mathematically removing contaminants, the top 80 ranked proteins were retained and subject to hierarchical clustering analysis. To determine the relationship between proteins within the complex, the components of the small and large complexes were systematically deleted from the network through the purification of Rpd3-TAP in a deletion strain as described in the main text. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on the dNSAF values. The result of the cluster indicates a dissociation of the RPD3S and RPD3L complexes through the formation of different subcomplexes. The complexes were also disrupted using fractionation of the RPD3L and RPD3S complex by chromatography as explained in the text. The proteins were sorted and ranked based on the dNSAF values (due to the small size the cluster could not be performed) and the constructed deletion matrix was therefore used to determine the association between the subunits of the complexes. To measure the effect of the deletion, the information based entropy was computed. Finally, a Bayesian analysis of the distributed spectral abundance factor deletion information on a per bait basis resulted in a network that reflects the probability between Rpd3-TAP in a subunit deletion strain (or bait) and prey interaction. The entropy, the deletion cluster, the ranked proteins in the deletion matrix, and the deletion network were used in the assembly of RPD3 complex model. Genetic information was used to validate the relationship between the components of the large and small complexes.</p><p>(0.64 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007310.s001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007310.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Distributions of the left singular vector (lsv).
