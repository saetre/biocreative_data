Here we asked whether &#x003b3;-synuclein expression in the retina can be considered a specific marker of RGCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>&#x003b3;-Synuclein expression was examined with immunohistochemistry in retinal sections from normal and glaucomatous human eyes. Primary cultures of RGCs from Sprague-Dawley rats purified by sequential immunopanning using a monoclonal antibody to Thy1&#x02013;1, cultures of A7 immortalized optic nerve astrocytes from newborn rats, and the immortalized RGC-5 cell line were studied using immunofluorescence and quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>&#x003b3;-Synuclein was highly expressed in RGCs in the human retina and was localized in cytoplasm adjacent to the RGC nuclear marker, Brn-3a. Axons of RGCs were immunopositive for &#x003b3;-synuclein in the nerve fiber layer (NFL), the lamina cribrosa and the retrobulbar optic nerve. In the optic nerve of glaucoma patients, axon swellings were likewise immunopositive, whereas in the retina of patients with retinoblastoma, NFL staining appeared reduced. In primary rat RGCs and in immortalized RGC-5 cultures, &#x003b3;-synuclein was localized predominantly in the perinuclear area and in cell processes. Among rat retinal cells in culture, all Brn-3a positive cells were stained with a &#x003b3;-synuclein antibody; rare &#x003b3;-synuclein-positive cells were not stained by the Brn-3a antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>&#x003b3;-Synuclein is selectively and abundantly expressed in human RGCs in vivo, primary rat RGCs in vitro, and immortalized RGC-5 cells. In pathology, &#x003b3;-synuclein abundance may vary between RGC somas and axons. Coincident Brn-3a and &#x003b3;-synuclein expression suggests that strong &#x003b3;-synuclein expression can be considered a marker of RGCs. Future translational approaches might include using a &#x003b3;-synuclein promoter for the specific delivery of siRNA or therapeutic proteins to RGCs.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>f2-style</meta-name><meta-value>two-column</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>f3-style</meta-name><meta-value>two-column</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>f4-style</meta-name><meta-value>two-thirds</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glaucoma results in a slow, progressive, and selective dysfunction and ultimately apoptotic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the retinal neurons that project to the brain via the optic nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. The precise mechanisms involved in glaucomatous RGC death are not completely understood, but it is widely accepted that pathophysiological events in the retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) and at the optic nerve head, through which RGC axons pass, play a prominent role in the development of this neuropathy. Therefore, a better appreciation of the factors involved in ganglion cell death is central to the development of therapeutic strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. RGCs make up only approximately 45% of RGC layer neurons in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. RGCs can not be reliably distinguished from the other neurons in the GCL, such as displaced amacrine cells, based on cell morphology alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. In addition, RGCs are structurally and functionally heterogeneous, and information regarding the molecular composition and characteristics of RGC subtypes remains incomplete. Further progress in this field is difficult because of the paucity of markers distinguishing RGCs and their subtypes.</p><p>Finding and characterizing markers for RGC death could be an important step in understanding the molecular and cellular processes in glaucoma. Thy1&#x02013;1 and Brn-3 are currently used as markers of RGCs, but Thy1&#x02013;1 is not a good marker of RGC loss in models of retinal damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], and Brn-3c is only expressed in 50% of RGCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>].</p><p>Here we show that &#x003b3;-synuclein is highly and specifically expressed in RGCs in the intact retina, in primary cultures of RGCs, and in an immortalized cell line, RGC-5. We further demonstrate that &#x003b3;-synuclein localization changes in the glaucomatous retina, and may thus be used as a marker for damaged RGCs in glaucoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Retina and optic nerve: tissue section preparation and staining</title><p>Human eyes, from donors aged 53&#x02013;70 years who had no history of eye disease, were obtained from Mid-America Transplant Services (St. Louis, MO).

The presence of a weak, punctate signal in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) in these retinal sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) may be explained by slight cross-reaction of &#x003b3;-synuclein antibody with &#x003b1;-synuclein, which is localized in the IPL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Thus in human retinal sections, &#x003b3;-synuclein colocalizes with Brn-3a-positive RGCs.</p><p>We next considered whether &#x003b3;-synuclein expression changed in retinal disease. In the retinas of patients with retinoblastoma, &#x003b3;-synuclein immunoreactivity was reduced in the nerve fiber layer (NFL), but increased in the cell bodies of RGCs in the GCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). In a second retinoblastoma patient, we observed similar changes in the pattern of staining (data not shown). In three glaucoma patients, swollen axons and axonal fragments were also immunopositive for &#x003b3;-synuclein (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> a representative sample is shown).</p><p>In the optic nerve of a patient with glaucoma, normal RGC axons, swollen axons, and axonal fragments were immunopositive for &#x003b3;-synuclein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus in example eyes with either retinoblastoma or glaucoma, &#x003b3;-synuclein changed its pattern of subcellular expression, but appeared to maintain RGC expression and specificity.</p><p>We next analyzed the expression and localization of &#x003b3;-synuclein in an immortalized RGC cell line, RGC-5. In RGC-5, &#x003b3;-synuclein demonstrated a diffuse localization in the cytoplasm and in cell processes, with a typical punctate staining predominantly in the perinuclear area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). The nuclei of all these cells were stained with a polyclonal antibody against Brn-3a (not shown).</p><fig id="f4" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Retinal ganglion cell-5 (RGC-5) cell-line expression of &#x003b3;-synuclein protein and mRNA were investigated using immunofluorescence and quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR. <bold>A:</bold> Immunofluorescent staining of RGC-5 cultures reveals &#x003b3;-synuclein staining (green) localized in the perinuclear area (arrowheads) and in cell processes (arrows). <bold>B</bold>: no fluorescence was detected in the absence of primary antibody.<bold/>Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). <bold>C</bold>:<bold/>qRT&#x02013;PCR of endogenous synuclein-family transcripts in RGC-5 demonstrates that &#x003b3;-Synuclein had the highest level of expression (Ct=24.44&#x000b1;0.3), followed by &#x003b1;-synuclein (Ct=26.72&#x000b1;0.3) and finally &#x003b2;-synuclein (Ct=36.93&#x000b1;0.4). Ct represents threshold cycles; a lower number reflects higher levels of initial mRNA. A representative duplicate curves are shown for three independent isolation. Ct differences were statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mv-v14-1540-f4"/></fig><p>By quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR, we analyzed &#x003b3;-synuclein mRNA expression in RGC-5 cells. &#x003b3;-Synuclein mRNA expression was more abundant compared to &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-synuclein levels with &#x003b2;-actin as an endogenous control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>) . The threshold cycle (C<sub>T</sub>) was found to be 24.4&#x000b1;0.3 for &#x003b3;-synuclein, 26.7&#x000b1;0.4 for &#x003b1;-synuclein and 36.9&#x000b1;0.4 for &#x003b2;-synuclein. Because &#x003b3;-synuclein is localized in the optic nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>], we also considered the possibility that it is expressed by astrocytes. Although we did not generate primary cultures of optic nerve astrocytes, we were able to obtain the A7 astrocyte cell line. Using ELISA analysis, extracts of RGC-5 cells had significantly higher expression of &#x003b3;-synuclein protein than A7 astrocyte cells (3.3 versus 0.8&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mg of total protein, p&#x0003c;0.01).</p><p>We next used cultures of rat retinal cells and rat RGCs purified by immunopanning to consider whether &#x003b3;-synuclein was specific for RGCs. In primary cultures of purified rat RGCs, &#x003b3;-synuclein was again localized in the cytoplasm, while Brn-3a was expressed in the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). The asymmetry of the staining was mainly from the asymmetry of the cytoplasm. When retinal suspensions were immunostained with antibodies to &#x003b3;-synuclein and Brn-3a, we identified four types of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). Most abundant were cells not stained by either &#x003b3;-synuclein or Brn-3a antibodies, as expected since RGCs make up a small fraction of the neurons in the retina. About 1% of retinal cells were marked by intense staining by both antibodies. Finally, there were retinal cells weakly double-positive, and rare &#x003b3;-synuclein-positive/Brn3a-negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). We did not determine whether this last group represented a Brn-3a-negative subtype of RGC, or a different retinal cell type. We noted at higher magnification that Brn-3a-positive and Brn-3a-negative cells differed in their &#x003b3;-synuclein immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). Brn-3a positive cells were extensively stained throughout the cytoplasm by the &#x003b3;-synuclein antibody, and more strongly in the perinuclear area where we observed bright, punctate reactivity. In contrast, Brn-3a negative cells demonstrated only a weak dot-like staining in a small part of the cell. In all cases, Brn-3a staining overlapped with DAPI nuclear staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, taken together, these data demonstrate that brighter and broader cytoplasmic staining of &#x003b3;-synuclein overlapped well with Brn-3a staining, and that &#x003b3;-synuclein appears to be an RGC-specific marker.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><fig id="f5" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Localization of &#x003b3;-synuclein and Brn-3a were examined in a primary culture of rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). <bold>A</bold>: DAPI (blue) counterstained the nuclei. <bold>B</bold>: Brn-3a (green) was localized to RGC nuclei. <bold>C</bold>: &#x003b3;-synuclein (red) was localized throughout the cytoplasm (arrowheads) and processes.

We have demonstrated similar results with two different &#x003b3;-synuclein antibodies in this study, and a third in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>], and have found similar patterns of RGC specificity in human and rodent retinas. The identification of specific molecular markers for RGCs, which may have more than a dozen subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>], has been difficult. Previously, Thy1&#x02013;1 and Brn-3 family proteins have been described as RGC markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. However, their expression is developmentally regulated and Thy1 expression is not limited to RGCs, but is also weakly expressed by a subset of cells in the inner nuclear layer. In contrast, &#x003b3;-synuclein mRNA and protein are expressed in neurons from the earliest stages of axonal outgrowth and are maintained at a high level throughout life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. &#x003b3;-Synuclein and other such markers may be useful to investigate normal functions of RGCs and the mechanisms underlying their death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>].</p><p>Synucleins are small natively unfolded proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and some forms of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. We and others previously found that three members of the synuclein family were differentially expressed in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-Synucleins are expressed mainly in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer, and in photoreceptor cells, whereas here we find that &#x003b3;-synuclein is expressed by RGCs in the ganglion cell layer and in their axons in the nerve fiber layer (NFL). Here we found that, in the retinas of retinoblastoma patients, &#x003b3;-synuclein expression was reduced in the NFL and increased in the cell bodies of subsets of RGCs. In patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, the bundles of axons and axon swellings remained immunopositive for &#x003b3;-synuclein. The role of this protein in retinal cancers and retinal degenerative diseases remains to be studied, but these data suggest that &#x003b3;-synuclein&#x02019;s role in other disease processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>] may be mirrored in the eye. For example, synucleins bind to vesicles through their N-terminal repeat region and are involved in axonal transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. The accumulation of &#x003b3;-synuclein aggregates we observed in a glaucomatous optic nerve might be a result of the disruption of &#x003b3;-synuclein transport in axons of RGCs, consistent with the decrease in &#x003b3;-synuclein expression and the axonal transport impairment in the DBA/2J mouse model of glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. &#x003b3;-Synuclein could also play a causative role in axonal transport deficits through its ability to modulate neurofilament network integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>] or through its ability to upregulate matrix metalloproteinase 9, an enzyme modulating extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>] that plays a role in retinal ganglion cell death in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>].</p><p>In this study our antibodies did not distinguish expression of differentially modified &#x003b3;-synuclein proteins in RGCs and RGC axons. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that all three synucleins are substrates of G-protein coupled receptor kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>] which phosphorylate Ser-129 in &#x003b1;-synuclein and the corresponding Ser-124 in &#x003b3;-synuclein. Other posttranslational modifications have been described for synucleins, including sumoylation, O-glycosylation, tyrosine nitrosylation among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. It would be interesting to determine whether &#x003b3;-synuclein is differentially modified during development or in disease.</p><p>Taken together, these data demonstrate that &#x003b3;-synuclein is highly expressed in RGCs, and that this high level of expression is largely RGC-specific. The use of a &#x003b3;-synuclein promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>] for specific delivery of siRNA or fluorescent markers to RGCs might be useful for future translational approaches. We propose that this marker may become an important tool for the future investigation of normal physiology of RGCs and the mechanisms underlying their death, and is itself a strong candidate for playing a role in the pathophysiology of RGC death in glaucoma and other degenerative diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Dr. Raghu Krishnamoorthy (University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, TX) for RGC-5 cells, Dr. Herbert.
