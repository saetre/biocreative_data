Miyata et al. (1987) proposed that differences in the rate of neutral evolution on X, Y, and autosome can be employed to measure the extent of this male bias. This commonly applied method assumes replication to be the sole source of between-chromosome variation in substitution rates. We propose a simple test of this assumption: If true, estimates of the male bias should be independent of which two chromosomal classes are compared. Prior evidence from rodents suggested that this might not be true, but conclusions were limited by a lack of rat Y-linked sequence. We therefore sequenced two rat Y-linked bacterial artificial chromosomes and determined evolutionary rate by comparison with mouse. For estimation of rates we consider both introns and synonymous rates. Surprisingly, for both data sets the prediction of congruent estimates of &#x003b1; is strongly rejected. Indeed, some comparisons suggest a female bias with autosomes evolving faster than Y-linked sequence. We conclude that the method of Miyata et al. (1987) has the potential to provide incorrect estimates. Correcting the method requires understanding of the other causes of substitution that might differ between chromosomal classes. One possible cause is recombination-associated substitution bias for which we find some evidence. We note that if, as some suggest, this association is dominantly owing to male recombination, the high estimates of &#x003b1; seen in birds is to be expected as Z chromosomes recombine in males.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>male-mutation bias</kwd><kwd>male-driven evolution</kwd><kwd>mutation</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd><kwd>introns</kwd><kwd>rodents</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haldane's (1947)</xref> discovery that most mutations in humans are male derived, it has been conventional wisdom that this male excess is owing to a difference in germ line replications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crow 1997a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hurst and Ellegren 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ellegren 2007</xref>). In males, spermatogenesis is an ongoing process through a male's life, whereas in females, the number of divisions prior to oocyte production is fixed. Under the presumption of a male bias owing to replication differences, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miyata et al. (1987)</xref> proposed a simple means to assay the extent of male bias. They argued that the rate of evolution of putatively neutral sites on X, Y, and autosome should reflect the amount of time spent in the male germ line by the three chromosomal classes: The Y should evolve the fastest being exclusively in males, followed by autosomes that spend half of the time in males, followed by the X which spends only one-third of its time in males.</p><p>More formally, suppose that the mutation rate in females is &#x003bc; and the ratio of male-to-female germ line replication events (prior to generation of a successful gamete) is &#x003b1;. Miyata et al. (1987) proposed that if germ line replication is the source of all differences in substitution rate of sequence not under selection:<disp-formula id="fd1"><label>(1)</label><inline-graphic xlink:href="gbeevp001fx1_ht.jpg"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="fd2"><label>(2)</label><inline-graphic xlink:href="gbeevp001fx2_ht.jpg"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="fd3"><label>(3)</label><inline-graphic xlink:href="gbeevp001fx3_ht.jpg"/></disp-formula>where <italic>K<sub>N</sub></italic> indicates the evolutionary rate of sequences of class <italic>N</italic> (Y, X, or autosomal). By considering the ratios of any two classes at a time (<italic>K</italic><sub>X</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>Auto</sub>, <italic>K</italic><sub>Y</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>Auto</sub>, or <italic>K</italic><sub>Y</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>X</sub>), it is possible to estimate &#x003b1;.</p><p>Typically, by employing just one of the three possible comparisons, various authors have attempted to assess the extent of male bias in various taxa (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shimmin et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Makova and Li 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sandstedt and Tucker 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goetting-Minesky and Makova 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachtrog 2008</xref>). It is commonly argued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Makova and Li 2002</xref>) that results are broadly consistent with expectations, in that species with relatively long-lived males (hence, a greater discrepancy between the number of male and female replications) have higher values of &#x003b1;. For humans, the estimate is typically around six (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shimmin et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Taylor et al. 2006</xref>), for rodents around two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sandstedt and Tucker 2005</xref>), and for flies around one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer and Aquadro 1997</xref>).</p><p>The case is by no means decided however. First, direct observations of male bias (rather than molecular evolutionary inferred estimates) do not agree with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hurst and Ellegren 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hurst 2006</xref>). In part, this reflects the fact that very high estimates of &#x003b1; appear to be confounded by intramale germ line selection favoring certain mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qin et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al. 2008</xref>). Although these very strong male biases were initially taken as strong support for the replication hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al. 2002</xref>), they no longer arbitrate on the issue. Why some (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yin et al. 1996</xref>) might show a female bias is unresolved.</p><p>The molecular evolutionary comparisons also have a number of unresolved issues. Z&#x02013;W chromosomal comparisons in birds, for example, tend to give estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartosch-H&#x000e4;rlid et al. 2003</xref>) that are rather high given the short life spans of the species (&#x003b1; &#x0223c; 5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hurst and Ellegren 1998</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, one study claims there is a bias of the same magnitude claimed for rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachtrog 2008</xref>). In mammals there is also now strong evidence for within-autosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matassi et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lercher et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malcom et al. 2003</xref>) and between-autosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lercher et al. 2001</xref>) variation in rates. To account for this under the replication model, one must suppose different genomic regions are subject to different rates of replication-associated mutations, but why this might be is mechanistically unclear.</p><p>Although it has been claimed that differences in the rate of evolution of different chromosomal classes can be explained by the male mutation bias alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axelsson et al. 2004</xref>), others have argued that mutations arising in nonreplicating DNA also contribute substantially to rates of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huttley et al. 2000</xref>). Further, substitution rates are known to be effected by transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Green et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Majewski 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lercher et al. 2004</xref>), location within an inversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Navarro and Barton 2003</xref>), GC content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith and Hurst 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bielawski et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hurst and Williams 2000</xref>), and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perry and Ashworth 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rattray et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lercher and Hurst 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hellmann et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bussell et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dreszer et al. 2007</xref>). However, the quantitative effect of these processes, if any, on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miyata et al.'s (1987)</xref> model has not yet been explored.</p><p>We propose that there is a simple test of whether replication alone is the source of the differences in evolutionary rate between X, Y, and autosome. If the logic is correct, then <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd1">equations 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="fd3">3</xref> must hold. If so, all of the possible pairwise comparisons (X&#x02013;A, Y&#x02013;A, and Y&#x02013;X) should provide the same estimate for &#x003b1;. If they do not, then the &#x0201c;replication-alone&#x0201d; method fails and application of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miyata et al.'s (1987)</xref> commonly employed method must be questioned.</p><p>In rodents, some prior evidence suggested that the value of &#x003b1; is dependent on which chromosomal classes were employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith and Hurst 1999a</xref>). However, sample sizes were too limited to make definitive statements and substitution rates at exonic silent sites were used. As we now know (Chamary et al. 2006) that selection can act on synonymous mutations in mammals (although estimates of <italic>K</italic><sub>S</sub> are very similar to <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> &#x02013; the intronic rate), it is worthwhile repeating this analysis using a larger sample of well-aligned intronic sequence as well as employing synonymous rates. To this end, we sequenced two rat Y-linked bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). Although this provides copious amounts of sequence, outside of the coding regions it proved impossible to unambiguously define orthology. We therefore confined analysis of BAC-derived sequence to well-aligned introns. In addition, we sequenced some further Y-linked cDNAs to expand the inventory for analysis of synonymous substitution rates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>BAC Isolation, Sequencing, and Annotation</title><p>By reference to known rat Y-linked genes, we identified, by screening the RZPD's rat BAC pool library RPCIB657, two Y chromosome BACs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp001/DC1">supplementary table 1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp001/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online).

Mouse exonic and intronic sequences were obtained from the February 2006 and July 2007 builds, respectively, whereas rat exonic and intronic sequences were both obtained from the November 2004 build. Exonic sequences were concatenated by gene and filtered so that only those containing complete codons, correct start and termination codons, no premature stops, or ambiguous bases were retained.

In all, 1,915 introns were eliminated due to poor alignment. Rates of evolution of autosomal introns derived from the LAGAN alignment (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> = 0.1666) were in agreement with those previously obtained both by eye (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> = 0.1533) and by a maximum likelihood protocol (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> = 0.1791) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chamary and Hurst 2004</xref>).</p><p>We additionally analyzed synonymous rates of evolution.

To attempt to filter out these introns, we asked whether, within an intron, substitutions/conserved residues were clustered or randomly scattered through the intron. Our premise is that if a hidden exon or a protein-binding domain is present, such regions should be relatively free of substitution, so we will see longer runs of conserved residues than expected in the absence of such domains.</p><p>The filter consisted of a linear model derived from a simulation in which varying percentages of diverged bases ranging from 10% to 90% were randomly distributed along sequences varying in length from 100 to 100,000 bases. For each sequence length and percentage divergence modeled, the number of switches in state between conserved and diverged bases as one moves down the sequence was counted. From multiple permutations ranging from 10,000 permutations for shorter sequences to 100 permutations for longer sequences due to computational limitations, the lowest one-sided 95 percentile was identified. From this, a linear model was developed from which the lowest number of switches in state per base (<italic>z</italic>) expected for a given number of aligned nucleotides (<italic>l</italic>) and a given percentage of diverged bases (<italic>d</italic>) could be predicted: <italic>z</italic> = &#x02212;0.005757 + 0.00000026 (<italic>l</italic>) + 0.0192327 (<italic>d</italic>) &#x02212; 0.000192 (<italic>d</italic><sup>2</sup>) + 0.0000000136 ((<italic>l</italic> &#x02212; 20350) (<italic>d</italic> &#x02212; 50)) &#x02212; 0.00000000014 ((<italic>l</italic> &#x02212; 20350) (<italic>d</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x02212; 3166.67)). We do not suppose this method to be perfect (it will likely miss small hidden exons), but it should eliminate those introns most profoundly affected by hidden exons.</p><p>After elimination of the 30 bp of sequence flanking exon&#x02013;intron boundaries (known to be under selective constraint; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chamary and Hurst 2004</xref>), we classified sites as conserved or diverged and then calculated the number of switches in state as one moves down the intron.

In all, 21,041 (55%) introns showed such evidence of selective constraints and were excluded from the analysis.

For analysis of the effect of GC, expression rate, and a past history of inversions, introns from the same gene were concatenated (comprising 4,051 autosomal, 107 X-linked, and 3 Y-linked genes). Aligned coding sequences for each gene were assigned to the three chromosomal classes. This second data set was comprised of 4,474 autosomal genes (5.8 Mb), 145 X-linked genes (180 Kb), and 7 Y-linked genes (13,662 bp).

Why might this be? Although the replication model has dominated thinking on between-chromosome substitution rates, there are now regular reports that both neutral single nucleotide polymorphism diversity and neutral substitution rates increase across autosomes in correspondence with the local recombination rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lercher and Hurst 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hellmann et al. 2003</xref>). This may be owing to recombination-induced mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perry and Ashworth 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rattray et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lercher and Hurst 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hellmann et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bussell et al. 2006</xref>) and/or recombination-associated biased gene conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dreszer et al. 2007</xref>). A correlation between substitution rate and recombination rate is not, however, universally reported. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nachman (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spencer et al. (2006)</xref> failed to observe a correlation in humans.</p><p>That there might be disagreement between studies is unsurprising given that recombination rate data are based on relatively recent crossover events, whereas substitution rates reflect a much longer history. However, note that recombination is seen at high rates on the pseudoautosomal region of X and Y, a region known to be associated with high substitution rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perry and Ashworth 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bussell et al. 2006</xref>) but not included in our study.</p><p>First then we ask whether we see any evidence in rodents that, across autosomes, regions with high recombination rates have high substitution rates. This issue is, however, enormously problematic. What one needs to know for any sequence is not the current recombination rate alone, but rather the recombination rate to which the sequence has been exposed in both lineages over the course of the divergence of the two species. This is impossible to know. Perhaps, then, it is optimal to consider the mean recombination rate of a sequence in mouse and in rat? This too is problematic. The mouse lineage has undergone very many rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramsdell et al. 2008</xref>), so the recombinational environment of a gene in today's mouse genome need not correlate in any manner to its recombinational environment in mouse and rat since divergence of the two. At the extreme, if a rearrangement is very modern, today's recombinational environment may well be a very poor guide to that to which the gene has been exposed over its evolutionary history.</p><p>Given that the rat genome is vastly more stable than the mouse, one can, however, define a test that is defendable. If we assume that each chromosomal region has a characteristic recombination rate (on the megabase scale this is defendable), then we may presume that the recombination rate seen in rat should correlate with the recombination rate of a sequence in the rat lineage and for some early part of the mouse lineage of the gene. We therefore ask whether rat recombination rates predict substitution rates. We find that they do, with a significant relationship between substitution rate and recombination rate in rat on the autosomes (weighted linear regression <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.0346, <italic>P</italic> = 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">fig. 3</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>F<sc>IG</sc>. 3.&#x02014;</label><caption><p>The relationship between substitution rate and recombination rate in rat.

Such a model could predict that if germ line replication&#x02013;associated bias, &#x003b1;, were weak (as probably seen in rodents but not necessarily in humans; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Makova and Li 2002</xref>), the fact that recombination in males is limited to autosomes should increase the autosomal substitution rate, possibly exceeding the Y-linked rate.</p><p>As a first approximation, let us then consider a simple extension to Miyata et al.'s (1987) model, whereby a recombination-associated substitution/mutation effect boosts the rate of evolution by an increment of <italic>r</italic>.

This suggests that replication in males provides a boost of 0.7263 and recombination supplies a boost of about the same magnitude, probably a little weaker.</p><p>This may not be the whole story. Recent evidence suggests the effect of recombination on neutral substitution rates and clusters of biased substitutions correlates strongly with male recombination rates but not with rates seen in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Webster et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dreszer et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duret and Arndt 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tyekucheva et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berglund et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galtier et al. 2009</xref>). Allowance for this indicates a much lower replication-associated bias.

If recombination in males alone is associated with a substitution bias, then these results suggest that in rodents, at least, the effect of replication may have been much overestimated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We find strong evidence that replication alone cannot explain differences in the rates of evolution of X, Y, and autosomes. This is important to know as it suggests that the method of Miyata et al. (1987), although commonly employed, is fundamentally incorrect. Whether the method is grossly misleading, however, will depend on many parameters.</p><p>First, if the true replication effect is very large compared with the recombination effect (or whatever causes the disparity), then Miyata et al.'s (1987) method is unlikely to greatly mislead. This may well be the case in humans where a priori, if replication is associated with mutation, a male bias should be very pronounced.</p><p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Makova and Li (2002)</xref> estimate <italic>K</italic><sub>Y</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>Auto</sub> to be 1.68 and estimate &#x003b1; = 5.25. Assuming <italic>r</italic><sub>m</sub> = 0.35&#x003bc;, we can correct this estimate by considering that <italic>K</italic><sub>Y</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>Auto</sub> = 2&#x003b1;/(1.35 + &#x003b1;) and so estimate &#x003b1; = 7.08. This corrected estimate and the original are both around the proposed &#x003b1; = 6 derived from germ line anatomy. Whether it is legitimate to suppose that any recombination effect is the same in rodent and human is unclear. The reason for this approximate insensitivity is that, if &#x003b1;, the replication-associated bias, is high, the relative impact of male recombination on between-chromosome estimates is reduced. Conversely, the evolutionary rates of rodents may be especially instructive, as any recombination and replication effects are likely to be more balanced.</p><p>The models above also suggest that whether any recombination effect is associated with males alone may be very important. A priori given a lack of understanding of any substitution&#x02013;recombination correlation on a mechanistic basis, it seems impossible to arbitrate at the present. The observation that gene conversion predominantly occurs in the mitotically dividing spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">B&#x000f6;hme and H&#x000f6;gstrand 1997</xref>) might be important, but the regular finding of increased pseudoautosomal evolutionary rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perry and Ashworth 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Filatov and Gerrard 2003</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yi et al. 2004</xref>) is more obviously consistent with meiotic events.</p><p>We find some weak evidence consistent with a male bias to recombination-associated substitution bias, but this is not definitive. If male recombination is the sole or dominant source of within-autosome heterogeneity in substitution rates, then we might expect to see no or lesser regionality of substitution rates on the X chromosome and the Y chromosome, these never being subject to recombination in males (nor to translocations from autosomes). Data remain limited on the Y, as it has too few genes on it. Nonetheless, ANOVA reports no gene effect on substitution rates for Y-linked sequences (<italic>P</italic> = 0.5628). For X and autosome, we can compare the rate of evolution of a gene with its immediate chromosomal neighbors (one 5&#x02032; and one 3&#x02032;). On the X chromosome, there is no correlation (Spearman's rank correlation &#x003c1;<sup>2</sup> = 0.007, <italic>P</italic> = 0.40), whereas on autosomes, we find a correlation an order of magnitude higher (Spearman's rank correlation &#x003c1;<sup>2</sup> = 0.054, <italic>P</italic> = 2.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">fig. 4</xref>). As expected, the slope of the regression line of focal versus flanking for autosomes is steeper than that on the X (slope for autosomes = 0.167 &#x000b1; 0.01 [SEM], for X = 0.0472 &#x000b1; 0.07 [SEM], <italic>t</italic> = 1.69, <italic>df</italic> = 107, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). These data are consistent with a dominant effect of recombination in the male germ line. However, this test suffers two problems. First, the gene density on the X is lower than on autosomes, so immediate neighbors on the X from our ortholog sample are less likely to be in the same recombination block. Second, recombination in females is more scattered along chromosomes than in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paigen et al. 2008</xref>), hence any female effect on the X need not be visible in a comparison between neighbours, while nonetheless a potent force in determining the overall rate of evolution of the X.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>F<sc>IG</sc>. 4.&#x02014;</label><caption><p>No evidence for local similarity of substitution rates on the X chromosome.

Data for autosomal genes are in blue and for X chromosome in red. Also shown are bin averages (&#x000b1;1 SEM), where for each chromosomal class bins contain equal numbers of genes, 100 for X chromosome, and 401 for autosomal. Regression lines are for all data, not bin means.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gbeevp001f04_3c"/></fig><p>Further, if only male recombination is mutagenic, then we would not expect to see a relationship between recombination rate and substitution rate for X-linked genes, these not recombining in males. Indeed, although we find that recombination rate in rat can predict the substitution rate on the autosomes, no such effect is observed on the X chromosome (weighted linear regression for autosomes <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.0346, <italic>P</italic> = 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>; for X, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.004, <italic>P</italic> = 0.8122). However, given the weakness of the effect, it is unsurprising that we do not find a steeper slope on the autosomes than on the X (slope for autosomes = 0.0086 &#x000b1; 0.0021 [SEM], for X = &#x02212;0.0026 &#x000b1; 0.0111 [SEM], <italic>t</italic> = 1.0, <italic>df</italic> = 13.949, <italic>P</italic> = 0.167). We are therefore unable to completely exclude a female recombination effect.</p><p>We further wish to make two observations. Any theory to explain why X, Y, and autosomes evolve at different rates should also attempt to account for why different autosomes evolve at different rates. We suggest that a recombination model might be able to explain one curious observation. We find a striking correlation (&#x003c1; = 0.7488, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.00009) between the probability that two randomly chosen genes on a given mouse chromosome have their ortholog on the same chromosome in rat and the evolutionary rate of the mouse chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">fig. 5</xref>). We suggest that two factors might link this observation to recombination. Let us assume that regions associated with high recombination rates have high substitution rates. Such high-recombination, fast-evolving domains may be expected to be associated with genomic rearrangements, first because, at least in some species, rearrangements tend to occur in regions of high recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhunov et al. 2003</xref>), and second because when chromosomal fusions and translocations occur, they tend to move telomeres rendering them nontelomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dreszer et al. 2007</xref>). If high rates of telomeric recombination are associated with increased substitution rates, fusions of such regions should have elevated rates of evolution, as recently reported at the fusion point of human chromosome 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dreszer et al. 2007</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>F<sc>IG</sc>. 5.&#x02014;</label><caption><p>The relationship between between-chromosome rearrangement rates and rates of sequence evolution of genes on mouse autosomes. For each mouse chromosome, we determined a rearrangement probability by repeatedly taking random genes on a given mouse chromosome for which 1:1 orthologs are known in rat and asking whether the two genes reside on the same chromosome in rat. The index is the proportion of times this is not true. As nearly all chromosomal rearrangements occur down the mouse lineage, we employ mouse as the focal chromosome set. The chromosomal rate is derived from intron concatenation. Spearman's &#x003c1; = 0.7488, <italic>P</italic> = 8.098 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gbeevp001f05_lw"/></fig><p>Second, if recombination in females has little or no effect on substitution rates but male recombination is important, then, in birds, in which Z chromosomes can recombine in males, we expect Z&#x02013;W comparisons to produce estimates of &#x003b1; that are biased upward. It has indeed been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hurst and Ellegren 1998</xref>) that given their life span, the Z-W derived estimates of &#x003b1; are sometimes unusually high, although this in part may be related to extrapair paternity influencing the number of replication events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartosch-H&#x000e4;rlid et al. 2003</xref>). Comparably, if male recombination is the cause of disparity between estimators of &#x003b1;, assuming nothing else peculiar about the X chromosome, X&#x02013;Y comparisons are probably best to estimate &#x003b1;, as male recombination should not influence these predictions. It is probably for this reason that X<strike>&#x02013;</strike>Y comparisons are those that in the past have more accurately reflected presumed differences in germ line replication ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sandstedt and Tucker 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goetting-Minesky and Makova 2006</xref>), whereas X&#x02013;autosome comparisons have suggested remarkably high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith and Hurst 1999a</xref>), sometimes impossible (&#x003b1; &#x0003e; infinity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McVean and Hurst 1997</xref>) estimates for &#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary Material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp001/DC1">Supplementary tables 1</ext-link>&#x02013;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/evp001/DC1">18</ext-link>, information 1&#x02013;5, and references are available at <italic>Genome Biology and Evolution</italic> online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/">http://www.gbe.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="evp001_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="evp001_Pinketal_suppl_revised_v2.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the members of the Sanger Institute sequencing teams for their assistance with sequencing of the rat BAC clones, in particular, Sian Hammond, Carl Henderson, and Owen McCann.
