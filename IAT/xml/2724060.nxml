Here, we investigated the contribution of the structural protein caveolin-1 (Cav1) to the overall lipid composition and domain abundance in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild-type (WT) or Cav1-deficient (Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) animals. Our findings show that Cav1 expression had no effect on free (membrane-associated) cholesterol levels. However, Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>-deficient cells did have a higher proportion of sphingomyelin, decreased abundance of unsaturated phospholipids, and a trend toward shorter fatty acid chains in phosphatidylcholine. We isolated detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs), nondetergent raft domains (NDR), and cholesterol oxidase (CO)-sensitive domains and assessed the abundance of ordered domains in intact cells using the fluorescent dye Laurdan. Despite differences in phospholipid composition, we found that cholesterol levels in DRMs, NDR, and CO-sensitive domains were similar in both cell types. The data suggest that Cav1 is not required to target cholesterol to lipid rafts and that CO does not specifically oxidize caveolar cholesterol. In contrast, the abundance of ordered domains in adherent cells is reduced in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> compared with WT MEFs, suggesting that cell architecture is critical in maintaining Cav1-induced lipid rafts.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lipid rafts</kwd><kwd>caveolae</kwd><kwd>lipid profile</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The organization of cellular membranes is largely described by the classic fluid mosaic model, which assumes that lipids in the bilayer are fluid, with uninterrupted lateral diffusion. However, this model can explain neither lateral segregation at cell activation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) nor the variety of lipid species in cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Over the past 10 years, the lipid raft hypothesis has changed the way cell biologists view lipids and membrane organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). It defines lipid rafts as cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich domains within the cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) that localize and concentrate raft-associated proteins to specific sites, in particular proteins with glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors or pairs of closely spaced acyl chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Due to the tight packing of lipids, particularly saturated fatty acids, in lipid raft domains, they are more ordered than their more fluid surrounding membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Hence, these membrane domains constitute biophysically and biochemically discrete platforms. The existence of specialized domains in cell membranes has implications for fundamental cell function, such as signal transduction and protein sorting processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), because domains that dynamically regulate the association and disassociation of proteins control protein targeting and signaling efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>The lipid raft hypothesis created excitement because it described lipid-based lateral segregation and elevated lipids from simple building blocks to regulatory elements. However, it remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Lipid rafts can be isolated based on their resistance to certain nonionic detergents as detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) or on their relatively low density as the light membrane subfraction obtained after mechanical disruption of cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). A concern about the use of detergents for raft isolation is based on the observation that detergents can scramble lipids and thus artificially induce membrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Detergent-free isolation procedures, however, yield similar domains as DRMs and, additionally, resemble ordered rafts domains in intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), suggesting a general similarity between preexisting domains and isolated DRMs or nondetergent raft domains (NDRs). Nevertheless, it is the current consensus that DRMs do not reflect lipid rafts in cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) but are a useful tool to generally describe biochemical differences between cell types and identifying protein modifications that are raft-favoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).</p><p>Caveolae are regarded as a subtype of lipid rafts that are characterized by &#x0223c;50&#x02013;80 nm uncoated invaginations of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Caveolae were first discovered morphologically before the molecular identity was described by the discovery of caveolins in 1992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). It is now known that caveolin-1 (Cav1) expression in mammalian cells drives the formation of caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). It was also shown that caveolins are associated with DRMs in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). In fact, in all cell types tested, Cav1 is predominantly associated with DRMs or light membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Caveolae associate with specific lipids, and Cav1 itself binds cholesterol with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). With approximately 144 molecules of caveolin per caveola (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) and 20,000 molecules of cholesterol in addition to glycolsphingolipids (such as GM1) and sphingomyelin (SM), the density of lipids in caveolae was found to be higher in immuno-isolated caveolae than the surrounding plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Cells that do not exhibit morphologically identifiable caveolae nevertheless yield DRMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) and NDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). It has previously been suggested that cholesterol oxidase (CO) preferentially oxidizes cholesterol in caveolae, making it the simplest approach to discriminate between caveolae cholesterol and noncaveolar raft cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>).</p><p>Cav1 expression is essential for the formation of caveolae, and cells from Cav1-deficient (Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice show a complete lack of morphologically identifiable caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). The effects of Cav1 ablation on plasma membrane lipid raft composition and distribution, however, is not well understood. Previous studies indicated that the distribution of proteins normally associated with lipid rafts is unaffected by loss of Cav1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), suggesting either that preexisting lipid raft domains are not dependent on Cav1 expression or that caveolae represent only a small proportion of total raft domains. Therefore, we compared lipid raft domains in wild-type (WT) and Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>MEFs were prepared from 13.5 post-coitum embryos obtained by homozygous crossings of Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice or WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).

While Cav2 deficiency alone is insufficient to reduce caveolae on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), Cav2 expression can rescue caveolae formation in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Hence, the decreased expression of Cav2 in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEF is fortuitous and necessary to assess caveolin and caveolae-dependent membrane domains.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Caveolin expression in WT and Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs.

As a consequence, many of the low-abundance SM molecules are obscured by isotopes of PC. In order to obtain a more complete analysis of SM, hydrolysis of glycerophospholipid fatty acyl esters was promoted by the addition of sodium hydroxide (0.7 M final concentration) to the homogenate prior to lipid extraction. Under these conditions, due to their amide linkage, SMs maintain their molecular integrity, resulting in a significantly improved detection (see supplementary Fig. IB). A similar, yet more complex, approach for the analysis of low-abundance sphingolipids has been described recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>).</p><p>Because relative levels of SM were significantly higher in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs, we analyzed SM species in more detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>).

We found no differences in either total membrane cholesterol content (data not shown) or in its distribution between raft and nonraft domains (66.6 &#x000b1; 0.6% in rafts in WT MEFs; 69.7 &#x000b1; 2.5% in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). This indicates that Cav1 expression does not significantly control cholesterol distribution in DRMs, suggesting that Cav1 may associate with lipid raft domains in the plasma membrane rather than directly generate them.</p><p>The cell-impermeable enzyme, CO, converts cholesterol to cholestenone and is widely used to probe changes in plasma membrane cholesterol distribution. There are several technical variations in the method that can lead to quantitative differences in the estimated size of the cholesterol-oxidase sensitive pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Previously, it was reported that a particular protocol, which avoids fixation of the cells, preferentially oxidizes cholesterol present in caveolae, causing Cav1 to relocate in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). This property has been used to study the role of caveolae in signal transduction processes and cholesterol transport, suggesting that Cav1 transports newly synthesized cholesterol to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). We used the same conditions to measure the CO-sensitive cholesterol pools in WT and Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>). Consistent with previous studies, &#x0223c;10% of cellular cholesterol was converted to cholestenone in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Furthermore, we observed no significant difference in CO-sensitive cholesterol between WT and Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Because Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs lack caveolae, this result suggests that CO accessible cholesterol is not restricted to, or even predominantly in, caveolae. To further explore the location of CO-sensitive cholesterol, DRMs were isolated from CO-treated WT and Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells.

This has led to the development of other techniques to separate rafts that avoid the use of detergents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>).

Although NDR cholesterol is consistently lower in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs, the difference between WT and Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> NDR cholesterol was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Similarly, when isolated plasma membranes instead of whole cell homogenates were sonicated, we found no significant difference between WT and Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs with respect to the cholesterol levels in the raft fractions (data not shown). In summary, we found no difference in cholesterol distribution between WT and Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEF DRMs, CO-sensitive domains, or NDR, suggesting that Cav1 does not control lipid distribution between raft and nonraft domains.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of Cav1 expression on membrane structure in adherent cells</title><p>Biochemical assay may not reflect preexisting rafts in intact, adherent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Hence, we assessed the effect of Cav1 expression on the physical state of cell membranes in intact cells labeled with the fluorescent probe Laurdan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). The probe is sensitive to membrane structure, with its peak emission shifting from &#x0223c;500 nm in fluid to &#x0223c;430 nm in ordered membrane. A normalized ratio of the two emission regions, defined as generalized polarization (GP), reflects membrane order with +1 indicating the most ordered and &#x02212;1 the most fluid membranes. Recently, we showed that Cav1 is associated with ordered domains in WT MEFs, yielding a mean GP value of 0.382 &#x000b1; 0.070 (from n = 27 images), while the nonraft marker, transferrin receptor, colocalizes with fluid domains (GP 0.165 &#x000b1; 0.066, n = 13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). The subunit B of cholera toxin, which specifically binds to the ganglioside GM1 and is frequently used as a raft marker, also colocalized to ordered domains in both WT and Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (GP 0.434 &#x000b1; 0.069, n = 11 WT MEFs; 0.442 &#x000b1; 0.099, n = 10 Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs). The similarity in subunit B of cholera toxin binding and association with domains of high order (GP) in both cell types suggests that noncaveolar raft domains may be independent of Cav1 expression.</p><p>For a more general analysis of the effects of Cav1 on membrane structure, we compared the global GP distribution in MEFs, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><bold>Fig. 6A</bold></xref> for WT MEFs. Two populations, fluid (P<sub>f</sub>, dark gray) and ordered (P<sub>o</sub>, light gray), were identified. Each population has a characteristic mean GP value and abundance (or coverage) that equate to the area under the curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). The mean GP values of fluid membranes, P<sub>f</sub>, were similar in WT and Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>), but in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells covered a greater proportion of the membrane surface (91.9 &#x000b1; 3.7% in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs vs. 71.4 &#x000b1; 5.7% in WT MEFs; <italic>y</italic> axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). In contrast, the ordered membranes were relatively more fluid and less abundant in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs than WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>), suggesting that Cav1 does contribute to the lipid order of raft-like domains in adherent cells. To demonstrate that the differences in membrane structure were directly related to Cav1 expression and function, Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs were transfected with either WT Cav1 or with Y14F Cav1. Expressing WT Cav1 in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs restored both order and relative surface coverage of ordered domains to WT levels. Mutating the only tyrosine phosphorylation site in Cav1 (Y14F Cav1) has no effect on caveolae formation but inhibits raft internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>) and decreases membrane order at focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Expression of Y14F Cav1 only partially rescued ordered domains when expressed in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>). WT Cav1 and Y14F Cav1 correspondingly decreased the proportion of fluid domains in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). Overall, the data support a contribution of Cav1 to the generation of ordered domains in adherent, intact cells.

Since Cav1 associates with specific membrane lipids and thus may be involved in lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), we started our study with a complete PL analysis of MEFs from WT or Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals. We found a higher proportion of SM and increased abundance of smaller, more saturated PLs in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells but no difference in membrane-associated cholesterol. Our data conclude that Cav1 expression is not required for the targeting of cholesterol to DRMs, NDRs, or CO-sensitive domains, despite the contribution of Cav1 to ordered domains in adherent cells. In summary, our data suggest that Cav1 is involved in the organization of cell architecture-dependent lipid rafts.</p><p>Genetic deletion of Cav1 increases the proportion of esterified cholesterol without altering total cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>) and increases relative SM levels and the incorporation of saturated fatty acids into PLs. Ether PLs levels and the rate of PC and SM synthesis are not altered by caveolin deficiency. The mechanisms that regulate PL levels or the fatty acid incorporation into PLs are poorly understood; thus, it is unclear precisely how Cav1 achieves such modulation in cellular lipid homeostasis. Similar effects were not observed when Cav1 expression was induced in a cell type that otherwise did not form caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), suggesting that the role of Cav1 in lipid homeostasis in vivo is more complex than the formation of caveolae. Recently, it was reported that Cav<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice on a normal chow diet have increased saturated and monounsaturated cholesterol esters in their circulating lipoproteins compared with their WT controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Taken together, it appears that Cav1 plays a role in maintaining the balance of saturated to unsaturated lipids, but further studies are required to understand the mechanism of this regulation.</p><p>The isolation and biochemical characterization of lipid rafts by detergent extraction (as DRMs) or sonication (as light membranes) have attracted criticism, as they may not reflect rafts in intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). We have recently shown that isolation protocols can be adjusted so that DRMs and light membranes can represent similar domains, which, in macrophages, have similar structural properties to those found in intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Surprisingly, we found no difference in the cholesterol content of isolated lipid rafts from Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT MEFs, suggesting that caveolar cholesterol contributes a negligible or minor amount of cholesterol to DRMs and light membranes, respectively, although Cav1 itself fractionated almost completely into DRMs. Taken alone, the biochemical data suggest that both cell types have the same amount of total raft lipids; when Cav1 is present, it associates with raft fractions and generates caveolae, but Cav1 is not required for the formation of DRMs, NDRs, or CO-sensitive domains. In contrast, the data obtained by Laurdan microscopy in intact, adhered cells suggest otherwise, with Cav1 expression resulting in more ordered and more abundant raft domains. It should be kept in mind, however, that the biochemical and microscopy analysis assess rafts in two different experimental systems. The microscopy images record the structure of the adherent plasma membrane adjacent to the substratum, while in DRM and NDR assays, whole detached cells are fragmented containing both plasma membranes as well as intracellular membranes. We have previously shown that cell shape and integrin engagement significantly contribute to membrane order and, further, that Cav1 expression and phosphorylation regulate membrane order at focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Hence, the microscopy analysis of membrane order also detects cell architecture-dependent membrane domains but is limited to the plasma membrane, whereas DRM and NDR analysis suggest that there is per se no biochemical difference in cholesterol-enriched membrane domains between detached WT and Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. Taken together, it appears that Cav1 expression has little effect on the cholesterol distribution within membranes but does contribute to anchorage-dependent membrane order at the cell surface.</p><p>In this context, it is noteworthy that we found no difference in total cell cholesterol levels between the two cell types, while the proportional increase in SM or saturated PLs in Cav1-null cells does not contribute to higher cholesterol levels in isolated raft domains. The inverse is observed when cholesterol or sphingomylin levels are manipulated acutely; treatment with cyclodextrin to remove membrane cholesterol lowers SM levels in DRMs and NDRs, while treatment of membranes with sphingomyelinase reduces DRM and NDR cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). One interesting hypothesis is that the higher levels of SM and saturated PLs in Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells compensate for the loss of Cav1, resulting in the formation of noncaveolae raft domains that isolate as DRMs and NDRs. Whether subtle shifts in lipid profile, such as changes in fatty acid chain length in specific PLs subclasses, affect raft formation in general will only be resolved when lipid profiles and raft abundance are compared across cell types.</p><p>Our observation that Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells had identical levels of CO-sensitive cholesterol to WT cells refutes the previous suggestion that CO specifically targets caveolar-cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Interestingly, CO-sensitive depletion of cholesterol was largely limited to DRM in both cell types, while the CO product (cholestenone) was recovered predominantly in detergent-soluble fractions. This could be explained if lipid rafts with their high substrate concentration are the main target for CO, but that the cholestenone generated redistributes to nonraft domains. The absence of the 3&#x003b2;-hydroxyl group in cholestenone may cause such redistribution as it is important for the interaction with sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). By visualizing CO action on lipid monolayers, Slotte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>) has not only shown that the oxidation reaction converts the condensed phase (cholesterol-rich phase) into an expanded phase (cholestenone-rich phase) but also located CO activity in the expanded phase or at the boundary between expanded and condensed phases. Furthermore, the catalytic rate of CO decreases with increasing membrane order of artificial lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). In agreement, we only observed a small shift of raft proteins toward the nonraft fractions after CO treatment, but not the complete disorganization of DRMs observed in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>) that used different CO treatment conditions and cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). Overall, our and other data strongly suggest that CO activity is complex and not an appropriate tool for simple characterization of caveolae.</p><p>In summary, we identified that Cav1 does not contribute to DRMs and NDR but contributes to cell architecture-dependent raft domains in adherent cells. Our complete lipid analysis of WT and Cav1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEF further suggests that Cav1 plays a role in lipid homeostasis by regulating the balance in cholesterol esterification and between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in PLs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M800601-JLR200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800601-JLR200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Harder</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rentero</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zech</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gaus</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></person-group><year>2007</year><article-title>Plasma membrane segregation during T cell activation: probing the order of domains</article-title>. <source>Curr.
