Recently, this member of the PRL family has been found to play a critical role in the processes of tumor initiation and development, such as cancer cell invasion and migration, tumor angiogenesis and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Saha1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Guo1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. PRL-3 has also been proposed as a biomarker for advanced malignancy in gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal carcinoma etc. and implicates poor clinical outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Li1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Wang1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The potential great importance of PRL-3 in malignant tumors could also be supported from research insights into its structure.</p><p>The three members of PRL class share at least 75&#x00025; amino acid sequence similarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Heiskanen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Kozlov1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. With the other two members (PRL-1 and PRL-2), PRL-3 shares the family's common structure of two functional domains. The catalytic domain constitutes one critical motif for PRL-3 and functions as a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) for dephosphorylation similar to most other dual phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Kim1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Though its specific substrate <italic>in vivo</italic> has not been clearly identified yet, a number of papers have addressed the importance of this PTP domain of PRL-3 or other proteins in promoting cancer cell growth, invasion and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Miskad1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Zeng1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Our previous research also indicated that PRL-3 with inactive PTP domain reduced the migratory ability of tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Wu1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The other functional domain of PRL-3 is the CCVM motif for prenylation. In contrast to the known effects of the PTP domain as mentioned above, it is unknown if the CCVM motif contributes to the progress of cancer metastasis.</p><p>Prenylation is a common post-translational modification for proteins that are targeted to membranes or other interacting factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-WinterVann1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The CAAX sequence on the C-terminal of PRL-3 constitutes a conserved feature of this kind of protein family. The recognition of prenylation motifs such as CAAX, XXCC, XCXC and CCXX by farnesyltransferase (FT) or geranylgeranyltransferase (GGT), aids in the correct localization of a variety of proteins to specific sites within the cell and enables participation in their relevant signal transduction pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Seabra1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Andres1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Prominent members of the family such as Ras and Rab, including H-Ras, K-Ras and N-Ras, are prenylated resulting in targeting to plasma membrane or Golgi for their cellular function in tumor proliferation and anti-apoptosis. Likewise, Rho-A, Rho-B and Rho-C localize to plasma membrane after this prenylation resulting in promotion of tumor metastasis and angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-WinterVann1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Michaelson1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Chiu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>There is no current consensus on the subcellular localization of PRL-3. Zeng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Zeng2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> reported that PRL-1, -2, and -3 were targeted to plasma membrane and the early endosomes while a small fraction of unprenylated molecules were localized in the nucleus. In contrast other researchers such as Fiordalisi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Fiordalisi1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that PRL-3 localized in endomembranes. Since cellular localization could establish a causal link with the molecular intracellular function, the location of PRL-3 needs to be further elucidated. Therefore, here we explored the role of prenylation of the CCVM motif in PRL-3's cellular localization and in the process of tumor cell metastasis.

However, little is known about the role of PRL-3's cellular localization in this tumorigenic process. In order to explore the relationship between PRL-3's subcellular localization and its metastatic function, we utilized an over-expression system with Myc fusion protein. We amplified PRL-3 gene from mice skeleton muscle and constructed Myc-PRL-3 wild type and four mutant fusion expression vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004450-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The two cysteines of PRL-3 CCVM were mutated to serines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004450-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) to specify the exact crucial site in tumor migration.</p><p>Proteins with CAAX motif are often farnesyled or geranylgeranyled, which adds a long hydrophobic fatty acid chain to the proteins and facilitates their plasma membrane localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Casey1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Though various proteins of the CAAX family depend on such modifications for correct localization, they can be targeted to different subcellular sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Bos1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Fritz1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In our current study, with the effective transfection system shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004450-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, PRL-3 wild type and the mutant vectors were introduced into B16F1 to determine the subcellular localization of PRL-3. As shown by immunofluorescent microscopy, wild type PRL-3 was localized to cell cyto-membrane, while the C170S mutation resulted in the diversion of the majority of the protein to the whole cytosol. However, such whole cytosol distribution did not happen in the cells transfected with PRL-3-C171S mutants. Although the specific subcellular localization of PRL-3 was not examined in this work, our current data suggested, at least that PRL-3 could locate on the plasma membrane of murine melanoma cells and further, Cys170 was the key site for its localization while Cys171 contributed little to this progress. These results may be inconsistent with some previous conclusions. For example, Fiordalisi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Fiordalisi1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> transfected colon cancer cell line SW180 with GFP-PRL-3 fusion protein and found PRL-3 located on the endoplasts and recticulum membrane while its SAXX mutants were observed in the nucleus. Zeng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Zeng1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> reported that over-expression of GFP-PRL-3 fusion protein in CHO cells resulted in protein localization to certain regions of plasmic membrane such as membrane ruffles, protrusions and some vacuolar-like membrane extensions. These differences could be explained by cell type or fusion protein system specificity mediating localization due to differences in cell signaling and protein interaction. In previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Zeng1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Fiordalisi1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, the 22 kDa PRL-3 was fused to GFP of 27 kDa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Choi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, facilitating localization tracing, but possibly inducing side effects on the PRL-3's localization in normal status. Since GFP was bigger than PRL-3 in molecular size, it might produce steric hindrance for correct localization of PRL-3. The PRL-3's localization observed in our study could be supported from the reports of Bardelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Bardelli1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> in which over expression of HA-PRL-3 in colon cancer cells CRC resulted in cell plasmic membrane localization of PRL-3. It still needs to be determined whether PRL-3 would localize to other membrane structures within the cell.</p><p>We then determined the role of PRL-3 prenylation on the cancer cell adhesion and migration ability <italic>in vitro</italic>. Compared to the control group transfected with mock vector, PRL-3 transfectants with PRL-3-WT and PRL-3-C171S had an elevated ability of adhesion and migration to strata of fibronectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004450-g003">Fig. 3A and C</xref>). In contrast the other two mutants, PRL-3-C170S and PRL-3-C170/171S, had no effect on the rate of adhesion or migration. We thus hypothesize that PRL-3 localizing to cell cyto-membrane is indispensable for its function in cancer metastasis via participation in the signal transduction pathway on the inner side of the membrane. In fact, by using a yeast two-hybrid system to identify integrin &#x003b1;1 on cell membrane as a PRL-3-interacting protein, Peng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Peng1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that PRL-3 could down-regulate the tyrosine-phosphorylation level of integrin &#x003b2;1, hence activating the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, we found that C170S mutants showed a strongly reduced ability of cell adhesion and migration, and treatment with the prenylation transferase inhibitor FTI-277 also decreased the ability of PRL-3-WT transfected B16F1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004450-g003">Fig. 3B and D</xref>). This result supported a model of Cys170 prenylation in normal PRL-3 function. At the same time, we found that when treated with high concentration (2 &#x000b5;M) of FTI-277, PRL-3-WT transfected B16F1 cells showed even lower migration ability compared with mock vector, suggesting that FTI-277 might inhibit some other molecules' function. In fact, the most proteins of the CAAX family are also oncogenes, such as Ras and Rho super-family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Andres1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-deBono1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. For this reason, investigations into the mechanisms of farnesylation and the drug-screening for prenylation transferase inhibitors are becoming a new hotspot of pharmacology. A number of such inhibitors are already in phase III clinical trials as potential new generation of agents for anticancer treatment with their low toxicity and high efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004450-Doll1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Our current study offers PRL-3 as a new target for this kind of medicine treatment.</p><p>Since tumor metastasis is a highly complex, multi-step progress, the <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior of wild type PRL-3 and its mutation transfectants' were further examined. In an experimental passive tumor metastasis model, we found that few nodules were formed in the lung of mice injected by mock vector transfectants. Such pulmonary metastasis was apparently increased in those seeded by PRL-3-WT and PRL-3-C171S mutants. In contrast, mice with the other mutant-transfected B16F1 showed low tumorigenic behavior similar to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004450-g004">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). In addition, apparent mesentery lymph node metastatic lesions were also observed in mice injected with PRL-3-WT and PRL-3-C171S mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004450-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), but not those with mock vector, PRL-3-CCVM-del or the other two mutants. These results further support our hypothesis that PRL-3's localization to plasma membrane directed by Cys170 prenylation is crucial for its function in promoting tumor metastasis.</p><p>In summary, our current study demonstrated the critical role of CCVM motif for PRL-3 intracellular localization and promotion of tumor metastasis, of which Cys170 was the key amino acid for prenylation. The localization of PRL-3 to cell cyto-membrane was highly correlated with its function in the progress of metastasis, shedding some light for further investigation on its signal transduction pathway. Prenylation transferase inhibitors, which showed an effective inhibition on cancer cell migration, also suggested a promising future for the selection of such drugs as anti-cancer agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Lowly metastatic cell line B16F1 cells were maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10&#x00025; FBS (fetal bovine serum, Life Technologies Inc.), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> in the air.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6J mice (6 to 8 weeks old) were obtained from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center (Shanghai, China).
