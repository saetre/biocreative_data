To better understand MDR development, we employed the Methylation Sensitive-Representational Difference Analysis (MS-RDA) technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] to study DNA hypermethylation events in a human MDR breast cancer cell line, MCF7/AdrR, and its parental line, MCF7/WT. As a result, the <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene was discovered. <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene's product is homologous to the <italic>Rab6 </italic>and <italic>Rab6c </italic>genes that encode small G proteins and belong to the <italic>ras </italic>super family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Similar to the <italic>Rab6</italic>s, <italic>WTH3 </italic>is a house-keeping gene and its product is capable of binding to GTP molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, unlike the Rab6s that reside in the Golgi network, most of WTH3 is located in the cytoplasm and to a lesser degree in the nuclei. This disparity could be due to WTH3's lack of a cysteine at its C-terminus for geranyl-geranylation, a necessary post-translational modification for membrane attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Previous studies found that the <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene was down regulated in MDR cell lines, and by introducing it back into those lines caused down regulation of <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression that reversed their MDR phenotypes to various anti-cancer drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our research revealed that hypermethylation (an epigenetic modification event in mammals, which represses gene expression) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] of the <italic>WTH3 </italic>promoter and transcription factor modulation were involved in its differential expression in MCF7/AdrR versus MCF7/WT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the hypermethylation event was also observed in primary drug resistant breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we identified a p53-binding motif (p53M) in the <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene promoter, which was located in a CpG island that was targeted by DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The <italic>p53 </italic>gene product is a transcription factor that functions as a tumor suppressor and plays a pivotal role in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In addition, various mutations of <italic>p53 </italic>were found to be associated with human cancers and the onset of MDR in a broad field of solid and hematological malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. By performing the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we demonstrated that the <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene was a direct target of the p53 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This relationship led us to evaluate the possible participation of <italic>WTH3 </italic>in promoting apoptosis via different approaches. Our findings suggested that over expression of <italic>WTH3 </italic>stimulated cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. As a result, we believed that this gene played an important role in MDR development.</p><p>To further understand <italic>WTH3</italic>'s involvement in MDR, we carried out shRNA knockdown experiments to see if reduced <italic>WTH3 </italic>expression would increase tolerance of host cells to the anti-cancer drug, Doxorubicin (Dox). In addition, considering the physical interaction of p53 and the sequences subjected to DNA methylation, and a current observation that treating MCF7/AdrR cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza), a DNA methylation inhibitor, further elevated <italic>p53 </italic>transgene activity, which in turn increased endogenous <italic>WTH3 </italic>expression in host cells, we explored the possible interplay between epigenetic modification and the p53 transcription factor regarding their influence on <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Lines and Treatment</title><p>MCF7/AdrR and MCF7/WT were grown at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in DMEM medium with 10% FCS, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin.

Briefly, pSIEN-RetroQWTH3 or pSIEN-RetroQ (negative control) along with the envelope vector, pAmpho were co-transfected into the GP2-293 packaging cell line via the phosphate calcium method. Viral supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 500 &#x000d7; g for 10 min to remove the cellular debris. The supernatant was then used to infect HEK293 cells. The cells with integrated <italic>WTH3 </italic>shRNA sequences were selected by adding 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml puromycin into the medium for 2 weeks. The limiting dilution procedure was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] to obtain individual HEK293 clones that were either integrated with pSIEN-RetroQWTH3 or pSIEN-RetroQ.</p></sec><sec><title>SQRT-PCR</title><p>Total RNAs were isolated from cell lines treated with 5-aza, transfectants and the corresponding negative controls by the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche).

In 6 days, the cells were then stained with 3- [4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). IC50 (IC50 values represent Dox concentrations that cause 50% cell death) was quantitatively measured at 595 nm by the program software, EZ-ED50 Version 1.1 (Perrella Scientific Inc,) in a micro-plate spectrophotometer (Benchmark Plus, BIO-RAD).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In Vitro </italic>DNA Methylation</title><p>To methylate the CpG sites in pGL/WTH3P and pGL/WTH3d3 plasmids, 2 &#x003bc;g of each construct was incubated with 12 U CpG methylase <italic>Sss </italic>I and 640 &#x003bc;M of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (New England Biolab) at 37&#x000b0;C for 3 hr.

To further confirm this possibility, we decided to knockdown the <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene in HEK293 cells to see if reduced gene expression could increase the host cells' resistance to an anti-cancer drug, such as Dox. To do so, we employed the Clontech Knockout RNAi system to integrate a DNA sequence, which specifically interfered with the endogenous <italic>WTH3 </italic>transcripts, into the host cells' genome (see Materials and Methods for details). After antibiotic selection, RNAs were extracted from the cells infected with pSIEN-RetroQWTH3 or pSIEN-RetroQ (negative control), and quantified by SQRT-PCR. The results obtained from the three individual measurements showed that <italic>WTH3 </italic>transcripts in the cells infected with pSIEN-RetroQWTH3 (293/WTH3RNAi-P) were about 2 times lower than that in the control cells containing the empty vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, 1B</xref>). Therefore, the <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene was successfully knockdown in the HEK293 cell population. We then selected several individual cell clones via limiting dilution procedures. Consequently, we obtained 7 clones whose <italic>WTH3 </italic>expression was significantly lower due to the knockdown and 6 clones whose genome was integrated with the empty vector, but did not change <italic>WTH3 </italic>expression levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, 1B</xref>). The populations and three cloned cell lines, 293/WTH3RNAi-2, -3, -6, which were randomly picked, were used to perform MTT assays to obtain IC50s (the concentration of a drug that causes 50% cell death) to Dox. The results were an average of three individual experiments for each group. The IC50 value of the 293/WTH3RNAi-P cells was about 39 nM, while that of the control was about 13 nM. Clearly, the reduction of <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene expression made the host 3 times more resistance to Dox than its control, 293-V (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, 2B</xref>). Next, IC50s of the three cloned lines, 293/WTH3RNAi-2, -3 and -6 were also evaluated. The IC50 values to Dox were 44, 93, and 52 nM for 293/WTH3RNAi-2, -3 and -6, respectively, which were approximately 3.4, 7 and 4 times more resistance than the 293-V control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, 2B</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Moreover, due to past findings that suggested a reverse correlation between <italic>WTH3 </italic>and <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we examined <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression levels in those cells by SQRT-PCR. As we expected, the results showed that the <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene was re-activated in the 293/WTH3RNAi-P, 293/WTH3RNAi-2, -3 and -6 cells, while <italic>MDR1 </italic>transcripts were undetectable in the corresponding control cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, 3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>SQRT-PCR results for <italic>WTH3 </italic>expression in the knockdown cells, population (293/WTH3RNAi-P), 3 cloned cell lines (293/WTH3RNAi-2, -3, and -6), and 293 control cells (293-V) that were integrated with the empty vector.</bold> A.

It was also discovered that this island contained p53M, which was directly bound by the p53 protein, a trans-element for activating <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Based on these facts we speculated that DNA methylation could play an antagonistic role influencing the <italic>p53 </italic>transcription factor. To test this hypothesis, we transfected the pcDNA/P53 or pcDNA3.1 (negative control) construct into MCF7/AdrR cells (whose CpG island in the <italic>WTH3 </italic>promoter was methylated and <italic>p53 </italic>defective due to a mini-deletion) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and then treated the transfectants with 5-aza to see if the <italic>p53 </italic>transgene preferentially activated the <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene expression, but not in the untreated cells. After 24 and 72 hours of treatment, endogenous <italic>WTH3 </italic>transcript levels were evaluated by SQRT-PCR. We found that the <italic>p53 </italic>transgene's positive effect on the <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene expression of the cells treated with 5-aza was about 2 times stronger than that in the control cells who either contained the transgene or the empty vector, but were not treated with 5-aza (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, 4B</xref>). This suggested that DNA methylation could negatively affect p53 transactivity. In addition, as we expected, the 5-aza treat alone increased <italic>WTH3 </italic>transcript. Considering that Hela cells express a relatively low level of <italic>WTH3 </italic>and a relatively high IC50 value to Dox (data not shown), we introduced <italic>p53 </italic>transgene into those cells or treated them with 5-aza. It was observed that the <italic>p53 </italic>transgene and 5-aza positively affected the <italic>WTH3 </italic>expression of the cells compared to the untreated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C, 4D</xref>). These results further indicated that epigenetic modification and <italic>p53 </italic>regulated the <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene. To verify if DNA methylation could negatively affect p53 transactivity, the <italic>in vitro </italic>DNA methylation approach was employed to modify full length and deleted <italic>WTH3 </italic>promoters to analyzed <italic>p53</italic>'s influence.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>SQRT-PCR results for endogenous <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene expression in MCF7/AdrR and Hela cells</bold>.

The resulting construct, pGL/WTH3P<sup>m </sup>and pGL/WTH3d3<sup>m</sup>, their non-methylated controls, as well pCMV/&#x003b2;-galactosidase (transfection efficiency control) were then introduced into HEK293 cells.

Clearly, DNA methylation inhibited the promoters' function. We then co-transfected pGL/WTH3P<sup>m </sup>versus pGL/WTH3P and pGL/WTH3d3<sup>m </sup>versus pGL/WTH3d3 with pcDNA/P53, or pcDNA/P53R249S (negative control), or pcDNA3.1 (negative control) into HEK293 cells to see if DNA methylation could antagonize p53 transactivity. The results showed that the <italic>p53 </italic>transgene only activated the non-methylated WTH3P and WTH3d3 promoters but had no effect on their methylated counterparts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). However, mutated p53, p53R249S, was unable to influence non-methylated WTH3P and WTH3d3 promoters.

This idea was based on three observations, 1) its expression was reduced in cells exhibiting drug resistant traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; 2) its restoration in MDR cell lines not only increased sensitivity to a variety of drugs, but also decreased endogenous <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; and 3) it was a direct target of <italic>p53 </italic>whose role during the onset of MDR has been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. To further verify <italic>WTH3</italic>'s importance related to drug resistance, we recently employed the small hairpin RNA interference technique to permanently reduce its expression in non-MDR HEK293 cells to see if this could increase the host's tolerance to Dox. The reason for utilizing HEK293 was that it expressed normal amounts of the <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene, but undetectable <italic>MDR1 </italic>RNA, and was quite sensitive to Dox. The knockdown procedure was considered successful because <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene expression in the population and cloned host lines was 2 or more times below the original level. After measuring their IC50 values to Dox we found that all those cells with the <italic>WTH3 </italic>knockdown were 2 to 4 times more resistant to Dox than their controls. In addition, the knockdown was accompanied by significant <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene re-activation. These results were consistent with previous observations and supported the notion that there was a direct link between <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene function and MDR development. This relationship would be even more obvious if the <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene was completely knocked out by a traditional targeting knockout approach. This prediction is based on the fact that <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene expression was much lower (about 10 times) in MCF7/AdrR than in MCF7/WT cells, the former line processing a much stronger (about 100 times) MDR phenotype than the later one.</p><p>Considering that the <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene could play an important role in regards to the on set of MDR, we were interested in understanding the detailed mechanisms by which its transcription was regulated by DNA methylation and the p53 transcription factor. In the past, we presented data that the <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene promoter was hypermethylated not only in MCF7/AdrR but also drug resistant primary breast cancer epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and was physically targeted by p53 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We also found that the p53-binding site, p53M, in the gene promoter resided in a CpG island that was subjected to epigenetic modification. This information indicated that DNA methylation, whose role is to repress gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] could have a direct impact on <italic>p53 </italic>activated <italic>WTH3 </italic>expression. To test this hypothesis, two approaches were employed. The first included evaluating the <italic>p53 </italic>transgene's influence on <italic>WTH3 </italic>expression in MCF7/AdrR cells that were treated with 5-aza. The second was to study <italic>WTH3 </italic>promoter activity that was modified by methylation. The resulting information pointed out that DNA methylation significantly diminished promoter activity by at least one mechanism, by antagonizing <italic>p53 </italic>transactivity. Since, DNA methylation usually attracts methyl-binding-proteins (MBPs) and other epigenetic modification factors (EMFs), one could image that the methylated <italic>WTH3 </italic>promoter was bound by some MBPs and EMFs, which might change the chromatin structures and prevent p53 from recognizing its targeting structures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our studies provided solid evidence supporting the important role played by the <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene in MDR development and uncovered one of the mechanisms regulating its expression. Therefore, restoring or increasing this gene's activity could be another valuable strategy for easing MDR encountered during cancer chemotherapy. This could be achieved by introducing demethylation reagents if attenuated <italic>WTH3 </italic>gene activity in a patient was caused by DNA methylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KT participated experiments designing and carried out shRNA Knockdown, DNA methylation and luciferase assay.
