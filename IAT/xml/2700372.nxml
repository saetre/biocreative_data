In this study, we show that the processes of export and polyadenylation are coupled via the <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic> CCCH-type zinc finger protein CG6694/dZC3H3 through both physical and functional interactions. We show that depletion of dZC3H3 from S2R+ cells results in transcript hyperadenylation. Using targeted coimmunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (MS)/MS techniques, we characterize interactions of known components of the mRNA nuclear export and polyadenylation machineries with dZC3H3. Furthermore, we demonstrate the functional conservation of this factor, as depletion of its human homologue ZC3H3 by small interfering RNA results in an mRNA export defect in human cells as well. Nuclear polyadenylated (poly(A)) RNA in ZC3H3-depleted cells is sequestered in foci removed from SC35-containing speckles, indicating a shift from the normal subnuclear distribution of poly(A) RNA. Our data suggest a model wherein ZC3H3 interfaces between the polyadenylation machinery, newly poly(A) mRNAs, and factors for transcript export.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic gene expression requires mRNAs to be transported from their site of transcription in the nucleus to their site of translation in the cytoplasm. As translation of improperly processed mRNAs is likely to be detrimental to a cell, the passage of mRNA molecules between these two compartments is highly regulated. Studies in yeast and higher eukaryotes have identified many conserved factors that are critical to proper mRNA processing, including transcription, 5&#x02032; capping, 3&#x02032; processing, splicing, and surveillance factors, to additionally be required for transcript nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sommer and Nehrbass, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hagiwara and Nojima, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luna et al., 2008</xref>; for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reed and Cheng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saguez et al., 2005</xref>). By physical and functional coupling of the export process to components of prior mRNA processing steps, the cell may impose checkpoints that must be satisfied before transcripts can be released into the cytoplasm.</p><p>Heterodimers of the essential export factors NXF1 (human Tap/yeast Mex67p) and p15 (human NXT1/yeast Mtr2p) mediate the export of most mRNAs by interfacing with components of the nuclear pore complex. However, the majority of cellular mRNAs interact inefficiently with NXF1/p15 heterodimers. Instead, they require adaptor proteins such as REF (RNA export factor; human Aly/yeast Yra1p) or SR (serine/arginine-rich) proteins to interact with these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Santos-Rosa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2003</xref>). Although deposition of some adaptors occurs cotranscriptionally in yeast, these factors are recruited to the mRNA at a later stage in the splicing process in higher eukaryotes (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reed and Cheng, 2005</xref>). Interactions of Aly and SR proteins with mRNAs are also likely to be stabilized by contacts with the exon junction complex. As exon junction complexes are deposited on mRNAs during the splicing process, they and their associated factors are well positioned to recruit export factors NXF1/p15 to fully spliced transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Masuda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Substantial evidence indicates that the 3&#x02032; end processing of mRNAs is coupled to their export as well. Although the presence of proper 3&#x02032; cleavage signals can stimulate nuclear export of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eckner et al., 1991</xref>), mutations in cis in the 3&#x02032; processing signal sequences result in defective mRNA nuclear export in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Long et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Custodio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammell et al., 2002</xref>). Defects in yeast 3&#x02032; processing factors cause transcript nuclear retention, sometimes specifically at sites of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brodsky and Silver, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hilleren et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammell et al., 2002</xref>). In particular, the yeast factor Nab2p is implicated in both controlling polyadenylated (poly(A)) tail length as well as targeting transcripts to the nuclear periphery for export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hector et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fasken et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, nuclear export requires the active process of polyadenylation, not only the presence of a poly(A) tail, to proceed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang and Carmichael, 1996</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the polyadenylation process actively recruits and positions factors properly onto transcripts that are necessary for their export. However, the identities of these factors and the mechanistic details of their recruitment, particularly in metazoan cells, are currently not well understood.</p><p>mRNA polyadenylation occurs via a two-step mechanism; first, an endonucleolytic cleavage of the nascent mRNA followed by the addition of a poly(A) tail to the upstream 3&#x02032; hydroxyl group (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mandel et al., 2008</xref>). In mammals, the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) is required for both the cleavage event and the subsequent polyadenylation process. In this second step, CPSF acts in concert with nuclear poly(A) binding protein (fly PABP2 [poly(A) binding protein II]/human PABPN1) to tether poly(A) polymerase (PAP), which has low RNA-binding affinity itself, to the elongating 3&#x02032; tail and to stimulate processive polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bienroth et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kerwitz et al., 2003</xref>). As the reaction progresses, PABP2/PABPN1 molecules successively bind the adenylate residues, thus coating the tail and maintaining contacts with the extending PAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wahle, 1995</xref>). However, after addition of &#x0223c;200&#x02013;300 adenine residues (the typical length of a mammalian mRNA tail; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brawerman, 1981</xref>), interactions between CPSF and PAP are likely no longer favorable and, via an ill-defined mechanism, the quaternary complex of CPSF, PABP2/PABPN1, PAP, and RNA is thought to disassemble.</p><p>Nuclear speckles, also known as interchromatin granule clusters or splicing speckles, are one of many nuclear subcompartments thought to aid in the progression of DNA and RNA processing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Handwerger and Gall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernardi and Pandolfi, 2007</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lamond and Spector, 2003</xref>). Speckles are devoid of chromatin but rich in numerous factors important to different stages of mRNA biogenesis such as small nuclear RNP particles, splicing factors, RNA polymerase II, and 3&#x02032; end processing factors, including CPSF and PABPN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mintz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saitoh et al., 2004</xref>). Poly(A) RNA species, including mRNAs as well as noncoding RNAs, are also specifically enriched within these domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xing et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hutchinson et al., 2007</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lamond and Spector, 2003</xref>). Thus, nuclear speckles are currently regarded as dynamic repositories of factors required for the proper splicing and processing of transcripts. Although specific messages have been localized both peripheral and internal to speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xing et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson et al., 2000</xref>), questions still remain regarding the exact function of the speckle in transcript processing and the spatial relationship of messages to these domains during export.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic> factor CG6694 was identified in a genome-wide screen as required for the nuclear export of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farny et al., 2008</xref>). Harboring three CCCH-type zinc fingers near its C terminus, CG6694 possesses 27% sequence identity and 41% similarity to the 30-kD subunit of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CPSF. The closest homologue of CG6694 in mouse, Zc3h3, was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid study as a nuclear Smad-interacting protein (and thus termed Smicl [Smad-interacting CPSF-like factor]). Zc3h3 was additionally found to associate with subunits of CPSF and to have the ability to potentiate a Smad-dependent transcriptional event when proper 3&#x02032; end signal sequences were present in the responsive locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collart et al., 2005a</xref>). Later work further identified the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> homologue to be required for proper embryonic development also in a Smad-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collart et al., 2005b</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the coupling mechanisms that exist between the mRNA 3&#x02032; end processing and export machineries, we further explored the role that CG6694 has in these two processes. In this study, we demonstrate CG6694's importance in the proper polyadenylation and export of mRNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Through biochemical and genetic approaches, we demonstrate interactions of CG6694 with the export and polyadenylation machinery. We also illustrate its importance in mRNA processing in human cells, as depletion of its human homologue, ZC3H3, results in the aberrant accumulation of transcripts peripheral to nuclear speckles. Our data suggest that CG6694/ZC3H3 is a conserved modulator of mRNA processing after initiation of polyadenylation and before nuclear export.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>The C terminus of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CG6694/dZC3H3 is required for mRNA nuclear export</title><p>As part of a genome-wide RNAi screen, we identified nuclear <italic>Drosophila</italic> factor CG6694 as required for proper nuclear export of poly(A) RNA as well as of the endogenous heat shock protein mRNAs <italic>HSP83</italic> and <italic>HSP70</italic> from the nucleus of S2R+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farny et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> illustrates the nuclear accumulation of poly(A) RNA as indicated by a Cy3-labeled oligomer-dT(30) probe (Cy3-OdT), which is resultant upon double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)&#x02013;mediated depletion of CG6694 from <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R+ cells as compared with the steady-state cytoplasmic localization characteristic of control cells (depleted using GFP-targeting dsRNAs).

After fixation and processing for both poly(A) RNA and v5-tagged protein localization, populations of cells were assessed for the fraction of those transfected that yielded nuclear localized poly(A) RNA. Quantification and representative confocal fluorescence images of this experiment are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 (C and D)</xref>. Importantly, unlike some other RNA-binding proteins, full-length dZC3H3-v5 does not induce an export defect when overexpressed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811072/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Windgassen and Krebber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tavanez et al., 2005</xref>). However, cells transfected with GAPDH1-v5 and treated with either dZC3H3(C) or dZC3H3(N) harbor an abnormal level of nuclear poly(A) RNA (72% strong nuclear accumulation and 14% partial accumulation vs. 50% strong and 26% partial, respectively) as compared with cells treated with GFP dsRNAs (1% strong and 33% partial; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref> [rows 5&#x02013;7]). In contrast, cells transfected with the C terminus of dZC3H3 (dZC3H3-C&#x02013;v5) and treated with dZC3H3(N) exhibit a reduced level of nuclear poly(A) RNA accumulation (13% strong; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref> [row 3]). Thus, expression of dZC3H3-C&#x02013;v5 partially restores the cytoplasmic localization of poly(A) RNA in cells that are depleted of endogenous dZC3H3.</p><p>Interestingly, the N terminus alone (dZC3H3-N&#x02013;v5) acts as a dominant negative, as expression of this fragment caused an exacerbation of the poly(A) RNA export defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref> [row 2]). Despite relatively low expression levels (unpublished data), expression of dZC3H3's N terminus in GFP-depleted cells resulted in 82% of transfected cells to show a strong nuclear accumulation of poly(A) RNA, a level nearly identical to that seen upon dZC3H3 depletion. Furthermore, the localization of the N-terminal fragment was completely coincident with accumulation of poly(A) signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, rows 1 and 2), suggesting that despite elimination of the zinc fingers, the N terminus is still able to interact either directly or indirectly with poly(A) RNA. In summary, these results indicate that the C terminus of dZC3H3 is necessary and partially sufficient for nuclear poly(A) RNA export.</p></sec><sec><title>Distinct domains of dZC3H3 differ in their ability to interact with NXF1</title><p>A previous study has indicated that dZC3H3 physically interacts with the essential export factor NXF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farny et al., 2008</xref>). By assaying the propensity of the different dZC3H3 deletion mutants to coimmunoprecipitate with GFP-tagged NXF1, we identified the most significant interactions to occur between NXF1 and dZC3H3's N terminus. S2R+ cells were cotransfected with one of the three dZC3H3 constructs (FL-v5 [full length], N-v5 [N terminal], and C-v5 [C terminal]) or l(1)10Bb-v5 (lethal (1)10Bb), a factor previously determined to not interact with NXF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farny et al., 2008</xref>), and either GFP-NXF1 or GFP. Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) results illustrate that all three versions of dZC3H3 interact with NXF1, albeit to different extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). l(1)10Bb-v5 did not show interaction with NXF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>) nor did GFP alone significantly interact with any of the dZC3H3 constructs (not depicted). Quantification of the fraction of input v5 protein that immunoprecipitated with GFP-NXF1 reveals that the N-terminal portion of dZC3H3 interacts more strongly with GFP-NXF1 (5&#x02013;15-fold) than does the full-length form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). These results suggest that, in the absence of the C terminus of the protein, the N terminus of dZC3H3 may interact with NXF1 to an aberrant extent.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>dZC3H3's N terminus mediates a strong interaction with NXF1.</bold> (A) GFP-NXF1 interacts to different degrees by co-IP with all three v5-tagged dZC3H3 deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>) tested.

Swm possesses an RNA-binding recognition motif and, like ZC3H3, a CCCH-type zinc finger region, strongly suggesting that it is an RNA-binding protein.</p><p>To confirm the interactions of dZC3H3 with swm and PABP2, co-IP reactions of these factors were conducted in the absence or presence of RNase. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref> illustrates that GFP-dZC3H3 coimmunoprecipitates with both v5-tagged PABP2 and swm but not with tagged l(l)10Bb, thereby validating the TAP interaction data. Both interactions appear to be partially sensitive to treatment with RNase, indicating that a portion of dZC3H3's contacts with both PABP2 and swm are RNA dependent. This type of interaction is similar to that seen for GFP-NXF1 with dZC3H3-v5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811072/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>).</p><p>Given dZC3H3's CCCH-type zinc fingers and its interactions with export factors, including nuclear poly(A) binding protein and swm, we wanted to assess whether it associated with poly(A) RNAs. S2R+ cells were transfected with GFP-dZC3H3 or GFP-v5 alone and harvested for nuclear poly(A) RNA using an oligo-dT cellulose resin. Like endogenous PABP2 and NXF1, GFP-dZC3H3 specifically copurified with the poly(A) fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Furthermore, nuclear poly(A) RNA purified from cells transfected with swm-v5 coprecipitated this factor as well, suggesting that it associates with messenger RNP particles (mRNPs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Thus, these four factors, NXF1, PABP2, dZC3H3, and swm, associate with nuclear poly(A) RNA and may function together in transcript nuclear export.</p></sec><sec><title>Proper mRNA polyadenylation requires dZC3H3 activity</title><p>Given the association of dZC3H3 with PABP2, a factor required both for the polyadenylation of mRNA 3&#x02032; ends and controlling tail length, we wished to determine whether dZC3H3 functions in the polyadenylation process as well. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref> illustrates lengths of the poly(A) tail populations of S2R+ cells that have been depleted of GFP, dZC3H3, NXF1, or Rrp6, a core component of the nuclear exosome and an mRNA export factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briggs et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farny et al., 2008</xref>).

Control cells treated with a nontargeting siRNA exhibit weak nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A) RNA staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). In contrast, upon depletion of the mRNA export factor NXF1, cells strongly accumulate poly(A) RNA within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and C</xref>). ZC3H3 depletion also results in a robust nuclear accumulation of poly(A) RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>).

Additionally, to simultaneously monitor the distribution of the poly(A) RNA in these cells, we cohybridized these samples with a biotin-conjugated oligo-dT (biotin-OdT) probe. Similar to the results observed using the Cy3-OdT probe, depletion of either NXF1 or ZC3H3 from cells resulted in an increase in the nucleocytoplasmic ratio of <italic>RPL32</italic> signal intensity compared with control cells (Fig. S3 B).

Similar to its fly counterpart, PABPN1 is required for efficient poly(A) tail synthesis as well as poly(A) tail length control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wahle, 1995</xref>). To assess the effect of PABPN1's activity on the localization of poly(A) RNA, the Cy3-OdT in situ staining pattern of PABPN1-depleted U2OS cells was determined and compared with that of ZC3H3-depleted cells. As described previously, images of cells treated with various siRNAs were processed for poly(A) RNA in situ staining and photographed to enable comparison of nuclear poly(A) signal intensities between knockdown samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Quantification of the percentage of cells within a population that exhibit a nuclear poly(A) signal intensity over a baseline threshold was used to compare the level of nuclear poly(A) accumulation in each treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). As anticipated from our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>, depletion of ZC3H3 results in a dramatic increase in the degree of cells exhibiting a high level of nuclear signal compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). Treatment of cells with siRNAs targeting PABPN1 results in a reduction in the percentage of cells possessing a high level of nuclear poly(A) RNA. This decrease is likely indicative of PABPN1's requirement in the polyadenylation reaction and the cells' impaired ability to processively polyadenylate transcripts in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>). Interestingly, simultaneous reduced expression of ZC3H3 and PABPN1 causes cells to no longer demonstrate the high nuclear poly(A) signals characteristic of those depleted of ZC3H3. Instead, codepletion of ZC3H3 and PABPN1 results in penetrance of nuclear poly(A) accumulations indistinguishable from those of PABPN1 knockdown cells. Assessment of the efficiency of ZC3H3 and PABPN1 protein depletion in each sample indicates that this result is not a consequence of inefficient ZC3H3 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). The reversal of poly(A) signal accumulation upon codepletion of ZC3H3 and PABPN1 indicates that these two factors function in the same adenylation pathway and that PABPN1 activity is upstream of that of ZC3H3.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>ZC3H3 modulates mRNA polyadenylation downstream of PABPN1 activity.</bold> (A) U2OS cells were monitored for poly(A) RNA localization by hybridization with Cy3-OdT probe (left) as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> after depletion with either control siRNAs (ctrl) or siRNAs targeting ZC3H3, PABPN1, or both.

Costaining of the poly(A) RNA and coilin or promyelocytic leukemia protein, markers of Cajal and promyelocytic leukemia bodies, respectively, in ZC3H3-depleted cells revealed no significant colocalization (unpublished data). Similarly, visualization of paraspeckles (using a fluorescently tagged version of PSP1&#x003b1; [paraspeckle protein 1&#x003b1;] did not demonstrate significant overlap with the accumulated RNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811072/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>). However, inspection of the localization of poly(A) accumulations and nuclear speckles, as indicated by the splicing factor and speckle component SC35, illustrated that depletion of ZC3H3 causes a change in the spatial relationship between these two domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Mammalian cell nuclei normally contain a basal level of nuclear poly(A) RNA with specific accumulations within nuclear speckle domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter et al., 1991</xref>). Strikingly, abrogation of ZC3H3 expression in these cells results in nuclear poly(A) foci that are removed from and proximal to these speckle domains. Thus, depletion of ZC3H3 results in either an aberrant accumulation or redistribution of nuclear poly(A) RNA from within the SC35-containing speckles to regions just outside of these domains.</p><p>Unexpectedly, closer inspection of cells depleted of PABPN1 revealed that the nuclear poly(A) in situ signal, although of very weak intensity and more fractured than in ZC3H3-depleted cells, is similarly aberrantly distributed in punctate foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Diminished PABPN1 expression results in nuclear poly(A) signals and SC35 staining that is more coincident than in ZC3H3 siRNA&#x02013;treated cells but less coincident than in cells treated with control siRNAs. As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>, codepletion of ZC3H3 and PABPN1 results in foci with similar properties to those of cells depleted only of PABPN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>).</p><p>Given PABPN1's polyadenylation-related functions and its requirement for the formation of the poly(A) foci observed upon dZC3H3 depletion, we investigated whether it colocalized with these poly(A) accumulations. Normally, PABPN1 primarily resides in the nucleus with specific concentrations within the nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krause et al., 1994</xref>). However, similar to the redistribution of intranuclear poly(A) RNA, PABPN1's subnuclear localization is altered upon ZC3H3 depletion, causing a significant portion of the protein to colocalize with the resultant poly(A) foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 E</xref>). These results further support a function for PABPN1 in the formation and/or maintenance of these nuclear poly(A) RNA foci.</p><p>To further investigate the relationship between nuclear speckles and poly(A) RNA foci in ZC3H3-depleted cells, we monitored their relative localization in ZC3H3-depleted or control cells that had been treated with the RNA polymerase II&#x02013;specific transcriptional inhibitor &#x003b1;-amanitin.

In this study, we show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> factor dZC3H3 is required for both the proper polyadenylation and export of mRNAs. Cells depleted of dZC3H3 have longer poly(A) tails and exhibit a nuclear poly(A) phenotype. Consistent with these findings, we identify the polyadenylation factor PABP2 as a dZC3H3 interactor. We dissect the domains of dZC3H3 and discover that its C terminus is required for its export activity. We also show that the human homologue of this factor, ZC3H3, is similarly required for proper nuclear export of adenylated transcripts, as its depletion results in the formation of nuclear poly(A) RNA foci peripheral to nuclear speckles in U2OS cells. Formation of these foci is dependent on PABPN1 function, further suggesting the conservation of ZC3H3's function between organisms.</p><p>The N- and C-terminal domains of dZC3H3 mediate the export of poly(A) RNA to different extents. The dominant-negative effect of expressing dZC3H3's N terminus on RNA export suggests that the C terminus is required to keep dZC3H3 function, such as interaction with NXF1, in check. Additionally, in the absence of the C terminus, the N-terminal segment of dZC3H3 may be unable to modify the messages properly, thereby preventing their export via activation of additional surveillance mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p><p>We have now demonstrated physical interactions between dZC3H3 and three other factors, NXF1, PABP2, and swm, all of which are similarly required for mRNA nuclear export. These factors may function together or in combination in a larger mRNA export-associated complex. RNase sensitivity assays revealed that all of these interactions are dependent on the presence of RNA to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref> and Fig. S2). Therefore, it is likely that either some of these factors do not directly contact each other but are tethered together via a common RNA molecule or that their interactions with each other are dependent on changes in protein conformations induced upon their association with RNA. Indeed, specific protein conformational changes have been observed for the CCCH-type zinc finger protein tristetraprolin upon RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brewer et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We show that absence of ZC3H3 causes the appearance of aberrant poly(A) foci peripheral to nuclear speckles. We have also demonstrated that at least some of these accumulated poly(A) RNAs are mRNA molecules normally destined for export but abnormally retained due to depletion of this factor. Although the nuclear speckle is widely regarded as a compartment integral to mRNA processing, its exact functional and spatial relation to mRNAs is not clearly defined. Significant evidence indicates that a speckle-localized poly(A) RNA is dynamically associated with these domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Molenaar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Politz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishihama et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, some mRNA transcripts have been shown to transit through speckles before their export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith et al., 1999</xref>). However, this phenomenon appears to be transcript specific, as other messages have only ever been observed at the periphery of speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith et al., 1999</xref>). The poly(A) accumulations resultant upon ZC3H3 depletion may represent transcripts that are forming at the periphery of these domains.</p><p>Alternatively, these foci could be indicative of adenylated transcripts that normally transit through speckles but are instead trapped upon entry or exit from these domains. Interestingly, <italic>DMPK</italic> (<italic>dystrophia myotonica protein kinase</italic>) mRNA normally travels through the speckle before its export. However, in myotonic dystrophy I patient myoblasts, which harbor an abnormal CUG triplet expansion in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region of the <italic>DMPK</italic> gene, this message is trapped just outside of the speckle and is not exported from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). Depletion of ZC3H3 may be causing a similar but more widespread problem in speckle trafficking of mRNAs.</p><p>Previous work has demonstrated that transcripts that are aberrantly trapped in the nucleus, resulting from improper mRNP formation, are often specifically retained at their site of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Long et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Custodio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brodsky and Silver, 2000</xref>). Thus, misprocessed messages may be tethered to a site where they can be monitored by surveillance factors (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saguez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmid and Jensen, 2008</xref>).

In cells depleted of ZC3H3, transcriptional inhibition results in concurrent morphological changes in both speckle shape and foci organization, suggesting a physical and/or functional link between these two features. These poly(A) foci potentially indicate sites of cotranscriptional mRNA processing activity, containing transcripts stalled at a stage during polyadenylation just before export. ZC3H3 may be required to interact productively with mRNPs to signal that the message is properly adenylated and ready for release from its site of transcription for export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). Consistent with this model, dZC3H3 interacts with Rm62, which in addition to having a role in gene silencing, was also found to be required for proper clearance of <italic>HSP70</italic> mRNAs from their transcriptional locus after heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buszczak and Spradling, 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Model of potential roles of ZC3H3 in polyadenylation and nuclear export.</bold> RNA processing factors (light gray) are recruited to mRNAs during transcription by RNA polymerase II (red).

This activity could additionally aid in the release of the poly(A) transcript from the transcription focus, thereby allowing it to proceed toward the nuclear periphery for export via interactions with export factors such as NXF1 (purple). For simplicity, ZC3H3 is shown to interact with the mRNP after the initiation of transcript polyadenylation.

For example, mutations in yeast export factors, including Mex67p, Gle1p, and Sub2p result in polyadenylation defects, specifically hyperadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hilleren and Parker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jensen et al., 2001</xref>). However, in contrast to transcript hyperadenylation resulting from export defects in ZC3H3-depleted cells, we favor a model in which ZC3H3 functions directly in the polyadenylation process for several reasons: (1) depletion of dZC3H3 results in a more significant effect on poly(A) tail length (1.8-fold increased over control cells) than does either NXF1 or Rrp6 (a known RNA nuclease), (2) dZC3H3 interacts physically with PABP2, (3) dZC3H3 has homology to a 3&#x02032; end processing subunit, clp, and (4) formation of aberrant poly(A) foci in the absence of ZC3H3 requires the activity of PABPN1. Whether the trapping of mRNAs in the nucleus upon dZC3H3 depletion is caused by a second export-related function of dZC3H3 (perhaps via interaction with NXF1) or is rather a downstream consequence of improper 3&#x02032; end polyadenylation and enactment of nuclear surveillance machinery is unknown. However, it should be noted that export defects were not observed upon depletion of many 3&#x02032; end processing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farny et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>What is dZC3H3's function in the polyadenylation process? We envision the following three nonmutually exclusive scenarios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). First, ZC3H3 may be required to release transcripts from their site of transcription after proper polyadenylation has taken place. Second, this factor may aid in poly(A) tail length control by facilitating the release of other adenylation factors. Third, ZC3H3 may play a role in trimming the poly(A) tail down to the appropriate length. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collart et al.

We have further provided clues to the linkage between these two processes, as depletion of this factor causes unusual accumulations of adenylated RNA at the periphery of nuclear speckles, a domain whose functional role is tied to RNA processing. These data are consistent with a model in which ZC3H3 is required for release of adenylated transcripts from their processing centers, adjunct to nuclear speckles, en route to export.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and constructs</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R+ cells were maintained in Schneider's <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin solution.

In brief, total RNA was harvested from <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2R+ cells that had been depleted using dZC3H3, NXF1, Rrp6, or GFP-targeting dsRNAs. 2.5 ug total RNA from each sample was 3&#x02032; end labeled with [<sup>32</sup>P]pCp followed by digestion with RNase A and T1. A mixture of RNA standards (RNA Century-plus; Applied Biosystems) was similarly labeled and processed for size comparison. Products were separated on TBE Urea polyacrylamide gels, imaged by autoradiography, and quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi, transfections, and fluorescence microscopy</title><p>For dual transfection and knockdown experiments, S2R+ cells were first transfected with v5-tagged deletion constructs of the CG6694 coding sequence or GAPDH1 for 24 h and knocked down for an additional 48 h with either a dsRNA targeting the N-terminal (DRSC31743) or C-terminal (DRSC31742) portion of the CG6694 mRNA or GFP mRNA. In situ samples were fixed and hybridized using a Cy3-OdT(30) probe (Integrated DNA Technologies) followed by staining with mouse anti-v5 (Abcam) and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti&#x02013;mouse (Invitrogen) or Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (Invitrogen) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farny et al., 2008</xref>). Images were captured using confocal microscopy, and transfected cells (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003e; 40) were scored blindly for nuclear accumulation of poly(A) mRNA. This experiment was repeated three times.</p></sec><sec><title>IP experiments</title><p>Anti-GFP IP experiments were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farny et al., 2008</xref>) except that precleared lysates were incubated overnight with 3.6 ug rabbit anti-GFP antibody and immunoprecipitated for 4 h using protein A&#x02013;Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). For RNase experiments, samples were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 125 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40, 5% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitors) and treated with or without RNase cocktail (Applied Biosystems) for 30 min at room temperature before preclearing and IP using v5-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich). After washing with lysis buffer, purified samples were analyzed by Western blotting using either mouse anti-v5 (Invitrogen) or rabbit anti-GFP antibody. Quantification of interaction strength between dZC3H3 mutants and GFP-NXF1 was performed using Quantity One software by taking a ratio of the IP signal to the INPUT signal for each reaction and normalized to that of full-length dZC3H3 with GFP-NXF1.</p></sec><sec><title>TAP and MS analysis</title><p>Stable S2R+ cell lines were induced to produce each TAP fusion protein by treatment with media containing 0.21 mM cupric sulfate for 20 h.

Peptides were generated from purified samples by in-solution trypsin digestion and analyzed by liquid chromatography MS/MS. Spectra were analyzed using the SEQUEST algorithm against the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein database, and all identified peptides were filtered by tryptic state, XCorr, and dCorr. A factor was identified as a dZC3H3 interactor if its corresponding peptides were not isolated in any of the control purifications nor identified in any previous study as common contaminants of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> TAP/liquid chromatography MS/MS procedure, and either the factor was identified in three out of four or two out of the four experimental purifications and by at least two unique peptides.

Cells were finally washed three times in 2&#x000d7; SSC for 5 min before mounting. MetaMorph imaging software (MDS Analytical Technologies) was used to segment individual widefield images and record area and signal intensity values for each cell and its corresponding nucleus. After local background correction, the mean nuclear and cytoplasmic signal for each cell was calculated, and a corresponding nuclear/cytoplasmic signal ratio was recorded.</p><p>Protein levels were assessed by immunoblotting using either rabbit anti&#x02013;bovine PABPN1 or rabbit anti-ZC3H3 (peptide antibody generated in this study; Open Biosystems).
