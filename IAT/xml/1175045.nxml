In most normal and tumor tissues, adaptation to hypoxic conditions is critical for successful tissue expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In response to down-regulation of oxygen homeostasis, cells during hypoxic challenge transiently or chronically tolerate lowered oxygen levels by means of adaptive mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, oxygen is the terminal electron acceptor during ATP production. Several enzymatic reactions require oxygen as a substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Responses to hypoxia include a metabolic shift to anaerobic glycolysis as well as the initiation of neoangiogenesis via the expression of angiogenic factors to increase the opportunity for oxygen to reach the tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Oxygen homeostasis and its down-regulation are involved in the pathogenesis of common diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>It is well known that the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) appears to be one of the major regulators of the hypoxic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. HIF-1 controls hypoxic expression of erythropoietin, as well as the expression of genes with metabolic functions such as glucose transport and metabolism, and angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. HIF-1 is a heterodimer of the PAS subfamily of basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factors, and it consists of the subunit HIF-1&#x003b1; (120 kDa), produced in response to hypoxia, and the constitutively expressed HIF-1&#x003b1; (91 to 94 kDa) subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. HIF-1 protein accumulates and activates the transcription of genes that are of fundamental importance for oxygen homeostasis, including genes involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis, vasomotor control, apoptosis, proliferation and matrix production, under hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Articular cartilage is an avascular tissue lacking a capillary network, in which oxygen is limited due to its delivery via diffusion through the synovial fluid. It is well known that there is a physiological gradient of oxygenation within articular cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It has been reported that the partial pressure of O<sub>2 </sub>in synovial fluid in joints affected by osteoarthritis (OA) is between 40 and 85 mmHg, corresponding to an oxygen concentration of approximately 6 to 11% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Since O<sub>2 </sub>must enter from the cartilage surface, the concentration of oxygen is approximately 6% at the surface zone of the articular tissue and less than 1% in the deep zone. We histologically examined the oxygen gradation in articular cartilage tissue by immunofluorescence staining with a specific probe. We performed the analysis in human articular cartilage tissue in patients undergoing arthroplastic knee surgery. The levels of immunostaining revealed an O<sub>2 </sub>tension (approximately 3 to 8%) at the surface of the cartilage similar to that in positive control tumor tissues with already known O<sub>2 </sub>tension. There is a general consensus that articular chondrocytes are adapted to hypoxic conditions. Since HIF-1&#x003b1; expression is associated with low O<sub>2</sub>, this factor may play a role in chondrocyte survival and the maintenance of fundamental homeostasis in the normally hypoxic articular cartilage. In addition, degeneration of articular cartilage may directly influence the chondrocyte microenvironment, especially cellular adaptation to hypoxic conditions, in articular cartilage. Even a slight change may affect the adaptative hypoxic conditions of chondrocytes, resulting in alteration of the cellular microenvironment that is involved in the maintenance of articular cartilage. Indeed, more recently it has been demonstrated that HIF-1&#x003b1; is expressed in OA articular cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, the exact role of this factor in the pathogenesis of OA remains unclear.</p><p>We postulated that HIF-1&#x003b1; could play an important role as a survival factor protecting tissue against catabolic changes during the progression of OA. Our data show here for the first time a correlation between the levels of expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; and degeneration of articular cartilage in patients with OA. To clarify the role of HIF-1&#x003b1; in the pathogenesis of OA, we investigated whether or not hypoxia and catabolic factors (IL-1&#x003b2; and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) affected the expression of HIF-1&#x003b1;, energy generation, cartilage matrix production, and apoptosis in OA chondrocytes.</p><p>We also report evidence for the action of HIF-1&#x003b1; as a chondrocyte survival factor in OA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of human articular cartilage samples</title><p>Donor OA cartilage samples were obtained from knee joints of OA patients undergoing arthroplastic knee surgery (seven OA patients) after obtaining the patients' informed consent.

Schipani and colleagues reported that in HIF-1&#x003b1;-null mice, hypoxic chondrocytes showed massive cell death in cartilaginous elements such as the chondrosternal junction of the ribs and growth plate, suggesting that HIF-1&#x003b1; is not only crucial for survival of hypoxic chondrocytes, but also modulates the process of chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and growth arrest in growth-plate chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. More recently, Coimbra and colleagues also showed that HIF-1&#x003b1; is expressed in cultured cartilage and chondrocytes under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Their findings of HIF-1&#x003b1; expression in chondrocytes are basically consistent with our results from both human and rat OA cartilages.

Indeed, Coimbra and colleagues showed that HIF-1&#x003b1; was expressed not only in normal chondrocytes and cartilage but also in OA chondrocytes, under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions <italic>in vitro</italic>. In our present study, HIF-1&#x003b1; protein was undetected in chondrocytes under normoxic conditions. It is well known that cellular HIF-1&#x003b1; is not detected in normoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Under normoxic conditions, the HIF-1&#x003b1; protein undergoes ubiquitination and rapid degeneration in proteasomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Our data suggest that chondrocyte catabolic factors IL-1&#x003b2; and oxidative stress (oxidative free radicals) may induce the expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; in articular chondrocytes. IL-1 has been shown both to inhibit chondrocyte anabolic activity, including the down-regulation of proteoglycan synthesis, and to stimulate catabolic activity, including production of metalloproteinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. IL-1 also stimulates chondrocyte expression of inducible nitric oxide synthesis, iNOS, which results in an increase in NO production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Numerous reports have already demonstrated that oxidative stress acts as a catabolic factor in articular cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Articular chondrocytes actively produce endogenous reactive oxygen species, O<sub>2</sub><sup>- </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], <sup>-</sup>HO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). Oxidative damage in cartilage may affect chondrocyte function, resulting in changes in cartilage homeostasis that are relevant to cartilage aging and the development of OA. Our data indicated that in cultured chondrocytes, both mRNA and protein levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; were up-regulated by both IL-1&#x003b2; and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>under hypoxic but not normoxic conditions. These findings suggest that OA-related catabolic stresses (IL-1&#x003b2;, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) induce the expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; in the degenerated articular cartilages as degeneration progresses.</p><p>Interestingly, besides hypoxia, many cytokines and growth factors have been shown to be capable of stabilizing and activating HIF-1&#x003b1; under normoxic conditions. Stimulation of cultured synovial fibroblasts with IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1; increases levels of HIF-1&#x003b1; mRNA. Moreover, incubation with IL-1&#x003b2; leads to stabilization of HIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our results of catabolic stress-induced expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; in chondrocytes are consistent with these findings. These findings suggest that HIF-1&#x003b1; may, at least in part, have some role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis even under normoxic conditions, although further studies are needed to clarify this issue. Also, these findings, including our results, provide evidence to support the idea that OA-related catabolic factors (IL-1&#x003b2; etc.) induce HIF-1&#x003b1; during the progression of cartilage degeneration.</p><p>In this context, we also studied the signal transduction pathways involved in stress-induced HIF-1&#x003b1; expression in chondrocytes. It has been reported that p38 MAPK, PI3K, and ERK MAPK pathways are responsible for the stress-induced responses in a variety of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We found that both IL-1&#x003b2; and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>induced a prolonged activation of p38 in chondrocytes (data not shown). Under hypoxic conditions, the inhibitors of PI3K and p38 kinase caused a significant decrease in catabolic-factor-induced HIF-1&#x003b1; expression; this finding supports the idea that PI3K and p38 kinase, but not ERK, activation are required for catabolic stress-induced HIF-1&#x003b1; expression in chondrocytes in hypoxia. Local accumulation of a regulating protein to adapt to hypoxia may be mediated, at least in part, by p38 and PI3K in articular chondrocytes. In addition, we have focused on the redox factor 1 (Ref-1, also known as APE, HAP1, and APEX), a ubiquitous multifactorial protein that is a redox-sensitive regulator of mutifactorial transcription factors, including nuclear factor &#x003ba;B, c-myc gene, activating protein-1, and HIF-1&#x003b1;. Ref-1 may play a critical role in the regulation of endothelial cell fate in response to pathophysiological stimuli such as hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. We have studied the interactions between Ref-1 and HIF-1 activity in OA chondrocytes (data not shown).</p><p>Our <italic>in vitro </italic>data clearly indicate that expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; is responsible for the energy generation and cellular survival of hypoxic chondrocytes. We have shown that HIF-1&#x003b1; activity is essential for regulation of glycolysis, energy generation, synthesis of cartilage matrix proteins, and cell survival in OA chondrocytes under hypoxic conditions. HIF-1&#x003b1;-null chondrocytes did not maintain their viability; energy generation, and matrix production under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In addition, HIF-1&#x003b1;-null chondrocytes showed accelerated apoptosis induction by IL-1&#x003b2;, suggesting that HIF-1&#x003b1; has an important role in the survival of tissues that lack a functional vasculature, such as articular cartilage.</p><p>Articular cartilage adapts to hypoxic conditions, since the cartilage is an avascular tissue. Nutrition and oxygen for articular cartilage are supplied from the synovial fluid. Even a surface zone of articular cartilage has lower oxygen tension (approximately 6%) than synovial fluid (approximately 6 to 15%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. There is an oxidative gradient in articular cartilage. Oxygen homeostasis in normal articular cartilage is maintained under hypoxic conditions. During the progression of cartilage degeneration, OA-related catabolic stresses, mechanical and chemical, including IL-1&#x003b2; and oxidative stress, could induce the degradation of the extracellular matrix and decrease chondrocyte viability, resulting in the down-regulation of chondrocyte environment and the further degeneration of articular cartilage. The OA-related changes may also affect oxygen tension and the hypoxic conditions in articular cartilage. Breakdown of oxygen homeostasis in articular cartilage may influence the chondrocytes adapted to hypoxic conditions within the articular cartilage. Although further studies are needed to clarify the exact mechanism of HIF-1&#x003b1; expression, HIF-1&#x003b1; may be expressed in response to change of cellular microenvironment, especially O<sub>2 </sub>tension, in the tissue. Jewell and colleagues reported that HIF-1&#x003b1; was up-regulated by reoxygenation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Their findings suggest that expression of HIF-1&#x003b1; may be influenced by the cellular microenvironment. When there is deviation from the stable condition in terms of O<sub>2 </sub>tension, HIF-1&#x003b1; expression may be influenced to maintain the cellular homeostasis. Articular chondrocytes that are well adapted to hypoxia into the tissue may express HIF-1&#x003b1; with the deviating from adaptation to hypoxia. We postulated that HIF-1&#x003b1; is expressed in response to catabolic change in articular cartilage to maintain the cell viability and readaptation to hypoxia. Catabolic stress during the development of OA could influence the chondrocyte adaptation to hypoxia in the tissue.</p><p>Our findings of catabolic-factor-induced HIF-1&#x003b1; expression in chondrocytes provide evidence to support the idea that HIF-1&#x003b1; expression is up-regulated in response to catabolic degeneration of articular cartilage. Although genes under the control of HIF-1&#x003b1; have not yet been analyzed in OA, stress-induced HIF-1&#x003b1; may lead to the expression of anti-apoptotic factors or act as a chondroprotective factor to maintain chondrocyte viability in the face of catabolic changes in articular cartilage. Many molecular aspects of HIF-1 signaling should be also studied to further clarify the role of HIF-1 in the pathogenesis of OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our findings show for the first time that exposure to IL-1&#x003b2; and oxidative stress induce HIF-1&#x003b1; expression in degenerated articular cartilage, which is mediated, at least in part, by activation of PI3K and p38 kinase. Our data suggest a potential for HIF-1&#x003b1; in the maintenance of chondrocyte viability in articular cartilage challenged by progressive articular cartilage degeneration, and they provide new insights into pathogenesis of OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>DMEM = Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ERK = extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GAG = glycosaminoglycan; HIF-1&#x003b1; = hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1;; IL-1 = interleukin-1; MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase; MCL = medial collateral ligament; OA = osteoarthritis; ODN = oligonucleotide; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; PI3K = phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; TBST = Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20; TdT = terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase; Tris = tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KY carried out <italic>in vitro </italic>studies (cell culture), participated in the design of the study, conducted sequence alignment, and drafted the manuscript.

Statistical differences were calculated using data from four independent experiments. **<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01, control oligonucleotide group vs HIF-1&#x003b1;-antisense group.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ar1765-6"></graphic></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of patients with osteoarthritis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="center" colspan="2">Mankin grade</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Donor</td><td align="center">Age (y)</td><td align="left">Sex</td><td align="center">Disease duration (y)</td><td align="center">Intact region</td><td align="center">Degenerated region</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">1</td><td align="center">61</td><td align="left">Female</td><td align="center">5.5</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">7</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="center">62</td><td align="left">Female</td><td align="center">6.0</td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">9</td></tr><tr><td align="left">3</td><td align="center">64</td><td align="left">Male</td><td align="center">8.4</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left">4</td><td align="center">66</td><td align="left">Female</td><td align="center">11.5</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">9</td></tr><tr><td align="left">5</td><td align="center">67</td><td align="left">Female</td><td align="center">9.6</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">9</td></tr><tr><td align="left">6</td><td align="center">68</td><td align="left">Female</td><td align="center">8.4</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left">7</td><td align="center">72</td><td align="left">Female</td><td align="center">9.0</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">9</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Sequences of PCR primers and probes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left">Primer (5'-3')</td><td align="left">Probe</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">c-Jun</td><td align="left">fw: TGCATGCTATCATTGGCTCATAC</td><td align="left">CCCGGCAACACACA-MGB</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">rv: CACACCATCTTCTGGTGTACAGTCT</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">HIF-1&#x003b1;</td><td align="left">fw:CTATGGAGGCCAGAAGAGGGTAT</td><td align="left">AGATCCCTTGAAGCTAG-MGB</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">rv:CCCACATCAGGTGGCTCATAA</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Glucose transporter-1</td><td align="left">fw:GGGCATGTGCTTCCAGTATGT</td><td align="left">CAACTGTGCGGCCCCTACGTCTTC</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">rv:ACGAGGAGCACCGTGAAGAT</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>fw, forward; rv, reverse</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></back></article>
