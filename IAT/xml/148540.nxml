As such, Fmu represents the first protein identified as an S -adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)- dependent RNA m(5)C methyltransferase whose amino acid sequence is known. Using the amino acid sequence of Fmu as an initial probe in an iterative search of completed DNA sequence databases, 27 homologous ORF products were identified as probable RNA m(5)C methyltransferases. Further analysis of sequences in undeposited genomic sequencing data and EST databases yielded more than 30 additional homologs. These putative RNA m(5)C methyltransferases are grouped into eight subfamilies, some of which are predicted to consist of direct genetic counterparts, or orthologs. The enzymes proposed to be RNA m(5)C methyltransferases have sequence motifs closely related to signature sequences found in the well-studied DNA m(5)C methyltransferases and other AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases. Structure-function correlates in the known AdoMet methyltransferases support the assignment of this family as RNA m(5)C methyltransferases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
