The surface molecule CD152 (CTLA-4) is mostly considered as a negative regulator of T cell activation during immune responses. It is currently unknown whether CD152 can also influence chemokine-driven T cell migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We analyzed the consequences of CD152 signaling on Th cell migration using chemotaxis assays <italic>in vitro</italic> and radioactive cell tracking <italic>in vivo</italic>. We show here that the genetic and serological inactivation of CD152 in Th1 cells reduced migration towards CCL4, CXCL12 and CCL19, but not CXCL9, in a G-protein dependent manner. In addition, retroviral transduction of CD152 cDNA into CD152 negative cells restored Th1 cell migration. Crosslinking of CD152 together with CD3 and CD28 stimulation on activated Th1 cells increased expression of the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR7, which in turn enhanced cell migration. Using sensitive liposome technology, we show that mature dendritic cells but not activated B cells were potent at inducing surface CD152 expression and the CD152-mediated migration-enhancing signals. Importantly, migration of CD152 positive Th1 lymphocytes in <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments increased more than 200&#x00025; as compared to CD152 negative counterparts showing that indeed CD152 orchestrates specific migration of selected Th1 cells to sites of inflammation and antigenic challenge <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We show here, that CD152 signaling does not just silence cells, but selects individual ones for migration. This novel activity of CD152 adds to the already significant role of CD152 in controlling peripheral immune responses by allowing T cells to localize correctly during infection. It also suggests that interference with CD152 signaling provides a tool for altering the cellular composition at sites of inflammation and antigenic challenge.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The positioning of differentiated effector/memory T cells within tissues is important for the adaptive immune responses to ensure protection against reinfection. Chemokines and their receptors are essential for homing of antigen-experienced T cells to lymphoid and non-lymphoid destinations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Campbell1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Hamann1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The signals responsible for the chemokine-directed migration of certain T cell subsets remain poorly characterized.</p><p>Following initial activation, na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells can differentiate into Th1 cells that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1;, and induce cell-mediated immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Szabo1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Th1 responses are critical for the eradication of intracellular pathogens such as <italic>Leishmania major</italic> and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>. However, Th1 responses also drive chronic inflammation and tissue destruction in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, Crohn's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Olsson1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Powrie1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the requirement for trafficking of effector T cells to diverse tissue sites in the body, it seems likely that there is substantial heterogeneity in the migratory capacity of Th cell subsets.</p><p>CD28 and CD152 are the primary co-receptors on T cells that mediate positive and negative costimulation using the same ligands on APCs, CD80 and CD86. Triggering of CD28 strongly up-regulates IL-2 production and T cell proliferation, which is counter-regulated by CD152-mediated inhibition of IL-2 transcription and cell cycle progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Brunner2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. CD152 does not only oppose CD28-mediated effects, but can also synergize with it, <italic>e.g.</italic> by enhancing resistance to apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Kirchhoff1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Hoff1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the role of CD152 is more complex than its traditional view as a major down-regulator of immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Brunner2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Chambers1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Egen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. CD152 is inducible after stimulation of T cells and reaches maximal surface levels 48 h after T cell stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Maszyna1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, when maximal CD152 function is observed. The regulation of CD152 surface expression represents a major control point for its function because only cell surface expressed CD152 is functional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Pandiyan1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Maszyna1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, and only a restricted number of activated T cells can express CD152. CD152 is transported from intracellular vesicles to the cell membrane where it is expressed in a polarized manner at the immunological synapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Linsley1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The surface expression is mainly induced by TCR signaling strength, but can be enhanced by soluble factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Egen2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Gimsa1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Costimulation is an important control point to ensure that professional APCs define initiation, differentiation, and persistence of T cell responses. It has recently been proposed that tissue specific APCs direct and reprogram T cell migration into specific tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Dudda1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Mora1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the central role of costimulation in differentiation and function of T cells, we postulate that costimulatory molecules participate in the localization of adaptive immune responses by licensing T lymphocytes for chemotaxis. In the present study, we investigated the functional role of CD152 in migration of Th1 cells. We show that CD152 surface expression is induced in Th1 cells stimulated primarily by mature DCs when compared with other APCs. Surprisingly, CD152 engagement induced activated Th1 cell migration towards CXCL12, CCL19, and CCL4, the ligands for CXCR4, CCR7, and CCR5, respectively, whereas inhibition of CD152 abrogated migration. Importantly, CXCR4 and CCR5 and their ligands are associated with inflammatory diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Murdoch1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Mackay1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> and CCL19 as well as CXCL12 are also important for lymphocyte homing to lymph nodes and Peyer's patches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Stein1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Warnock1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, we show that CD152-mediated signals endow effector T cells with the capacity to migrate to sites of inflammation and lymph nodes. This novel function of CD152 could explain the retention and directed migration of effector cells to secondary lymphoid organs and sites of antigenic-challenge and might be important for T cell homeostasis as well as Th1-dominated diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Serological and genetic inactivation of CD152 reduces chemotaxis of Th1 cells to CXCL12 and CCL4</title><p>To examine the role of CD152 in T cell migration, we stimulated CD152-deficient (CD152<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) monoclonal OVA-specific TCR<sup>tg</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from OTII mice (TCR<sup>tg</sup>CD152<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) and monoclonal OVA-specific TCR<sup>tg</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from CD152<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> OTII mice (TCR<sup>tg</sup>CD152<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>) with cognate antigen <italic>in vitro</italic> and tested chemotaxis to the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12, the CCR7 ligand CCL19, and the CCR5 ligand CCL4 in a Transwell chemotaxis assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, and data not shown).

In contrast, for the mainly homeostatic chemokines CXCL12 and CCL19, no significant difference in migration was observed when comparing monoclonal CD4 cells from TCR<sup>tg</sup>CD152<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and TCR<sup>tg</sup>CD152<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>CD152 functions are more pronounced upon activation of antigen-experienced T cells than upon primary stimulation of na&#x000ef;ve T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Chambers2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we inactivated CD152 on antigen-experienced Th1 cells by adding neutralizing anti-CD152 Fab fragments to Th1 cells during primary stimulation and recall response, and monitored migration on day 6 of recall response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Polarization of primary Th1 cells resulted in &#x0003e;98&#x00025; pure effector populations, as confirmed by a CD44<sup>high</sup> IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> IL-4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> phenotype (data not shown). Following recall responses of antigen-experienced Th1 cells, cells that received a CD152 signal migrated two-fold better towards CCL4 than Th1 cells that were activated under a serological blockade of CD152 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Similarly, blockade of CD152 by the addition of anti-CD152 Fab fragments also resulted in reduced frequencies of cells migrating towards CXCL12. To substantiate a role for CD152 in mediating the migratory capacity of antigen-experienced T lymphocytes, we used T cells from CD152<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and CD152<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice. On day 4 after a polyclonally induced recall response of splenocytes with anti-CD3 and APCs, substantially more CD152<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> T cells migrated compared with CD152<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>): wild-type cells migrated three- and two-times better than CD152<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>cells toward CCL4 and CXCL12, respectively. Intriguingly, using 10 &#x000b5;g/ml instead of 1 &#x000b5;g/ml OVA during stimulation enhanced the migration for TCR<sup>tg</sup> CD152<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> T cells by 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). In contrast, CD152<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells did not migrate significantly better with higher peptide concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Thus, the enhanced migration of CD152<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> T cells towards CCL4 and CXCL12 was dependent on the concentration of antigen during TCR stimulation (duration and strength of signal). Interestingly, this chemotaxis enhancing property was specific to CCL4 and CXCL12, because no difference in migration towards CXCL9 occurred, even when high OVA concentrations were used for stimulation. Migration towards CCL19 was slightly enhanced by altering the signaling strength during stimulation, when Th1 cells received a CD152 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Most strikingly, CD152<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> but not CD152<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> antigen-experienced Th1 cells migrated to the homeostatic chemokine CCL19.</p><p>In summary, the presence of functional CD152 enhanced the chemotaxis of T cells, especially that of repeatedly activated Th1 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>CD152 enhances chemokine-driven transendothelial migration</title><p>Recruitment of lymphocytes to the site of infection involves a sequential, multi-step process leading to the active <italic>transmigration</italic> of lymphocytes across the blood vasculature endothelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Schenkel1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

To monitor CD152-mediated effects on T cell migration, a recall response of Th1 cells was induced for 48 h with congenic APCs and OVA. Additionally, antibody-coupled microspheres were used to cross-link CD152 in combination with CD3 and CD28 coligation. The stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coupled microspheres allowed for direct crosslinking of CD152 and also kept the CD28-signal constant in all populations. On day 3 of activation, migration of activated CD152-engaged Th1 cells towards CXCL12 and CCL19 was considerably enhanced compared with Th1 cells engaged only with CD3 and CD28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Strikingly, 4-times more Th1 cells migrated towards CCL4 after stimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28/anti-CD152 compared with anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated T cells. Thus, CD152 engagement in concordance with CD3 and CD28 of Th1 cells triggered chemokine responsiveness in the absence of additional signals provided by APCs.</p><p>To confirm that enhanced migration of Th1 cells is regulated by CD152 and is not merely the result of an early differentiation event, we retrovirally transduced CD152<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells during <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with the cDNA of full length CD152 (pMSCV-CD152).

Thus, CD152 expression mediates enhanced migration even in highly activated T cells and the detected lack of migration of CD152<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells is due to their lack of CD152 and not to developmental alterations.</p><p>Next, we determined whether the CD152-controlled migration towards the inflammatory chemokine CCL4 and the homoeostatic chemokine CCL19 reflects heterogeneity of the T cell population.

B cells and DCs stimulated T cells equally well as determined by the induction of similar T cell proliferation rates of 85&#x02013;86&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) on day 3 after onset of stimulation. Specific surface expression of CD152 was detected with low frequencies on day 1 in primary T cell cultures activated with either activated B cells or DCs. Following primary stimulation, CD152 expression increased and peaked after 48 h. Thereafter, the percentage of surface CD152-expressing cells declined in both cultures and these cells were infrequent (&#x0003c;3&#x00025;) after 3 days of stimulation. At the peak of surface CD152 expression, T cell populations stimulated by DCs displayed enhanced expression of surface CD152.

The number of surface CD152-expressing cells could not be attributed to contaminating Th2 cells, as no IL-4 producers were present in the cultures (data not shown).

In contrast, the sensitive liposome-based staining technique used in this study allowed the detection of as few as 100 to 200 surface molecules per cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Scheffold2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Using this method, we showed that the type of activating APC determines the frequency of surface CD152 expressing T cells. Interestingly, mature DCs, but not activated B cells, were potent in up-regulating surface CD152 on T cells. The fact that differentially activated (i.e. DC vs. activated B cell) T cells differentially express CD152 during an immune response raised the possibility that surface CD152<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and surface CD152<sup>no/low</sup> T cells could also be heterogeneous in their migratory potentials. Indeed, many more DC-activated T cells expressed surface CD152 and were able to chemotax than were B-cell activated T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, different classes of APC induce distinct T cell migration patterns via the differential induction of CD152 on T cells.</p><p>CD152 and CD28 share common B7 ligands. However, B7 expression is not limiting on APCs during an optimal immune response, enabling saturated engagement of both CD28 and CD152 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Chambers1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, making a simple competition of CD152 over CD28 unlikely and dispensable in our experiments. Additionally, there is accumulating evidence that CD152 directly modulates proximal TCR signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-BrunnerWeinzierl1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore unlikely that enhanced CD28 signaling occurs during serological or genetic blockade of CD152. Therefore, we conclude that CD152-enhanced migration of Th cells is not simply a result of impaired CD28 signaling.</p><p>Most studies showed that CD152 signaling down-regulates expression of molecules and, ultimately, the function of T cells. In addition, CD152 signaling can up-regulate the expression and activation of molecules such as TGF&#x003b2;, Bcl-2, pFKHRL1, LFA1, and PI3'K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Pandiyan1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Schneider1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Schneider2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Functionally, this means that cells expressing CD152 on the cell surface and receiving a CD152 signal are resistant against activation-induced cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Pandiyan1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, CD152 signals in activated T cells lead to reduced adhesion and increased motility that result in shortened T cell-APC interactions within lymph nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-BrunnerWeinzierl1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Schneider3">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. This finding was interpreted as a mechanism to down-regulate the immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Mustelin1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, our data add an important new piece to the puzzle by showing that CD152 signals license T cells for chemotaxis and migration into lymph nodes and inflammatory sites. In conclusion, CD152-signaling does not simply silence T cells, but rather enables them to actively contribute to the immune response by enhancing effector T cell migration <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We have now demonstrated that CD152 signaling enhances the cell surface expression of CCR5 and CCR7 on T cells. It is likely that up-regulation of CCR5 and CCR7 supports the CD152-mediated enhanced migration towards of the cognate ligands CCL4 and CCL19, respectively. However, this may not be the only mechanism. For example, we were not able to detect CXCR4 up-regulation in response to CD152 signaling, even though we detected enhanced migration to its ligand CXCL12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g001">Fig. 1A&#x02013;E</xref>). Chemotaxis is not always accompanied by enhanced chemokine receptor expression on leukocytes because factors that influence chemokine receptor signaling additionally control the migratory capacity in response to chemokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Bleul1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Thelen1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, CD152 could regulate T cell chemotaxis alternatively or additionally to the induction of chemokine receptors on T cells by controlling downstream signaling events.</p><p>Our study is the first report demonstrating that CD152 ligation as well as genetic or serological ablation of CD152 signaling affects chemotaxis of primary T cells. At first view, our data seems to be inconsistent with the observation that CD152<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice show dramatic lymphocyte infiltration of tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Chambers1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Schenkel1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Waterhouse1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Marengere1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in these studies a massive expansion of activated lymphocytes is seen; and the cells might just overflow throughout the body in shortage of space. Therefore, it is likely that lymphocytic infiltration of tissues is not only a consequence of directed migration. Alternatively, migration of the expanded cell populations into tissues might be fairly random, but as CD152<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells express CCR7 only at low frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), and CCR7 expression has been shown recently to be a prerequisite for T cells to exit extralymphoid tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Debes1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Bromley1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, they could be retained in peripheral tissues.</p><p>In this study, we have shown that enhanced avidity of the TCR determines migration of CD152<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> T cells along chemokine gradients. This suggests that cells receiving the most optimal signals during stimulation show enhanced CD152 expression and are licensed to migrate. These data are consistent with work of Allison and colleagues, showing that T cells receiving a strong signal up-regulate CD152 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Egen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Egen2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our results demonstrate that CD152 expressing T cells are not silenced by CD152-signaling but, on the contrary, are directed for migration, thereby driving and preserving the immune response.</p><p>Taking into account that CD152 induces resistance against activation-induced cell death, together with our new results that CD152 enhances chemotaxis of already activated, effector-cytokine producing T cells, we hypothesize that CD152 surface expression and signaling marks the &#x0201c;fittest&#x0201d; T cells out of a heterogeneous population of stimulated T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Gett1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Depending on the environment, the CD152-marked cells would home to secondary lymphatic organs or to the site of inflammation, probably depending on the stimulation history and the quality of the chemotactic gradient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Foxman1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. These cells will be allowed, via CD152 signaling to drive the immune response to fight pathogens immediately and to drive progressive T cell differentiation of T<sub>CM</sub> cells. Thus, CD152 might actively determine the fate of an effector T cell.</p><p>Importantly, consistent with our data showing that CD152 up-regulates expression and function of CCR7, a receptor crucial for entry of resting T cells and Th1 cells from the bloodstream into lymph nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Stein1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Warnock1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Debes2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, we found that migration of T cells into lymph nodes was enhanced by CD152 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). Moreover, we found that CD152 signals promoted accumulation of Th1 cells at a site of cutaneous inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>), which was most likely the consequence of the CD152-enhanced responsiveness to CCL4 and CXCL12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005702-g002">2</xref>) as both ligands are widely associated with inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Murdoch1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005702-Mackay1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Consequently, it is possible that CD152-regulated CCR7 expression contributes to effector T cell migration into both lymphoid organs and inflamed tissues.</p><p>Our data suggest that upon activation, T cells will not migrate efficiently into lymph nodes and inflamed tissues unless they up-regulate surface CD152. The migratory properties of the cell population are important to mount an adaptive immune response in the periphery. Thus, CD152 might be one master switch to determine that lymphocytes are in the right time at the right place.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>Transgenic (tg) mice for OVA-specific TCR<sup>tg/tg</sup> on BALB/c background (Do11.10, gift from Dennis Y.
