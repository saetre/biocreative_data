To date, the molecular role of HBsAg in HCC development has not been fully studied. We have previously reported that in cell cultures, HBsAg up-regulated the expression of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF-1), a key component of the <italic>Wnt </italic>pathway.

The distribution of cellular LEF-1 in peritumor tissues was predominantly in the cytoplasm; while LEF-1 in the tumor tissues was located either exclusively in the nucleus or both in the nucleus and cytoplasm.

It is estimated that around 350 million people are carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Persistent HBV infection leads to chronic hepatitis, and is closely associated with the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Three forms of viral particles can be detected in the serum of HBV infected patients, namely, 42 nm diameter mature virion particles, 22 nm diameter spherical particles and 22 nm diameter filamentous particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Uniquely, 22 nm subviral particles, which are composed of HBsAg and do not contain viral DNA, usually outnumber the virions in patient serum by a factor of 1000-fold or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Though HBsAg has been identified as the neutralizing antigen of HBV and has been used as the major component of preventive vaccine for viral hepatitis B, persistence of HBsAg in serum of patients has been recognized as a high risk factor for development of HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The possible roles of HBV envelope proteins LHBs (Pre-S1/Pre-S2/S) and MHBs (Pre-S2/S) in HCC development have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, the role of major HBsAg in tumorigenesis has not been studied in detail.</p><p>By microarray study of cells transfected with the S gene coding for HBsAg, we have previously shown that marked up-regulation of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF-1), a transcriptional factor in <italic>Wnt </italic>pathway, was closely correlated with HBsAg expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the expression level and cellular distribution of LEF-1 protein, mainly the dominant negative truncated isoform, was changed by the expression of HBsAg. In this study, we aimed to investigate the roles played by HBsAg on LEF-1 expression in the development of HBV-associated HCC. By immunohistochemical analysis and molecular studies, the intracellular expression and distribution of LEF-1 and HBsAg, <italic>cyclin D1 </italic>and <italic>c-myc </italic>gene expression were compared between HBsAg positive and negative HCC tissues, peritumor tissues and normal liver tissues. The possible roles of HBsAg in HCC development are discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Human liver tissues</title><p>Thirty surgical resected HCC tissues from different individuals were provided by Shanghai Cancer Institute. Tissue samples were categorized as tumorous (T) or matched adjacent peritumorous liver tissues (pT) by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained sections under the microscope. The size and regions of the resection of the tumorous and peritumorous tissues were decided by the surgeons based on each individual case under the regulation of the ethics committee. All these HCCs were associated with HBV infection as defined by serum HBsAg positive.

Immunohistochemical staining was carried out on tissue sections by using anti-LEF-1 polyclonal rabbit antibody (1:50, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or anti-HBsAg monoclonal antibody (1:50, Changdao Biotech, Shanghai, China) to detect the expression of LEF-1 and HBsAg respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcription and real-time PCR</title><p>After treated with 10 U DNase I (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min, 2 &#x003bc;g total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carisbad CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out using specific primer pairs designed by PrimerBank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. For real-time PCR, 2 &#x003bc;l of 10-fold dilutions of the cDNA products were assayed using the Premix Ex Taq Perfect Real Time PCR kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). To assess the association of HBsAg and LEF-1 isoforms in HCC tissues, two pairs of primers were designed to detect different LEF-1 isoforms. Primers LP1 and LP2 were designed to target the &#x003b2;-catenin binding domain, which could differentiate the 38 kDa truncated LEF-1 isoform from the 55 kDa full-length LEF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Another pair of primers LP3 and LP4 was targeted to the 3' UTR region of LEF-1 mRNA, and thus could detect both the full length and the isoforms.

Our results on the molecular expression levels among 30 HCC tissue and 9 normal liver tissues showed that HBsAg up-regulated not only LEF-1 but also the two of LEF-1 downstream genes expression levels. These finding provided evidence that HBsAg affected the <italic>Wnt </italic>pathway via up-regulation of LEF-1.</p><p>In this study, though all 30 HCC samples were collected from serum HBsAg positive patients, only 13 liver tissues were HBsAg positive by immunohistochemical staining. Since the expression pattern of LEF-1 was not significnatly changed in HBsAg negative HCC tissues, to reveal the roles of HBsAg on HCC development, we concentrated on these 13 pairs of HBsAg positive samples. Specifically, the expression levels of HBsAg, LEF-1, <italic>cyclin D1 </italic>and <italic>c-myc </italic>were studied in tumor cells and peritumor cells from the same patient. LEF-1 expression levels were found associated with the levels of HBsAg expression in HCC tissues. Interestingly, the intracellular distribution of LEF-1 protein in tumor cells was different from that in peritumor cells. In the peritumor cells LEF-1 was predominantly located in the cytoplasm, while in the tumor cells LEF-1 was located exclusively in the nucleus or both in the nucleus and cytoplasm. This observation is in accordance with a recent report stating that LEF-1/TCF was up-regulated in 52% of HCCs by strong nuclear LEF-1/TCF staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. As we have previously observed that expression of HBsAg initiated transfer of LEF-1 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, in this study, we further identified that the transfer of LEF-1 into the nucleus also occurred in tumor cells. The different distribution of LEF-1 in tumor cells and peritumor cells suggests that different mechanisms could be involved in the pre-malignant stage and the malignant stage in HBV associated HCC.</p><p>Our previous study showed that the 38 kDa truncated isoform of LEF-1 was markedly induced in HBsAg expressing cells, while full-length LEF-1 did not show a significant change.

To further investigate the expression of LEF-1 isoforms in HCCs, quantitative real-time PCR was employed to analyze the expression patterns of LEF-1 isoforms in 30 pairs of HCC tissues in tumor cells and peritumor cells. Compared to those in normal liver tissues, though both isoforms were significantly up-regulated in HCC, the 38 kDa truncated isoform of LEF-1 was more significantly up-regulated in tumor cells, than that in peritumor cells especially in those 13 HBsAg positive HCC tissues. The 55 kDa full-length LEF-1 showed no changes between tumor cells and peritumor cells. This observation further suggested that the molecular signaling cascades could have been changed between peritumor cells and tumor cells.</p><p>To further confirm the association of LEF-1 and HBsAg, expression pattern of LEF-1 in 13 HBsAg positive HCC tissues was analyzed and compared to that in 17 HBsAg negative HCC tissues. The expression of LEF-1 was found closely associated with the HBsAg expression in HBsAg positive HCC tissues. However no significant differences were observed either in LEF-1 protein or LEF-1 isoforms when compared between tumor cells and peritumor cells in these HBsAg negative tissues. The different expression patterns of LEF-1 between HBsAg positive and negative HCC tissues suggested that HBsAg could play important roles in regulating <italic>Wnt </italic>signaling pathway, thus providing new insights into the involvement of HBsAg in hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms of HBsAg-LEF-1 interaction and their roles in the development of HCC merit further investigation. Other viral or cellular factors might also be involved in the interaction between HBV and <italic>Wnt </italic>pathway. For instance, HBx has been reported to be essential for the activation of Wnt/b-catenin signalling in hepatoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and reduced the phosphorylation level of b-catenin by suppressing GSK-3b function through the Erk pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p><italic>Cyclin D1 </italic>and <italic>c-myc </italic>are key regulatory genes in the control of cell cycle and cell proliferation, and thus are the best-known candidates among the LEF-1 regulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Over-expression of <italic>cyclin D1 </italic>ranged from 5.6% to 54% of HCCs and was associated with advanced clinicopathological stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Up-regulation of <italic>c-myc </italic>gene was reported by Kawate et al in 33% of HCCs by differential PCR analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, to date, the roles of <italic>cyclin D1 </italic>and <italic>c-myc </italic>in HCCs are still not well defined. In this study, expression of <italic>cyclin D1 </italic>and <italic>c-myc </italic>was markedly increased in HCC tissues, compared with normal liver tissues but the expression levels of these two genes were higher in peritumor cells than that of tumor cells. This could partly be attributed to the over-expression of 38 kDa dominant negative LEF-1 isoform in tumor cells. Up-regulation of 38 kDa dominant negative isoform of LEF-1 in tumor cells could suppress rather than activate the <italic>Wnt </italic>pathway. Therefore the downstream target genes, <italic>cyclin D1 </italic>and <italic>c-myc</italic>, were induced at a lower level in the tumor cells, compared to that of peritumor cells. However the complexity of <italic>cyclin D1 </italic>and <italic>c-myc </italic>in HBV-associated HCC tissues should be considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, as there was higher expression of HBsAg in peritumor cells and higher up-regulation of LEF-1 in the cytoplasm of cells, as well as higher up-regulation of <italic>cyclin D1 </italic>and <italic>c-my</italic>, it is predicted that HBsAg exerted pronounced effects on LEF-1 and its downstream genes in hepatocytes, resulting in more active cell proliferation, which could promote or enhance malignant transformation of hepatocytes by other viral or cellular mechanisms. It is postulated that HBsAg interacted with liver cells only at the pre-malignant stage, and thus plays the role of an initiator during the process of HCC development.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>XT carried out molecular studies, collected and analyzed the data, performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
