The change from uterine quiescence to enhanced contractile activity may be associated with the spatial and temporal expression of BKCa within myometrium. The objectives of this study were to examine the expression of BKCa alpha- and beta-subunit in upper segment (US) and lower segment (LS) regions of uterus, and to investigate for the possibly differential expression of these proteins in US and LS myometrium obtained from three functional states: (1) non-pregnant (NP); (2) term pregnant not in labour (TNL) and (3) term pregnant in labour (TL).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Myometrial biopsies were collected from non-pregnant women at hysterectomy and pregnant women at either elective caesarean section or emergency caesarean section. Protein expression level and cellular localization of BKCa alpha- and beta-subunit in US and LS myometrium were determined by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>BK<sub>Ca </sub>alpha- and beta-subunit were predominantly localized to myometrial smooth muscle in both US and LS myometrium obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant patients. The level of BKCa alpha-subunit in US but not in LS was significantly higher in NP myometrium than those measured in myometrium obtained during pregnancy. Lower expression of BKCa alpha-subunit in both US and LS was found in TL than in TNL biopsies. Expression of beta-subunit in both US and LS myometrium was significantly reduced in TL group compared with those measured in TNL group. There was no significant difference in BKCa beta-subunit expression in either US or LS between NP and TNL group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that expression of BKCa alpha- and beta-subunit in pregnant myometrium is reduced during labour, which is consistent with the myometrial activity at the onset of parturition.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>During most of pregnancy, myometrium activity is characterized by poorly coordinated contractures. In late pregnancy, the uterus undergoes preparedness for the stimuli that lead to contractility and labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The mechanisms that initiate labour in women, particularly the molecular processes that convert the myometrium form a state of relative quiescence to the activated and contractile state, are not well understood. An understanding of these processes, at the molecular and cellular level, is essential to developing novel therapeutic strategies for management of associated clinical problems such as preterm labour that accounts for 85% of all perinatal complications and death.</p><p>It has been known that uterine myometrial contractility at term is triggered by a number of physiological signals, which orchestrate changes in uterine excitability via ion-channel modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Potassium channels are central to regulation of cell membrane potential and contractility of smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Among the diverse families of K<sup>+ </sup>channels, the large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BK<sub>Ca</sub>) is the predominant K<sup>+</sup>-channel type expressed in human myometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This channel is activated by membrane depolarization and also by an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration, thereby playing a pivotal role in the modulation of uterine contractility and myometrial calcium homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated changes in BK<sub>Ca </sub>activity during pregnancy. It was reported by Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] that the contribution of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels to the total outward K<sup>+ </sup>currents was reduced by about 10% in pregnant myocyte near term compared with non-pregnant myocyte. Khan and colleagues had shown that the sensitivity of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and voltage of this channel in human pregnant myometrium was lost at the time of labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A number of studies suggested altered BK<sub>Ca </sub>expression in myometrium during pregnancy and parturition. Song et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] worked on rat and found that BK<sub>Ca </sub>is decreased by 60% in the myometrium of pregnant rats at the end of pregnancy. Benkusky and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] reported that BK<sub>Ca </sub>in mouse myometrium is increased during pregnancy and diminished in post-partum. Studies by Khan's group demonstrated BK<sub>Ca </sub>expression in lower segment of human term myometrium and found it is decreased in labour onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>It has been implicated that there is a functional regionalization in the myometrium during pregnancy and labour. The upper segment (US) region of the uterus expands to accommodate the growing fetus and then at labour contract to cause expulsion of the fetus, while the lower segment (LS) may maintain a relative quiescence to allow passage of the fetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Current data about BK<sub>Ca </sub>expression in human myometrium during pregnancy are restricted to the LS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. There is no information concerning the expression of BK<sub>Ca </sub>in the different region of uterus during pregnancy and labour that would support its role in the regulation of uterus contractions.</p><p>The objectives of the present study were to determine the regional distribution of the BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel in human non-pregnant and term myometrium before and during parturition. Protein levels of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel were also examined by Western blotting to establish whether the expression of these proteins is changed in pregnancy and labour.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue Collection</title><p>Paired upper and lower uterine segmental myometrial tissues from pregnant and non-pregnant women were collected in Navy General Hospital, the teaching hospital of Second Military Medical University, Beijing, China. Approval of this study was granted by human ethic committee of Navy General Hospital as well as human ethic committee of Second Military Medical University. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant.</p><p>Non-pregnant myometrium tissues were obtained from premenopausal, normal, cycling women (mean age 41 &#x000b1; 4.3 yr, n = 8) undergoing hysterectomy for fibroids. Pregnant myometrial biopsies were collected at cesarean section form the following groups of pregnant women (37&#x02013;42 wk): term no labour (mean age, 25 &#x000b1; 2.2 yr, mean gestational age,39 &#x000b1; 1.7 weeks, n = 10) and term labour (mean age 26 &#x000b1; 2.3 yr, mean gestational age, 39 &#x000b1; 1.6 weeks n = 10). Labour was defined as regular contractions (&#x0003c;5 min apart) plus membrane rupture and cervical dilation (&#x0003e;3 cm) with no augmentation (oxytocin or PG administration). Indications for cesarean section included breech presentation, placenta previa, previous cesarean section, cephalopelvic disproportion, failure of labour to progress, fetal distress, or maternal request. None of the women included in this study had evidence of underlying disease (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, etc.). LS uterine samples were collected from the upper margin of the LS uterine incision, while US uterine samples were taken from just below fundus. Because there is no LS in non-pregnant uterus, tissues taken from the isthmus of non-pregnant uterus were treated to be equivalent to the LS of pregnant uterus. All non-pregnant tissues were taken from the normal part of uterus without fibrosis contamination. Collected samples were placed in phosphate-buffered saline on ice and transported to the laboratory. For Western blot analysis, tissues were then frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. For immunohistochemical analysis, the biopsies were placed in 10% phosphate buffered formalin.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunohistochemical investigations were performed with the Histostain-SP kit (Zymed, San Franscisco, CA), which uses a biotinylated second antibody, a horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin conjugate, and a substrate-chormogen mixture to demonstrate antigen in the tissue. The specific antibodies, anti-&#x003b1;<sub>1184&#x02013;1200 </sub>and anti-&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;191</sub>, were purchased from Alomone Labs (Alomone Labs Ltd. Jerusalem, Israel) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. The anti-&#x003b1;<sub>1184&#x02013;1200 </sub>antibody recognizes amino acid residues 1184&#x02013;1200 at the C terminus of the &#x003b1;-subunit. Anti-&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;191 </sub>antibody recognizes full length residues of &#x003b2;-subunit. Paraffin sections (5 &#x003bc;m) were cut, rehydrated and microwaved in citric acid buffer to retrieve antigens. After inhibition of endogenous peroxidases with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, unspecific antibody binding was blocked with 10% rabbit serum for 30 min. The tissue sections were then incubated with specific antibody against BK<sub>Ca </sub>&#x003b1;- or &#x003b2;-subunit (1:500). The bound antibodies were detected with the biotin-streptavidin-peroxidase system (UltraSensitive-SP-kit, MaiXin Biotechnology, Fuzhou, China) using diaminobenzidine (Sigma) as chromogen. Counterstaining was performed with hemalum. Negative controls were performed by substituting primary antibody with a normal serum in same dilution. To confirm the specificity of primary antibody, preabsorption of the primary antibody with a ten-fold excess of the blocking peptides was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Approximately 70 mg of human myometrial tissue was homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 60 mM Tris-HCl, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10% sucrose, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 &#x003bc;g/ml aprotinin (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany). Lysates were then quickly ultrasonicated in ice bath, boiled 5 min at 95 C, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until used. Protein concentrations were measured using a modified Bradford assay and samples were diluted in sample buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), containing 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2% &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, and 0.002% bromophenol blue) and boiled for a further 5 min. Samples were separated on an SDS-8% polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose filter at 300 mA for 1.5 h in a transfer buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 150 mM glycine, and 20% methanol. The filter was then blocked in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20(TBST) and 5% dried milk powder (wt/vol) for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBST, the nitrocellulose filters were incubated with primary antibody for BK<sub>Ca </sub>&#x003b1;- or &#x003b2;-subunit (1:500) at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. After another three washes with TBST, the filters were incubated with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature and further washed for 30 min with TBST. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Santa Cruz). The light-emitting bands were detected with X-ray film. The resulting band intensities were quantitated using an image scanning densitometer (Furi Technology, Shanghai, China). To control sampling errors, the ratio of band intensities to &#x003b2;-actin was obtained to quantify the relative protein expression level.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Protein levels of BK<sub>Ca&#x003b1; </sub>&#x02013; and &#x003b2;-subunit were determined by densitometric analysis (Furi Technology, Shanghai, China).

For instance, Havelock et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] showed that S100A9 mRNA was up-regulated in both US and LS during labour. Our results indicate that the similar expression pattern of BK<sub>Ca </sub>in US and LS is occurred with the onset of labour. Together, it suggests that the contractile activity of US or LS region is not likely to be determined by a single specific protein but rather by a combination of all CAPs.</p><p>The smooth muscle BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel is formed by tetrameric assembly of an &#x003b1; subunit and an accessory &#x003b2;-subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The &#x003b1;-subunit forms the functional BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The presence of the &#x003b2;-subunit confers BK<sub>Ca </sub>with higher Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and voltage sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, reduced expression of BK<sub>Ca </sub>&#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunit would permit an increase intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>levels without permit an increase opposing K<sup>+ </sup>conductance, thereby enhancing contractility of smooth muscle. Because the BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel is particular abundant in uterine myocytes, a reduction of this channel in protein level would translate into a considerable shift toward electrical excitability in the human uterus and likely promote contractile activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results indicate that BK<sub>Ca </sub>&#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunit are predominately localized to myometrial cells in US and LS region of pregnant and non-pregnant human uterus. It has been implicated that, at the time of labour, the uterus differentiates into the highly contractile activity. Because BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel play a pivotal role in the modulation of uterine excitability and contractility, the down-regulation of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel expression in myometrium following labour may contribute, in part, to the enhanced contractility during parturition.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LG and BC carried out all experimental work.
