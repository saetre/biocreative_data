We demonstrate the existence of <italic>in vivo</italic> interactions between Spo11 proteins carrying distinct tags, and the chromatin-binding and DSB activity of tagged Spo11&#x02009;at innate and targeted DSB sites upon fusion to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain.

In meiosis, recombination between homologous chromosomes is initiated by programmed double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs), which are transiently and meiotically introduced at recombination initiation sites, after the completion of premeiotic DNA replication. In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, ten genes (<italic>SPO11, MEI4, MER2/REC107, REC102, SKI8/REC103, REC104, REC114, MRE11, RAD50</italic> and <italic>XRS2</italic>) are required for meiotic DSB formation, in addition to two genes for meiosis-specific RNA splicing (<italic>MER1</italic> and <italic>MRE2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Null mutations of these genes result in defective meiotic recombination and spore inviability.</p><p>Spo11, an evolutionarily conserved protein, is the catalytic component of meiotic DNA cleavage, and many studies suggest that Spo11 cleaves DNA via a topoisomerase-like transesterification reaction, forming intermediates by linking to the 5&#x02032; ends of the DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). These intermediates are then further processed via asymmetric endonucleolytic cleavage that is likely mediated by one or more other endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Importantly, Spo11 shares structural similarity with the A subunit of topoisomerase 6 (Top6A) that has been found only in the archaeon <italic>Sulfolobus shibatae</italic>. Top6A has ATP-dependent DNA relaxation activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and forms a heterotetramer with Top6B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Crystallized Top6A of <italic>Methanococcus jannaschii</italic> forms a U-shaped dimer with a putative DNA interaction channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). To date, whether or not this dimer is similar to the Spo11 complex has not been determined, since it has proved difficult to purify functional Spo11 protein. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the heterozygous combination of various DSB-defective <italic>spo11</italic> mutant alleles and <italic>SPO11</italic>-<italic>3HA</italic> results in a partial dominant negative phenotype with respect to DSB formation, although the <italic>SPO11</italic>-<italic>3HA/SPO11</italic>-<italic>3HA</italic> homozygous diploid strain has a wild-type level of DSB formation, suggesting that Spo11 functions in dimeric or multimeric form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The difficulties experienced in purifying soluble Spo11 led us to investigate the interaction between Spo11 subunits <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Regulation of Spo11 endonucleolytic activity can be envisaged to occur in at least two ways. In the first model, cleavage activity of Spo11 might be activated or facilitated by other proteins. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, at least nine other proteins are known to be required for DSB formation, but their role remains poorly understood; genetic and/or physical studies indicate that they interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Ski8 interacts directly with Spo11, and this interaction, in addition to the interaction of Spo11 with Rec102 and Rec104, is essential for DNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), suggesting that these proteins form a complex with Spo11 to activate the cleavage reaction. Mer2/Rec107, Mei4 and Rec114 interact with each other, and contact Xrs2 of the Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 complex, which is required for DSB formation and repair, raising the additional question of how DSB formation is coupled to single-strand end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). Overexpression of Rec114 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is known to inhibit meiotic DSB formation, suggesting that Rec114 is a key regulator of meiotic DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), but the molecular basis of this effect has not yet been elucidated. Some additional factors, including histone acetyltransferases and chromatin-remodeling factors, are involved in meiotic alteration of local chromatin structure at DSB sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>), which is a prerequisite for meiotic DSB cleavage. DSB formation is temporally correlated with DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), and is also controlled by cell cycle regulators, since inactivation of the S cyclins Clb5-Clb6, CDK and Hsk1 kinasae (<italic>S. pombe</italic> homolog of <italic>CDC</italic>7) eliminates DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>).</p><p>An alternative but not mutually exclusive model to explain the regulation of Spo11 activity is to invoke chromosomal features (chromatin or higher order chromosome structures) defining permissive or nonpermissive chromosomal domains for DSB formation. Genome-wide studies have shown that DSB regions are not randomly distributed, but are rather distributed nonrandomly in DSB-hot and DSB-cold domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Whether this reflects the regulation of Spo11 binding or cleavage is not known.</p><p>The fusion of Spo11 protein to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4BD-Spo11), as accomplished by us in a previous study, produced a novel experimental tool that enabled additional information about molecular mechanism of the DSB cleavage by Spo11 to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Expression of Gal4BD-Spo11 in <italic>spo11&#x00394;</italic> diploids allowed recombinogenic DSB formation at innate DSB sites and wild-type production of viable spores. In addition, Gal4BD-Spo11 expression allowed the targeted stimulation of novel DSB sites, located in the vicinity of Gal4 consensus-binding sites (UAS), such as in the <italic>GAL2</italic> locus located within a DSB-cold domain on chromosome XII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In that study, we examined the genetic requirements for the formation of these targeted DSBs. Interestingly, we found that DSB formation at the targeted DSB sites required all of the known factors (DSB proteins and Clb5-Clb6) that are indispensable for DSB formation at innate DSB sites. This indicated that Gal4BD-Spo11 catalyzes DSB formation near the Gal4 UAS by locally recruiting the components necessary for DSB formation, whereas they might be absent or improperly localized in DSB-cold domains. In this model, the binding of Spo11 to DSB sites would be the first rate-limiting step for DSB formation. However, the observation that uncleaved DNA intermediates are bound by Spo11 suggests that the activation of Spo11 cleavage is controlled separately from its physical interaction with DSB sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Thus, activation of Spo11 cleavage activity is likely more complex than initially anticipated.</p><p>Here, to provide insights into the activation and catalytic processes controlling Spo11 activity, we examined the <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction between Spo11 and Gal4BD-Spo11 proteins carrying distinct tags, and assayed their chromatin-binding and DSB formation activity at innate (<italic>YCR048w</italic>) and targeted (<italic>GAL2</italic>) sites. We demonstrate that Rec102, Rec104 and Rec114 regulate meiotic association between Spo11 subunits on chromatin sites. Such meiotic self-association of Spo11 may be important for the regulation of DNA cleavage activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and media</title><p>All yeast strains used in this study were isogenic derivatives of SK1 and are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

The <italic>kanMX</italic>6 cassette was then inserted into the NruI site. The DNA fragment for the expression of Spo11Y135F was amplified by PCR, followed by insertion into the NdeI/BamHI site (pAP1-YF), which enabled expression of Spo11Y135F under the control of the <italic>ADH</italic>1 promoter. The plasmid pAUS was constructed as follows. First, a BamHI fragment harboring the <italic>ADH</italic>1 promoter and terminator derived from pAUR123 (TaKaRa-Bio Co.

PCR conditions were as follows: incubation at 95&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02009;min; 30 cycles of incubations for 10&#x02009;s at 95&#x000b0;C, 10&#x02009;s at 55&#x000b0;C and 1&#x02009;min at 72&#x000b0;C; followed by a final incubation for 7&#x02009;min at 72&#x000b0;C. The amplified products were separated on 3% Metaphor agarose (Cambrex Bio Science Rockland, Inc.). Real-time PCR was performed using the ABI 7300 system (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). We used SYBR-premixed ExTaq (TaKaRa-Bio Co. Ltd) for the samples and the ROX-dye for the references. After a 2-min incubation at 95&#x000b0;C, reaction cycles (95&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;s, 55&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;s and 72&#x000b0;C for 1&#x02009;min) were repeated 45 times, followed by a 7-min incubation at 72&#x000b0;C. Then, dissociation curve analysis was conducted to determine if specific products were amplified. The amount of precipitated (IP) DNA and whole-cell extract (WCE) DNA were measured relative to a standard sample of yeast genomic DNA.

After the plugs were equilibrated with restriction enzyme buffers (New England Biolabs, USA) and melted at 65&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;min, they were digested with AseI (for the <italic>YCR048W</italic> locus) and NcoI/XbaI (for the <italic>GAL2</italic> locus) for 4&#x02009;h at 37&#x000b0;C. Each digested sample was then separated by electrophoresis in a 1.0% agarose gel (40&#x02009;cm&#x02009;long) containing TAE. The separated DNA fragments were further alkali-transferred to charged nylon membranes (Biodyne B membrane, PALL, EA). To determine the presence of SSBs, the agarose plugs containing genomic DNA were directly treated with NcoI/XbaI without melting.

At the <italic>GAL2</italic> locus, the purified genomic DNA was treated with AccI, BspHI, HhaI and Nt.AlwI (New England BioLabs) for several hours. Nt.AlwI was used as a positive control for SSB detection. All samples were purified using a NucleoSpin Extract II kit (Macherey-Nagel) and suspended in TE and loading buffer (95% formamide, 10&#x02009;mM EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromophenol blue).

Furthermore, the meiotic interaction between Spo11-3FLAG and Gal4BD-Spo11 was confirmed in the YHS425 diploid strain, in which both Spo11 constructs were inserted in the <italic>AUR1</italic> locus (chromosome 11) and were constitutively expressed under the control of the same <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter. At <italic>t</italic> = 3.5&#x02009;h but not at <italic>t</italic> = 0&#x02009;h, an interaction between Spo11-3FLAG and Gal4BD-Spo11 was detected in meiotic WCEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Quantitatively, the efficiency of Gal4BD-Spo11 IP with Spo11-3FLAG in meiosis was estimated to be &#x0223c;3% of the total Gal4BD-Spo11 protein in the WCEs (normalized with reference to the IP efficiency of Spo11-3FLAG; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). Similarly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, this interaction was also detected in meiotic cells co-expressing Spo11-3FLAG and Gal4BD-spo11Y135F, indicating that the tyrosine residue of the Spo11 catalytic site is dispensable for the interaction between Spo11 subunits. We conclude that these Spo11 subunits interact in a meiosis-specific manner at the time of DSB formation, as suggested by studies on Spo11-oligonucleotide complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Since Spo11 forms a cleavage intermediate by covalently linking to the DSB ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), it is possible that the above interaction between Spo11 subunits is mediated by protein&#x02013;DNA interactions. To test this hypothesis, we examined Spo11 interactions after treating the IP complex with various concentrations of DNase I in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Irrespective of DNase I concentration, and thus after extensive digestion of the IP material, the Spo11-3FLAG and Gal4BD-Spo11 interaction was still detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), indicating that their interaction is not mediated by protein&#x02013;DNA interactions.</p><p>Arora <italic>et al</italic>. and other groups revealed that Spo11 directly or indirectly interact with other DSB proteins such as Rec102, Ski8/Rec103, Red104, Mer2/Rec107, Rec114 and Mei4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Thus, we next investigated the interaction between Spo11 subunits in diploid deletion mutants for those proteins, that co-expressed Spo11-3FLAG and Gal4BD-Spo11 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Western blotting analysis for the wild-type and DSB-deficient mutant strains revealed that Spo11-3FLAG and Gal4BD-Spo11 were present at similar levels in the WCEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). However, in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitated sample, the amount of Gal4BD-Spo11 significantly varied: it was reduced to background level in <italic>rec102&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>rec104&#x00394;</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E), but increased 2&#x02013;3-fold in <italic>ski8/rec103&#x00394;, mer2/rec107&#x00394;, rec114&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>mei4&#x00394;</italic> mutants. These results indicate that the meiotic interaction between the Spo11 subunits (assayed in WCEs) does not depend upon meiotic DSB formation, but is genetically controlled by the Spo11-interacting Rec102 and Rec104, which are essential regulator of meiotic DSB formation on meiotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29 B30 B31">29&#x02013;31</xref>). The increased Spo11 interaction observed in the other DSB-deficient mutants can be explained by the formation of non-functional Spo11 aggregates, which form in the absence of the DSB proteins in question, and likely accumulate in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Gal4BD-Spo11 and Gal4BD-spo11Y135F recruit Spo11-3FLAG to the <italic>GAL2</italic> locus</title><p>To investigate the interaction of Spo11 subunits on the chromosomal substrate, we examined the interaction between Spo11-3FLAG and Gal4BD-Spo11 or Gal4BD-spo11Y135F by using ChIP assays, using anti-FLAG and anti-Gal4BD antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The binding of these proteins was examined by multiplex and quantitative real-time PCR using three pairs of primers, allowing DSB-proficient and -deficient regions to be monitored. The PP<italic>048w</italic> primer pair was used to detect Spo11 binding to the <italic>YCR048w</italic> region, which contains the strongest innate DSB hotspot on chromosome III; and the <italic>GAL2</italic> region was monitored using a pair of primers located 58&#x02009;bp downstream of the <italic>Gal2</italic> UAS sites, away from the DSB cleavage sites (Murakami, unpublished dots). As a control, the third primer pair located within the <italic>SMC1</italic> DSB-cold domain was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). ChIP experiments using high-resolution genome tiling arrays have revealed that little Spo11 binds to this region (within &#x0223c;7&#x02009;kb&#x02009;5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; of the region amplified with PP<italic>SMC1</italic>; K. Kugou <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished results). </p><p>As expected, in the strain expressing Spo11-3FLAG (YHS395), 3&#x02013;4&#x02009;h after entry into meiosis, we observed Spo11-3FLAG binding to the <italic>YCR048w</italic> region (0.3&#x02013;0.4% of ChIP efficiency; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F), but not to the <italic>GAL2</italic> region (less than 0.03% of ChIP efficiency; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C (upper panel) and D). In contrast, in strains co-expressing Spo11-3FLAG and Gal4BD-Spoll (YHS425) or Gal4BD-spo11Y135F (YHS518) proteins, Spo11-3FLAG accumulated efficiently at both the <italic>YCR048w</italic> and <italic>GAL2</italic> regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C and D). Importantly, we also noted that the recruitment of Spo11-3FLAG to the <italic>GAL2</italic> DSB region peaked at 3&#x02009;h and 4&#x02009;h (an IP: WCE DNA ratio is about 0.3%, an average of 3 and 4&#x02009;h time points, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D), corresponding to the time of DSB formation, although the Gal4BD fusion proteins were constitutively expressed in premeiotic and meiotic cells. This indicates that Spo11 interactions occurring on the chromatin of the DSB sites are meiotically and temporally regulated.</p><p>In addition, we also examined the behavior of Gal4BD-Spo11 during meiosis by ChIP using an anti-Gal4BD antibody. Although all strains used here carried the wild-type <italic>GAL4</italic> gene, only a small IP signal was detected in the <italic>GAL2</italic> region in the absence of Gal4BD-SPO11 under the experimental condition used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). In contrast, in cell constitutively expressing Gal4BD-Spo11, the Gal4BD ChIP signal at the <italic>GAL2</italic> region stays at constant levels from premeiosis through to the period of DSB formation (an IP:WCE DNA ratio is about 2.0%, an average of 3 and 4&#x02009;h time points, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E, left), whereas it accumulated over time at the innate <italic>YCR048w</italic> DSB region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E, right) followed by a reduction after 6&#x02009;h of meiosis at both sites. These control experiments suggest that the Gal4BD ChIP signal in the presence of overexpressed Gal4BD-Spo11 was mainly due to the binding of Gal4BD-Spo11, but little endogenous Gal4 protein, to the <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS site.</p><p>The ChIP signal of Gal4BD-Spo11-3FLAG at <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS site by anti-FLAG antibody was 0.54% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>G), while it was 2.0% by anti-Gal4BD antibody. Therefore, ChIP efficiency by anti-Gal4BD antibody is about 3.7-fold higher than that by anti-FLAG antibody. Considering such difference in IP efficiency by distinct antibodies, we estimated that the molecular ratios of Gal4BD-Spo11 (or Gal4BD-spo11Y135F) versus Spo11-3FLAG at <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS and <italic>YCR048w</italic> regions (1:0.6 and 1:5.8, respectively). The ratio at <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS regions seems reasonable, given that free Gal4BD-Spo11/Gal4BD-spo11Y135F and Spo11-3FLAG can equally access to preloaded Gal4BD-Spo11/Gal4BD-spo11Y135F on <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS site. Less binding of Gal4BD-Spo11&#x02009;at <italic>YCR048w</italic> region may be due to the difference in the number of Gal4 UAS consensus sequences within <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS and <italic>YCR048w</italic> regions (five and one UAS sequences, respectively). In contrast with the case of <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS region, the binding of Spo11-FLAG in the <italic>YCR048w</italic> region is generally unaffected by the presence of Gal4BD-Spo11/Gal4BD-spo11Y135F. From these, we conclude that the Spo11-3FLAG and Gal4BD-Spo11/Gal4BD-spo11Y135F proteins form a chromatin-associated heterocomplex in the <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS region during meiosis.</p><p>To address the genetic control of the meiotic association of Spo11-3FLAG with the <italic>GAL2</italic> region in the presence of Gal4BD-Spo11, we examined the effects of deleting other DSB genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). A ChIP assay indicated that the absence of Rec102, Ski8/Rec103, Rec104, Mer2/Rec107, Rec114 or Mei4 severely impaired the recruitment of Spo11-3FLAG by Gal4BD-Spo11 to chromatin of the <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS region. Quantitatively, the ChIP ratio was reduced to 0.01&#x02013;0.1%, compared with 0.3&#x02013;0.4% in the wild-type strain (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Interestingly, two mutant categories were distinguishable: the first class, which included the <italic>rec102&#x00394;, rec104&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>rec114&#x00394;</italic> mutants, exhibited almost complete loss of the Spo11-3FLAG ChIP signal, whereas the second class, which included the <italic>ski8/rec103&#x00394;, mer2/rec107&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>mei4&#x00394;</italic> mutants, were associated with less severe defects (approximately 25% of the wild-type levels) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The severe deficiencies of the <italic>rec102&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>rec104&#x00394;</italic> mutants observed in the Spo11-3FLAG ChIP assay correlate with the lack of stable interaction between the Spo11 subunits observed by IP in WCEs. However, this was not the case for Rec114 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E), suggesting that Rec114 more specifically controls the chromatin-associated interaction of Spo11-3FLAG and Gal4BD-Spo11 proteins. We also noted that all members of the second class of mutants exhibited increased levels of Spo11 interaction in WCE IP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E), indicating that the Spo11 heterocomplexes form cytoplasmic and/or nuclear aggregates that cannot be recruited to the DSB sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). </p></sec><sec><title>Co-expression of the Spo11-3FLAG and Gal4BD-spo11Y135F proteins allows DSB formation in the <italic>YCR048w</italic> region but not at <italic>GAL2</italic></title><p>Next, we analyzed DSB formation in the <italic>YCR048w</italic> and <italic>GAL2</italic> regions in cells co-expressing the Spo11-3FLAG and Gal4BD-Spo11 or Gal4BD-spo11Y135F proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). These DSB analyses were performed using a <italic>rad50S</italic> mutant background that allowed the accumulation of unresected meiotic DSB fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In both <italic>SPO11</italic> and <italic>SPO11-3FLAG</italic> control diploids, DSBs became detectable in the <italic>YCR048w</italic> promoter region 2&#x02009;h after entry into meiosis, and had accumulated by 6&#x02009;h to reach an absolute frequency of &#x0223c;8% per DNA molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B). In the <italic>GAL4BD-SPO11</italic> cells, as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), DSBs were formed not only in the <italic>YCR048w</italic> promoter region, but also in the vicinity of the fortuitous Gal4 UAS sites located in the <italic>YCR048w</italic> coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, arrowhead). The distribution and timing of DSB formation was similar in cells co-expressing Spo11-3FLAG and Gal4BD-Spo11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, and D). </p><p>The results of DSB analysis in cells expressing the nuclease-deficient <italic>spo11Y135F</italic> mutation are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. We first examined the <italic>YCR048w</italic> region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). As expected, no DSBs were detected in the homozygous <italic>GAL4BD-spo11Y135F</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E), and diploid cells co-expressing Spo11-3FLAG and Gal4BD-spo11Y135F exhibited a DSB pattern that was very similar to those observed in diploids expressing Spo11 or Spo11-3FLAG alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F and A&#x02013;C, respectively). These results indicate that expression of the Gal4BD-spo11Y135F cleavage-deficient protein hardly interferes with the DSB activity of wild-type and Spo11-3FLAG proteins at innate DSB regions (see discussion).</p><p>In contrast, as in the <italic>GAL4BD-spo11Y135F</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), no DSBs were formed at the <italic>GAL2</italic> locus in cells co-expressing the Gal4BD-spo11Y135F and Spo11-3FLAG proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), although the nuclease-active Spo11-3FLAG was meiotically recruited in the presence of the Gal4BD-spo11Y135F protein (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). We also examined whether or not spo11Y135F-3FLAG protein exhibits a dominant negative effects on DSB formation at <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS region, when it is co-expressed with Gal4BD-Spo11. In this case, we detected impaired levels of DSB formation (60&#x02013;70% of the wild-type levels) at <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C and D). </p><p>In the gel image for analysis of DSBs at the <italic>YCR048w</italic> locus in the <italic>GAL4BD-spo11Y135F/SPO11-3FLAG</italic> strain, we noted the presence of a faint and diffuse DSB signal within the <italic>YCR048w</italic> coding region, close to the fortuitous Gal4 UAS consensus-binding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F, arrowheads). This weak DSB signal was &#x0223c;10-fold weaker than that for cells expressing Gal4BD-Spo11 alone or Gal4BD-Spo11 plus Spo11-3FLAG (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F with C and D). We do not know whether this reflects residual activity of the heterocomplex not detected in the <italic>GAL2</italic> region, or results from an indirect effect of the binding of Gal4BD-spo11Y135F in this region, sufficient to locally open the chromatin structure, and thus facilitate access by Spo11-3FLAG alone.</p><p>Finally, to further address the potential cleavage activity of the Gal4BD-spo11Y135F/Spo11-3FLAG heterocomplex associated with the <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS region, we examined the presence or absence of single-stranded breaks (SSBs). To visualize potential nicks, we used two experimental methods. First, we attempted to detect the presence of SSBs by extensively treating the genomic DNA preparation with the single-strand DNA-specific endonuclease S1, and visualizing the DNA fragments by Southern blot hybridization (see Materials and methods section). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, no band indicating the formation of SSBs at the <italic>GAL2</italic> locus was detected upon S1 treatment of the <italic>GAL4BD-spo11Y135F/SPO11-3FLAG</italic> or control <italic>GAL4BD-spo11Y135F</italic>&#x02009;DNA samples. </p><p>In the second experimental method, which has been used earlier to map DSB sites to nucleotide-level resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33 B34 B35 B36">33&#x02013;36</xref>), native genomic DNA preparations were run on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and hybridized with strand-specific probes. As a positive control for the detection of nicked fragments, DNA preparations were digested with the Nt.AlwI restriction enzyme, which introduces SSBs at the specific 5&#x02032;-GGATCNNNN/N-3&#x02032; sequence. Conveniently, a Nt.AlwI site is located in the <italic>GAL2</italic> region, near the Gal4 UAS sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C and D illustrate the results obtained upon hybridization of the meiotic DNA extracted from the <italic>GAL4BD-spo11Y135F/SPO11-3FLAG</italic> strain and various positive and negative control strains, using <italic>GAL2</italic> Watson and Crick strand-specific probes, respectively. Clearly, no band indicating the formation of meiotic SSBs was detected in the <italic>GAL4BD-spo11Y135F/SPO11-3FLAG</italic> strain, nor in the <italic>SPO11-3FLAG</italic> strain. Based on quantification of minor bands, we estimated that the sensitivity of detection of this method is in the range of 0.1&#x02013;0.2% of total DNA, which is much lower than the intensity of major SSB signals (&#x0223c;17%) appeared in the wild-type strain. Therefore, we conclude that the wild-type Spo11-3FLAG protein remains inactive for single- and double-strand DNA break formation at <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS site, although it is recruited to the chromatin of a potentially cleavable region by association with the nuclease-deficient Gal4BD-spo11Y135F protein.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, we examined the <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction between Spo11 proteins carrying distinct tags, and assayed chromatin binding and DSB formation at innate (<italic>YCR048w</italic>) and targeted (<italic>GAL2</italic>) sites upon fusion of Spo11 to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. We established that: (1) At the time of DSB formation, but not at premeiotic stages, the Spo11-3FLAG and Gal4BD-Spo11 proteins can form a heterocomplex; (2) In the presence of the Gal4BD-Spo11 protein, Spo11-3FLAG meiotically interacts with the preloaded Gal4BD-Spo11 protein and bound to the chromatin of the <italic>GAL2</italic> region; (3) This interaction depends on other DSB proteins, since it is reduced in all DSB protein mutants, but more severely in <italic>rec102&#x00394;, rec104&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>rec114&#x00394;</italic> mutants; and (4) Spo11-3FLAG is recruited to the <italic>GAL2</italic> region in the presence of the nuclease-deficient Gal4BD-spo11Y135F protein, but remains inactive for DSB as well as potential SSB cleavage activity.</p><sec><title>Spo11 interactions are under genetic control</title><p>Our time-course analysis of the Spo11-FLAG and Gal4BD-Spo11 interaction in diploid cells expressing both proteins under the control of the <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) shows that the Gal4BD-Spo11-mediated recruitment of Spo11-3FLAG is enhanced during the period of DSB formation, although both proteins are present at generally constant levels during premeiosis and meiosis. In addition, they are co-immunoprecipitated only in the meiotic cell extracts. All these data demonstrate that the self-interaction of Spo11 is controlled in a meiosis-dependent manner.</p><p>Our analysis of mutants indicates that the self-association of Spo11 is genetically controlled by the activity of other known meiotic DSB proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In cells lacking Rec102 and Rec104, which physically interact with each other and with Spo11, the meiotic self-interaction of Spo11 decreases dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E), suggesting that Rec102 and Rec104 may mediate the interaction between Spo11 subunits during meiosis via a physical interaction with Spo11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29 B30 B31">29&#x02013;31</xref>). </p><p>Interestingly, the genetic requirements for the self-interaction of Spo11 as determined by the IP and ChIP experiments are somewhat different: Rec102 and Rec104 were absolutely required for the Spo11 self-interaction in the cell extracts, whereas Rec114 in addition to Rec102 and Rec104 was essential for the Gal4BD-Spo11-mediated recruitment of Spo11-3FLAG to the chromatin at the <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). It is most likely that Rec114 is not involved in the Spo11 self-interaction, but has other roles in facilitating the initial chromatin binding of Spo11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). This idea is consistent with the previous finding that the chromatin binding of Spo11 to DSB sites is not observed in <italic>rec114&#x00394;</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In addition, the idea seems reasonable, since overproduction of Rec114 perturbs global DSB formation, presumably by an abortive chromatin loading of Spo11 proteins in the presence of an excess amount of Rec114 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>We also found that other meiotic DSB proteins, Mei4, Mer2 and Ski8, are partially required for Spo11-3FLAG recruitment to the <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS site, although they are dispensable for the Spo11 self-interaction in meiotic cell extracts. However, <italic>mei4&#x00394;, mer2&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>rec114&#x00394;</italic> mutants had higher levels of Spo11 self-interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). Prieler <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that Spo11-Myc forms aggregates in spread nuclei of <italic>rec114&#x00394;</italic> mutants in addition to normal Spo11 foci, whereas no Spo11-Myc foci are detected at all in <italic>rec102&#x00394;</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Thus, it is likely that polycomplex aggregates of Spo11 are formed in these three mutants.</p><p>It should be noted that Ski8 is known to interact with Spo11, and assists in the nuclear import of Spo11 during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Presumably Ski8 is not involved in controlling the Spo11 self-interaction, but has other roles as a direct partner of Spo11, for example acting to carry Spo11 into meiotic nuclei, converting Spo11 to a nuclease-active state, or stabilizing the binding of pre-DSB complexes to DSB sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Spo11 self-interaction and its cleavage activity</title><p>We found that the Gal4BD-spo11Y135F-assisted recruitment of the functional Spo11-FLAG subunit to the <italic>GAL2</italic> region is not active with respect to DSB or SSB activity. This may be most simply explained by an excess occupancy of Gal4BD-spo11Y135F at <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS site over the binding of Spo11-FLAG. However, we think this may not be the case for the following reason. Dimerization of Gal4BD-fused Spo11 may be facilitated via the dimerization between Gal4BD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Therefore, it is very likely that a homo-dimer Gal4BD-spo11Y135F preoccupies at the <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS site. The molecular ratio of Gal4BD-spo11Y135F versus Spo11-3FLAG at <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS site is expected to be 1:0.6 (see above). These results suggest that on average at least one wild-type Spo11 molecule is present at <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS region forming a heterocomplex with Gal4BD-spo11Y135F, but cannot catalyze DNA cleavage reaction. Therefore, it is suggested that multimeric assembly of active Spo11 monomers at DSB sites may be critical in DNA cleavage reaction.</p><p>In this notion, one can predict that co-expression of Gal4BD-Spo11 and spo11 Y135F may exhibit a dominant negative effect on DSB formation at <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS region. In fact, we observed 30&#x02013;40% reduction of DSB formation at <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS region in this situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C and D). The partial (but not total) reduction of DSB formation at <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS region can be explained as follows. At <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS region in meiotic cells co-expressing Gal4BD&#x02013;Spo11 and Spo11Y135F, there should be four types of Spo11 complexes (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B, upper panel). Spo11-3FLAG homocomplex is present in nuclei, but cannot bind to <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS regions without guidance by Gal4BD-spo11Y135F. Therefore, the <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS is likely to be bound either by homocomplexes consisting of only Gal4BD-spo11Y135F, or by heterocomplexes consisting of Gal4BD-spo11Y135F and Spo11-3FLAG, which are all supposed to be inactive in the hypothesis. The lower diagram of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B illustrates four potential situations at <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS region in cells co-expressing Gal4BD-Spo11 and spo11Y135F. In this case, three types (one type is half active) out of four possible combinations are assumed to catalyze DSB formation, thereby dominant negative effects may be only partial.</p><p>Since purification of active Spo11 proteins has not yet been achieved, it is difficult to estimate the exact number of Spo11 subunits present in an individual complex. However, biochemical and structural analyses of the archaeal Top6A protein complex suggest the participation of an anti-parallel dimer of Spo11 subunits in DSB cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In this idea, the location of the catalytic site of each protomer is closer to the magnesium-binding pocket in the Toprim domain of the other protomer than it is to its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The notion of anti-parallel interaction between Spo11 subunits is consistent with the partial dominant negative defects of DSB formation in heterozygous combinations of some DSB-defective alleles and Spo11-3HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> biochemical analysis of yeast topoisomerase II has revealed that the catalytic tyrosine residue of one protomer causes SSBs in association with the metal-binding pocket of the other protomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Therefore, if Spo11 forms a dimer that functions via a topoisomerase-II-like mechanism, the heterocomplex of Gal4BD-spo11Y135F and Spo11-3FLAG should introduce an SSB at the <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS. However, this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). It seems likely that the mechanism by which Spo11 cleaves DNA is slightly different from the way that topoisomerase II functions. Presumably, two active catalytic tyrosine residues in a dimeric configuration are essential to function in concert to generate DSBs.</p></sec><sec><title>Self-interaction of Spo11 and regional control of DSB cleavage</title><p>In cells co-expressing Gal4BD-spo11Y135F and Spo11-3FLAG, we detected only faint levels of DSB formation at the UAS within the <italic>YCR048w</italic> coding region, suggesting that DSB formation is impaired, but not absent at this locus, whereas no DSB was detected at the <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS site. The former locus is in a chromosomal domain that is very active in meiotic DSB formation, but the latter site is in a DSB-cold domain. Differences in the effects on DSB formation at the two UAS-containing sites may reflect regional conditions that limit or favor DSB formation. In DSB-cold domains, it is possible that Spo11 and its activating factors may be absent or present only in small amounts, so that DSB formation is more severely affected in comparison with the situation at DSB-hot domains, at which Spo11 and its activating factors may be more readily available. In fact, the molecular ratios of Gal4BD-Spo11 (or Gal4BD-spo11Y135F) versus Spo11-3FLAG at <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS and <italic>YCR048w</italic> regions are 1:0.6 and 1:5.8, respectively. Therefore, Spo11 may be able to form larger multimers in DSB-hot domains than in DSB-cold domains. In such larger Spo11 multimers, a small portion of active complexes can exist and sufficiently catalyze DSB formation; thereby the presence of Gal4BD-spo11Y135F hardly interferes with the DSB activity of active Spo11 proteins at innate DSB sites in DSB-hot domains. It will be interesting to test the possibility of regional regulation of DSB formation in terms of the interaction between Spo11 subunits.</p><p>Activation of Spo11 is controlled separately from the control of its physical interaction with DSB sites, since there are uncleaved DNA intermediates bound by Spo11, without introducing any nicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). We also found that Spo11 can bind to DSB-cold regions such as centromeric regions (K. Kugou <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished results), and that Gal4BD-Spo11 binds to <italic>GAL2</italic> UAS sites without cleaving DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). It is therefore possible that Spo11 complexes at DSB-cold regions do not participate in the DNA cleavage reaction unless they are converted to active complexes with the assistance of other DSB factors. Since Rec102 and Rec104 are involved in the meiotic self-interaction of Spo11, these meiotic DSB factors are assumed to play important roles in the regulation of Spo11 activity by controlling the self-interaction between Spo11 monomers, thereby facilitating the formation of the pre-DSB complex.</p><p>The present analyses reveal that Spo11 molecules can interact with each other, and are genetically controlled by meiotic DSB proteins such as Rec102, Rec104 and Rec114. This finding permits new insights into the molecular mechanisms of DSB cleavage and regulation of cleavage activity by Spo11.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank K.
