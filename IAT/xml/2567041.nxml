By contrast, because CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells can be infected by HIV-1 and at least some subsets secrete anti-viral CCR5 ligands, it is possible that these ligands protect against HIV-1 via autocrine as well as paracrine pathways. Here we use a model primary CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell response in vitro to show that individual CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that secrete anti-viral CCR5 ligands are &#x02018;self-protected&#x02019; against infection with R5 but not X4 strains of HIV-1. This protection is selective for CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that secrete anti-viral CCR5 ligands in that activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the same cultures remain infectable with R5 HIV-1.

Responses are monitored by cell division by CFSE dilution and for changes in phenotype and function by surface markers and cytokine production, respectively. Responses in this system are strictly dependent upon MDDC as antigen presenting cells and foreign antigen.

Viral infection of MDDC was performed by co-culturing MDDC (2&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> per well) with 1000 TCID50 of the HIV-1 isolates as indicated in the text. Aliquots of supernatants were removed on days 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 and quantified for p24 concentrations by ELISA (New England Nuclear, Cambridge, MA). Alternatively, viral replication was determined by intracellular staining for HIV-1 p24 antigen as described below.

This conclusion is based on kinetic studies of HIV-1 replication during the primary antigen specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> where R5 virus growth was selectively dampened by the synthesis of anti-viral CCR5 ligands by the responding T cells. It is also based on single cell analyses of the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells undergoing a primary response where R5 HIV-1 infection and the synthesis of CCL4 were largely exclusive. By contrast, significant exclusivity was not observed for X4 HIV-1 infection. Taken together, these data show that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, which synthesize anti-viral CCR5 ligands during the primary immune response, are &#x0201c;self-protected&#x0201d;. To our knowledge, this is a new phenomenon in the interplay between HIV-1 infection and anti-viral effector mechanisms of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, which are the principal targets of this virus. Four aspects of this observation warrant further discussion.</p><p>First, this observation strongly suggests that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells manifest potent anti-HIV-1 effector activity early in the primary immune response <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is well established that memory CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells secrete high levels of anti-viral CCR5 ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Cocchi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Cocchi2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-KaminLewis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> constituting one of several cell-mediated anti-HIV effector mechanisms; however, less is known about the production of these factors by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell subsets during the different phases (i.e., primary and secondary) of an immune response. In an early study using CD45RA and CD45RO to mark na&#x000ef;ve and memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell subsets, respectively, it was shown that both CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD45RO<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> subsets activated by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 secreted anti-viral CCR5 ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Riley1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results showing that antigen-activated na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells secrete anti-viral CCR5 ligands agree and extend those studies. They agree in that both sets of studies show that recently activated na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells secrete anti-viral CCR5 ligands. Our studies place this observation on a more solid footing in that the previous study used only CD45RA expression to define na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. It is known that a subset of memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in normal individuals also express CD45RA and that a second marker, such as CD62L needs to be used to exclude this subset from the na&#x000ef;ve pool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Roederer1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In the above experiments, na&#x000ef;ve cells were defined as CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD45RO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD62L<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, which excludes the CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population of memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Because of this, our studies more precisely define the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell subsets that secreted anti-viral CCR5 ligands.</p><p>Using this marker strategy we showed previously that that CCL4 is made by CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> memory T cells where greater frequencies of CCL4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were found for the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> subsets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-KaminLewis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This has been confirmed by others during vaccine evaluation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-DeRosa1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells did not synthesize CCL4 in short term assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-KaminLewis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However, shortly after immunization <italic>in vitro</italic> with model antigens, na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells differentiate into blasts that secrete CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 at levels that are potently anti-viral when culture supernatants are evaluated in <italic>trans</italic> using R5 viruses and assays using CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CCR5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> indicator cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Abdelwahab1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. This indicated that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells could exert potent anti-viral activity early in the primary immune response.</p><p>This observation led us to the current studies where we directly challenged antigen-driven primary CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses with R5, R5/X4, and X4 viruses to determine whether these CCR5 ligands are active <italic>in situ</italic>. In the studies described above, the viruses were simply added at the time of culture initiation with antigen, MDDC, and na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and viral growth monitored over the course of the primary response. In all cases, strong primary immune responses were observed to the model antigens as judged by high frequencies of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD45RO<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the stimulated cultures. It should be noted that CD45RO expression is upregulated within hours after antigen stimulation in our culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Abdelwahab1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and unpublished). Thus, the presence of HIV-1 during this early phase of the immune response is not suppressive. We used SEB and alloantigens as the immunogens because anti-HIV-1 primary responses are small in magnitude in our system and these responses are highly reproducible among volunteers (unpublished). In addition, the primary alloantigen response provided a fortuitously optimal dynamic range of response for the bivariate analyses of CCL4 synthesis and HIV-1 infection monitored by intracellular CCL4 and p24 expression. This raises one caveat in that our conclusions are based on primary responses to non-HIV-1 antigens, although it is likely that HIV-1 specific T cells are among the spectrum of responding T cells elicited by SEB and alloantigens.</p><p>There is another potential caveat in using superantigens as opposed to peptide-MHC complexes (i.e., alloantigens or nominal protein antigens) in that superantigens activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells through both lck-dependent and lck-independent pathways whereas peptide-MHC complexes apparently stimulate only via the former pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Criado1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Bueno1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In this regard, it is important to note that the key observation in the studies described above, &#x02018;self-protection&#x02019; of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells by the synthesis anti-viral CCR5 ligands, was made using alloantigen (i.e., peptide-MHC) stimulation. This tempers the caveat that the lck-independent pathway contributes to this observation.</p><p>Second, the selective pressure exerted by anti-viral CCR5 ligands secreted by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells undergoing a primary immune response could affect both the viral and cellular phenotypes that emerge early in HIV infection. Immune responses to different viruses can result in distinct populations of memory T cells that differ not only in the spectrum of their antigen receptor sequences but also surface phenotype and effector function (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Selin1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>). This is due to the local ecology of the cell types infected by the virus and by adaptation of the responding T cells to effectively confront the virus, which attempts to escape the response by evolution under this selective pressure. In the case of HIV-1, it has been known for some time that distinct T cell subsets emerge during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Douek1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Roederer2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and that this is often paralleled by the emergence of viral variants with distinct phenotypes such as altered co-receptor usage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Moore1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Sabbe1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, although the two phenomena have not been causally linked by direct experiment. Our studies suggest a mechanism whereby CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell phenotype can affect viral phenotype and vice versa during a primary immune response.</p><p>Since our results show that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells secreting anti-viral CCR5 ligands during the primary immune response are selectively protected from R5 but not X4 viruses, HIV-1 specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells with this phenotype should selectively survive during acute infection and contribute ultimately to the memory pool. It is interesting to note that while HIV-1 specific memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are selectively infected during an ongoing infection as compared with CMV specific memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, only a fraction of the HIV-1 specific memory cells are infected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Douek2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. While it is possible that this result simply represents the stochastic nature of HIV-1 infection, it is striking that the majority of HIV-1 specific cells were not infected. Our studies suggest that the uninfected HIV-1 specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells might be refractory to infection because they produce anti-viral CCR5 ligands and are &#x02018;self-protected&#x02019;. If so, we predict that HIV-1 specific memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that survive during infection secrete anti-viral CCR5 ligands. In this vein, a recent report described the emergence of an unusual CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CCR5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> memory population in infected people that is resistant to HIV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-OswaldRichter1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. It will be interesting to learn whether these memory cells derive from the lineage of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that secrete anti-viral CCR5 ligands during the primary immune response.</p><p>Third, it is possible that the synthesis of anti-viral CCR5 ligands early in the primary immune response contributes a selective pressure to generate the latent viral reservoir in resting CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Chun1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Chun2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. The CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell reservoir latent harboring HIV-1 is established very early in infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Chun3">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Finzi1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> and it persists throughout the course of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Finzi2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Pierson1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> with apparent replenishment even in individuals undergoing successful HAART therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Finzi2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Pierson1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, this latent pool is populated predominantly by R5 viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Pierson2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Viral latency is one means to escape selective pressure and it is tempting to speculate that the selective pressure exerted by anti-viral CCR5 ligands early in the primary immune response contributes to the early establishment of the latent pool of R5 HIV-1. This hypothesis is currently under investigation using our system.</p><p>Fourth, our studies also suggest a mechanism that could drive the co-receptor switch early in infection. It is well established that the co-receptor switch can occur rapidly in scid-Hu mice under the selective pressure of CCL5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Mosier1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> and it is reasonable to suspect that a similar switch could occur <italic>in vivo</italic> under pressure of CCL5 synthesis by HIV-1 specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells undergoing a primary immune response. We are testing this hypothesis in our system where delayed viral growth is observed for some R5 virus isolates such as HIV-1<sub>SF162</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003481-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). This virus might be particularly susceptible to co-receptor switching as it has been shown that it has a single pathway to X4 usage that is determined by two common mutations in the V3 loop (I309R and A316V) regardless of whether the selection pressure was exerted by culturing in the presence of CCL5 or by switching cellular substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Mosier1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is possible that the HIV-1<sub>SF162</sub> that appears late in our culture system is actually co-receptor switched. We are testing this hypothesis but the potent secretion of anti-viral CCL5 ligands in the early primary CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell response <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Abdelwahab1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> coupled with the selective protection of the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that synthesize these ligands, strongly suggests a role for anti-viral chemokines in protection against R5 viruses early in infection.</p><p>In summary, the results described above indicate a previously overlooked aspect of protective immunity against HIV-1, the selective protection of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that secrete anti-viral CCR5 ligands during the primary immune response. At this point, our studies are limited to a model system in which na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are co-cultured with MDDC and an antigen to elicit a primary immune response. Our studies suggest that HIV specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that secrete anti-viral CCL5 ligands should be selectively protected during the primary HIV-1 infection and enter the memory pool. It is also possible that the relative survival of these cells is a determining factor in the relationship between the magnitude of early CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell depletion and clinical outcome in SHIV vaccination models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003481-Letvin1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Most important, these conclusions suggest that the design immunogens which selectively elicit CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses capable of &#x0201c;self-protection&#x0201d; against HIV-1 is a potential new strategy in the quest for an AIDS vaccine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Robert C.
