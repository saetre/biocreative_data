Although several STAT5 partners have been identified, the molecular events taking place at the promoter level upon STAT5 recruitment have not yet been characterized in great detail. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and accessibility assays, we characterized histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling events occurring during transcriptional activation of the endogenous murine <italic>Cis</italic> gene, a STAT5 target gene, in response to IL-3. We found that STAT5 binding <italic>in vivo</italic> is associated with low histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels in the proximity of the STAT5 binding sites. STAT5 recruitment also results in chromatin reorganization over that promoter region. These events (STAT5 binding, histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling) are not sufficient for transcriptional activation, which requires a non-histone protein deacetylase. These data reveal novel implications of STAT5 in chromatin regulation during cytokine-induced transcription, thus contributing to a better understanding of the mechanism of transcriptional activation by STAT5.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transcription in eukaryotes is a multi-step process involving distinct chromatin modifying and remodeling complexes that control the proper recruitment of transcription factors and assembly of the pre-initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c1">1</xref>).

Chromatin modification by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and deacetylase (HDAC) complexes plays a major role in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c7">7</xref>). Transcriptional activation is generally correlated with histone acetylation and repression with histone deacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c11">11</xref>), although several studies have now well established that this correlation is not exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c19">19</xref>). In addition, acetyltransferases and deacetylases can regulate transcription by targeting non-histone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c22">22</xref>), adding another layer of complexity to the process.</p><p>The signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT5 functions as an important downstream effector of cytokine signaling. STAT5 proteins are present in a latent form in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. Following cytokine stimulation, STAT5 is phosphorylated by the JAK kinases, triggering its dimerization and translocation into the nucleus where it can bind to specific DNA binding sites and activate transcription of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c23">23</xref>). STAT5 function is regulated through interaction with a variety of cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c25">25</xref>), and through functional cooperation with other transcription factors bound on adjacent binding sites and STAT5 tetramerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c25">25</xref>). Despite those extensive studies, the molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation by STAT5 remains poorly understood.</p><p>We recently showed that transcriptional activation by STAT5 requires a deacetylase activity that targets a yet unknown factor necessary for proper recruitment of the basal transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c22">22</xref>). In an extension of this study, we report here a detailed analysis of the molecular events occurring at the level of chromatin along the STAT5-dependent <italic>Cis</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c26">26</xref>), during IL-3-induced transcription. We present evidence that binding of STAT5 to its target sites <italic>in vivo</italic> modulates the level of histone H3 and H4 acetylation and chromatin accessibility over the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter region. Most importantly, these chromatin changes occur even in the absence of transcription, thus supporting the assumption that the deacetylase activity required for transactivation by STAT5 is targeting non-histone proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cells</title><p>The IL-3-dependent murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3-&#x003b2; has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c22">22</xref>).

For comparison, we used a STAT5-independent cytokine inducible gene, <italic>c-Fos</italic>. The murine <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter contains several regulatory elements (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f2">2</xref>B). Among them is a serum inducible element (SIE) shown to mediate transcriptional activation by various STAT family members in different cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c32">32</xref>). To validate <italic>Cis</italic> and <italic>c-Fos</italic> genes within one chosen cell system, the murine pro-B IL-3-dependent cell line Ba/F3, a number of expression analysis experiments were performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f1">1</xref>). First, we used Ba/F3 cells stably expressing a constitutively active mutant form (1&#x0002a;6) of STAT5A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c33">33</xref>). Second, we developed an siRNA-mediated approach to specifically knock down expression of both <italic>STAT5A</italic> and <italic>STAT5B</italic> endogenous genes in Ba/F3-&#x003b2; cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f1">1</xref>C). RNAs were isolated at various times upon IL-3 stimulation. Following a reverse transcription reaction, the cDNAs for <italic>Cis</italic> and <italic>c-Fos</italic> were analyzed by real-time PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f1">1</xref>A and B).</p><p>As expected, expression of <italic>Cis</italic> was strongly upregulated in IL-3-stimulated Ba/F3-1&#x0002a;6 cells compared to Ba/F3-WT cells stably expressing a wild-type form of STAT5A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f1">1</xref>A), while it was inhibited in IL-3-stimulated Ba/F3-&#x003b2; cells following STAT5 knock-down (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f1">1</xref>B). By contrast, expression of <italic>c-Fos</italic> remained unaffected both in Ba/F3-1&#x0002a;6 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f1">1</xref>A) and in STAT5 knock-down Ba/F3-&#x003b2; cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f1">1</xref>B). Together with our previous observation that the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), a specific repressor of STAT5-mediated transcription, abrogates induction of <italic>Cis</italic> while upregulating expression of <italic>c-Fos</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c22">22</xref>), these experiments clearly confirm <italic>Cis</italic> as a STAT5-target gene and establish <italic>c-Fos</italic> as a STAT5-independent gene in IL-3-stimulated Ba/F3 cells, which can be used as a control in our comparative study.</p></sec><sec><title>STAT5 binding to the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> locally modulates histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels</title><p>It was previously shown that STAT5 binds to the endogenous <italic>Cis</italic> promoter within minutes of IL-3 stimulation, closely followed by TBP and RNA polymerase II recruitment. In addition, TSA treatment abrogates TBP and RNA polymerase II recruitment, resulting in transcriptional inhibition, while STAT5 binding remains unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c22">22</xref>). In the present study, we investigated how these molecular events correlate with, and possibly regulate, chromatin modifications along the <italic>Cis</italic> gene. To investigate chromatin acetylation along the STAT5-dependent <italic>Cis</italic> gene <italic>in vivo</italic>, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were conducted, using <italic>c-Fos</italic> as a control gene. ChIP assays were performed in Ba/F3-&#x003b2; cells stimulated with IL-3 for 0&#x02013;2 h, in the absence or presence of TSA. Cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for acetylated and non-acetylated forms of histone H3 and H4, as well as for STAT5 and RNA polymerase II for comparison. Purified genomic DNA was then subjected to real-time PCR using primers amplifying various regions along both genes. Regions overlapping the STAT5 binding sites, the transcription start (or CAP) site, and upstream and downstream regions of the <italic>Cis</italic> gene were investigated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f2">2</xref>A). Identical results were obtained with amplicons &#x02013;256/&#x02013;195 and &#x02013;184/&#x02013;102 overlapping the two clusters of STAT5 binding sites, and therefore only the data obtained with amplicon &#x02013;184/&#x02013;102 are shown. Promoter, CAP site and downstream regions of the <italic>c-Fos</italic> gene were analyzed in parallel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f2">2</xref>B).</p><p>Prior to characterizing the acetylation status along the <italic>Cis</italic> gene, a control experiment was carried out to assess the recruitment of STAT5 and RNA polymerase II on <italic>Cis</italic> and <italic>c-Fos</italic> genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>A and B). Upon IL-3 stimulation, STAT5 was efficiently and specifically recruited to its binding sites (&#x02013;184/&#x02013;102) on the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>A). As expected, STAT5 recruitment was not affected by TSA. Gene expression closely correlated with the presence of RNA polymerase II at the CAP site of <italic>Cis</italic> (&#x02013;17/&#x0002b;55) and <italic>c-Fos</italic> (&#x02013;56/&#x0002b;13) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>B). Accordingly, RNA polymerase II was not detected at the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter upon transcriptional inhibition by TSA. In contrast, in the presence of TSA, the enzyme was found at the <italic>c-Fos</italic> CAP site during the entire time course of induction, in agreement with the prolonged expression of the gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c22">22</xref>). In the same experiment, the no-antibody control yielded no enrichment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>F).</p><p>Analysis of the histone acetylation status on <italic>Cis</italic> and <italic>c-Fos</italic> genes revealed three main distinctive features (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>C&#x02013;E). First, the global level of histone H3 and H4 acetylation in unstimulated cells was on average eight times higher on <italic>Cis</italic> than on <italic>c-Fos</italic> (5&#x02013;10&#x00025; versus 0.6&#x02013;1.6&#x00025; of input DNA for Ac-H3, and 1.9&#x02013;2.2&#x00025; versus 0.2&#x02013;0.4&#x00025; of input DNA for Ac-H4) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>C and D, 0 h IL-3, -TSA). Second, IL-3 stimulation resulted in a different acetylation pattern along both genes. While H3 and H4 acetylation was increased at both loci upon IL-3 stimulation, this increase was transient on <italic>c-Fos</italic>, whereas it persisted or even increased along the <italic>Cis</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>C and D, 0&#x02013;2 h IL-3, -TSA). Moreover, the increase in histone acetylation was higher within the open reading frame of <italic>Cis</italic> (4-fold versus 2-fold within the promoter), while it was higher within the promoter region of <italic>c-Fos</italic> (5- to 8-fold). Third, treatment with the deacetylase inhibitor TSA resulted in histone hyperacetylation (4- to 9-fold) along the <italic>c-Fos</italic> gene in unstimulated cells, whereas the effect on histone acetylation at the <italic>Cis</italic> locus was negligible (1.4- to 1.8-fold) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>C and D, 0 h IL-3, &#x02013;/&#x0002b;TSA). This difference might be a consequence of the already high level of histone acetylation along the <italic>Cis</italic> gene, and suggests that the <italic>c-Fos</italic> gene but not the <italic>Cis</italic> gene is targeted by TSA-sensitive histone deacetylases (HDACs). Upon Il-3 stimulation, there was no significant effect of TSA on histone H3 and H4 acetylation on <italic>Cis</italic>, while the hyperacetylation on <italic>c-Fos</italic> persisted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>C and D, 0&#x02013;2 h IL-3, &#x0002b;TSA). These experiments thus reveal a general trend in which the acetylation status along the genes reflects quite closely their transcriptional activity. This is particularly clear when looking at H3 acetylation within the open reading frame of <italic>Cis</italic> and <italic>c-Fos</italic> in TSA-treated and -untreated IL-3-stimulated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>C, black bars).</p><p>However, the most remarkable feature on the <italic>Cis</italic> gene was the low level of histone H3 and H4 acetylation (3&#x02013;6&#x00025; of input DNA for Ac-H3, and 1.2&#x02013;1.8&#x00025; for Ac-H4), within the promoter region bound by STAT5 proteins (&#x02013;184/&#x02013;102), which was maintained regardless of IL-3 stimulation or TSA treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>C and D). The observation that acetylation levels were not increased following TSA treatment demonstrates that they were not the result of deacetylation by TSA-sensitive HDACs at this site. Moreover, the levels of the non-acetylated form of histone H4 increased specifically at the region overlapping the STAT5 binding sites upon IL-3 stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>E), suggesting that the decreased acetylation levels were not the consequence of nucleosome loss. Although it remains possible that they were the result of deacetylation by a TSA-insensitive deacetylase, these observations suggest that the region of the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter bound by STAT5 is not targeted for acetylation, as opposed to adjacent regions of the gene. These data therefore suggest that STAT5 binding can locally influence the level of histone H3 and H4 acetylation on the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>STAT5 binding to the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> correlates with chromatin remodeling in the vicinity of the STAT5 binding sites</title><p>Next, we wished to investigate whether STAT5 binding had an effect on chromatin structure. We showed previously that an AvaII site located between the two clusters of STAT5 binding sites of the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter (position &#x02013;184, see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f5">5</xref>A) becomes highly accessible <italic>in vivo</italic> in response to IL-3 stimulation of Ba/F3-&#x003b2; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c22">22</xref>). Moreover, this chromatin transition is unaffected by the inhibition of transcription by TSA, as is STAT5 binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c22">22</xref>). To address whether the chromatin transition at position &#x02013;184 is a consequence of STAT5 recruitment in the vicinity, chromatin accessibility in Ba/F3-1&#x0002a;6 cells expressing a constitutively active form of STAT5A was investigated. In these cells, the mutant STAT5 was shown to be constitutively phosphorylated, to localize in the nucleus and exhibit constitutive DNA binding activity <italic>in vitro</italic> in the absence of IL-3, although its activity was exacerbated upon IL-3 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c34">34</xref>). We made the assumption that if STAT5 binding suffices to induce the chromatin transition, constitutive binding of STAT5A-1&#x0002a;6 in unstimulated cells <italic>in vivo</italic> should be associated with constitutive chromatin accessibility.</p><p>First, we demonstrated that STAT5A-1&#x0002a;6 was constitutively bound to the endogenous <italic>Cis</italic> promoter in the absence of IL-3. ChIP assays were performed in Ba/F3-1&#x0002a;6 and Ba/F3-WT cells, unstimulated or stimulated with IL-3 for 30 min. Cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for STAT5, and purified genomic DNA analyzed by real-time PCR using primers specific for <italic>Cis</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f4">4</xref>A). In unstimulated 1&#x0002a;6 cells, a 5-fold enrichment of STAT5 proteins was specifically detected on the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter (&#x02013;184/&#x02013;102) compared to unstimulated WT cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f4">4</xref>A). In agreement with <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA binding data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c34">34</xref>), STAT5A-1&#x0002a;6 association with the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> was further increased upon IL-3 stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f4">4</xref>A). Thus, the constitutively active form of STAT5A is bound to the endogenous <italic>Cis</italic> promoter in the absence of IL-3. As expected, histone H3 and H4 acetylation in unstimulated 1&#x0002a;6 cells as determined by ChIP was 2- to 3-fold lower than in WT cells over the STAT5 binding sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f4">4</xref>B and C, &#x02013;184/&#x02013;102), therefore confirming that binding of STAT5 to DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> correlates well with a local decrease in histone acetylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>).</p><p>We next determined chromatin accessibility by real-time PCR (CHART-PCR) in nuclei from Ba/F3-1&#x0002a;6 and Ba/F3-WT cells treated as above. Nuclei were incubated with restriction enzymes cutting in the vicinity of the STAT5 binding sites (&#x02013;184 and &#x02013;133) and the transcription start site (&#x02013;17) of the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f5">5</xref>A). Genomic DNA was then isolated and analyzed by real-time PCR using primers amplifying the region targeted by the enzyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f5">5</xref>B). In Ba/F3-WT cells, position &#x02013;133 of the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter was protected from restriction digest, while position &#x02013;17 was accessible, regardless of IL-3 stimulation. The observed pattern remained the same in Ba/F3-1&#x0002a;6 cells. In contrast, accessibility at position &#x02013;184 differed in Ba/F3-WT and Ba/F3-1&#x0002a;6 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f5">5</xref>B). While a strong increase in accessibility from 20 to 64&#x00025; was detected upon IL-3 stimulation in the Ba/F3-WT cells, chromatin from Ba/F3-1&#x0002a;6 was already highly accessible (64&#x00025;) in the absence of IL-3. In correlation with increased STAT5 DNA binding upon IL-3 stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f4">4</xref>A), a further increase in chromatin accessibility (83&#x00025;) was detected in IL-3-stimulated Ba/F3-1&#x0002a;6 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f5">5</xref>B). Altogether, these data show that constitutive binding of STAT5 to DNA is closely coupled to increased chromatin accessibility <italic>in vivo</italic>, and therefore suggest that STAT5 DNA binding is a prerequisite for chromatin remodeling at position &#x02013;184 of the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We present here a detailed mapping of histone acetylation and chromatin transitions taking place on the endogenous <italic>Cis</italic> gene, a model STAT5 target gene, following IL-3 stimulation of the murine pro-B cells Ba/F3.</p><p>We found that the <italic>Cis</italic> gene is highly acetylated <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that it is targeted by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activities. Since histone acetylation levels are already high in unstimulated cells, and increase only moderately upon STAT5 binding, it suggests that these HATs act in a STAT5-independent manner. The acetyltransferase p300/CBP was shown to interact with the C-terminal transactivation domain of STAT5 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in overexpression systems, and to enhance STAT5 transactivation using reporter systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c36">36</xref>). Our <italic>in vivo</italic> data thus suggest that, if it is recruited by STAT5 on the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, p300/CBP might not target histones but rather acetylate another factor in the process of STAT5-mediated transcriptional activation. In contrast, a distinct histone acetylation pattern was observed on our control promoter <italic>c-Fos</italic>, with a strong and transient increase in H3 and H4 acetylation within the proximal promoter and CAP site regions upon IL-3 stimulation. <italic>c-Fos</italic> expression was shown to be induced through the MAPK pathway, which activates downstream transcription factors, such as Elk-1 and CREB/ATF1, which bind to the TCF (Elk-1), AP-1 and CRE (CREB/ATF1) elements of the <italic>c-Fos</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f2">2</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c39">39</xref>). Interestingly, CREB/ATF1 is known to recruit p300/CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c39">39</xref>), which might be responsible for the histone acetylation pattern observed over the AP-1 and CRE elements.</p><p>While our data suggest that the endogenous <italic>Cis</italic> promoter is targeted by HATs, the observation that TSA treatment did not result in histone hyperacetylation along the <italic>Cis</italic> gene also suggests that it is not targeted by histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities. We have shown previously that deacetylase inhibitors (TSA, SAHA, NaB) can prevent induction of STAT5 target genes, including <italic>Cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c22">22</xref>), therefore suggesting that a deacetylase activity is required for STAT5-mediated transcription. Our data also suggested that the inhibitory effect of those drugs is not mediated through changes in histone acetylation levels or chromatin accessibilities within the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c22">22</xref>). The present study thus confirms that the deacetylase activity required for STAT5 transactivation does not target histone H3 and H4 acetylation, and further support the involvement of a deacetylase specific for non-histone proteins.</p><p>We found that STAT5 binding to its target sites <italic>in vivo</italic> is closely associated with a local decrease in histone H3 and H4 acetylation. A similar decrease was observed on the endogenous <italic>Osm</italic> gene (data not shown), another STAT5 target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c40">40</xref>). Our data favor a model in which STAT5 binding limits access of histone acetyltransferases to chromatin, rather than active deacetylation. Although we cannot rule out that the observed acetylation pattern is the result of the action of a TSA-insensitive deacetylase, such as the Sir2-like family of deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c41">41</xref>), this appears unlikely since histone acetylation levels remained significantly high at that site, as compared to those at the <italic>c-Fos</italic> control gene. Our data suggest that this local acetylation pattern is a consequence of STAT5 binding since it was detected in unstimulated cells in which a mutant STAT5 protein (1&#x0002a;6) was constitutively bound to the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter, in the absence of other signaling. Whether this decrease in acetylation is a prerequisite for downstream events (such as chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation) remains to be elucidated.</p><p>We also show here that STAT5 DNA binding <italic>in vivo</italic> resulted in a local increase in chromatin accessibility to restriction endonucleases. Since this chromatin transition was detected in unstimulated 1&#x0002a;6 cells, it suggests that it is a consequence of, rather than a prerequisite for, STAT5 binding. Our data therefore support a model in which STAT5 binding induces chromatin remodeling. This remodeling could be the direct result of STAT5 DNA binding or could involve the recruitment of a chromatin remodeling complex by STAT5. Interestingly, analysis of the levels of acetylated and non-acetylated forms of histone H4 suggested the persistence of a nucleosome within the region overlapping the STAT5 binding sites. This observation therefore makes it unlikely that the increase in chromatin accessibility over that region is the result of a nucleosome loss, and rather suggests that it reflects either a conformational change in the nucleosome architecture, or nucleosome sliding along the <italic>Cis</italic> promoter. Chromatin reorganization at this site might be involved in the transcriptional activation process, by facilitating binding of STAT5 heterodimers on the adjacent binding sites and/or tetramer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c25">25</xref>), or by exposing a region of DNA previously unaccessible, thus permitting binding of transcriptional coactivators. Our data also confirmed that STAT5 binding and chromatin remodeling are necessary but not sufficient for transcriptional activation, as they occurred in unstimulated Ba/F3-1&#x0002a;6 cells in which <italic>Cis</italic> is not transcribed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f1">1</xref>A), and are not affected upon inhibition of transcription by TSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f3">3</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg907c22">22</xref>).</p><p>These conclusions are summarized in a model shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg907f6">6</xref>. Collectively, these studies reveal characteristic features of transcriptional regulation of the murine <italic>Cis</italic> gene in response to IL-3. They also highlight novel implications of the transcription factor STAT5, linking it to chromatin modification and remodeling <italic>in vivo</italic>, thus leading toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation by STAT5.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg907f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> STAT5-dependent and -independent expression of <italic>Cis</italic> and <italic>c-Fos</italic> in Ba/F3 cells stimulated with IL-3.
