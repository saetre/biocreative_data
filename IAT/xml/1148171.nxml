The protein and intron RNA function in a ribonucleoprotein particle, with much of the DNA target sequence recognized by base-pairing of the intron RNA. Consequently, group II introns can be reprogrammed to insert into specific or random DNA sites by substituting specific or random nucleotide residues in the intron RNA. Here, we show that an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> gene disruption library obtained using such randomly inserting Ll.LtrB introns contains most viable <italic>E.coli</italic> gene disruptions. Further, each inserted intron is targeted to a specific site by its unique base-pairing regions, and in most cases, could be recovered by PCR and used unmodified to obtain the desired single disruptant. Additionally, we identified a subset of introns that insert at sites lacking T+5, a nucleotide residue critical for second-strand cleavage. All such introns tested individually gave the desired specific disruption, some by switching to an alternate retrohoming mechanism targeting single-stranded DNA and using a nascent lagging DNA strand to prime reverse transcription.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Mobile group II introns use a remarkable mobility mechanism, termed retrohoming, in which the excised intron RNA uses its ribozyme activity to insert directly into a DNA target site by reverse-splicing and is then reverse-transcribed by the intron-encoded protein (IEP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Retrohoming is mediated by a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that contains the IEP and the excised intron RNA, with both used for DNA target site recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Because the IEP recognizes only a small number of fixed positions and most of the target specificity comes from base-pairing of the intron RNA to the DNA target sequence, it is possible to reprogram group II introns to insert into desired sites simply by modifying the intron RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). This feature combined with their very high insertion frequencies and specificity have made it possible to develop mobile group II introns into gene targeting vectors, dubbed &#x02018;targetrons&#x02019; [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>)]. A targetron derived from the <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> Ll.LtrB intron has been used for chromosomal gene disruption and site-specific DNA insertion in a variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>The RNPs that mediate retrohoming are formed when the IEP binds to the intron in unspliced precursor RNA and promotes its splicing by stabilizing the catalytically active RNA structure; it then remains bound to the excised intron lariat RNA in a stable RNP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). To initiate mobility, group II intron RNPs bind DNA and recognize target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). The DNA target site for the <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> Ll.LtrB intron used in the present work is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The initial recognition event is thought to involve major groove interactions between the IEP and a small number of specific bases in the distal 5&#x02032;-exon region, including T&#x02013;23, G&#x02013;21 and A&#x02013;20. These base interactions, bolstered by neighboring phosphate-backbone interactions and possibly minor groove interactions between positions &#x02212;18 and &#x02212;14, lead to local DNA unwinding, enabling the intron RNA to base-pair to the adjacent 14&#x02013;16 nt DNA sequence for reverse-splicing into the intron-insertion site. The intron RNA sequences involved in base-pairing are located in two RNA stem&#x02013;loops and are denoted exon-binding sites 1 and 2 (EBS1 and EBS2) and &#x003b4;, while the complementary DNA target-site sequences are denoted intron-binding sites 1 and 2 (IBS1 and IBS2) in the 5&#x02032; exon and &#x003b4;&#x02032; in the 3&#x02032; exon. Second-strand cleavage to generate the primer for reverse transcription requires additional interactions between the IEP and the 3&#x02032; exon, the most critical being recognition of T+5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). In the absence of second-strand cleavage, the Ll.LtrB intron has been shown to retrohome at low frequency by using nascent leading or lagging strands at DNA replication forks to prime reverse-transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), and such mechanisms are also used for retrohoming by group II introns that encode proteins lacking the DNA endonuclease (En) domain (referred to as En<sup>&#x02212;</sup> introns) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). In all cases, the IEP is thought to synthesize a full-length intron cDNA, which is then integrated into the recipient DNA by a DNA repair mechanism independent of homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>For use in gene targeting, the Ll.LtrB intron (targetron) is expressed from a donor plasmid, such as pACD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). This plasmid uses an inducible T7lac promoter to express a &#x00394;ORF-derivative of the intron and short flanking exons, with the LtrA ORF cloned just downstream of the 3&#x02032; exon. The LtrA protein expressed from this position still binds to the intron to promote RNA splicing and mobility, but when the &#x00394;ORF intron integrates at a new location, it is unable to splice in the absence of the IEP, yielding a gene disruption. Currently, the targetron is programmed to insert into different sites with the help of a computer algorithm, which scans the target sequence for the best matches to the positions recognized by the IEP and then designs primers from modifying the intron's EBS1, EBS2 and &#x003b4; sequences to insert into those sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The positions recognized by the IEP are sufficiently few and flexible that the algorithm readily identifies multiple rank-ordered target sites in any gene. The IBS1 and IBS2 sequences in the 5&#x02032; exon of the donor plasmid are also modified to be complementary to the retargeted EBS1 and EBS2 sequences for efficient RNA splicing. The necessary modifications are introduced into the donor plasmid by a two-step PCR, using three unique primers (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>4</sub>) and one &#x02018;fixed&#x02019; primer (P<sub>3</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Targetrons that insert at the desired site can be detected by a resulting phenotypic change, by colony PCR or by using a genetic marker inserted in intron domain IV, a non-essential region that extends outside of the intron's catalytic core. Particularly useful for gene targeting is a Retrotransposition Activated Marker (RAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>); also referred to as a Retrotransposition-Indicator Gene or RIG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). The RAM is a selectable gene, such as trimethoprim-resistance (<italic>Tp<sup>R</sup></italic>), inserted in the group II intron in the reverse orientation, but interrupted by an efficiently self-splicing group I intron in the forward orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). During retrotransposition via an RNA intermediate, the group I intron is spliced allowing direct selection of the marker after DNA integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>In addition to targeted disruption, the incorporation of a RAM makes it possible to use a targetron with randomized target-site recognition (EBS1, EBS2 and &#x003b4;) sequences to obtain a gene disruption library in which group II introns integrate at sites distributed throughout a genome, analogous to global transposon mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Here, we show that an <italic>E.coli</italic> gene disruption library obtained using this approach contains a high proportion of all viable disruptions. Further, unlike a conventional transposon, each of the inserted targetrons in the library is potentially targeted to a specific location by virtue of its unique EBS1, EBS2 and &#x003b4; sequences, and in most cases, could be recovered (&#x02018;fished&#x02019;) by PCR and inserted into a donor plasmid to give the desired single disruptant. Additionally, we identified a subset of introns that could be targeted to sites that lack T+5, including two that retrohome at relatively high frequency, apparently by targeting single-stranded DNA and using a nascent lagging DNA strand to prime reverse-transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and growth condition</title><p><italic>E.coli</italic> HMS174 (DE3) (F<sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>recA hsdR Rif</italic><sup>R</sup>) (Novagen, Madison, WI), which contains an isopropyl-&#x003b2;-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG)-inducible phage T7 RNA polymerase, was used for generating the chromosomal gene disruption library and for individual gene disruption experiments.

The frequency of targetron insertion at different sites could be influenced by many factors, including the fitness of the target sequence, the activity of the target gene, partial or complete occlusion of sites by DNA-binding proteins or the frequency of suitable targetrons in the donor-plasmid library. The distance of the target site from the DNA replication origin could also be a factor, although highly efficient targetrons can be obtained for sites distributed throughout the <italic>E.coli</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>The three genes for which we were unable to fish targetrons were <italic>b2654</italic> and <italic>b2856</italic>, both of which are very small (333 and 165 bp, respectively) and of unknown essentiality, and <italic>rfc</italic> (aka <italic>wbbH</italic>, 1167 bp), which encodes O antigen polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Neither the <italic>rfc</italic> gene nor other genes in the same operon are essential in <italic>E.coli</italic> K12 MG1655 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), and we were able to disrupt <italic>rfc</italic> at low frequency in HMS174(DE3) by using a computationally designed targetron (Rfc706a) with a <italic>Tp<sup>R</sup></italic>-RAM gene (data not shown). Thus, the failure to recover Rfc targetrons from the library could reflect either that the disruptants were underrepresented initially or that they grow slowly and were lost in the outgrowth step.</p></sec><sec><title>Characteristics of fished targetrons and their insertion sites</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> show compilations of nucleotide frequencies and base-pairing interactions at the 36 insertion sites of targetrons fished from the library. These data are generally in good agreement with those obtained previously for randomly integrated targetrons isolated from an <italic>E.coli</italic> gene disruption library by inverse PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Most of the isolated targetrons have good matches for the critical positions recognized by the IEP, including G&#x02013;21 (64%) and T+5 (78%), as well as good but not perfect EBS/IBS and &#x003b4;/&#x003b4;&#x02032; pairings (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The compilations show that the requirement for base-pairing is most stringent for positions &#x02212;12 to +1 (81&#x02013;100% base-pairing), and less stringent at position +2 (72%), while position +3 shows a previously noted strong preference for an A-residue in the intron RNA (73%) regardless of its potential base-pairing partner in the DNA target site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The apparent preference for the wild-type C&#x02013;28 (50%) was not seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) and likely reflects a statistical anomaly in the smaller data set in the present work.</p><p>Notably, several target sites deviate substantially from the canonical sequence recognized by the IEP, including some that were sites of multiple insertions by different targetrons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The latter include the target sites for AraD260s, AraD538a and MgtA1273s, all of which lack T&#x02013;23, G&#x02013;21, A&#x02013;20 and G&#x02013;17, and those for NarQ165s and NarQ1387a, both of which lack T+5, a critical nucleotide residue for second-strand cleavage. LacZ294s also appears to have a highly deviant target site with an unfavorable G at position &#x02212;23 and C at position &#x02212;21, and six mispairings between positions &#x02212;12 and +1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, we noticed that target site could conform to that for the wild-type Ll.LtrB intron if a single T residue at position &#x02212;4 was flipped-out to change the register by one nucleotide residue [see alternate pairing for LacZ294s (Alt) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>], and we confirmed that a target site in which T&#x02013;4 was deleted supported efficient retrohoming in a plasmid assay (data not shown). We show below that all of the targetrons that recognize deviant target sites still gave the expected disruption when tested individually.</p></sec><sec><title>Use of fished targetrons to obtain single disruptants</title><p>Thirty-one of the fished targetrons were recloned into the pACD3 and/or pACD3-Tp-RAM donor plasmid and transformed into <italic>E.coli</italic> HMS174(DE3) to see if they would give the desired single disruptant. We note that the target gene's 5&#x02032;-flanking sequences, which are cloned with the targetron into the donor plasmid (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), automatically contain IBS1 and IBS2 sequences complementary to the targetron's unique EBS1 and EBS2 sequences, since these base-pairing interactions were necessary for targetron integration by reverse-splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). In the donor construct, base-pairing between the targetron's EBS sequences and the complementary IBS sequences in the 5&#x02032; exon is necessary for RNA splicing to generate active RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>).</p><p>Of the 31 targetrons tested, 27 gave the desired single disruptant without further modification (results summarized under 'Targeted Disruption in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). In each case, insertion of the targetron at the correct site was confirmed by colony PCR and DNA sequencing (data not shown). The four targetrons that did not give the desired single disruptants, AraD288a, AraD538a<sub>1</sub>, MgtA2516a and RecD1620a, each contains mispairings in the EBS/IBS interactions. When retested after modifying their EBS sequences to form Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairs at the mispaired positions and to insert a preferred A residue at the &#x003b4;+3 position (targetrons indicated by asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), three gave the desired single disruptant. The RecD1620a targetron, which was confirmed to have the correct sequence, did not give the desired single disruption. It appears to have a favorable target site for IEP recognition, but its EBS2 sequence, 5&#x02032;-GGCGC, could mispair with a neighboring sequence just upstream in the intron RNA to disrupt the Id1 stem&#x02013;loop, which displays EBS2. Such mispairings have been found to result in low targeting efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>In general, more efficient targetrons had better matches to the wild-type target site and higher numbers of EBS/IBS and &#x003b4;/&#x003b4;&#x02032; base pairs than did the less efficient targetrons. However, even targetrons with deviant target sites or significant numbers of mispairings gave specific disruptions. The LacZ294s targetron, mentioned above, gave disruptions at a frequency of 1% by blue-white screening. YhbY84a<sub>2</sub> and MgtA1273s<sub>1</sub>, which have two or three mispairs at key positions, respectively, had targeting efficiencies sufficient to detect using the <italic>Tp<sup>R</sup></italic>-RAM, as did all four YgjH179a targetrons, despite mispairing at different positions in three of the targetrons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Finally, seven targetrons that insert at sites lacking T+5 were also tested, and all gave the desired specific disruptions (Lhr400s; MgtA606s, MgtA2466a, NarQ165s<sub>1</sub>, NarQ1387a<sub>1</sub>, RecD1682a, and YhbY107s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>A PCR method for inserting fished targetrons into donor plasmids without cloning</title><p>For high-throughput approaches, it is desirable to generate donor plasmids containing the fished targetrons without cloning. For this purpose, we developed the procedure diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> in which a 27 nt vector sequence (v) was added to the 5&#x02032; end of the target gene-specific primers used for targetron fishing. The resulting PCR product was then used in a second PCR with <italic>Eco</italic>RV-digested donor plasmid pACD3E-Tp-RAM-PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), yielding a non-covalently closed circular PCR product, which can be transformed directly into <italic>E.coli</italic>. This method avoids the use of a gene-specific restriction site flanking the target gene for blunt-end cloning into the vector. A test of this method in which the AraD260s<sub>1</sub> targetron was amplified directly into the pACD3E-Tp-RAM plasmid backbone gave the correct disruption at roughly the same frequency as the conventional cloning method (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Specificity of targetron insertion</title><p>Because some of the &#x02018;fished&#x02019; targetrons have suboptimal protein recognition and base-pairing interactions, there was a danger that they would be less specific than designed targetrons. To test the specificity of targetron insertion, we carried out Southern hybridizations for a randomly chosen disruptant obtained with each of the fished targetrons that was active in giving disruptants. In 22 cases, the Southern hybridizations showed a single prominent band of the size expected for site-specific insertion of the targetron into the target gene, while in the remaining eight cases (AraD288a*, AraD538a<sub>1</sub>*, Lhr4038a, MgtA606s, MgtA1300s<sub>1</sub>, MgtA2516a*, RuvA51s and YhbY84a<sub>2</sub>), the initial disruptant showed multiple bands. In these eight cases, we isolated 5&#x02013;10 additional transformants using a shorter induction period (2 h instead of 18 h; see Materials and Methods), and in each case, we obtained at least one transformant that gave a single integration at the desired site. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> shows Southern blots for the complete set of single disruptions for each targetron. We note that all seven of the tested targetrons that insert at sites lacking T+5 gave the desired single disruptant, with only one (MgtA606s) being in the group that initially gave multiple bands.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of retrohoming into target sites that lack T+5</title><p>Those targetrons that insert at sites lacking T+5 could do so either by an En-dependent pathway with inefficient second-strand cleavage or by En-independent pathways using nascent leading or lagging DNA strands to prime reverse-transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). To help distinguish these possibilities, we tested the ability of each targetron to retrohome into its target site cloned in recipient plasmids in opposite orientations relative to the direction of DNA replication. The assay used is diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>. In this assay, the Amp<sup>R</sup> recipient plasmids pBRR3A and pBRR3B contain the target site cloned immediately upstream of a promoterless <italic>tet<sup>R</sup></italic> in orientations denoted LAG or LEAD, according to whether a nascent lagging or leading DNA strand could be used to prime reverse-transcription of the inserted intron RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). The donor intron contains a phage T7 promoter inserted near its 3&#x02032; end, so that its insertion into the target site activates the expression of the <italic>tet<sup>R</sup></italic> gene. Mobility frequencies are then determined from the ratio of (Tet<sup>R</sup> + Amp<sup>R</sup>)/Amp<sup>R</sup> colonies.</p><p>In previous work using the above assay, we found that retrohoming of the Ll.LtrB intron under conditions where second-strand cleavage is inhibited by mutations in either the IEP or DNA target site shows a pronounced bias for the LEAD orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). This bias is thought to reflect that when the intron reverse-splices into double-stranded DNA prior to passage of a replication fork, it is positioned to directly use a nascent leading-strand primer, while use of a lagging-strand primer requires the potentially disruptive passage of the replication fork through the inserted intron. In contrast, some En<sup>&#x02212;</sup> group II introns are thought to insert preferentially into single-stranded DNA at replication forks, enabling the efficient use of lagging-strand primers, and such introns show the opposite orientation bias in this type of assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>The results of the assays for the wild-type Ll.LtrB intron and those targetrons that insert into sites lacking T+5 are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>. As expected, the wild-type Ll.LtrB intron, which uses an En-dependent retrohoming pathway, showed no significant orientation bias. Five of the seven target sites lacking T+5 are located on the leading template strand of the <italic>E.coli</italic> chromosome. In the plasmid assay, all of these sites were used at either low or undetectable frequency. Three of these sites (Lhr400s, MgtA2466a and RecD1682a) showed a clear bias for insertion into the leading template strand, the pattern expected for the reverse-splicing into double-stranded DNA and use of a nascent leading DNA strand to prime reverse-transcription, while the other two sites (NarQ165s and YhbY107s) showed no significant strand bias, the pattern expected for an En-dependent pathway with inefficient second-strand cleavage.</p><p>The remaining two target sites lacking T+5 are located on the lagging template strand of the <italic>E.coli</italic> chromosome. In the plasmid assay, one of these sites (MgtA606s) showed a very pronounced bias for the lagging template strand, with a relatively high insertion frequency (7.4%) in that orientation, and no detectable insertion in the opposite orientation (&#x0003c;0.0001%). This bias is expected for reverse-splicing into single-stranded DNA and use a nascent lagging strand to prime reverse-transcription. The inability of MgtA606s to reverse-splice into double-stranded DNA may reflect suboptimal IEP recognition in the 5&#x02032; exon and/or that it has relatively weak base pairs at EBS2/IBS2 positions &#x02212;12 and &#x02212;11 (U&#x02013;A and A&#x02013;T), which are thought to be critical for nucleating local DNA unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>The other site found on the lagging template strand of the <italic>E.coli</italic> chromosome, NarQ1387a, showed a substantial bias for the LAG orientation (9.6%), but also supports relatively efficient retrohoming in the LEAD orientation (1.2%). This pattern suggests preferential targeting of single-stranded DNA, but substantial reverse-splicing into double-stranded DNA. The ability of the NarQ1387a<sub>1</sub> targetron to efficiently reverse-splice into double-stranded DNA may reflect that its EBS2/IBS2 pairing consists largely of stable GC or CG base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), thereby favoring displacement of the opposite strand for reverse-splicing into double-stranded DNA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUMMARY AND PROSPECTS</title><p>The targetron fishing approach selects targetrons that have successfully inserted into desired target genes and uses them as reagents to obtain specific single disruptions. Despite the previously observed preference for targetron insertion near the chromosome replication origin under similar conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), the library obtained here is sufficiently complex to contain most viable <italic>E.coli</italic> gene disruptants. The fished targetrons can in principle be used to obtain disruptions in any bacterial strain, so long as the target sequence does not deviate at significant positions. The remarkable finding is that a high proportion of the fished targetrons gave the desired single disruptant without further modification, even if there were mispairings in the EBS/IBS and &#x003b4;&#x02013;&#x003b4;&#x02032; interactions. By selecting only targetrons that have inserted successfully, the fishing approach avoids factors that could negatively impact intron-insertion frequency and have not yet been incorporated into computer algorithms for target site selection and intron design. These include the effect of higher-order DNA structure and thermal stability profiles of the target sites, protein-binding at DNA target sites, and the deleterious effects of different combinations of nucleotide residues on intron RNA structure. Targetron fishing also has the advantage of requiring only two target gene-specific primers and a simple single-step PCR, compared to a more complex PCR for retargeting computationally designed group II introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>The finding that some targetrons retain specificity even in the absence of perfect EBS/IBS and &#x003b4;&#x02013;&#x003b4;&#x02032; interactions implies a significant degree of redundancy in the RNA and protein interactions used for target site selection. Additionally, we were surprised by the number of the fished targetrons that gave specific disruptions despite substantial deviations from current target site-selection rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). One of these, LacZ294s, appears to recognize its target site by flipping out one target site nucleotide residue in the base-paired region, and seven targetrons insert specifically at sites lacking T+5, which is critical for second-strand cleavage. Two of these targetrons appear to insert at relatively high efficiency by targeting single-stranded DNA and using a nascent lagging strand to prime reverse-transcription, a mechanism used by En<sup>&#x02212;</sup> group II introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Thus, in addition to providing a rapid method for obtaining validated targetrons, our results show that Ll.LtrB can be targeted to a much greater range of sites than predicted by the current computer algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), including sites used preferentially in single-stranded DNA and without second-strand cleavage. Finally, our findings indicate that En<sup>+</sup>-group II introns can switch surprisingly readily to En-independent retrohoming pathways, thereby facilitating their dispersal to new target sites. Such a switch may in turn lead to dispensability of the En domain, possibly contributing to its loss multiple times during evolution in different group II intron lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank rotation students Yamin Li, Zhi Guo, Kay-Yin Lo and Shaofei Tu for help with some experiments, and Jiri Perutka for comments on the manuscript and help with computer-based design of targeted group II introns.

Key bases recognized by the IEP (gray shading) include T&#x02212;23, G&#x02212;21 and A&#x02212;20 in the 5&#x02032; exon and T+5 in the 3&#x02032; exon; T+5 is required only for second-strand cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).

The intron is retargeted by modifying its EBS2, EBS1 and &#x003b4; sequences to base-pair to the IBS2, IBS1 and &#x003b4;&#x02032; sequences in the DNA target site. The IBS1 and IBS2 sequences in the donor plasmid are also modified to base-pair to the intron's retargeted EBS1 and EBS2 sequences for efficient RNA splicing.

T&#x003c6; is a phage T7 transcription terminator. (<bold>B</bold>) Mobility frequencies. The target site is indicated to the left with (LEAD) or (LAG) indicating whether the site is located on the leading- or lagging-template strand of the <italic>E.coli</italic> chromosome. Mobility frequencies (%) are the mean &#x000b1; SD for at least three replicate experiments for each targetron/target site combination.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gki649f10"/></fig><table-wrap
