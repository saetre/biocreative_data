The molecules involved in pDC accumulation in psoriasis lesions are unknown. Chemerin is the only inflammatory chemotactic factor that is directly active on human blood pDC in vitro. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the chemerin/ChemR23 axis in the recruitment of pDC in psoriasis skin. Prepsoriatic skin adjacent to active lesions and early lesions were characterized by a strong expression of chemerin in the dermis and by the presence of CD15<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> neutrophils and CD123<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/BDCA-2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/ChemR23<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> pDC. Conversely, skin from chronic plaques showed low chemerin expression, segregation of neutrophils to epidermal microabscesses, and few pDC in the dermis. Chemerin expression was localized mainly in fibroblasts, mast cells, and endothelial cells. Fibroblasts cultured from skin of psoriatic lesions expressed higher levels of chemerin messenger RNA and protein than fibroblasts from uninvolved psoriatic skin or healthy donors and promoted pDC migration in vitro in a chemerin-dependent manner. Therefore, chemerin expression specifically marks the early phases of evolving skin psoriatic lesions and is temporally strictly associated with pDC. These results support a role for the chemerin/ChemR23 axis in the early phases of psoriasis development.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: AD, atopic dermatitis; LS, lesional; mRNA, messenger RNA; NLS, nonlesional; pDC, plasmacytoid DC.</p></fn><fn><p>G.

Upon viral stimulation, pDC differentiate into a unique type of mature DC, which directly regulates T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Circulating pDC directly migrate to secondary lymphoid organs through the expression of CD62L and some chemotactic receptors, namely CXCR4, CXCR3, CCR5, and ChemR23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). pDC also infiltrate peripheral tissues in a few pathological conditions, such as some skin immune-mediated diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, lichen planus, and psoriasis), allergic contact dermatitis reactions, and certain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>).</p><p>Psoriasis is one of the most common T cell&#x02013;mediated inflammatory diseases in humans. It is characterized by a chronic course with relapses triggered by environmental factors such as trauma, infections, stress, and drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Recently, it was reported that resting pDC infiltrate lesional (LS) skin of patients affected by psoriasis and, once activated, produce high levels of IFN-&#x003b1; that in turn drive the local activation and expansion of pathogenetic T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). These are mainly represented by Th17 and Tc1 lymphocytes and are directly responsible for the development of psoriatic skin lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). The chemotactic factors involved in the recruitment of pDC to prepsoriatic skin are currently unknown. Accumulating evidence supports a role for chemerin and its cognate receptor ChemR23 in the recruitment of pDC into pathological peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Chemerin is a protein, originally isolated from inflamed biological fluids (i.e., ovarian cancer ascites and rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluids), which is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein that binds ChemR23 with low affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Prochemerin can be rapidly converted into a full ChemR23 agonist by the proteolytic removal of the last six or seven amino acids by neutrophil-derived proteases (elastase and cathepsin G), mast cell products (tryptase), proteases of the coagulation cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>), and certain bacterial proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>).</p><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible role of the chemerin/ChemR23 axis in the recruitment of pDC to the skin of psoriasis patients. This study shows that chemerin expression selectively marks the early phases of psoriasis lesions and strongly parallels pDC and neutrophil dermal infiltration. Collectively, these results propose chemerin as a key protein in the early phases of psoriasis lesion development.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Chemerin is highly expressed in psoriatic LS skin</title><p>Based on previous work showing that pDC abundantly infiltrate psoriatic skin, we sought to assess chemerin presence in psoriatic plaque lesions. Chemerin expression and distribution were investigated by immunohistochemistry in both uninvolved and LS skin of psoriatic patients and, in parallel, in skin of patients affected by atopic dermatitis (AD) or healthy individuals. Skin biopsies from psoriatic lesions showed numerous chemerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells localized in the dermis and scattered throughout the T cell&#x02013;rich infiltrate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In contrast, only a few chemerin immunoreactive cells were detected in the dermis of uninvolved psoriatic skin or healthy skin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>, respectively) or in the dermis of AD lesions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Double staining analysis revealed that the majority of chemerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were dermal cells with a fibroblast morphology coexpressing vimentin, which is a typical mesenchymal cell marker (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Some of the dermal chemerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells also coexpressed FVIII<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, which stains blood endothelial cells (&#x0223c;20% of dermal vessels), and &#x0223c;5% of total chemerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells expressed c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, which is a mast cell marker (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>, respectively). Conversely, chemerin immunoreactivity did not colocalize with CD15<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, BDCA-2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD1a<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD1b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, or CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> markers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>; and not depicted). Finally, expression of chemerin immunoreactivity was also observed in the epidermal compartment of healthy or uninvolved psoriatic skin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). On the contrary, and in agreement with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), LS psoriatic plaques displayed a weak chemerin expression in the epidermis that was confined to the keratinocyte suprabasal layer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Chemerin expression in healthy and diseased skin.</bold> Immunohistochemistry was performed with an anti-chemerin mAb (red) on the following: a, LS (12 different subjects); b, nonlesional (NLS; 10 different subjects); c, normal skin from healthy donors (6 different subjects); and d, AD LS skin (5 different subjects).

Consistent with the immunohistochemical findings, chemerin messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, evaluated by quantitative PCR, were significantly higher (&#x0003e;50%; P &#x0003c; 0.01) in fibroblasts obtained from LS psoriatic skin compared with those from NLS skin of the same patients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Fibroblasts from healthy donors expressed levels of chemerin mRNA that were only slightly reduced compared with fibroblasts from uninvolved skin of psoriatic patients, suggesting that the different genetic background of psoriatic cells does not have an influence on the basal levels of chemerin expression. Regulation of chemerin production was investigated at the protein level in cultures of fibroblasts stimulated with some of the proinflammatory cytokines that characterize psoriatic plaque lesions (e.g., IFN-&#x003b3;, IFN-&#x003b1;, TNF-&#x003b1;, and CXCL8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) or with factors known to regulate fibroblast growth, such as retinoic acid, calcitriol, and TGF-&#x003b2;. Basal chemerin release from healthy donor and NLS psoriatic skin fibroblasts was similar (321 &#x000b1; 31 vs. 436 &#x000b1; 84 pg/ml; mean &#x000b1; SD; P &#x0003d; 0.07), whereas LS psoriatic fibroblast cultures released higher amounts of chemerin (702 &#x000b1; 110 pg/ml; P &#x0003c; 0.01), which is in agreement with mRNA data. Among the different experimental conditions tested, only calcitriol induced a significant up-regulation of chemerin production (P &#x0003c; 0.01). Retinoic acid induced only a minor increment of chemerin release (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>), whereas all the other agonists tested did not show any effect on chemerin basal production independent of the source of fibroblasts (not depicted). The three fibroblast types investigated, namely from healthy donor skin, and NLS and LS skin from the same patients with psoriasis showed the same degree of chemerin regulation independent of basal levels of chemerin production (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Selective expression of chemerin by fibroblasts isolated of psoriatic LS skin.</bold> (A) Chemerin expression was determined in fibroblast primary cultures prepared from skin cells isolated from healthy donors (five donors) as well as NLS and LS skin of the same psoriatic patients (six donors).

Chemerin<sup>low</sup> skin lesions also showed the markers of chronic inflammation, such as CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell infiltration in the epidermis and the intense ICAM-1 immunoreactivity of basal keratinocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B, n and q</xref>). CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were present in a similar manner in both chemerin<sup>high</sup> and chemerin<sup>low</sup> biopsies (Fig. S3, a and b, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080129/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080129/DC1</ext-link>). Similarly, CXCL10 and CXCL12 expression was equally present in early (chemerin<sup>high</sup>) and chronic (chemerin<sup>low</sup>) LS skin (Fig. S3, d, e, g, and h). AD skin lesions presented only a negligible infiltration of pDC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>, i), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), which was not associated with dermal chemerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A, c</xref>) or CD15<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> neutrophils (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B, l</xref>). The presence of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T lymphocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B, o</xref>), CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC (Fig. S3, c), and focal ICAM-1 positivity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B, r</xref>) in the epidermis of AD skin is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). The quantification of chemerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, ChemR23<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD123<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, BDCA-2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD15<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, and CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the different experimental conditions is reported in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>.</p><p>Finally, to definitively establish whether chemerin expression might be an early event leading to the initial infiltration of pDC in psoriatic skin, chemerin expression and pDC infiltration were investigated in NLS prepsoriatic skin adjacent to newly developed plaque lesions. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 (b and h)</xref> shows that chemerin was expressed in the dermis of prepsoriatic skin and was associated with the initial, still limited infiltration of BDCA-2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) and CD123<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (not depicted) pDC. Dermal chemerin expression was further increased in the proximal plaque lesions and was associated with extensive infiltration of BDCA-2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/CD123<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> pDC (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, c and i</xref>; and not depicted). Both chemerin expression and pDC recruitment was not observed in the dermis of distant NLS psoriatic skin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, a and g</xref>). In contrast, CXCL10 expression was detectable only within the plaque lesions and was confined to basal layer epidermis in both adjacent and 3-cm distant NLS psoriatic skin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, d-f</xref>), showing a pattern of expression different from that of chemerin and pDC infiltration. Collectively, these results indicate that chemerin expression is an early event in psoriasis plaque development, and it precedes and parallels the recruitment of pDC into developing skin lesions.</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Chemerin is highly expressed in prepsoriatic skin where BDCA-2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> pDC start to be accumulated.</bold> Immunohistochemistry was performed using sections from early psoriatic plaques at sites of peripheral lesions (LS) together with the adjacent prepsoriatic NLS skin and biopsies from normal skin appearing 3 cm distant from the evolving plaques of the same patients (five total patients examined).

In vivo, chemerin expression was shown to correlate with pDC infiltration into peripheral tissues during autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and lichen planus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). In this paper, we report that expression of chemerin is temporally strictly associated with pDC recruitment in psoriatic skin biopsies. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease characterized by a profound T cell dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Growing evidences propose a pivotal role for pDC in the triggering of the inflammatory reactions associated with psoriasis, and the current model depicts pDC as key effector cells that drive the activation of pathogenetic T cells through their ability to release high levels of IFN-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Previous studies have focused on the role of innate immunity in psoriasis. Neutrophils and mast cells are known to infiltrate psoriasis skin plaque lesions during the early phases of the disease, whereas both cell types are more rarely found in the late chronic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Immunohistological features of chronic lesions are also characterized by a prominent CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell infiltrate in the epidermis and by ICAM-1 expression by basal layer keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). In addition, CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> iNOS<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> myeloid DC also infiltrate psoriatic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). These data indicate that psoriatic lesions markedly change their inflammatory cell profile according to the development stage, with different cell types playing distinct roles in earlier versus later stages.</p><p>In this paper, we report that in psoriatic skin lesions, pDC accumulation is almost exclusively associated with the concomitant presence of neutrophils and mast cells in the dermis. In contrast, psoriatic skin specimens characterized by the presence of intraepidermal neutrophils and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, ICAM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> keratinocytes, and a few c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> dermal mast cells were associated to a scanty presence of pDC. The majority of CD123<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and BDCA-2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> pDC expressed ChemR23, the chemerin receptor, and chemerin expression in the dermis was only observed in association with pDC infiltration. Analysis of uninvolved prepsoriatic skin that was adjacent to active plaque lesions demonstrated that chemerin is already expressed in the dermis in pre-LS sites, where pDC start to become recruited. Therefore, chemerin expression represents an early event that precedes and strictly parallels accumulation of pDC and clinical expression of psoriasis. Moreover, recruitment of pDC in psoriatic skin lesions is associated with infiltration of neutrophils and numerous mast cells in the dermis. In this context, it is interesting to note that activated neutrophils and mast cells can convert prochemerin into active chemerin through the release of cathepsin G, elastase, and tryptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). These proteolytic enzymes can also regulate keratinocyte proliferation, although their precise role in psoriasis pathogenesis is still elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Of note, immunohistochemical stainings of CXCL12 and CXCL10 showed that these two chemokines were equally expressed in chronic versus early psoriatic skin lesions (Fig. S3), arguing against a direct role in pDC recruitment into psoriatic lesions. To confirm the specificity of these findings, we studied LS AD skin, which did not express chemerin and was scantly infiltrated by pDC.</p><p>In psoriatic dermis, chemerin immunoreactivity was observed in endothelial cells, mast cells, and fibroblasts. Chemerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> blood vessel endothelial cells have been also observed in the skin of lupus erythematosus and lichen planus patients. In addition, chemerin is expressed by high endothelial cells in the lymph node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). The expression of chemerin by mast cells represents a new finding, and it is interesting in light of the ability of these cells to generate active chemerin through the release of tryptase. However, fibroblasts apparently represent the major source of chemerin in psoriatic dermis. This in vivo finding was further substantiated in vitro by the use of primary cell cultures. Fibroblasts isolated from LS skin expressed higher levels of chemerin mRNA than cells obtained from uninvolved skin of the same patients or skin obtained from healthy donors. Moreover, only supernatants of fibroblasts obtained from LS skin of psoriatic patients, and not from healthy donor or NLS psoriatic skin, induced the migration of pDC in vitro and activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is an early step of chemotactic receptor signaling cascade, in ChemR23-transfected cells. These activities were completely blocked in the presence of an anti-ChemR23 blocking antibody with no effect of anti-CXCR3 and -CXCR4 antibodies. Furthermore, pDC migration to psoriatic skin fibroblast supernatants was completely inhibited (desensitized) by a precedent exposure of the cells to recombinant chemerin. Altogether, these results strongly indicate that chemerin is the main, if not the only, protein responsible for the pDC chemotactic activity that is present in the conditioned medium of psoriatic skin fibroblasts. Taking into consideration that fibroblasts from healthy and NLS psoriatic skin also release chemerin/prochemerin, the selective ability of psoriatic fibroblasts to promote pDC migration is likely to be crucially regulated by the concomitant higher expression of proteases by these cells and, thus, by their higher efficiency in generating bioactive chemerin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the nature of the signals present within the psoriatic inflammatory milieu that is responsible for the induction of chemerin production, fibroblasts at early culture passages were stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors that characterize psoriatic lesions such as IFN-&#x003b3;, IFN-&#x003b1;, TNF-&#x003b1;, CXCL8, retinoic acid, calcitriol, and TGF-&#x003b2;. Among the different experimental conditions investigated, only calcitriol and, to a lesser extent, retinoic acid were able to induce the up-regulation of chemerin protein release. Therefore, as previously described for endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), the mechanisms that govern chemerin expression in pathological conditions still need to be fully elucidated.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry analyses also showed a diffuse chemerin expression in the epidermis. Chemerin epidermal expression was higher in healthy and uninvolved psoriatic skin than in plaque lesions. The biological role of chemerin in the epidermis is unknown, but it can be speculated that under homeostatic conditions chemerin may represent a ready-to-use mechanism to rapidly recruit effector cells upon the generation of danger signals. Recently, chemerin was shown to play a role in the resolution of the inflammatory process at the mucosal sites by promoting the clearance of epithelial bound neutrophils through a CD55/ICAM-1&#x02013;dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). This function might sustain the transmigration of neutrophils in the parakeratotic areas as observed in chronic psoriatic skin, and it is consistent with the expression of chemerin found both in vitro and in vivo in differentiated keratinocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and not depicted). The possible antiinflammatory action of chemerin in the epidermis was also suggested in a previous study showing the up-regulation of chemerin (Tig-2) in psoriatic epidermis after topical application of tazarotene, an antipsoriatic synthetic retinoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). In contrast, calcitriol, an effective antipsoriatic agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), was the most potent inducer of chemerin in cultured fibroblasts. Finally, a recent study reported that chemerin exhibits antiinflammatory activity on macrophages in vitro and in vivo in a proteolysis-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Therefore, chemerin might have a dual opposite role during the evolution of psoriatic skin lesions: first, a crucial role in the recruitment of pathogenetic pDC during the early phases of the disease when expressed in the dermis; and subsequently, during the chronic phase, the expression of chemerin in the epidermis may favor leukocyte clearance from inflamed tissue and restoration of skin homeostasis.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified the chemerin/ChemR23 axis as a new important player in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The concomitant presence of chemerin, pDC, neutrophils, and mast cells during the early phases of the disease proposes chemerin as a target for prevention and early therapeutic intervention in psoriasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Tissue samples.</title><p>For immunohistochemistry, 4-mm punch biopsies were taken from LS (involved) skin of adult patients with early lesions (&#x0003c;10 d; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 8) and late plaque psoriasis (&#x0003e;2 mo; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 12).
