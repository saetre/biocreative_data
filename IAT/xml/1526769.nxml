Although transmission can be successfully interrupted using antibiotics and improvements in public and personal hygiene, the long-term success of the control programmes advocated by the World Health Organization are still uncertain. For the complete control and prevention of trachoma, a vaccine would be highly desirable. Currently there are no licensed vaccines for trachoma, and no human vaccine trials have been conducted since the 1960s. A barrier to new attempts to design and introduce a vaccine is the identification of immunologic correlates of protective immunity or immunopathology. We studied important correlates of the immune response in a trachoma-endemic population in order to improve our knowledge of this disease. This is essential for the successful development of a vaccine against both ocular and genital <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. trachomatis</named-content> infection.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We used quantitative real-time PCR for <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. trachomatis</named-content> 16S rRNA to identify conjunctival infection. The expression of <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;, IDO, IL-10,</italic> and <italic>FOXP3</italic> mRNA transcripts was measured. We evaluated the role of immune effector and regulatory responses in the control of chlamydial infection and in the resolution of clinical signs of trachoma in endemic communities in Gambia. All host transcripts examined were detectable even in normal conjunctiva. The levels of these transcripts were increased, compared to normal uninfected conjunctiva, when infection was detected, with or without clinical disease signs. Interestingly, when clinical disease signs were present in the absence of infection, the expression of a regulatory T cell transcription factor, <italic>FOXP3,</italic> remained elevated.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There is evidence of an increase in the magnitude of the local anti-chlamydial cytokine immune responses with age. This increase is coupled to a decline in the prevalence of infection and active trachoma, suggesting that effective adaptive immunity is acquired over a number of years. The anti-chlamydial and inflammatory immune response at the conjunctival surface, which may control chlamydial replication, is closely matched by counter inflammatory or regulatory <italic>IL-10</italic> expression. Differences in the level of <italic>FOXP3</italic> expression in the conjunctiva may indicate a role for regulatory T cells in the resolution of the conjunctival immune response, which is important in protection from immunopathology. However, the expression of cytokines that control chlamydial replication and those that regulate the conjunctival immune response is not simply juxtaposed; the interaction between the infection and the clinical disease process is therefore more complex.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The immune response in a trachoma-endemic population showed an increase in local anti-chlamydial cytokine responses with age, associated with a decline in the prevalence of infection and active trachoma.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec id="sb1"><title/><sec id="sb1a"><title>Background.</title><p>Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. Six million people&#x02014;most of whom live in crowded, unhygienic conditions with limited water supplies&#x02014;are blind because of repeated eye infections with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Chlamydia trachomatis</named-content>. This bacterium passes easily from person to person on hands or clothing and is also spread by flies. Successive infections starting in childhood cause progressive scarring of the inside of the eyelid. Eventually, the eyelashes turn inwards and rub painfully over the front of the eye (the cornea). This causes corneal scarring, loss of corneal transparency, and, finally, irreversible loss of sight, usually in adulthood. <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. trachomatis</named-content> infections can be prevented by improving personal hygiene and by reducing fly breeding sites, and they can be treated with antibiotics. In addition, early scarring of the eyelid and turned-in eyelashes can be treated surgically.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Through the above interventions, the World Health Organization hopes to eliminate trachoma by 2020, but a vaccine might also be necessary. To develop a vaccine, the human immune response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. trachomatis</named-content> needs to be better understood. As with other diseases, the immune response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. trachomatis</named-content> includes a pro-inflammatory side, which activates immune cells to attack the bacteria, and a regulatory side, which keeps the pro-inflammatory responses in check. The balance between these two sides is not perfect, however. Although the immune response deals with <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. trachomatis</named-content> infections efficiently, it also causes some of the tissue damage that leads to scarring and loss of sight. In this study, the researchers have investigated the human immune response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. trachomatis</named-content> to provide immunological information that might help vaccine development.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers examined school children living in Gambia, where trachoma is very common, for clinical signs of active trachoma (for example, red or swollen eyelids). To find out which children were infected with <italic>C. trachomatis,</italic> the researchers collected a few cells from the surface of their eyes and looked for a ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecule that is only made by <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. trachomatis</named-content>. The researchers also looked in these samples for human messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that are made during pro-inflammatory and regulatory immune responses.</p><p>The children formed four groups based on infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. trachomatis</named-content> and clinical signs. Some children&#x02014;particularly the older ones&#x02014;were uninfected and had no clinical signs. Others were infected but showed no clinical signs&#x02014;these children were incubating the bacteria. Some were infected and had clinical disease; these children had the highest bacterial loads. Finally, children recovering from an infection carried no bacteria but still had some clinical signs.</p><p>The researchers detected different types of immune response in each of these groups. Children incubating the bacteria had a strong pro-inflammatory response&#x02014;their immune systems were trying to fight off infection. The pro-inflammatory response was even stronger in the infected children with clinical signs, but now the regulatory response had also increased, presumably to limit inflammation. In children in the recovery phase, only regulatory immune cells, which were making an mRNA from a gene called <italic>FOXP3,</italic> remained active.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>The relative rarity of infections and active disease in older children together with indications of a more active immune response to infection indicates that protective immunity to <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. trachomatis</named-content> is acquired through repeated exposure to it. This bodes well for the development of a vaccine, which would speed up the acquisition of this natural immunity. Furthermore, the new information about immune responses at different stages of infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. trachomatis</named-content> should help in vaccine design. The findings need to be confirmed by tracking immune responses in individual children during episodes of infection, but could then be used to help design vaccines that produce good protective immunity against <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. trachomatis</named-content> without causing too much collateral tissue damage. The current results suggest, for example, that regulatory immune cells are important in limiting the inflammatory response, so vaccine developers may need to ensure that their vaccines stimulate the production of this sort of cell as well as of the pro-inflammatory cells needed to clear the infection.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030266">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030266</ext-link>.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02002;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=372">NHS Direct Online</ext-link> patient information on trachoma</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02002;World Health Organization information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/trachoma/en">trachoma</ext-link> and its <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/blindness/causes/priority/en/index2.html">elimination</ext-link></p><p>&#x02022;&#x02002;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/trachoma_t.htm">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</ext-link> general information on trachoma</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02002;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001486.htm">MedlinePlus</ext-link> encyclopedia entry on trachoma</p></sec></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Faal N, Bailey RL, Jeffries D, Joof H, Sarr I, et al.

In the United Kingdom, the Health Protection Agency found that in 45- to 64-y-old women, rates of chlamydial sexually transmitted infection increased by 177&#x00025; between 1995 and 2003 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;.

Examination of the immune response as the infection unfolds is key to understanding the immunopathogenesis of ocular <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. trachomatis</named-content> infection (OCI). Infectious diseases are often characterised by an incubation period, in which infection is present without clinical disease; a period during which both infection and disease are present; and a period when clinical signs persist after infection has been cleared &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Miller et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d; have proposed that OCI follows such a pattern based on the clinical and microbiological observation of trachoma. Earlier work by our group supports this proposal &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. We identified individuals with infection in the absence of clinical disease, and individuals with clinical signs in the absence of infection. Follow-up examination found that individuals who were PCR-positive but clinically negative were more likely to develop clinical signs than PCR-negative individuals. Conversely, clinical signs were twice as likely to have resolved after 1 mo in PCR-negative individuals with disease as in those who were PCR-positive. Dissection of the immune response in individuals at these times should identify key components of the immune response associated with the acquisition or resolution of infection and clinical signs of trachoma.</p><p>Using quantitative PCR it is now possible to study immunity to OCI in humans at the conjunctival surface. This approach has been used in studies in trachoma-endemic populations in Tanzania and Gambia. Bobo et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, in a cross-sectional study of both adults and children, used a polymerase chain reaction&#x02013;enzyme immuno-assay to detect a number of cytokine transcripts and found a predominantly pro-inflammatory response in trachoma. Burton et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, in a similar study in Gambian individuals, found that transcripts associated with pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and fibrogenic processes were increased in active trachoma. Markers indicative of a T cell response (interferon gamma &#x0005b;IFN-&#x003b3;&#x0005d;, interleukin &#x0005b;IL&#x0005d;&#x02013;4, IL-12p40, and perforin) were increased when chlamydial infection was present. This demonstrated that, in a complex response, differences associated with infection and clinical signs could be identified.</p><p>A key factor in the immune response to chlamydial infection in both humans and animal models is IFN-&#x003b3; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

A role for <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-specific regulatory T cells has not yet been investigated in trachoma; yet evidence from many chronic infectious diseases suggests that these important regulators of the immune response are central to the development of a balanced and effective immune response, particularly at sites of infection. Regulatory T cells can be identified by a combination of phenotypic markers, the majority of which are not unique to this cell type. We used the most reliable marker for naturally occurring and induced regulatory T cells, forkhead box p3 (FOXP3), as an indicator of regulatory T cell activity in different phases of infection and disease caused by OCI.</p><p>We present results of a cross-sectional study of OCI and the clinical signs of trachoma in children living in trachoma-endemic communities.

During OCI and the appearance of clinical signs both inflammatory (<italic>IFN-&#x003b3;</italic>) and regulatory <italic>(IL-10)</italic> cytokine gene expression is increased. Epithelial conjunctival <italic>IDO</italic> expression is also induced, with evidence that the expression levels of these three genes increase with age. The age-related decline in the prevalence of OCI and clinical disease is most likely due to the improvement of these adaptive immune responses. The conjunctival expression of <italic>FOXP3</italic> points to an important contribution of regulatory T cells, which have thus far not been described in chlamydial diseases. Interestingly, of the gene transcripts studied, <italic>FOXP3</italic> is the only transcript expressed above normal levels in individuals with clinical signs of disease but in whom current infection cannot be identified. Further work needs to establish if <italic>FOXP3</italic> expression and regulatory T cells in such individuals are beneficial or exacerbate disease.</p><p>Both qualitative DNA-based PCR and quantitative chlamydial 16S rRNA RT-PCR tests identify individuals in whom there is discordance between infection and clinical signs of trachoma. It has been established that the clinical signs of trachoma can persist for long periods of time after infection can no longer be detected &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Our data are consistent with a classical progression of infection&#x02014;incubation, concordant clinical signs of disease and infection, followed by the reduction or clearance of infection with residual clinical disease signs&#x02014;since we find evidence of the existence of these four phases in study participants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. We have revealed that it is possible to identify discrete patterns of conjunctival mRNA expression in these phases that are most characteristic of the immune response in each phase. These data provide evidence underscoring the importance of the IFN-&#x003b3; response in the local control of infection and evidence of the presence of regulatory T cells in human OCI.</p><p>In the pre-clinical, incubation phase of infection prior to disease onset there are low chlamydial loads associated with an immune profile that is largely type-1 inflammatory, with increased expression of <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;</italic> and <italic>IDO</italic>. In a previous study of the conjunctival cytokine responses of a small group of individuals followed over a 6-mo period, we found a strong positive correlation between the amount of chlamydial 16S rRNA and <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;</italic> mRNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. We now demonstrate that <italic>IDO</italic> is also highly expressed in the conjunctiva. This expression is greatest in the next phase, when clinical signs and the highest infection loads are coincident. Like the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, <italic>IL-10</italic> and <italic>FOXP3</italic> expression is also higher in this phase than in normal conjunctiva. The effect of IL-10 and the presence of FOXP3 may possibly counteract the high degree of inflammation; however, antagonism of IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated chlamydial inhibition by IL-10 may reduce the effectiveness of chlamydial clearance. In humans, host genetic susceptibility to recurrent genital chlamydial infection and to the blinding sequelae of ocular infection (trichiasis) are associated with polymorphism at the <italic>IL-10</italic> locus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, the strong positive correlation between <italic>IFN-y</italic> expression and <italic>IL-10</italic> in all study participants suggests that the expression of these genes closely moves hand in hand. Similar observations have been made in human leishmaniasis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, where it was suggested that those with mild forms of cutaneous disease quickly establish parasite-killing mechanisms and efficiently control the inflammatory response, whereas those with disseminated mucosal disease fail to control the inflammatory response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Longitudinal study of individuals with trachoma should reveal if analogous responses contribute to exacerbation of conjunctival infection or effective disease resolution.</p><p>These data suggest that the increasing antigen load stimulates higher levels of <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;/IDO</italic>, which lag behind replication of the pathogen but eventually lead to the control of infection. This is supported by the observation that infected individuals with clinical signs have very high <italic>IDO</italic> transcript levels and relatively lower bacterial loads. An alternative explanation, supported by the generally positive correlation between pathogen load and <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;/IDO</italic> expression during infection, might be that chlamydial growth evades the IFN-&#x003b3;/IDO control pathway in the conjunctiva. Currently it is unclear how ocular serovars of <italic>C. trachomatis,</italic> which are deficient in an essential tryptophan synthase gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, can withstand the effects of IFN-&#x003b3;/IDO-mediated tryptophan depletion in conjunctival epithelial cells.</p><p>In trachoma-endemic communities, where most individuals are repeatedly exposed to OCI, age is a proxy for antigen experience. In a longitudinal study of individuals of all ages in an endemic community, we found that disease and infection episodes were resolved much more rapidly with increasing age, which explains the observation of a lower prevalence of clinical signs of disease and of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. trachomatis</named-content> infection in older individuals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. The age-related resolution of infection was not explained by age differences in exposure, and presumably indicated the development of an immune response that became more effective at clearing infection with cumulative exposure. The current data demonstrate that, over a narrower age range of individuals (4- to 15-y-olds), a reduction in prevalence of disease and infection can still be observed. In parallel, these findings provide evidence of age-related modulation of cytokine expression in response to disease and infection: older individuals tend to have greater expression of <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;, IDO,</italic> and <italic>IL-10</italic> in the presence of infection or disease. Thus, it can be suggested that these responses represent components, or markers, of the immune response in the conjunctiva that results in more rapid clearance of infection and disease with increasing age.</p><p>In the final phase, when infection has been cleared but signs of active disease persist, there is evidence of the presence of regulatory T cells. Regulatory T cells are known to be involved in the control of a variety of immune responses, including those responses directed against microbial pathogens &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. The mechanisms by which they suppress immune responses have been suggested to include contact-dependent mechanisms, cytokine secretion (in particular IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;), and the modulation of antigen-presenting cell function (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;). In a murine model of herpetic ocular keratitis, regulatory T cells were able to control the severity of immunopathological lesions in the corneal stroma by reducing migration of pathogenic CD4&#x0002b; T cells and by reducing the activation of pathogenic T cells, in an IL-10-dependent manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We found that in OCI, increased <italic>FOXP3</italic> expression at the site of infection could be an indicator of recruitment of regulatory T cells. One of the likely consequences of this recruitment is that the regulatory T cells limit the inflammatory response and the extent of extracellular matrix breakdown (possibly by mechanisms similar to that of the herpetic keratitis model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;), thus limiting tissue damage and encouraging extracellular matrix repair after the damage caused by cellular infiltration and lymphoid follicle formation.</p><p>Levels of <italic>FOXP3</italic> were higher in infection and disease, but they also increased with age in both infected and normal conjunctiva. This finding does not indicate that the implied regulatory T cell activity is not <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. trachomatis</named-content> related or disease specific. Rather it may be a feature of the measurement of a transcription factor or an indication that in the conjunctiva the dynamics and magnitude of the adaptive regulatory T cell response are different to that of cytokine gene expression.</p><p>There are currently conflicting opinions on whether T cell regulation declines or increases with age, and what contribution this regulation may have to immune senescence or immune dysfunction. In some models of autoimmune disease, onset of auto-reactivity, which is related to age, coincides with the decline of <italic>foxp3</italic>-expressing cells in the tissues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. In other diseases, however, such as inflammatory bowel disease, the mucosal lesions contain increased FOXP3&#x0002b; cells and transcripts even though the compartment of peripheral FOXP3&#x0002b; cells is reduced &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Recently, a subset of cells termed natural na&#x000ef;ve FOXP3&#x0002b; regulatory T cells present in the peripheral blood were also shown to decline with age &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, but others have found that the number of peripheral CD4&#x0002b;CD25<sup>high</sup> cells with demonstrable regulatory T cell function increased with age &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030266-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. In order to resolve these conflicts, further work is required that clearly identifies the phenotype of each regulatory T cell population and its functional status in relation to its anatomical location.</p><p>Studying immune responses at the conjunctival surface in a large number of individuals presents many problems, including limitations in the type of sample that can be obtained. This study used expression of immune response genes to overcome some of these limitations. This is a sensitive technique, amenable to repeated sampling and applicable to large numbers of samples. In addition, it provides greater sensitivity for detecting some of the markers assayed and in some cases is the only means available for detection. However, the nature of the sampling technique precludes an assessment of the relative contribution of different cell types to the production of these cytokines and other factors.</p><p>This study highlights the distinct immunological profiles, inflammatory and regulatory, that may be associated with the different phases of OCI and disease. These profiles may, by virtue of their duration, contribute to protection from infection or to the immunopathology induced by infection. Longitudinal follow-up studies should seek to verify their contribution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The National Center for Biotechnology Information (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nih.gov</ext-link>) accession numbers for the transcripts used in this study are <italic>FOXP3</italic> (NM&#x0005f;014009), <italic>HRPT</italic> (M31642), <italic>IDO</italic> (M34455), <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;</italic> (X01992), and <italic>IL-10</italic> (NM&#x0005f;000572).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="ack"><title/><p>We thank all study participants and locally employed Medical Research Council support staff including Ewen Cameron, Frederick Pemberton-Pigott, and Omar Maneh for invaluable help in the field.</p><fn-group><fn id="ack1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> RLB, DJ, DCWM, and MJH designed the study.
