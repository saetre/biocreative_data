As a result, dopaminergic therapy with dopamine agonists (DA) has gained popularity as initial therapy in younger patients and as add-on therapy in older individuals. However, it has been demonstrated that in clinical practice over half of patients initiating non-ergoline DA ropinirole and pramipexole therapy have discontinued (51 and 60%, respectively) within 3 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Remarkably, determinants for the discontinuation of non-ergoline DA therapy are largely unknown. We hypothesize that several non-genetic factors, such as the duration of PD or concurrent drug use, are associated with this discontinuation of non-ergoline DA use. We also suggest that genetic polymorphisms in the genes encoding the dopamine receptor (DR) are associated with this discontinuation. Several polymorphisms in the DR have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and those in DRD2 and DRD3 could be important determinants because the non-ergoline DA have high binding characteristics for the DRD2 subgroup and a preferential affinity for the DRD3 subgroup.</p><p>The aim of this study was to identify non-genetic determinants for the discontinuation of non-ergoline DA and to perform an exploratory analysis of genetic determinants in genes encoding DRD2 and DRD3.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting, study population and data collection</title><p>The setting of this cohort study was the neurology department of a large teaching hospital in Enschede, The Netherlands. Outpatients diagnosed with PD before 2005 who had received a non-ergoline DA (ropinirole or pramipexole) for the first time were included. Prescription data were retrieved from community pharmacies after obtaining the patients&#x02019; informed consent as described in an earlier publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The date of the first prescription of the DA was defined as the index date. To ascertain first-time use, we required that the patients had at least 180&#x000a0;days of prescription history for any prescribed drug before the index date. In addition, patients needed to have at least 180&#x000a0;days of prescription data for any medicine after the index date. Thereafter, patients were asked for informed consent in order to obtain saliva for DNA collection and pharmacogenetic analysis. All genotyped patients were of Caucasian ethnicity. The patients included in the genetic analysis were asked in a semi-structured interview by a researcher (MA) if they could recollect any period in which they had discontinued non-ergoline DA treatment and, if so, what was the reason for this discontinuation. The study was approved by the medical ethics committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Endpoint</title><p>The endpoint of this study was discontinuation of non-ergoline DA treatment. Patients were considered to have discontinued ropinirole or pramipexole treatment when more than 180&#x000a0;days elapsed between two consecutive pharmacy refills of the non-ergoline DA. Patients who persisted with therapy to the end of their observation time were censored on the last day of their follow-up. Consequently, patients who were lost to follow-up (e.g. moved to another place or died) were censored on the last day of their follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Determinants</title><p>Non-genetic determinants present at the index date were recorded from the medical charts and extracted from the prescription histories. We investigated gender, age, duration of PD, type of non-ergoline DA treatment, concomitant use of other antiparkinson drugs, daily levodopa dosage, and concomitant use of antipsychotics and antidepressants. The mean dosage of non-ergoline DA during follow-up was also investigated as a determinant for discontinuation.</p><p>Genetic determinants for discontinuation of non-ergoline DA treatment were studied in the subgroup of patients who gave separate informed consent for genetic testing.

Non-genetic determinants that were associated with discontinuation were apomorphine use, levodopa dosage, and the dosage of non-ergoline DA during follow-up. In an exploratory pharmacogenetic analysis, we identified a DRD2 (CA)<sub>n</sub> repeat polymorphism that was associated with non-ergoline DA discontinuation.</p><p>Apomorphine use was associated with a sixtime higher risk of discontinuation. Apomorphine is a potent DA and is used in patients with severe on&#x02013;off fluctuations. As other, less potent dopaminergic drugs can be discontinued with the initiation of apomorphine therapy, it is not surprising that apomorphine use is associated with non-ergoline DA treatment discontinuation. More than half of the patients included in this study used levodopa when starting non-ergoline DA treatment. One might expect that higher levodopa dosages have a higher risk of dopaminergic side effects, often resulting in the discontinuation of other dopaminergic treatment. This is in line with our findings. The use of levodopa itself was not associated with non-ergoline DA discontinuation, but within the levodopa users, dosages between 500 and 1000&#x000a0;mg were positively associated with non-ergoline DA discontinuation. However, as levodopa dosages &#x0003e;1000&#x000a0;mg were not associated with non-ergoline DA discontinuation, this result may have been an artefact due to the relatively small numbers of patients that used &#x0003e;1000&#x000a0;mg levodopa per day.</p><p>Higher dosages of non-ergoline DA itself were associated with a reduced chance of treatment discontinuation. This can be explained by the fact that the dosage of these drugs is slowly increased in order to minimize adverse events and by the fact that most patients discontinued in the first months after treatment initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, this association is a marker for early discontinuation.</p><p>We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in the genes encoding the DR, specifically in DRD2 and DRD3, could be associated with discontinuation of DA use. Indeed, our data show interesting genetic results. The absence of a 15&#x000d7; DRD2 CA repeat allele was associated with a decreased risk of non-ergoline DA treatment discontinuation. The DRD2 (CA)<sub>n</sub> polymorphism is located in a non-coding region of the DRD2 gene, but the precise functional consequence of this polymorphism for the DRD2 protein remains unclear. The DRD3 <italic>Msp</italic>I polymorphism showed an allele dose effect (increase in the risk of treatment discontinuation per G allele), which is suggestive of a causal relationship. The consequence of this polymorphism on DRD3 functionality remains to be unraveled. The DRD3 <italic>Msp</italic>I polymorphism is located in an intron, suggesting no direct influence of the polymorphism on DRD3 protein function, and is near the <italic>Msc</italic>I polymorphism. However, we found no linkage disequilibrium between these two polymorphisms. It may be that the non-significant association between the DRD3 <italic>MspI</italic> polymorphism and non-ergoline DA treatment discontinuation is indicative of other polymorphisms not studied in this gene region. Although we expected that the DRD3 <italic>Msc</italic>I Gly polymorphism would lead to increased agonist binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], we did not notice an association between this polymorphism and non-ergoline DA discontinuation. Wang and colleagues found that PD patients with the DRD2 <italic>Taq</italic>IA polymorphism who received levodopa had a higher risk of developing motor fluctuations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Again, we did not find an effect of this polymorphism on DA discontinuation. Our finding may not be surprising as the DRD2 <italic>Taq</italic>IA polymorphism is located in a kinase gene, denoted the ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (ANKK1), which is located downstream of the DRD2 gene. It is therefore unlikely that this polymorphism alters DRD2 activity directly.</p><p>Several remarks should be made with respect to the methodology used. In this study, use of the non-ergoline DA ropinirole and pramipexole was combined in order to improve statistical power. This can be justified by the fact that both ropinirole and pramipexole are DRD2 agonists with a preferential affinity for the DRD3 subgroup. The choice of the endpoint of this study, discontinuation of non-ergoline DA treatment, which encompasses both efficacy and tolerability, is also open to discussion. Since discontinuation related to insufficient efficacy and to intolerability may be mechanistically different, ideally, a stratified analysis on separate endpoints efficacy and tolerability should be performed. However, this could not be done because the reasons for discontinuation in the overall population were not known and because the population in the genetic analysis was too small for subgroup analysis. Moreover, the baseline characteristics in the genetic analysis subgroup differed from those of the overall study population due to the fact that there was a time gap of nearly 2 years between the selection of the overall population and receiving informed consent from patients for the pharmacogenetic analysis. Fortunately, the allele frequencies were in accordance with those reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. We did not correct for multiple testing as the aim of the genetic subgroup study was to perform an exploratory analysis of genetic determinants. Positive associations should therefore be interpreted with caution. Finally, we included outpatients from only one hospital. Therefore, the results could have been biased by the prescribing patterns of a few clinicians.</p><p>The study reported here is the first to investigate determinants for the discontinuation of non-ergoline DA therapy, including pharmacogenetic determinants. Ideally, knowledge of these determinants will enable clinicians to predict an individual&#x02019;s response.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified non-genetic (apomorphine use and daily levodopa dosages between 500 and 1000&#x000a0;mg) and genetic determinants [DRD2 (CA)<sub>n</sub> repeat polymorphism] for the discontinuation of non-ergoline DA treatment. The DRD3 <italic>Msp</italic>I polymorphism also showed a non-significant allele dose effect with non-ergoline DA treatment discontinuation, which is suggestive of a causal relationship. Confirmation of these data is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to thank all community pharmacists who contributed to this study.</p><p><bold>Competing interests</bold> Jeroen van Vugt's salary is fully covered by Medisch Spectrum Twente.
