This allows recruitment of damage-tolerant polymerases for damage bypass and DNA repair. In this activity, the Rad18 protein has to interact with Rad6, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, ubiquitin, PCNA and DNA. Here we analyze the biochemical interactions of specific domains of the Rad18 protein. We found that the Rad6/Rad18 complex forms stable dimers <italic>in vitro</italic>. Consistent with previous findings, both the Ring domain and a C-terminal region contribute to the Rad6 interaction, while the C-terminus is not required for the interaction with PCNA. Surprisingly we find that the C2HC zinc finger is important for interaction with ubiquitin, apparently analogous to the interactions of classical zinc fingers with ubiquitin such as found in the UBZ and UBM domains in Y-family polymerases. Finally we find that the SAP domain, but not the zinc finger domain, is capable of DNA binding <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Living organisms are sensitive to DNA damage such as that caused by UV light or chemical mutagens and it is essential for genome stability that the DNA damage is accurately repaired. Many mechanisms are responsible for this repair, but damage that remains during DNA synthesis causes DNA replication to stall. To avoid such stalling there is a specific set of post-replicative repair enzymes that allows bypass of the damaged DNA and continuation of replication. A critical component of this post-replicative repair system is the Rad18 protein. This protein performs one of the earliest steps in the damage recognition and bypass. It acts as an E3 ligase for monoubiquitination of PCNA, together with its cognate E2, Rad6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The monoubiquitination of PCNA allows switching from normal replicative polymerases to Y-family translesion polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). These polymerases are recruited to ubiquitinated PCNA to allow bypass of the damaged lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Monoubiquitination can also be followed by polyubiquitination by Ubc13/Mms2 as E2 and Rad5 as E3, leading to an error-free repair pathway that involves recombination with the newly synthesized strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>The importance of Rad18 is notable, since mice and chicken DT40 cells deficient in Rad18 show sensitivity to various DNA-damaging agents and enhanced genomic instability as seen by increased spontaneous sister chromatid exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Rad18 is also involved in homologous recombination, cell-type-specific processes such as somatic hypermutation, and in S-phase it plays a role in single-strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In addition, Rad18 was found to play a role in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In agreement with this, the Rad18 protein is found in the nucleus of many different cell types, with the highest abundance in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Ubiquitin E3 ligases are multidomain proteins that confer the target specificity on a ubiquitin modification system, bringing the ubiquitin conjugating E2 enzyme and the target together. The ubiquitin conjugation activity of Rad18 on PCNA has been reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and was dependent on ubiquitin E1, Rad6 as E2 enzyme, ubiquitin, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP, as well as on PCNA loaded onto DNA by the RFC complex. Under these conditions, the enzyme can efficiently monoubiquitinate all three monomers of PCNA. In this process, Rad18 must interact with the E2, Rad6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and the target, PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) and it was also found to interact with Pol-eta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Rad18 utilizes multiple domains for these interactions.</p><p>At its N-terminus Rad18 contains a Ring domain, common in ubiquitin E3-ligases, where the Ring domains interact with the cognate E2. In the case of mouse Rad18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), it was shown that the E2 Rad6 interacts with the Rad18 Ring domain, and that mutations in this region result in increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. A second region, in the C-terminal domain of Rad18, is also involved in Rad6 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Deletion of the peptide 340&#x02013;395 results in loss of Rad6 interaction <italic>in vitro</italic>, although localization to damage was not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>An unusual C2HC Zinc-finger (ZnF, residues 201&#x02013;225 in human Rad18), has been identified in Rad18, which was suggested to have the potential to bind to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). A sequence that contains this ZnF, between residues 83 and 248, is important for dimer formation according to two-hybrid studies performed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and mammalian Rad18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). This self-association is disrupted in a mutant, where one of the Zn-binding cysteines is replaced by a phenylalanine (C207F). These experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) gave rise to the suggestion that the ZnF domain is critical for dimerization. The C207F mutation also interferes with auto-monoubiquitination and localization of the Rad18 protein to CPD damage on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), reinforcing the notion that the ZnF region is of critical importance for Rad18 function.</p><p>A SAP domain (243&#x02013;282 in human Rad18) is located just C-terminal of the ZnF region. This is a domain type named after SAF-A/B, Acinus and Pias, the three proteins where it was first identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In these proteins the SAP domains are involved in DNA interaction. In Rad18, this domain was found to be important for localization to pol-eta-containing foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Regions of the protein that include the ZnF and SAP domain are sufficient for localization to DNA damage even in the absence of DNA replication but mutation of C207F interferes with this localization.</p><p>In the C-terminus of human Rad18 Watanabe <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) identified a region (401&#x02013;445) that is important for Pol-eta binding. Upon UV-damage Rad18 and Rad6 are critical for formation of pol-eta-containing foci on stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), but other translesion polymerases, such as Rev1 play an additional role in these complexes.</p><p>Altogether considerable knowledge on the Rad18 domain structure has been acquired, but relatively few experiments have been performed on the purified mammalian proteins. Here we use biophysical methods to study protein&#x02013;protein interactions <italic>in vitro</italic> and map functional domains on mammalian Rad18 proteins. We show that Rad6/Rad18 forms stable dimers of heterodimers and our <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination reactions and mapping of Rad6 correlates well with published data. Surprisingly we find that only the SAP domain, and not the ZnF domain, is capable of DNA recognition <italic>in vitro</italic>. In contrast, we find that the ZnF domain binds to ubiquitin, with an affinity similar to other ubiquitin interaction motifs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning and expression</title><p>Bicistronic PET25b plasmid (Novagen) was constructed containing both genes expressed via one promotor but with two separate ribosome-binding sites (rbs). hRad18 was encoded untagged after the first rbs already present in the plasmid (NdeI/NcoI), while hHR6B was given a His6 N-terminal tag and its own rbs encoded in the reverse Rad18 PCR primer (AflIII/XhoI). A three-point ligation resulted in the dicistronic vector PET25b&#x02014;hRad18&#x02014;His6hHR6B. Alternatively, the genes were cloned separately into pET28a (Rad6) and pET22b (Rad18).

We used both the mouse and human versions of the protein in a bicistronic co-expression construct in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), with a His-tag on the Rad6 protein for initial purification on Talon beads. The Rad6/Rad18 complex was found to be soluble and could be purified away from a significant excess of Rad6 using heparin affinity and gel-filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). This excess of Rad6 was also seen when expressing Rad6 and Rad18 from independent vectors, although to somewhat lesser extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Rad6/Rad18 complex expression and E3-ligase activity (<bold>A</bold>) Residue boundaries of the human Rad18 fragments used in the studies (to size with beginning and end residue).

In the presence of ubiquitin, ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, magnesium and ATP, we could detect significant ubiquitination of PCNA as seen by analysis on SDS-PAGE and confirmed on western blot against PCNA and ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The reaction appears to proceed in a stepwise manner, with partially modified trimers more abundant than tri-ubiquitinated PCNA. The activity is presumably suboptimal, since our PCNA is not loaded onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Nevertheless, the reaction is dependent on the presence of E1 and E2/E3. Moreover the complex is capable of modifying all three sites on PCNA trimers, as indicated in native PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), while peptide mapping of the ubiquitin site detected K164 as the only modified site (data not shown). Thus our assay recapitulates many of the significant features of the PCNA modification and it can serve as a functional test of enzymatic activity.</p><p>We expressed a series of Rad18 deletion constructs as complexes with Rad6 using either the polycistronic system or a two-plasmid system, in order to map the site of interaction of the ligands of Rad18 onto the complex. One complex, Rad18<sup>312&#x02013;495</sup> with Rad6 was produced as a side product of expressing the full-length mouse and human Rad6/Rad18 protein complex. This was the result of a modified Kozak sequence, which apparently acts as an alternative translation start site at methionine 312, as confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. We tested various complexes in the activity assay and we showed that Rad18<sup>16&#x02013;429</sup> is still fully active (data not shown) and Rad18<sup>16&#x02013;366</sup> has maintained substantial activity on PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). Thus the proposed Pol-eta interaction domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) is not essential for the PCNA ubiquitination activity by Rad6/Rad18.</p><sec><title>N- and C-terminal regions of Rad18 interact with Rad6</title><p>The interaction between Rad6 and Rad18 has been studied in detail in yeast, where a C-terminal region of Rad18 was found to be capable of binding to Rad6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In our co-expression studies, we could detect stable complexes in any construct that contained a region ending at Rad18 residue 366. Rad18<sup>312&#x02013;495</sup>, which lacked the N-terminal region, still formed a stable complex with Rad6. In Rad18<sup>199&#x02013;366</sup>, which was shortened at both the N- and C-terminus, the complex with Rad6 was detectable, but dissociated in high-salt conditions. This is in good agreement with the mapping data from Watanabe <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) who showed that the C-terminal interaction region maps to residues 340&#x02013;395.</p><p>In addition to the C-terminal interaction we could also detect significant interaction of the Ring domain (Rad18<sup>1&#x02013;99</sup>) of Rad18 with Rad6. Using analytical gel filtration we showed that the peaks of GST-Ring domain could be shifted by Rad6 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). This component of the interaction with Rad6 in the Ring domain of Rad18 is in agreement with Tateishi <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) who showed that the interaction was sensitive to mutations in the Ring domain. We also detected a shift of the GST-Ring protein by the Rad6/Rad18<sup>312&#x02013;495</sup> complex (data not shown). This shows that the two Rad6 interaction regions on Rad18 are non-overlapping. Rad18 therefore, interacts with Rad6 through its C- and N-terminus independently. Both these regions are predicted to be partially alpha-helical from primary sequence. In the N-terminal domain predicted helices flank the well-characterized Ring topology, while the C-terminal Rad18-binding domain is predicted to be composed of two &#x003b2;-strands followed by an &#x003b1;-helix. Both of these regions show sequence similarity with Zip3, another proposed ubiquitin E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Similar E2/E3 interaction is seen in the crystal structure of UbcH7/c-Cbl, where Ubc5 is flanked by two alpha helices from c-Cbl originating from sequentially distant helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Rad6 binds to Rad18 and forms a dimer of heterodimers.

We initially showed the existence of such a complex using chemical cross-linking followed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). To confirm these indirect data, we performed multi-angle static light-scattering (MALLS) online with a gel-filtration setup on the mouse Rad6/Rad18 complex. In this experiment we found that the molecular weight of the complex is 171 kDa, in good agreement with the calculated value of 161.6 kDa for 2xRad6 (19.7 kDa) and 2xRad18 (61.1 kDa) molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Similarly, the human complex showed a molecular weight of 165 kDa compared with a calculated value of 150.5 kDa for 2xRad6 (19.1 kDa) and 2xRad18 (56.2 kDa) molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B).</p><p>In order to detect biochemically which domains are important for dimerization in the Rad6/Rad18 complex, we first analyzed human Rad6/Rad18<sup>312&#x02013;495</sup> and Rad18<sup>195&#x02013;232</sup> (ZnF) by gel filtration and MALLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C) and the data were consistent with monomeric species. Thus, the molecular weight of Rad6/Rad18<sup>312&#x02013;495</sup> was 41.1 kDa compared with 21.0 kDa for Rad18<sup>312&#x02013;495</sup> and 20.0 kDa for Rad6. Similarly the observed molecular weight of the ZnF was 5.1 kDa compared with a predicted molecular weight of 5.6 kDa, although the error was greater at lower molecular weight.</p><p>Next we constructed a C207F mutant of human Rad18 and MALLS analysis of the purified complex with Rad6 gave a molecular weight of 171 kDa versus 150.5 kDa for the dimeric species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), showing that <italic>in vitro</italic> this mutant can still dimerize effectively. Finally we tested a set of deletion constructs in an analytical gel-filtration setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). All species form complexes that have at least the size of dimers of heterodimers except for the fragment Rad18<sup>199&#x02013;366</sup>, which only forms the monomeric Rad6&#x02013;Rad18 heterodimer.</p><p>Dimerization of Rad18 has previously been shown genetically in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In yeast, it was mapped to the region comprising residues 83&#x02013;248, that contains the ZnF domain, and mutation C207F in the ZnF-domain in human Rad18 could no longer be found to dimerize. Thus the ZnF domain was suggested to be the dimerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data do not support this: the monomeric region (199&#x02013;366) containing the ZnF domain, and the isolated ZnF were monomeric, and the C207F mutation had no effect on the oligomeric state of Rad18 in our assays. The suggested role of the self-association is localization in the cell, with the monomer form mostly found in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In that light the stability of the dimer that we observe is surprising and could indicate that other regulatory steps, such as additional post-translational modifications of the protein are required to create the monomer state.</p><p>Taken together, our data are consistent with dimerization being mediated with the N-terminal region of Rad18, but not particularly by the ZnF. We could not directly detect dimerization of the Ring domains, since we could not make soluble Ring domain alone, and GST itself makes dimers so it was not clear if the dimerization was mediated by the GST or the Ring domain. However, the presence of higher order complexes than the GST dimer indicates that Ring/Ring dimerization may occur. Moreover, there is significant precedence for Ring/Ring dimers as shown in the Brca1/Bard1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and Ring1b/Bmi1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) heterodimers, while homodimerization was seen in the isostructural U-box complex of Chip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). At the sequence level, many of the dimeric Ring domains, such as Brca1, Bard1, Ring1b and Bmi1 have significant similarity to the Rad18 Ring domain in the flanking regions that are important for dimerization, and in psi-Blast searches they find each other with more ease than monomeric Ring domains, indicating that Rad18 may well form a similar type of dimer, where the flanking regions of the Ring domain create the dimer interface.</p></sec><sec><title>The N-terminal region of Rad18 binds to PCNA</title><p>In an analytical gel filtration experiment, we could show that PCNA interacts with the Rad6/Rad18 complex: both peaks shift from their separate elution volumes to a higher apparent molecular weight.</p><p>The shorter construct of Rad18<sup>16&#x02013;366</sup> also could be shifted by interaction with PCNA in this manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) but the GST-Ring, GST-ZnF, GST-SAP or GST-ZnF-SAP could not increase the apparent molecular weight of the PCNA (data not shown).

Since the Zn-finger domain (UbZ) in Pol-eta was shown to be involved in DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), we decided to study ubiquitin binding to the Rad18 ZnF domain.</p><p>In a pull-down experiment using GST-ZnF we could show that GST-ZnF, but not GST, will pull down ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). To study this interaction in more detail we loaded the ZnF domain with increasing amounts of ubiquitin on a native PAGE gel. At higher concentrations of ubiquitin, we could see a clear shift of the Rad18 band. To quantify this interaction between ubiquitin and Rad18 ZnF domain we used surface plasmon resonance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C).

We tested the relevance of the Rad18 SAP domain for DNA binding by mutational analysis. Based on structural analysis of known SAP domain structures, we made three sets of mutations on the predicted surface of the SAP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>H) and measured their affinity for DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>G).

These regions were also implicated in binding to DNA in Pias1 by NMR-based chemical shift perturbation studies, while the regions probed by the other sets of mutants were not significantly perturbed in the Pias1 study.

We have confirmed the previously published Rad6 interaction domains and shown that the functional unit of Rad18 activity is a dimer of Rad6-Rad18 heterodimers. We have shown that the N-terminal half of the Rad18 protein binds to PCNA by size-exclusion chromatography. Our mapping shows that the DNA recognition region in mammalian Rad18 is not localized to the ZnF domain, but to the SAP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Only fragments containing the SAP domain were able to bind DNA, as demonstrated in an electrophoresis mobility shift assay and the ZnF alone fails to do so. The SAP domain binds to DNA as shown by surface plasmon resonance. The affinity is &#x0223c;1 &#x003bc;M, as previously reported, and mutagenesis studies revealed that the mode of DNA binding may be conserved with other SAP family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This role is not unusual for SAP domains, as these are found in other DNA-interacting proteins such as KU and PARP, the histone mRNA 3&#x02032; exonuclease, Saf-A and Pias. The importance of this domain for DNA targeting fits with the data of Nakajima <italic>et al.</italic> who found that the SAP domain of Rad18 is important for the formation of pol-eta containing foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of ligand-interacting regions of human Rad18.

The affinity that we measure is in the range determined for UBMs. The precise role of such ubiquitin-binding motifs is under much debate. Apparently this region is not critical for PCNA modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), thus implying a role at a different step in the Rad18 function. The effect of the C207F mutation on the dimerization and autoubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) could not be reproduced <italic>in vitro</italic>. Nevertheless, it is possible that <italic>in vivo</italic> ubiquitin binding is a step required for autoubiquitination, which subsequently regulates Rad18 localization and degradation.</p><p>The identification of the domains responsible for the component interactions of Rad18 with DNA, ubiquitin, Rad6 and PCNA will be useful for designing mutants of Rad18 with altered ligand-binding properties to study the role of Rad18 further. Meanwhile these domains should not be envisaged as beads on a string. The presence of multiple domains that interact with Rad6 and PCNA make this obvious. The role of the dimer of Rad6/Rad18 is also of interest. Various different modes of interaction can be envisaged in which the multiple Ub and DNA-binding domains interact in different ways, and it will be interesting to see how these communicate with each other in time and space to execute the Rad18 function in translesion DNA synthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm615_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="ps" xlink:href="nar_gkm615_nar-00948-c-2007-File009.eps"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>Heinz Jacobs and Mark Luna-Vargas for critical reading of the manuscript.
