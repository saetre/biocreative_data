In the most well understood Wnt signaling pathway, Wnt binding to Frizzled and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein induces &#x003b2;-catenin protein stabilization and entry into the nucleus, resulting in changes in target gene transcription. Emerging evidence suggests that Wnt5a can inhibit Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling through interaction with the receptor Ror2. The Ror2 protein belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily and contains several recognizable structural motifs. However, limited information is available regarding which specific domains are required for the inhibitory signaling activity of Wnt5a. Through mutation and deletion analysis, we have analyzed which specific domains and residues, including those necessary for tyrosine kinase activity, mediate the Wnt5a signal. To determine whether Ror2 can inhibit canonical Wnt signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>, we examined the effect of Ror2 loss on the expression of the Wnt reporter Axin2<sup>LacZ</sup>, finding increased reporter activity in Ror2 null mice, demonstrating that Ror2 can also inhibit Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in the context of intact tissues.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Wnts include a large family of secreted hydrophobic proteins that regulate essential developmental processes, including embryonic development, cell growth, migration, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).

To measure Ror2 signaling activity, we used SuperTopFlash (STF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), a T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor luciferase reporter that serves as a transcriptional readout for Wnt<bold>/</bold>&#x003b2;-catenin signaling, following exposure of cells to various concentrations of purified Wnt3a or Wnt5a protein. As we have shown previously, Wnt3a activates the STF reporter in HEK293 cells, whereas Wnt5a protein treatment does not stimulate reporter activity. When cells are treated with both Wnt proteins simultaneously, Wnt5a inhibits the ability of Wnt3a to activate the reporter &#x0223c;2.5-fold, which is due to endogenous expression of Ror2 in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>We next took advantage of the fact that Wnt5a-mediated inhibition of STF is enhanced in the presence of overexpressed wild type mRor2 to assay the activity of mutated forms of the mRor2 molecule. To determine which extracellular domains are important for Wnt5a signaling, we created mRor2 variants wherein the cysteine-rich domain, Ig-like, and Kringle domains were deleted (Ror2&#x00394;CRD, Ror2&#x00394;Ig, and Ror2&#x00394;Kringle, respectively) and then assayed their activity in the STF assay. Mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against the last 100 amino acids of the mRor2 protein were generated to monitor Ror2 expression <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These antibodies are specific to the mouse and human forms of Ror2 but do not detect the mRor1 homolog as would be predicted based on sequence divergence in this region (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.041715/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1<italic>A</italic></ext-link>).

The inhibition observed is similar to that seen when cells are transfected with empty vector, providing evidence that the CRD domain is required for mRor2 to transduce the Wnt5a signal. We next assayed the Ror2&#x00394;Ig and Ror2&#x00394;Kringle constructs in the Wnt3a inhibition assay. Ig-like domains are general protein-protein binding domains found in many proteins and almost all RTKs. Kringle domains, however, contain a characteristic pattern of cysteine residues and are found in a smaller subset of proteins such as clotting factors. The Rors are the only RTK family members that possess Kringle domains, which suggests that the mRor2 Kringle domain might be an important motif necessary for conferring ligand specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Interestingly, deletion of these domains showed that the Ig-like domain is required for Wnt5a signaling, but the Kringle domain is not.</p></sec><sec><title>Several Ror2 Intracellular Domains Are Required for Wnt5a Signaling</title><p>Brachydactyly B and recessive Robinow syndromes are caused by a variety of genetic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Several of these mutations (missense, nonsense, and frameshift) result in the premature truncation of the Ror2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). Frameshift mutations at amino acids 441, 463, or 467 are associated with one or both diseases. In addition, frameshift or missense mutations resulting in premature stop of the coding sequence cluster to the area around amino acids 749&#x02013;755. To test the effect of truncation of Ror2 at similar positions in our Wnt5A/Ror2 signaling assay, we generated FLAG-tagged Ror2 variants that terminated at amino acid position 469 (mRor2&#x00394;469) or 745 (mRor2&#x00394;745). mRor2&#x00394;469 lacks almost the entire intracellular domain of Ror2, whereas mRor2&#x00394;745 is truncated immediately following the tyrosine kinase domain. Following transient transfection into HEK293 cells with the STF reporter and subsequent Wnt treatment, both intracellular deletion variants displayed significantly reduced signaling potential as compared with wild type mRor2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.041715/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2</ext-link>) even though the transfected receptors were expressed in equivalent amounts. This indicates that the intracellular domain of Ror2 is required for functional Wnt5a/Ror2 signaling.</p><p>To determine the importance of specific subdomains within the intracellular portion of the receptor, we individually deleted the mRor2 serine/threonine (Ser/Thr)-rich domains 1 and 2 and the proline (Pro)-rich domain. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>, loss of Ser/Thr-rich domain 1 (ST1) and the Pro-rich domain (Pro) reduced Ror2 signaling activity, similarly to the mRor2&#x00394;745 mutant. Interestingly, deletion of Ser/Thr-rich domain 2 (ST2) had minimal effect on receptor activity suggesting that only the Ser/Thr-rich domain 1 and the proline-rich domain carry out crucial signaling and/or structural functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Tyrosine Kinase Activity Is Necessary for mRor2 Signaling</title><p>By sequence similarity to other closely related RTKs, the mRor2 receptor should be a fully functional tyrosine kinase. The asparagine residue at amino acid 620, invariant in all receptor tyrosine kinases, is likewise conserved in the Ror receptor family. In humans, mutation of this residue to lysine (N620K) results in recessive Robinow syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Structural analyses have indicated that this residue binds to one of the magnesium ions within the catalytic cleft of tyrosine kinases with homology to Ror2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Although others have shown that Wnt5a is able to induce Ror2 signaling through tyrosine kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), it has not been shown that tyrosine kinase activity is required for the inhibitory effects of Wnt5a on Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling, leading us to investigate this using several approaches. We found that overexpression of this predicted kinase-inactive variant of Ror2, Ror2N620K, did not enhance Wnt5a inhibition of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling above base line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>). The fact that mRor2N620K was unable to signal in a wild type fashion potentially links impaired Wnt/Ror2 signaling to recessive Robinow syndrome.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Point mutation of the tyrosine kinase domain results in impaired signaling ability.</bold><italic>A</italic>, N620K point mutation, which is associated with recessive Robinow syndrome, results in impaired Wnt5a-mediated inhibitory activity. &#x0223c;40 h post-transfection with STF reporter and Ror2 variants, HEK293 cells were treated with vehicle, Wnt3a protein alone, Wnt5a protein alone, or Wnt3a protein plus Wnt5a protein for an additional 20 h.

Mutation of tyrosine residues 641, 645, and 646 singly, and in combination, to phenylalanine resulted in varying degrees of receptor dysfunction, with Y645F displaying the greatest loss of activity. Mutation of equivalent residues within the insulin receptor regulatory loop results in an inactive kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). These independent mRor2 mutations in combination with the mRor2N620K data indicate the requirement of an active tyrosine kinase domain for functional Wnt5a signaling.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, all of the mutated receptors were expressed in equivalent amounts. Interestingly, whereas wild type Ror2 runs as a doublet following Western blot analysis with our anti-Ror2 antibodies, Ror2N620K appears as a single band. This is also what is observed when Tyr-641 and Tyr-645 are mutated to phenylalanine, the point mutations within the regulatory loop that result in the most severe loss of function. Additional mutational analysis of the Ror2 receptor revealed that only mutation of these specific residues resulted in the loss of the slower migrating band (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.041715/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2</ext-link>). These data indicate that the wild type receptor is post-translationally modified in a manner different from the tyrosine kinase domain mutants. Because Ror2 can autophosphorylate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), these observations likely indicate that loss of kinase activity resulted in the lack of autophosphorylation at other distant sites on the receptor and suggest that Wnt5a protein directly activates mRor2 tyrosine kinase activity.</p><p>One reason why the mutant Ror2 receptors (mRor2N620K, mRor2Y645F, etc) used in our analyses above may be nonfunctional in our Wnt5a-mediated inhibition assays is that the mutated receptors may not be properly localized to the cell surface. As assessed by fluorescence microscopy imaging and staining with either anti-FLAG or rabbit anti-Ror2 antibodies, the receptor molecules were detected on the plasma membrane (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.041715/DC1">supplemental Fig. S3</ext-link>). Thus, not only were all of the mutant proteins expressed, they were also accessible to ligand, suggesting that the inability of the various mutants to signal is due to in part to receptor inactivation and not simply defective trafficking as has been described previously for mutations associated with recessive Robinow syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Wnt5a Directly Modulates Ror2 Tyrosine Kinase Activity</title><p>As shown above, receptor mutagenesis suggested that mRor2 tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for receptor function. Following their activation, most tyrosine kinase receptors become autophosphorylated via cross-phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Thus, to test whether Wnt5a protein directly activates Ror2 tyrosine activity, we performed IP kinase assays. Overexpressed mRor2 was immunoprecipitated from lysates made from cells treated with vehicle or Wnt5a for 10 min. The immunoprecipitated protein was then incubated with kinase buffer and either GST protein (as a control) or a protein in which GST is fused to the mRor2 tyrosine kinase domain to determine whether full-length Ror2 protein could phosphorylate its own tyrosine kinase domain following ligand-induced activation.

Although the role of mRor2 in noncanonical Wnt signaling has been intensely investigated in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), few studies have addressed the ability of mRor2 to transduce a signal mediated by Wnt5a, ultimately resulting in Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling inhibition. Using various approaches, we show in this study that Ror2 acts as a classical ligand-dependent tyrosine kinase receptor, the ligand being the Wnt5a protein. Through mutation and deletion analyses of the receptor, we have determined that two extracellular domains, the Ig-like and CRD, and three domains within the cytoplasmic domain, the tyrosine kinase, Ser/Thr-rich 1, and pro-rich domains, are required for Ror2 to transduce the inhibitory signal of Wnt5a. In addition, the embryonic Ror2 expression pattern was examined to help discern important anatomical sites of Ror2 function.</p><p>In some model systems, the cytoplasmic domain has been shown to be dispensable for Ror2 function, and it has been suggested that Ror2 may simply capture Wnts and present them to other cell surface receptors. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, mutant variants of <italic>X</italic>Ror2 that lack the cytoplasmic domain are able to inhibit convergence and extension movements similar to wild type <italic>X</italic>Ror2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). In addition, deletion of the <named-content content-type="project">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> CAM-1 cytoplasmic domain results in a protein that is able to negatively regulate Egl-20 (Wnt ortholog) signaling during Q cell migration in a manner indistinguishable from wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). With respect to the data in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, however, Green <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) have shown that CAM-1/Ror exerts it function in cells adjacent to Wnt target cells, working as a &#x0201c;sink&#x0201d; to modulate Wnt signaling nonautonomously. Importantly, we show here that the cytoplasmic domain is required for Ror2 to mediate the inhibitory signal of Wnt5a in the mammalian cell lines, suggesting a different, cell-autonomous role for Wnt5A/Ror2 in mammals.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that the Ror2 tyrosine kinase domain is essential for Ror2 function. Variants of the Ror2 receptor that lack the entire cytoplasmic domain show impaired ability to transduce the inhibitory signal of Wnt5a. In addition, point mutation of a single residue (Asn-620) that, by extrapolation, should be crucial for tyrosine kinase activity results in a protein that can no longer enhance the inhibitory activity of Wnt5a. This is the first time it has been shown that a mutant allele of Ror2 associated with human disease, recessive Robinow syndrome, is also deficient in Wnt5a signal transduction. These data might help explain some of the phenotypes associated with recessive Robinow syndrome as a disease of hyperactive Wnt signaling.</p><p>The embryonic expression pattern of mRor2 was analyzed via immunostaining. Ror2 was found to be expressed in many different tissues, with the highest expression found in the developing lung where Ror2 is known to play a crucial role during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In the embryonic lung, Ror2 was found to colocalize with &#x003b1;-SMA, reflecting its expression in cells of mesenchymal origin. The observation that Ror2 loss did not affect Shh protein levels in the developing lung in the stages that we examined might be explained by the fact that Ror2 acts cell-autonomously in the mesenchyme, and thus does not perturb Shh signaling in the lung epithelium.</p><p>Finally, we observed the effect <italic>Ror2</italic> loss has on Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that in cells specifically expressing Ror2, Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling is diminished.
