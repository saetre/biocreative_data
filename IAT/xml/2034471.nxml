At the site of DNA damage, &#x02018;mediator&#x02019; proteins are in charge of recruiting &#x02018;signal transducers&#x02019; to molecules &#x02018;sensing&#x02019; the damage. Budding yeast Rad9, fission yeast Crb2 and metazoan 53BP1 are presented as mediators involved in the activation of checkpoint kinases. Here we show that, despite low sequence conservation, Rad9 exhibits a tandem tudor domain structurally close to those found in human/mouse 53BP1 and fission yeast Crb2. Moreover, this region is important for the resistance of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to different genotoxic stresses. It does not mediate direct binding to a histone H3 peptide dimethylated on K79, nor to a histone H4 peptide dimethylated on lysine 20, as was demonstrated for 53BP1. However, the tandem tudor region of Rad9 directly interacts with single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNAs of various lengths and sequences through a positively charged region absent from 53BP1 and Crb2 but present in several yeast Rad9 homologs. Our results argue that the tandem tudor domains of Rad9, Crb2 and 53BP1 mediate chromatin binding next to double-strand breaks. However, their modes of chromatin recognition are different, suggesting that the corresponding interactions are differently regulated.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>To protect the integrity of their DNA against the attacks from various endogenous and environmental sources, cells have evolved a genome surveillance network that carefully coordinates DNA repair with cell cycle progression. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are considered the most toxic type of DNA damage. If left unrepaired or repaired improperly, they cause chromosomal aberrations, which may be lethal or result in oncogenic transformation. A prominent cellular response to DSBs is the focal assembly of a large number of DNA repair proteins and checkpoint proteins at the site of damage. In particular, in budding yeast, induction of HO endonuclease in G1 results in a Tel1-dependent histone H2A S129 phosphorylation, the subsequent retention of the checkpoint adaptor protein Rad9 to DSBs, and the phosphorylation of its N-terminal region by the Ddc2/Mec1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). More generally, Rad9 is phosphorylated in a Mec1- and Tel1-dependent manner after cell treatment with various DNA-damaging agents [UV, &#x003b3;-rays, MMS; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>)]. Subsequently, Rad9 binds to the checkpoint effector kinase Rad53, which transautophosphorylates and becomes active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Similarly, in fission yeast, after creation of DNA damage by either ionizing radiation (IR) or the site-specific HO endonuclease, the checkpoint adaptor Crb2 forms distinct nuclear foci at DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). It is also hyperphosphorylated by the Rad3 protein kinase and is required for the activation of the effector kinase Chk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In metazoa, upon exposure to DNA-damaging agents, 53BP1 undergoes a rapid relocalization to sites of DSBs and is phosphorylated by the ATM kinase in its N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>). All three proteins Rad9, Crb2 and 53BP1 possess two C-terminal BRCA1 C Terminus (BRCT) motifs. This motif is found in a number of proteins implicated in various aspects of cell cycle control, recombination and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Crb2 and 53BP1 also exhibit a tandem tudor domain between their N-terminal region, rich in phosphorylation motifs, and the C-terminal BRCT domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>). Such a domain is predicted in the case of Rad9, despite the lack of sequence identity in this region between the three proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic>, the tandem tudor domain of 53BP1 specifically binds with a micromolar affinity to H4K20me2, a histone H4 peptide dimethylated on K20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, the interaction between 53BP1 and the correspondingly modified H4 is necessary for the accumulation of 53BP1 to DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). A millimolar interaction is found when looking at the binding of Crb2 tudor region with the same H4K20me2 peptide by NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Histone H4 K20 methylation by Set9 methyltransferase is required for formation of Crb2 foci in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, Set9 is not required to arrest division in response to DNA damage.</p><p>Based on these properties, Rad9, Crb2 and 53BP1 are proposed to play similar roles in DNA damage signaling and repair. In particular, the current thinking is that Rad9 recognizes modified histones close to DSBs through its predicted tudor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Indeed, cells lacking the H3 methylase Dot1 or carrying a mutant allele of Rad9 (Y798Q) supposed to be defective in K79 dimethylated H3 binding are G1 checkpoint-defective and fail to phosphorylate Rad9 or activate Rad53.</p><p>However, there are clearly some differences between metazoan 53BP1 and yeast Crb2/Rad9. For example, the BRCT motifs of Crb2 are required for both homo-oligomerization and foci formation at sites of damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), whereas the regions sufficient for these functions lie upstream of the BRCT domains in 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Moreover, Rad9 and Crb2 play a major role in cell cycle checkpoint control, whereas 53BP1 has limited checkpoint functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). It was recently proposed that 53BP1 might rather act as an adaptor in the repair of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigate the functional role of the predicted tudor region of Rad9. We confirm that this region is important for the resistance of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to different stresses. We also analyze the molecular mechanisms linking Rad9 to chromatin. We determined the 3D structure of the proposed tudor region and assessed its binding properties <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our results show that ScRad9[754&#x02013;947] indeed folds into a tandem tudor domain. However, the five-residue histone-binding cage found in 53BP1 is only partially conserved in Rad9. Moreover, the tandem tudor region of Rad9 does not directly recognize the K79 dimethylated histone H3 peptide or the K20 dimethylated histone H4 peptide reported to bind 53BP1. Our results rather support a mechanism in which Rad9 directly recognizes DNA at the site of damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strain, plasmids and media</title><p>The yeast strain rad9&#x00394;-L157 harbors a complete deletion of the <italic>RAD9</italic> gene and is described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).

We showed that this fragment, which we will hereafter call ScRad9[754&#x02013;947], is folded, contains 73% of &#x003b2;-sheet and 27% of random coil and has a heat transition midpoint of 52&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). These structural characteristics are similar to those of the tandem tudor domain of mouse 53BP1. However, the Rad9 fragment is prone to aggregation. Various attempts to optimize its solubility by modifying its limits or by mutating its cysteines failed.

Between residues 756 and 895, 81% of the backbone NMR signals were assigned; moreover, the NMR signals of 67 and 8% of the side chains were completely and partially assigned, respectively. Unassigned signals were clustered in residues K755, C789, I814, C863 and segments 776&#x02013;777, 794&#x02013;798, 824&#x02013;830, 832&#x02013;833, 896&#x02013;897. In the C-terminal part of ScRad9[754&#x02013;947], between residues 896 and 947, the NMR signals corresponding to regions 896&#x02013;910 and 918&#x02013;929 were also unassigned. Most of the unassigned fragments are in conformational exchange on a millisecond timescale, as only few peaks could correspond to these fragments in the 3D spectra.

Additional refinement took into account 42 hydrogen bond restraints corresponding to slowly exchanging amide protons. Nine hundred structures of the fragment 762&#x02013;896 were calculated, and the ten structures of lowest energy were analyzed (Supplementary Table S1). These structures have a root-mean-square deviation around the average backbone structure of 1.7 &#x000c5;.

Consistently, we obtained a significant structural alignment between Rad9 sequence and the sequences of the tandem tudor domains of Crb2 and 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). This alignment reveals that Rad9/Crb2 and Rad9/53BP1 sequences share only 18 and 15% of identical residues in the tudor region, respectively. However, the structural fit on the 60 C&#x003b1; atoms of the 10 common &#x003b2;-strands (i.e. &#x003b2;1 to &#x003b2;5 and &#x003b2;1&#x02032; to &#x003b2;5&#x02032;) yields 3.2 and 3.1 &#x000c5; between Rad9/Crb2 and Rad9/53BP1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and C). The individual &#x003b2;-barrels of Rad9 are particularly similar to those of the tudor folds of Crb2 and 53BP1, with C&#x003b1; root-mean-square deviations within each barrel comprised between 1 and 1.5 &#x000c5;.

In fact, as region 824&#x02013;829, which contains &#x003b2;5, is not assigned (as shown by the purple color of its backbone on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), it is not possible to demonstrate the presence of a &#x003b2;-sheet between &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;5. Similarly, because the region 789&#x02013;798 is essentially unassigned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), the 3D structure of loop &#x003b2;1&#x003b2;2 is unknown, and the presence of a &#x003b2;-sheet between &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;5&#x02032; cannot be proven. Finally, a C-terminal &#x003b1;-helix is found after &#x003b2;5&#x02032; in Crb2 and 53BP1, which interacts with &#x003b2;2, but the region corresponding to this helix is unassigned in Rad9. Thus, because several NMR frequency assignments in loop &#x003b2;1&#x003b2;2, in strand &#x003b2;5 and in the region following &#x003b2;5&#x02032; are lacking, it is not possible to describe the conformation of the interface between the two &#x003b2;-barrels in the &#x003b2;5/&#x003b2;1/&#x003b2;2/&#x003b2;5&#x02032; region. Conformational exchange on a microsecond to millisecond timescale at this interface is one possible explanation for the lack of NMR data.</p><p>We tested if the relative positioning of the tudor folds observed in 53BP1 and Crb2 was consistent with the NMR data obtained on Rad9. Therefore, we calculated a set of 3D structures of the Rad9 fragment 762&#x02013;896, using three additional hydrogen bond restraints linking the oxygen of Q790 (&#x003b2;1) to the nitrogen of D827 (&#x003b2;2), and the oxygen/nitrogen pair of F797 (&#x003b2;2) to the corresponding pair in L895 (&#x003b2;5&#x02032;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). These structures are as consistent as the first set of structures with the experimental NMR data (Supplementary Table S2). The second &#x003b2;-barrel of these structures is structurally similar to that of the first set of structures. However, the conformation of the first barrel as well as the relative positioning of the two barrels is closer from Crb2: the structural fit on the 60 C&#x003b1; atoms of the 10 common &#x003b2;-strands (i.e. &#x003b2;1 to &#x003b2;5 and &#x003b2;1&#x02032; to &#x003b2;5&#x02032;) yields 2.7 and 2.4 &#x000c5; between Rad9/Crb2 and Rad9/53BP1, respectively. Thus, the relative positioning of the tudor folds observed in 53BP1 and Crb2 is one of the possible relative positioning of Rad9 tudor folds.</p></sec><sec><title>The tandem tudor region ScRad9[754&#x02013;947] is required for cell resistance to genotoxic stresses and for Rad53 phosphorylation in G1 phase</title><p>To analyze the functional importance of Rad9 tandem tudor region for resistance to DNA damage, <italic>rad9&#x00394;</italic> cells complemented with either the wild-type <italic>RAD9</italic> gene or the <italic>rad9&#x00394;Tudor</italic> allele deleted for the tudor-encoding sequence were tested for their resistance to various genotoxic stresses, including UV- and X-irradiation, camptothecin (CPT, an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I) and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO, a drug producing bulky base adducts of the type that is mainly repaired by the nucleotide excision repair system).

In the absence of any specificity, for the same concentration of DNA, the percentage of complexes should be inversely proportional to the length of the tested DNA fragment. Measurement of the affinity of ScRad9[754&#x02013;947] for the 35 bp double-stranded DNA, as well as for three other double-stranded DNAs of different lengths, shows that the affinity does not depend on the tested DNA: calculation of the ratios between bound DNA and free DNA measured on the gels enabled us to estimate an apparent affinity constant of 0.4 (&#x000b1; 0.1) &#x000b5;M, 0.5 (&#x000b1; 0.1) &#x000b5;M, 0.3 (&#x000b1; 0.1) &#x000b5;M and 0.6 (&#x000b1; 0.1) &#x000b5;M for DNAs of respectively 357, 211, 146 and 35 bp (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and E).</p><p>Furthermore, we tested the binding of ScRad9[754&#x02013;947] to a 35 bp double-stranded oligonucleotide biotinylated at one or two 3&#x02032;-OH ends. Clearly, the presence of biotine does not modify the affinity of ScRad9[754&#x02013;947] for the oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 1</xref>). However, after binding of streptavidin to one of the ends of the 35 bp DNA, the affinity drops by a factor of two [i.e. 1.4 (&#x000b1; 0.1) &#x000b5;M; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>F and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 1</xref>]. After binding of streptavidin to both biotinylated extremities, the gel shift pattern is largely modified (data not shown). These results are consistent with the hypothesis of Rad9 tudor domain binding to DSBs directly, but it must be stressed that obstruction by streptavidin might also have prevented the formation of the previously observed Rad9&#x02013;DNA interactions.</p><p>Finally, we observed by NMR the binding of a 10 bp oligonucleotide 5&#x02032;-AACTCGAGTT-3&#x02032; or a 12 bp oligonucleotide 5&#x02032;-CGATCAATTACT-3&#x02032; to an NMR sample of <sup>15</sup>N labeled ScRad9[754&#x02013;947]. Therefore, we added progressively the DNA to an NMR sample of ScRad9[754&#x02013;947], and we followed the chemical shifts of labeled <sup>15</sup>N nuclei and <sup>15</sup>N attached <sup>1</sup>H nuclei by recording <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra.

We characterized its 3D structure and tested its interaction with different components of chromatin.</p><sec><title>Structural differences between Rad9 and Crb2/53BP1 in the tudor region</title><p>ScRad9[754&#x02013;947] exhibits a tandem tudor domain structurally similar to that of 53BP1 and Crb2. However, the N- and C-terminal regions surrounding the tudor domain show different structural characteristics. First, the C-terminal &#x003b1;-helix observed in Crb2 and to a larger extent in 53BP1 corresponds to an unassigned fragment in Rad9, suggesting that either the fragment exhibits local conformational exchange, or that its position relatively to the tudor core fluctuates. Circular dichro&#x000ef;sm studies favor the first hypothesis: they give a 6% helix content for Mm53BP1[1463&#x02013;1617] whereas ScRad9[754&#x02013;947] has no detectable helix signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Second, ScRad9[754&#x02013;947] exhibits supplementary loops and &#x003b2;-strands at its N-terminus, between residues 754 and 782. This region is not present in the 53BP1/Crb2 tandem tudor domains analyzed by NMR or X-ray crystallography. In the case of Rad9, it contains several hydrophobic residues that are related by nOe interactions to the second tudor fold (Y761, I767, T769, A770, I781, F782). Interestingly, only one regular &#x003b2;-sheet is found between the additional N-terminal region and the tudor folds. This &#x003b2;-sheet involves residues 768&#x02013;771 of &#x003b2;0&#x02032; and the four last residues of &#x003b2;2&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In the X-ray structure of human 53BP1 tandem tudor domain, the corresponding four residues form a &#x003b2;-sheet with the same residues of another 53BP1 molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Thus, the propensity of the four residues to be involved in a &#x003b2;-sheet is conserved from 53BP1 to Rad9, but the functional significance of this structural property is not known.</p><p>The loops observed in ScRad9[754&#x02013;947] are particularly flexible in solution, either on a microsecond to millisecond timescale, as loops &#x003b2;1&#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;4&#x003b2;5, or on a picosecond to nanosecond timescale, as loop &#x003b2;3&#x02032;&#x003b2;4&#x02032;. Alternative conformations have been described in the 1.2 &#x000c5; resolution X-ray structure of human 53BP1 tudor region, in particular in loop &#x003b2;1&#x003b2;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). NMR analysis of Mm53BP1[1463&#x02013;1617] showed that, in solution, loop &#x003b2;1&#x003b2;2 of Mm53BP1[1463&#x02013;1617] exhibits picosecond to nanosecond timescale motions of particularly large amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Furthermore, 15 residues were found in two different chemical environments, and these residues are mainly located at the interface between the first tudor fold and the C-terminal &#x003b1;-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Thus, in Rad9 as in 53BP1, the large loops of the tudor folds and the interface between the first tudor and the region following the second tudor seem to be highly dynamical, both on a rapid (ps&#x02013;ns) and slower (&#x003bc;s&#x02013;ms) timescale.</p><p>Interestingly, calculation of the electrostatic potential surfaces of the tudor region of 53BP1, Crb2 and Rad9 shows that, if 53BP1 and Crb2 exhibit many well-dispersed positive and negative patches, Rad9 has a largely negatively charged surface and a unique positively charged patch centered on loop &#x003b2;3&#x003b2;4&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). This loop is more than 8 residue-long and rich in positively charged residues in most Rad9 yeast analogs, while it is only 2 or 3 residue-long in fission yeast and in metazoans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). Moreover, several residues of loop &#x003b2;2&#x02032;&#x003b2;3&#x02032; participate to the positively charged patch in Rad9, and this loop is &#x0003c;9 residue-long in metazoans, while it is between 14 and 26 residue-long in Rad9 yeast analogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). These observations suggest that DNA recognition by the tudor region is a property shared by most Rad9 yeast analogs and involves a large positively charged patch around loops &#x003b2;2&#x02032;&#x003b2;3&#x02032; and &#x003b2;3&#x02032;&#x003b2;4&#x02032;.</p></sec><sec><title>Why the tudor region of Rad9 does not bind to the tested methylated histone peptides?</title><p>According to our study, it appears that Mm53BP1[1463&#x02013;1617] interacts with methylated histone peptides and in particular with H4K20me2, whereas ScRad9[754&#x02013;947] does not interact with any of these peptides. Consistently, GST-pull-down experiments using calf thymus H3 showed that, after elution from the beads, H3 is revealed by immunoblotting together with GST-Mm53BP1[1463&#x02013;1617], but not together with GST-ScRad9[754&#x02013;947] (data not shown). Two different groups reported the capture of histone H3 by GST-ScRad9[750&#x02013;917] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Our effort in using such Rad9 construction was stopped by the poor stability of this fragment: 40% of the corresponding NMR signal was lost after 2.5 h at 30&#x000b0;C. From our results, the tandem tudor domain of Rad9 does not bind to H3 as modified in calf thymus cells, does not recognize H3K79me2, and is not sufficient to bind to H4K20me2 or H4K20me3.</p><p>It has been recently shown that the structure of 53BP1/H4-K20me2 complex uncovers a unique five residue-binding cage, remarkably conserved in Crb2, that best accommodates a dimethyllysine but excludes a trimethyllysine, thus explaining the methylation state-specific recognition of H4-K20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This five residue-binding cage includes four aromatic residues (W1495, Y1502, F1519, Y1523) and an aspartic acid (D1521), all from the first tudor domain of 53BP1. On the basis of the structural alignment between Rad9 and 53BP1 in the tudor region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E), a dimethyllysine-binding pocket partially similar to that of 53BP1 is predicted in Rad9. Within the five residues in contact with K20me2, W1495, Y1502 and F1519 correspond to aromatic amino acids in Rad9, D1521 correspond to a threonine, and Y1523 is absent (it corresponds to a residue deleted in Rad9). We and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) have shown that replacement of D1521 by an alanine abolished binding of 53BP1 tudor region to H3. In the absence of D1521, the favorable coulombic interaction in the form of a salt bridge between the carboxylate of the aspartic acid and the dimethylammonium ion of H4-K20me2 can no more contribute to the affinity and high specificity of the protein for H4-K20me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Interestingly, the aspartic acid is present in Crb2. Similarly, 53BP1 Y1500 which interacts with R19 of the peptide H4-K20me2 in the complex is replaced by a lysine in Rad9. So the guanidinium group of R19 cannot make a cation-&#x003c0; interaction with the phenyl ring of the tyrosine. Such differences may account for the loss of histone binding in the case of Rad9. Another argument comes from the conformational exchange exhibited by loop &#x003b2;1&#x003b2;2 in Rad9. This exchange might increase the entropic cost of Rad9 binding to the histones.</p></sec><sec><title>What role for the recognition of DNA by Rad9 tudor region?</title><p>Human 53BP1 interacts with chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic> at DSBs following X-irradiation but not after treatment with UV or hydroxyurea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). DNAse or phosphatase treatment abolishes this interaction. Blot experiments using a double-stranded 10 bp oligonucleotide have shown that the only region capable of DNA binding in 53BP1 is comprised between residues 1052 and 1709. This region contains the minimal 53BP1 fragment necessary for foci formation at DSBs, which corresponds to the tandem tudor domain. EMSA experiments have shown that the fragments 1319&#x02013;1480 (containing the RG-rich stretch) and 1480&#x02013;1616 (containing the tudor region) of human 53BP1 interact with single-stranded and double-stranded DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). We have previously tested the interaction of the mouse tandem tudor region Mm53BP1[1463&#x02013;1617] with the already cited 10 bp oligonucleotide using NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). We observed that the conserved aromatic patch of 53BP1 tudor domain mediates a millimolar affinity interaction with this DNA fragment. However, using EMSA experiments, we could not visualize an interaction of higher affinity with a longer double-stranded DNA fragment. Thus, we suggest that the tudor region of 53BP1 may participate to chromatin binding, but needs to be associated to another 53BP1 region as its RG-rich region to increase its affinity for DNA up to a level detectable by EMSA.</p><p>In the case of Rad9, the tudor region ScRad9[754&#x02013;947] is clearly sufficient to bind DNA with a micromolar affinity. Moreover, this region possesses a positively charged patch in the second tudor fold which mediates DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). This patch is conserved neither in 53BP1, nor in Crb2. However, it is present in several other yeast Rad9 analogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). Thus, DNA binding through the positive surface of the second tudor could be a property common to a large subset of yeast Rad9 analogs. The shorter ScRad9[754&#x02013;931] also binds to the 35 bp double-stranded DNA with a micromolar affinity, whereas the ScRad9[754&#x02013;931,C789A,C812S,C853S] mutant does not recognize DNA anymore. Comparison of the chemical shifts between ScRad9[754&#x02013;931] and ScRad9[754&#x02013;931,C789A,C812S,C853S] shows that the two proteins share the same global fold (Supplementary Figure S1A and B). Chemical shifts are perturbed around the mutated cysteines, but can still be assigned, except in loop &#x003b2;2&#x02032;&#x003b2;3&#x02032; (i.e. residues 854&#x02013;869, close to C853S) where major changes are observed: the 3D structure of this loop is probably largely modified by the mutations. Interestingly, loop &#x003b2;2&#x02032;&#x003b2;3&#x02032; contains R854, whose side-chain amide proton signal is shifted after addition of DNA, and R862, whose side chain is close to that of R854 but its amide proton is not assigned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). These arginines are relatively conserved in yeast: position 854 is mainly positively charged and position 862 is essentially occupied by an arginine or a threonine. They are not conserved in Crb2. Finally, in metazoan, position 854 is never positively charged and position 862 is absent (it is in a deleted loop). We suggest that the positioning of loop &#x003b2;2&#x02032;&#x003b2;3&#x02032;, and in particular of R854 and R862 side chains, is crucial for DNA binding in a large subset of Rad9 analogs.</p><p>We looked on the DNA side which type of structure was recognized by Rad9 tudor region. We observed that this region does not preferentially bind to nick, gap or mismatch. Furthermore, its apparent affinity for DNA is not modified whether the DNA consists of 35, 146, 211 and 357 bp. As these fragments do not possess a common DNA sequence of more than 4 nucleotides, we suggest that Rad9 binding is not sequence specific, but instead is based on the recognition of DNA ends. Consistently, blockage of one of the DNA ends by streptavidin divides the affinity of ScRad9[754&#x02013;947] for DNA by a factor 2, and blockage of both ends largely modify the gel shift pattern.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We have shown that Rad9, as Crb2 and 53BP1, possesses a tandem tudor domain upstream from its BRCT region. This domain exhibits additional N-terminal &#x003b2;-strand and loops when compared to the published structure of 53BP1 and Crb2 tudor regions, and is highly dynamic both on a fast ns to ps timescale and on a slower &#x003bc;s to ms timescale. <italic>Per se</italic>, it is not capable of recognizing the methylated histone peptides reported to bind 53BP1 tudor region. However, it possesses a large and positively charged loop &#x003b2;3&#x02032;&#x003b2;4&#x02032; which recognizes DNA with a micromolar affinity and is conserved in most identified yeast Rad9 analogs. Thus, both the tudor regions of 53BP1 and Rad9 seem to recognize chromatin, however through different interactions: 53BP1 binds with a micromolar affinity to H4 dimethylated on K20 through a five-residue binding cage located on the first tudor fold, whereas Rad9 binds with a similar affinity to DNA through a positively charged region situated on the second tudor fold. The two binding regions are located on the same side of the tandem tudor domain; they are distinct but contiguous. In the case of Crb2, Botuyan <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) reported that the affinity of the tudor region for H4K20me2 is only in the millimolar range, but proposed that <italic>in vivo</italic>, the effective affinity is higher if one considers that Crb2 not only interacts with histones but also with DNA in the context of nucleosomes. Consistently, they noticed some affinity of the Crb2 tudor region for nucleic acids. Rad9 and 53BP1 tudor regions could similarly be involved in such multi contact interaction with chromatin.</p><p>All these results underline that a common mechanism exists in the biological functions of Rad9, Crb2 and 53BP1: they bind chromatin through their similar tudor domains. As proposed by Kron and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), these transient interactions may allow the initial targeting of Rad9 to DSBs. Then, phosphorylation of H2A by Tel1 may induce a stabilization of the Rad9/chromatin interaction and promote Rad9 hyperphosphorylation and Rad53 transautophosphorylation by the Ddc2/Mec1 complex. However, the mode of chromatin recognition by Rad9, Crb2 and 53BP1 is different, which implies that the corresponding interactions might be differently regulated. It was proposed by several authors that Rad9 tandem tudor region interacts directly with H3 dimethylated on K79 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). We show in this paper that our Rad9 fragment does not bind to such modified histone <italic>in vitro</italic>. Methylation of H3 K79 may play a more general role in coordinating various repair processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). More recently, it was proposed that dimethylation of H4 K20 plays a critical role in the direct binding of yeast Rad9 homologs to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This hypothesis is not supported by our study. However, Rad9 tandem tudor domain might recognize another region of H4, or the multimeric functional state of Rad9 might be critical for histone binding. Lastly, the targeting of yeast Rad9 homologs to DSBs might depend on indirect interactions with methylated histones. More quantitative binding studies and 3D structural information are needed in order to understand how Rad9 cooperates with other BRCT proteins in order to recognize chromatin at the vicinity of DSBs and thus prevent accumulation of DSBs.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm607_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm607_nar-00998-w-2007-File002.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint" xlink:href="nar_gkm607_nar-00998-w-2007-File003.ppt"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Alain Lecoq at the SIMOPRO (CEA Saclay, France) for H4K20 and H4K20-long peptide chemical syntheses, Steven Dubois and Robert Thai at SIMOPRO (CEA Saclay, France) for amino acid composition and peptide sequence analyses, Nathalie Nozerand and Alain Lorphelin (CEA Marcoule, France) for their help in protein expression and purification and C&#x000e9;dric Laguri at the IBS (CEA Grenoble, France) for the annealing of the different 35 bp oligonucleotides (double strand, nick, mismatch and gap).
