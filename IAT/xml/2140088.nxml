Although vertebrate transglutaminases have been studied extensively, thus far all structurally characterized members of this family have been crystallized in conformations with inaccessible active sites. We have trapped human TG2 in complex with an inhibitor that mimics inflammatory gluten peptide substrates and have solved, at 2-&#x000c5; resolution, its x-ray crystal structure. The inhibitor stabilizes TG2 in an extended conformation that is dramatically different from earlier transglutaminase structures. The active site is exposed, revealing that catalysis takes place in a tunnel, bridged by two tryptophan residues that separate acyl-donor from acyl-acceptor and stabilize the tetrahedral reaction intermediates. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the acyl-acceptor side of the tunnel, yielding mutants with a marked increase in preference for hydrolysis over transamidation. By providing the ability to visualize this activated conformer, our results create a foundation for understanding the catalytic as well as the non-catalytic roles of TG2 in biology, and for dissecting the process by which the autoantibody response to TG2 is induced in celiac sprue patients.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The transglutaminase family of enzymes is best known for crosslinking proteins to form networks that strengthen tissues.

The resulting crosslinked protein structures add strength to tissues and increase their resistance to chemical and proteolytic degradation.

In the absence of a suitable amine, water can act as an alternative nucleophile, leading to deamidation of the glutamine residue to glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050327-g001">Figure 1</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

To verify the essential catalytic role of the two tunnel-forming tryptophan residues, we constructed W241A and W332A mutants, both of which showed no detectable activity.</p><table-wrap id="pbio-0050327-t002" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Kinetic Parameters of Wild-Type TG2, T360W, and T360A Mutants Using Ac-PQLPF-NH<sub>2</sub> as the Acyl-Donor and Putrescine as the Acyl-Acceptor</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050327.t002"/></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although conformational changes occur frequently in enzymes, observations of large conformational changes such as the one in this study are rare. Together, the x-ray crystal structures of the closed and open forms of TG2 provide fundamentally new insights into the biological dynamics of this ubiquitous, multifunctional, and tightly regulated protein. Moreover, as the prototypical structure of a catalytically activated transglutaminase, the crystal structure reported here also yields clues regarding the regulation of enzymatic activities of other members of the transglutaminase family. Additionally, as TG2 is the principal autoantigen in celiac sprue, the structure of human TG2 bound to a gluten peptide mimetic presents an opportunity to dissect this autoimmune response at a biochemical level.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>TG2 Biology</title><p>Although fibronectin crosslinking activity was the original biological function assigned to TG2, more-recent data suggest that the catalytically active form of mammalian TG2 is a relatively rare species, both in the intracellular and extracellular milieu. The absence of catalytic activity of intracellular TG2 is not surprising, given the allosteric effects of Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup> and GTP/GDP, and the demonstrated role of TG2 as a G-protein inside the cell &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Consistent with these observations, the active site of GDP-bound TG2 is in a closed conformation as a result of GDP binding between the first &#x003b2;-barrel domain and the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050327-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). More surprising, however, are recent observations that (1) extracellular TG2 is catalytically inactive under ordinary physiological conditions (unpublished data), and (2) its ability to promote cell adhesion, spreading, migration, or differentiation is independent of catalytic activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. The simplest explanation for these observations is that, like intracellular TG2, extracellular TG2 is also predominantly in a closed conformation. We have observed that catalytically inactive extracellular TG2 is transiently activated in response to innate immune signals such as exposure to poly(I:C), a potent ligand of the toll-like receptor TLR-3 (M. Siegel, P. Strnad, E. Watts, K. Choi, B. Jabri, M. B. Omary, C. Khosla, unpublished data). On the basis of these observations. we hypothesize that, in a normal stress-free environment, most extracellular TG2 is maintained in the closed conformation as a result of guanine nucleotide and/or integrin binding, despite relatively high extracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations. Physical or certain forms of chemical injury trigger rapid activation of TG2 into its catalytically active, open conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Mechanism and Regulation of Transglutaminases</title><p>Nine members of the mammalian transglutaminase family have been identified at the genetic level, seven of which have been characterized at the protein level (transglutaminases 1&#x02013;5, factor XIIIa, and the catalytically inactive erythrocyte band 4.2). Although the regulation and substrate specificity varies significantly within this enzyme family, all active members share a high degree of sequence similarity, including strict conservation of key active-site residues such as the catalytic triad, W241, W332, and T360. In our structure, the dual hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor ketone and the indole of W241 and the backbone amide of the catalytic Cys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050327-g004">Figure 4</xref>D) are consistent with a catalytic mechanism involving oxyanion stabilization, a model that is supported by available biochemical data &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, early kinetic analysis of both guinea pig liver TG2 and human factor XIIIa had led Folk to propose the transient formation of a tunnel in the active site during acylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Our results provide structural support for this hypothesis. Specifically, we propose that the bridging tryptophan residues and their corresponding loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050327-g004">Figure 4</xref>C) separate, analogous to a drawbridge, in order to release the enzyme-bound transamidated product. On the basis of these observations, we predict that an analogous tunnel is also transiently formed between corresponding Trp residues in other transglutaminases during their catalytic cycle.</p><p>Notwithstanding their closely related catalytic mechanism, the activity of individual transglutaminase members is differentially regulated. For instance TG2, TG3, TG4, and TG5 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b031">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, but not TG1 or factor XIIIa &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, are inhibited by GTP, and whereas TG3 requires cleavage at a loop between the catalytic core and the C-terminal &#x003b2;-barrels for full display of catalytic activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, cleavage at this loop leads to inactivation of TG2 and factor XIIIa. Activation of factor XIIIa is more intricate because the latent form is a heterotetramer consisting of two catalytic A subunits (factor XIIIa) and two regulatory B subunits. Activation involves thrombin cleavage of an N-terminal peptide on the A subunits, followed by dissociation of the tetrameric complex and a concerted conformational change in factor XIIIa &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. In each case, a major conformational change such as that observed for human TG2 in this study is required for unmasking of the active-site residues and to allow access to protein substrates for crosslinking.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Celiac Sprue Pathogenesis</title><p>The ability to visualize the structure of TG2 bound to a high-affinity gluten peptide analog has several potential consequences for our understanding of gluten-induced pathogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. First, the atomic details of this covalent complex may facilitate a deeper understanding of the autoantibody response to TG2. If extracellular TG2 is predominantly in a closed conformation, then the open conformation described here is likely to expose self-epitopes that are ordinarily inaccessible to the immune system. In order for these &#x0201c;neo-epitopes&#x0201d; to trigger an autoantibody response via a hapten carrier-like model in celiac sprue, TG2&#x02013;gluten adducts would have to be relatively stable. Enzymological analysis under conditions mimicking the gluten-fed small intestine has verified the unusual stability of the TG2&#x02013;gluten peptide thioester adduct &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, once extracellular TG2 in the celiac small intestinal mucosa is activated, the resulting TG2&#x02013;gluten adducts may be sufficient to trigger an initial autoantibody response in HLA-DQ2&#x02013;positive individuals. The question of course arises, how is extracellular TG2 activated in the celiac mucosa? As mentioned above, at least some innate immune signals, such as TLR-3 agonism, can induce TG2 activation. The expression of TLR-2, &#x02212;3, and &#x02212;4 is up-regulated in celiac mucosa, even in patients whose disease is in remission &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore hypothesize that, either TG2 is constitutively in the open (catalytically active) conformation in celiac mucosa, or more likely, gluten triggers extracellular TG2 activation by interacting with certain up-regulated innate immune receptors in celiac mucosa. Notably, recent studies have suggested the occurrence of an innate immune response to gluten in celiac sprue patients &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b038">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Last but not least, the availability of high-resolution structures of both the GTP binding site and the active site of human TG2 facilitates inhibitor design for this pharmacologically significant protein. In particular, two distinct classes of pharmacological TG2 inhibitors are being explored: GTP analogs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, which presumably stabilize the closed conformation, and active-site inhibitors, which trap the open conformation as shown in this study. Although both classes of inhibitors block TG2 catalytic activity, we predict that they will have different pharmacological effects. The ability to visualize protein&#x02013;ligand interactions at both ligand binding sites should allow the rational design of inhibitors for pharmacological and therapeutic purposes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Synthesis of inhibitor.</title><p>The peptide Ac-P(DON)LPF-NH<sub>2</sub> was synthesized using a modified method described for the synthesis of similar products by Hausch et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050327-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;.
