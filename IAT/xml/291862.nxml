Structural studies have shown that the tyrosine in a highly conserved GQDPY water-activating loop of UDGs blocks the entry of thymine or purines into the active site pocket. To further understand the role of this tyrosine (Y66 in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> UDG), we have overproduced and characterized Y66F, Y66H, Y66L and Y66W mutants. The complexes of the wild-type, Y66F, Y66H and Y66L UDGs with uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor (Ugi) (a proteinaceous substrate mimic) were stable to 8 M urea. However, some dissociation of the complex involving the Y66W UDG occurred at this concentration of urea. The catalytic efficiencies (<italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> &#x0002f; <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) of the Y66L and Y66F mutants were similar to those of the wild-type UDG. However, the Y66W and Y66H mutants were &#x0223c;7- and &#x0223c;173-fold compromised, respectively, in their activities. Interestingly, the Y66W mutation has resulted in an enzyme which is resistant to product inhibition. Preferential utilization of a substrate enabling a long range contact between the &#x02013;5 phosphate (upstream to the scissile uracil) and the enzyme, and the results of modeling studies showing that the uracil-binding cavity of Y66W is wider than those of the wild type and other mutant UDGs, suggest a weaker interaction between uracil and the Y66W mutant. Furthermore, the fluorescence spectroscopy of UDGs and their complexes with Ugi, in the presence of uracil or its analog, 5-bromouracil, suggests compromised binding of uracil in the active site pocket of the Y66W mutant. Lack of inhibition of the Y66W UDG by apyrimidinic DNA (AP-DNA) is discussed to highlight a potential additional role of Y66 in shielding the toxic effects of AP-DNA, by lowering the rate of its release for subsequent recognition by an AP endonuclease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Damage to DNA is perilous to cells as it alters the genetic code or obstructs recognition by the proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c1">1</xref>). In order to prevent such threats, cells possess a number of repair enzymes, which actively search for damage in DNA and correct it. The RNA base uracil arises in DNA either by erroneous incorporation by DNA polymerases or as a consequence of cytosine deamination by physiological or environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c3">3</xref>). Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), a ubiquitous enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c4">4</xref>) recognizes uracils in DNA and pioneers the uracil the excision repair pathway by cleaving the N-glycosidic bond between the base and DNA backbone to generate uracil and apyrimidinic DNA (AP-DNA) as reaction products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c5">5</xref>). UDGs are highly conserved not only in their primary structure but also in the overall architecture of the tertiary fold, and are extremely specific for uracil in DNA. Uracil analog 5-bromouracil in DNA is neither acted upon by UDGs nor does it, in its free form, inhibit the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c6">6</xref>), suggesting that substitution of non-polar hydrogen at the uracil position 5 with electronegative and&#x0002f;or bulky atoms is unfavorable for binding into the active site pocket of UDGs. On the other hand, analogs such as 6-(<italic>p</italic>-<italic>n</italic>-octylanilino) uracil, 5-azauracil and 6-aminouracil are known to inhibit various UDGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c9">9</xref>).</p><p>UDGs are subject to product inhibition. The AP-DNA acts as a competitive inhibitor with a <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> of &#x0223c;1.2 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c10">10</xref>). Similarly, 6-(<italic>p</italic>-<italic>n</italic>-octylanilino) uracil is a competitive inhibitor of HSV UDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c7">7</xref>). In contrast, uracil is known to be a non-competitive inhibitor of UDGs with a <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> of &#x0223c;0.2&#x02013;5 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c13">13</xref>). By definition, the non-competitive mode of inhibition means that the inhibitor binds to both the free enzyme and the enzyme&#x02013;substrate complex. Since free uracil binds into the active site pocket of UDGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c15">15</xref>), the apparent non-competitive nature of inhibition may suggest additional site(s) of its binding on the enzyme. Yet another category of inhibitor is a phage encoded protein, uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor (Ugi), a substrate mimic, which establishes an intricate network of interactions at the active site face of the UDGs to form a highly stable complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c18">18</xref>).</p><p>The co-crystal structures of UDG with uracil containing DNA as well as free uracil have shown that uracil binding in the active site pocket occurs by extensive shape and charge complementarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c15">15</xref>). Several hydrogen bonds are established from the conserved UDG residues such as histidine of the HPSPLS motif &#x0005b;H187 in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> UDG (<italic>Eco</italic>UDG)&#x0005d; and asparagine of the GVLLLN motif (N123 in <italic>Eco</italic>UDG and N204 in human UDG) to positions 2, 3 and 4 of uracil. Specificity of these contacts avoids cytosine binding in the pocket. Furthermore, the side chain of tyrosine of the GQDPYH motif (Y66 in <italic>Eco</italic>UDG and Y147 in human UDG), which is in van der Waals&#x02019; contact with the C5 position of the uracil, excludes thymine with a methyl group at this position, or the purines with bulky rings (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c21">21</xref>). The significance of these interactions in the active site pocket as specificity determinants was highlighted in a protein- engineering quest wherein designed mutations (N204D, Y147A, Y147C and Y147S) in human UDG conferred detectable levels of altered substrate specificities of cytosine, and thymine DNA glycosylases, respectively, upon the mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c19">19</xref>). However, yet another pursuit in protein engineering is to design variants of the enzymes that are efficient in catalysis and that retain substrate specificity but become resistant to product inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c22">22</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we proposed that the role of Y66 in <italic>Eco</italic>UDG is not restricted to merely preventing the entry of non-uracil residues into the active site pocket and that it also plays a role in catalysis of the glycosidic bond cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c23">23</xref>). To further our understanding of the significant role of Y66 in catalysis, product inhibition and interaction with Ugi, in this study, we have characterized additional mutants containing substitutions at the Y66 position.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligodeoxyribonucleotides</title><p>DNA oligomers were obtained from Ransom Hill Bioscience, USA, and Microsynth, Switzerland.

These profiles of inhibition by uracil are identical to those obtained earlier with the UDGs from <italic>E.coli</italic>, human, HSV, mycoplasma and wheat germ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c13">13</xref>). Interestingly, in these experiments, no inhibition of uracil excision by the Y66W UDG was seen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f4">4</xref>A). Also, upon inclusion of varying concentrations of AP-DNA (0.0625&#x02013;0.25 &#x000b5;M) along with uracil (5 mM) in reactions, while the inhibition of the wild-type, Y66L, Y66H and Y66F UDGs increased to &#x0223c;80&#x00025;, the Y66W UDG was still completely resistant to inhibition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f4">4</xref>B). Since the AP-DNA that we used in these reactions was prepared from the uracil containing DNA (Materials and Methods), to ensure that the preparation served as an inhibitor of UDGs, we carried out UDG assays in the absence of any externally added uracil. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f4">4</xref>C, at 0.25 &#x000b5;M concentration, the AP-DNA preparation inhibited the wild-type UDG by &#x0223c;50&#x00025;. Interestingly, the Y66W mutant UDG was not inhibited at all. The other UDG mutants (Y66F, Y66H and Y66L) were inhibited to varying degrees. The Y66F protein was inhibited to a small extent by &#x0223c;20&#x00025;. Even in the experiment shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f4">4</xref>B, upon addition of the AP-DNA in the reaction, this mutant showed the least increment in inhibition (over and above uracil inhibition). More importantly, these experiments identified the Y66W mutant as a UDG, which showed complete resistance to inhibition by both the products.</p></sec><sec><title>Y66W UDG shows differential utilization of SSU9 over SSU4</title><p>We have shown earlier that, with the addition of the &#x02013;1, &#x0002b;1 and &#x0002b;2 phosphates (with respect to the scissile uracil), UDGs make an additional contact at the &#x02013;5 phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c34">34</xref>). While this contact is not crucial for substrate utilization by the wild-type UDG <italic>in vitro</italic>, it is important for the activity of the mutant UDGs that are impaired in establishing a full complement of interactions with uracil in the active site pocket. The resistance of the Y66W UDG to uracil inhibition suggested its weak binding in the active site pocket. Hence, we checked for relative utilization of SSU9 and SSU4 by mutant UDGs in a mixed substrate (SSU9 and SSU4) assay. SSU9 contains the &#x02013;5 phosphate, whereas the SSU4 lacks this phosphate even after 5&#x02032; end phosphorylation (Materials and Methods). The quantification of data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f5">5</xref>) shows that, while the wild-type, Y66F, Y66H and Y66L UDGs use the substrates with similar relative efficiencies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f5">5</xref>, ii&#x02013;v), the Y66W UDG utilized SSU9 &#x0003e;4-fold better than the SSU4 (vi).</p></sec><sec><title>Widening of the uracil pocket in Y66W</title><p>As mentioned in Materials and Methods, a sterically acceptable model of the Y66W could be constructed only when the 72&#x02013;82 polypeptide segment was allowed to move away from the center of the uracil binding cavity, to accommodate the larger size of the tryptophan side chain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f1">1</xref>B). The movement widens the uracil binding pocket, loosening the contacts between uracil and F77 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f1">1</xref>C). An analogous situation is observed in the case of mycobacterial RecA which has a lower affinity for nucleotides than its close homolog from <italic>E.coli</italic>. Modeling and crystal structures indicate that this difference occurs due to a wider nucleotide binding site in the case of mycobacterial RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c35">35</xref>). In the case of the UDG mutants, the looseness of the fit in Y66W is quite conspicuous. While the shape complementarity coefficient between UDG and uracil varies between 0.78 and 0.81 for the WT, Y66F, Y66L and Y66H, it is 0.73 in the case of Y66W. These coefficients were computed using the Lawrence and Colman method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c36">36</xref>), where a value of 1 on a scale of 0&#x02013;1 indicated ideal compatibility between surfaces.</p><p>Taken together, the preferential utilization of SSU9 over SSU4 by the Y66W UDG, and the molecular modeling studies, support the view that the interaction of uracil in the active site pocket of the Y66W UDG is compromised. This, in turn, would explain the lack of inhibition of Y66W by uracil.</p></sec><sec><title>Changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of UDGs and UDG&#x02013;Ugi complexes in the presence of urea</title><p>To further our understanding of the Y66W UDG, we subjected this and the wild-type UDGs to urea-mediated unfolding and monitored the changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. In such experiments, unfolding of UDGs results in fluorescence quenching as well as in a red shift of the fluorescence spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c26">26</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f6">6</xref>, the changes in the spectral profiles of both the wild-type and Y66W UDGs are very much alike and they both show a red shift upon treatment with 4 M urea (i and ii).</p><p>Furthermore, as shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c26">26</xref>), complexation of the wild-type UDG with Ugi makes it impervious to treatment even with 8 M urea, and in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra, no red shifts &#x0005b;characteristic of decomposition of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c26">26</xref>)&#x0005d; are seen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f6">6</xref>, iii). However, when the complex of the Y66W UDG and Ugi was treated with 8 M urea (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f6">6</xref>, iv), consistent with its dissociation on 8 M urea-containing gels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f2">2</xref>, v), it showed a red shift in the spectra. The observation that the free UDGs (wild type and Y66W) are alike in their resistance&#x0002f;susceptibility to urea, but among their complexes with Ugi, the UDG(Y66W)&#x02013;Ugi, is slightly more susceptible to urea, suggests that the Y66W protein suffers a subtle structural change in the DNA binding&#x0002f;active site pocket which establishes contacts with Ugi, a substrate mimic (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>Changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of UDGs and&#x0002f;or the UDG&#x02013;Ugi in the presence of uracil or 5-bromouracil</title><p>Treatment of UDGs or their complexes with uracil or 5-bromouracil led to changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence with no shifts in the spectra. As shown in the spectral recordings in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f7">7</xref>A, treatment of the wild-type UDG with increasing concentrations of uracil resulted in a gradual increase in fluorescence quenching (i). In contrast, under the identical assay conditions, treatment of the Y66W UDG did not result in significant fluorescence quenching at the lower concentrations of uracil (0&#x02013;0.6 mM, ii). These observations suggest poor binding of uracil to the Y66W UDG.</p><p>To gain better insight into these effects, we compared the profiles of the relative ratios (<italic>F</italic><sub>x</sub> &#x0002f; <italic>F</italic><sub>o</sub>) of the fluorescence intensities (at &#x003bb;<sub>max</sub> of 332 nm) of the uracil treated (<italic>F</italic><sub>x</sub>) and untreated (<italic>F</italic><sub>o</sub>) samples for both the UDGs. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f7">7</xref>B (i), treatment of the wild-type UDG with uracil resulted in a distinct biphasic profile of quenching. While a biphasic profile is discernible even for the Y66W UDG, the amplitude of the first phase in this profile is much decreased. Interestingly, a control experiment, where the complexes of the two UDGs with Ugi (wherein access of uracil to the active site pocket of UDGs is blocked by Ugi) were treated with uracil, revealed identical profiles for both the samples (ii). Thus, a more rapid dip in the profile of the wild-type UDG at lower concentrations of uracil (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f7">7</xref>B, i) suggests its high affinity binding in the active site pocket of the wild-type UDG. In yet another approach, the wild-type and the Y66W UDGs were treated with 5-bromouracil, an analog of uracil possessing a substitution at C5 position unfavorable for interaction in the active site pocket. In this experiment also, the relative fluorescence quenching profiles of the two UDGs were alike (iii). Taken together, these experiments suggest that the binding of free uracil to the active site pocket of the Y66W UDG is weak.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>An extreme specificity in detection and removal of uracil by UDGs is rendered by interaction of uracil with a number of residues in its active site pocket (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f1">1</xref>A). Recent studies involving mutational analysis of the <italic>in vitro</italic> produced <italic>Eco</italic>UDG mutants at the Y66 position, suggested that in addition to its role in uracil base selectivity, the van der Waals&#x02019; interaction that it establishes with the C5 position of the uracil also facilitates the catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c23">23</xref>). In order to understand the role of Y66 further, we have overproduced several proteins mutated at this position (Y66F, Y66L, Y66H and Y66W). As summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg918tb1">1</xref>, the catalytic efficiencies of the Y66L and Y66F proteins were very similar to those of the wild-type UDG. The observation that the mutant UDGs containing substitution of tyrosine with phenylalanine or leucine, but not with histidine (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg918tb1">1</xref>), cysteine or serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c23">23</xref>), were as active as the wild-type protein, suggests that a hydrophobic residue at this position is crucial for efficient catalysis.</p><p>All the conserved UDGs form a highly stable complex with the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> phage, PBS-1, or -2, encoded proteinaceous inhibitor (Ugi). <italic>Eco</italic>UDG forms a complex with Ugi, which is physiologically irreversible and has been a good model system to understand the mechanism of protein&#x02013;protein interaction. The Y66 side chain of <italic>Eco</italic>UDG forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with E20 of Ugi. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f2">2</xref>, like the complex of the wild-type proteins, the complexes of mutant UDGs (Y66L, Y66H and Y66F) with Ugi were also stable in 8 M urea. Thus, the identity of tyrosine at this position is unimportant in forming a tight complex with Ugi. An earlier report showed that a mutant of Ugi (E20A) formed a weaker and reversible complex with UDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c37">37</xref>). However, it should be noted that E20 of Ugi, makes two more hydrogen bonds with S88 and S189 of <italic>Eco</italic>UDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c18">18</xref>), and a single mutation at this position in Ugi (E20A) will be expected to have a more severe phenotype, as observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c37">37</xref>). The presence of diminishing band of the UDG (Y66W)&#x02013;Ugi complex in 8 M urea (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f6">6</xref>) is more likely a consequence of a subtle structural perturbation in the active site&#x0002f;DNA binding pocket, which is commonly utilized by both the Ugi and the substrate for their interaction with UDGs. Several other lines of evidence support this conclusion. (i) Co-crystal structures of uracil and UDG have shown that at least one site of uracil binding to UDGs is the active site pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c15">15</xref>). Thus, unlike the uracil inhibition of the wild-type, Y66L, Y66F and Y66H UDGs, lack of uracil inhibition of the Y66W UDG indicates that uracil binding in its active site pocket is compromised. In fact, the modeled structures show that the active site pocket of the Y66W mutant is larger than those of the wild-type and the other mutant UDGs. (ii) In the co-crystals of human UDG with DNA, the equivalent of H67 (H148) in the neighbor of the equivalent of Y66 (Y147) forms hydrogen bonds with the uridine O4&#x02032; and the &#x02013;2 phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c38">38</xref>). Since the three-dimensional structural folds of the UDGs are highly conserved, the lack of inhibition of the Y66W UDG by AP-DNA would again suggest a structural perturbation in the uridine binding pocket of this mutant. (iii) The observation that, unlike the wild-type UDG and other mutants studied here, the Y66W UDG utilizes SSU9 preferentially over SSU4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f5">5</xref>), also suggests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c23">23</xref>) that the Y66W UDG is deficient in establishing a full complement of interactions in the uracil binding pocket. (iv) The changes in the relative intrinsic fluorescences of UDG in the presence of uracil (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f7">7</xref>) support the view that the Y66W mutation has resulted in poor binding of uracil in its active site. Earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c39">39</xref>) suggested that the rate of catalysis by UDG is limited by the slower rate of product release. Since the affinity of the products to the Y66W UDG is highly compromised (no inhibition by the products), it is quite likely that the actual efficiency of the glycosidic bond cleavage by the Y66W UDG is compromised to an extent larger than the apparent decrease of &#x0223c;7-fold in its overall rate. Importantly, and consistent with our earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c23">23</xref>), this observation supports the role of the Y66 residue in UDGs in assisting transition state substrate binding in the active site pocket and in decreasing the rate of product release. As the unprotected AP sites in DNA are mutagenic and toxic, Y66 of this repair enzyme (UDG) may perform an important function in shielding the AP site in DNA (by decreasing product release) until its recognition by a relevant AP endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c39">39</xref>).</p><p>The fluorescence quenching studies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f7">7</xref>) allow us to draw further insights into the complex mechanism of UDG inhibition kinetics by uracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c7">7</xref>). The crystal structures have clearly revealed that by the virtue of uracil binding in the active site pocket, it should be a competitive inhibitor of UDGs. However, a number of biochemical studies have shown that uracil is a non-competitive inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c13">13</xref>). The observed biphasic nature of the uracil binding profile to the wild-type UDG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f7">7</xref>B, i) suggests that in addition to binding to the active site pocket, uracil binds to UDGs at some other site(s) as well. The lack of Y66W UDG inhibition suggests that uracil binding to this site alone does not lead to a direct inhibition of enzyme activity. However, the binding of uracil to the second site may still facilitate its channeling into the active site pocket to result in a complex mode of inhibition, which is apparently non-competitive. Interestingly, from a physiological perspective, the additional binding site(s) on the enzyme may help in rapid localization of the substrate into the active site pocket of UDG and in conferring processivity to this enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c40">40</xref>).</p><p>Finally, while an N-terminal deletion construct (UNG1 &#x00394;N29) of human UDG1 (precursor of the mitochondrial UDG) is resistant to inhibition by AP-DNA, it is sensitive to inhibition by uracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c41">41</xref>). And, although the mutations in human UDG (Y147A and Y147C) have been described that are resistant to inhibition by uracil, these are &#x0003e;1000-fold compromised in their uracil excision activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg918c19">19</xref>). On the other hand, the Y66W UDG is only &#x0223c;7-fold compromised in its catalytic activity (compared with the wild-type counterpart). To our knowledge, the Y66W is the first characterized UDG mutant, which is an efficient enzyme and which shows no susceptibility to either of the reaction products. Furthermore, the observation that in the UDG assays, the only cleavage products that we detected corresponds to specific excision of uracils (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg918f5">5</xref>), and the fact that the Y66W protein was hyperexpressed <italic>in vivo</italic>, clearly show that it retains high specificity towards uracils in DNA. The biochemical studies described here pave the way for determination of the structural basis of the fascinating properties of the Y66W UDG mutant.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg918f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) Uracil specificity pocket showing the interactions between the uracil residue, and the side chains of Y66, F77, N123 and H187 in the active site pocket of <italic>E.coli</italic> UDG (PDB code 1FLZ).
