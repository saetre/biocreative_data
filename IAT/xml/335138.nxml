About 2kb mRNA of the clone was accumulated in all the mature and immature lymphoid and myeloid cell lines tested, and two of three erythroblastoid cell lines, but not in any cell lines of non-hematopoietic tissues. The same mRNA was also detected in normal lymphoid and myeloid tissues and peripheral blood lymphocytes, granulocytes and macrophages, but again not in non-hematopoietic tissues. Nucleotide sequence of the HS1 predicts a protein of 486 amino acids (Mr 53,931). N-terminal half of the protein retains unique repeating motifs, each of which shows a significant homology with the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif of several proteins reported previously. C-terminal half of the protein retains a region conserved between non-receptor tyrosine kinases (src family), phospholipase C(PLC)-148 and the crk oncogene product. A unique feature of HS1 suggests that the protein may be involved in signal transduction and regulation of gene expression.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0460-a" xlink:role="9374"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0461-a" xlink:role="9375"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0462-a" xlink:role="9376"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0453.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9367"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0454.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9368"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0455.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9369"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0456.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9370"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0457.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9371"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0458.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9372"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0459.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9373"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0460.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9374"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0461.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9375"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0462.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9376"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0463.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9377"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0464.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9378"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00139-0465.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9379"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
