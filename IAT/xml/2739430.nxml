This extreme phenotype is due in part to an 11-bp loss-of-function deletion in the myostatin gene that has been fixed in the breed (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000666-Grobet1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>), as well as to ongoing selection on as of yet unidentified polygenes influencing muscularity. As in other breeds, intense selection has substantially reduced the effective population size. Extensive reliance on artificial insemination (AI), in particular, by allowing popular sires to have thousands of descendants, narrows the genetic basis. The concomitant increase in the rate of inbreeding causes recurrent outbreaks of recessive defects. Inherited defects that have lately afflicted the BBCB include the recently described Congenital Muscular Dystonias (CMD) I and II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000666-Charlier1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>As a result of this peculiar demography of domestic animal populations, inherited defects generally involve unique &#x0201c;founder&#x0201d; mutations. Allelic homogeneity greatly facilitates positional identification using identity-by-descent (IBD) mapping, as recently demonstrated using the first generation high density SNP arrays for the bovine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000666-Charlier1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The genes underlying CMD I &#x00026; II were readily mapped, and the causative mutations in the <italic>ATP2A1</italic> and <italic>SLC6A5</italic> genes identified. The widespread use of the resulting diagnostic tests allowed immediate and effective control of the corresponding pathologies.</p><p>We herein report the positional identification of the mutation causing a novel, recently appeared defect referred to as Crooked Tail Syndrome (CTS). The incidence of CTS has risen very suddenly in the BBCB, and 25&#x00025; of animals now appear to be CTS carriers. We herein provide strong evidence for exacerbated muscular development of carriers of the CTS mutation, conferring &#x0201c;heterozygote advantage&#x0201d; underlying the selective sweep that raised the causative mutation to alarming proportions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Crooked Tail Syndrome (CTS) exhibits variable expressivity</title><p>We recently established a heredo-surveillance platform operating in close collaboration with field veterinarians to rapidly identify emerging genetic defects. As part of these activities, 105 CTS cases were reported to the platform between November 2006 and November 2007. In addition to the striking deviation of the tail (equally likely to be dextro- or levo-rotatory), detailed clinical examination revealed three symptoms shared by all cases: (i) general growth retardation manifesting itself at approximately one month of age, (ii) abnormal skull shape manifested as a shortened broad head, and (iii) extreme muscular hypertrophy including a conspicuous outgrowth of the gluteus medius anchor. Additional symptoms were observed in a substantial proportion but not all cases: (i) spastic paresis of the hind limbs affecting either the quadriceps only (22&#x00025;), or quadriceps and gastrocnemius (14&#x00025;), often associated with straight hocks, (ii) short, straight and extended fore limbs (33&#x00025;), and (iii) pronounced scoliosis with asymmetric development of the muscles of the back (20&#x00025;). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000666-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the corresponding symptomatology.

To refine the map location of the CTS locus we genotyped the 105 reported CTS cases for five SNPs covering the 2.4 Mb interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000666-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The SNPs were selected on the basis of the low population frequency of the disease-associated allele. Genotyping was achieved by first sequencing 35 pools of three animals, followed by individual sequencing of the pools revealing the presence of the major allele and therefore of one or more recombinants. This approach allowed us to confine the critical region to the 812 Kb rs29010018 - AAFC03034831 interval. It comprises seven annotated genes which were ranked on the basis of their perceived relevance with regard to the CTS condition. Coding exons were sequenced in an affected and a matched healthy control individual.</p><fig id="pgen-1000666-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000666.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Positional identification of the <italic>c.2904_2905delAG MRC2</italic> mutation causing CTS, and its effect of the Endo180 protein.</title><p>(A) Gene content of the 2.4 Mb interval in which the CTS mutation was located using identity-by-descent mapping.

The <italic>MRC2</italic> gene encodes the 180 kDa Endocytic Transmembrane Glycoprotein (Endo180), one of the four members of the mannose receptor family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000666-East1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000666-Behrendt1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Endo180 is a recycling endocytic receptor that is predominantly expressed in mesenchymal cells such as stromal fibroblasts and in the chondrocytes and osteoblasts/osteocytes in the developing bones, and is proposed to play a role in regulating extracellular matrix degradation and remodelling. It has C-type lectin activity, binds collagen and interacts with urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) in a trimolecular cell surface complex with pro-urokinase plasminogen activator (pro-uPA). The 180 kD Endo180 protein comprises an aminoterminal cysteine-rich domain of unknown function, a fibronectin type II domain which mediates collagen binding, eight C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs) of which the second mediates Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent lectin activity, a stop-transfer signal anchoring this single-pass transmembrane protein in the membrane, and a carboxyterminal cytoplasmic domain allowing association with adaptor proteins in the clathrin coat. The mutation identified in CTS cases is located in exon 20 and deletes nucleotides 2904 and 2905 of the <italic>MRC2</italic> cDNA (<italic>c.2904_2905delAG</italic>). It is predicted to append a frame-shifted 30-residue peptide to a truncated Endo180 receptor missing the CTLD6-8 domains, the stop-transfer signal and the cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000666-g002">Figure 2B,C,D</xref>). As a result, the mutated protein should be unable to localize to the plasma membrane and mediate receptor-mediated endocytosis.</p><p>We developed a 5&#x02032; exonuclease assay for the mutation and genotyped the 105 reported CTS cases. All proved to be homozygous for the <italic>c.2904_2905delAG</italic> mutation. We then genotyped 1,899 healthy Belgian Blue animals. Unexpectedly, 24.7&#x00025; of animals appeared to be carriers, without a single homozygous mutant (p&#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup> assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium).

To test this hypothesis we estimated the effect of carrier genotype on 22 type traits evaluating muscularity, skeletal conformation, size and leg soundness, which are systematically recorded as part of the selection programs implemented in the BBCB. The analysis was conducted on 519 pedigreed bulls, including 148 carrier and 371 homozygous wild-type animals, using a mixed model including fixed effects of <italic>MRC2</italic> genotype, year at scoring, body condition and age at scoring, as well as a random individual animal effect. Variance components and effects were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) analysis. Highly significant effects were obtained for the four categories of recorded traits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000666-t001">Table 1</xref>). CTS carrier animals were smaller, stockier and more heavily muscled. They had a thinner skeleton and more rounded ribs, which are characteristics of beef cattle. <italic>MRC2</italic> genotype accounted for 3.6&#x00025;, 3.6&#x00025; and 2.6&#x00025; for the genetic variance of height, muscularity and general appearance, respectively.

sweep</title><p>To more directly demonstrate the occurrence of a selective sweep, we performed the following analysis. Examination of the available genealogies of the 105 affected individuals indicated that all of them trace back to Pr&#x000e9;cieux, a popular AI sire, via both sire and dam. This suggested that Pr&#x000e9;cieux, born in 1980, was CTS carrier and that its extensive utilization in the mid eighties spread the CTS mutation in BBCB. Genotyping Pr&#x000e9;cieux and three of his sons for the <italic>C.2904_2905delAG</italic> mutation and the 60K Illumina chip, indeed demonstrated that he carried the CTS mutation embedded in the SNP haplotype shared homozygous-by-descent by the examined cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000666-Charlier1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the vast majority of <italic>C.2904_2905delAG</italic> mutations encountered in present-day BBCB animals, trace back to Pr&#x000e9;cieux.</p><p>We obtained DNA samples from all BBCB sires (174) born between 2003 and 2005, whose semen had been commercialized by one of the ten major Belgian AI studs. Such AI sires are heavily selected for extreme muscularity. Examination of the pedigrees indicated that 160 of the 174 &#x0005b;2003&#x02013;2005&#x0005d; AI sires were descendents of Pr&#x000e9;cieux. The number of generations separating these sires from Pr&#x000e9;cieux averaged 5.9 (range: 3 to 8). Genotyping the <italic>C.2904_2905delAG</italic> mutation in this cohort identified 45 CTS carriers, all of them amongst the 160 descendents of Pr&#x000e9;cieux.</p><p>Assuming that the CTS mutation indeed underwent a selective sweep, 45 carriers out of the 160 Pr&#x000e9;cieux descendants would be significantly higher than expected by chance alone. To verify this assumption we simulated the segregation of a mutation in the true genealogy of the 160 descendants of Pr&#x000e9;cieux and counted the resulting number of carrier bulls. In these simulations, Pr&#x000e9;cieux was systematically assumed to be carrier, while the frequency of the mutation in animals unrelated to Pr&#x000e9;cieux varied from 0 to 0.05. In the absence of selection (i.e. if a carrier animal is equally likely to transmit either the mutation or the wild-type allele to anyone of its descendents), the probability to obtain 45/160 carriers was 0.0014, 0.0023 and 0.0130 for mutation frequencies (outside the Pr&#x000e9;cieux lineage) of 0.00, 0.01 and 0.05, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000666.s001">Table S1</xref>). Thus we can confidently assert that the <italic>C.2904_2905delAG</italic> mutation indeed underwent a selective sweep in the BBCB.</p><p>To have some quantitative assessment of the intensity of the selective sweep, we repeated the &#x0201c;gene dropping&#x0201d; simulations while varying the degree of segregation distortion in favour of the mutant allele. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000666-g005">Figure 5</xref> shows the proportion of simulations yielding 45/160 carrier bulls as a function of the transmission probability of the CTS mutation from carrier parents to offspring. It can be seen that the outcome of 45/160 carrier bulls is most likely for a transmission rate between 0.62&#x02236;0.38 (mutation frequency outside Pr&#x000e9;cieux lineage of 0.05) and 0.67&#x02236;0.33 (mutation frequency outside Pr&#x000e9;cieux lineage &#x02264;0.01). The fact that all 105 CST cases traced back to Pr&#x000e9;cieux both on the dam and sire side, indicates that the mutation frequency outside of the Precieux lineage is closer to 1&#x00025; than to 5&#x00025;. Thus, a carrier animal is approximately two times more likely to be selected than a non-carrier sib.</p><fig id="pgen-1000666-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000666.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Distribution of the number of simulations (out of 10,000) yielding 45 carriers out of 160 Pr&#x000e9;cieux descendants (Y-axis), as a function of the rate of transmission of the mutation from heterozygous carriers (X-axis).</title><p>Three curves are given corresponding to frequencies of the mutation outside of the Pr&#x000e9;cieux lineage of 0, 1, and 5&#x00025;.

Clinical manifestations of CTS are dominated by skeletal and muscular anomalies. Skeletal symptoms including growth retardation, abnormally shaped legs and skulls, are perfectly compatible with the known involvement of <italic>MRC2</italic> in regulating extracellular matrix degradation and remodeling and its strong expression in developing bone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000666-WagenaarMiller1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The muscular symptoms, including muscular hypertrophy, tail deviation and spastic paresis are more difficult to rationalize, although a role for the related mannose receptor in myoblast motility and muscle growth has been recently reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000666-Jansen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. We cannot formally exclude the possibility that the muscular manifestations result from distinct sequence variants in linkage disequilibrium with the CTS mutation, although we favor the more parsimonious hypothesis of a single causative mutation.</p><p>It is noteworthy that mice homozygous for a targeted deletion of <italic>MRC2</italic> exons 2 to 6 have been generated in two independent laboratories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000666-East2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000666-Engelholm1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Both laboratories reported that the mice were viable and fertile, although more recently a minor deficiency in long bone growth, bone mineral density and calvarial bone formation has been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000666-WagenaarMiller1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Cells derived from these animals show a clear defect in collagen uptake and degradation. One reason for the more pronounced clinical manifestations in cattle than in mice may lie in the distinct nature of the murine and CTS <italic>MRC2</italic> mutations. Cells isolated from the genetically modified mice express a mRNA species in which exon 1 (containing the signal sequence) is spliced in frame onto exon 7 (containing CTLD2), and in embryonic fibroblasts a truncated Endo180 protein missing the cysteine-rich, FNII and CTLD1 domains can be expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000666-East2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, little or no truncated protein is found in postnatal tissues from these knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000666-Engelholm1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000666-Curino1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively it may be that there are distinct degrees of redundancy between members of the mannose receptor family in different species. Also the more striking phenotype in cattle may be due the different genetic background and particularly the fact that the studied animals were all homozygous for a <italic>MSTN</italic> loss-of-function mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000666-Grobet1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This hypothesis could be tested by mating the available <italic>MRC2</italic> and <italic>MSTN</italic> knock-out mice. Whatever the reason, at this point bovine CTS may be the more informative model to decipher <italic>MRC2</italic> function, and to assist in the identification of as of yet unidentified human pathological conditions resulting from <italic>MRC2</italic> loss-of-function.</p><p>We provide very strong evidence of phenotypic manifestations of the CTS mutation in carriers. This is more than likely reflecting dosage sensitivity for Endo180, as NMD causes the mutant protein to be present at near undetectable levels, thus very unlikely to affect cellular function <italic>per se</italic>. Enhanced muscularity of CTS carriers has supposedly contributed greatly to the rapid increase of the CTS mutation in the BBCB. Indeed, we demonstrate that carrier animals have approximately two times more chance to be selected as elite sires than their non-carrier sibs. Note that this is the level of segregation distortion expected for a gene that accounts for &#x0223c;5&#x00025; of the genetic variance for a trait with heritability of &#x0223c;25&#x00025; and assuming a selection intensity of &#x0223c;2&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000666.s002">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>Such selective sweep is reminiscent of the spread of other inherited defects in domestic animals as a result of advantageous traits exhibited by carriers.

Assume a normally disturbed trait with 25&#x00025; heritability, influenced by a QTN with MAF 1 of 0.25 and with two possible genotypes in the population (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; and &#x0002b;/M) as is the case for the CTS mutation. Assume that the average phenotype of the &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; population is -&#x003b4;/2 and of the &#x0002b;/M population is &#x0002b;&#x003b4;/2. Assume also that the residual variance is 1. The table shows, for varying values of &#x003b4;, the proportion of the phenotypic (P-PV) and genetic variance (P-GV) explained by the QTN in the general population. Assume that one selects future AI sires amongst offspring of popular &#x0002b;/M heterozygous sires. The table shows, for five hypothetical phenotypic threshold values for selection T&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.00&#x02013;2.00, the proportion of sons selected (Prop-Sel), and amongst the selected sons, the ratio of carrier (&#x0002b;/M) versus non-carriers (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;) (C/NC). Dams were assumed to be &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; for simplicity. It can be seen that the observed &#x0223c;2&#x02236;1 segregation ratio observed for CTS implies a selection intensity of the order of 0.02 for a QTN that accounts for &#x0223c;0.05 of the genetic variance in the general population.
