SLP-76 is constitutively associated with the adapter Gads in platelets, which also binds to tyrosine phosphorylated LAT, thereby providing a potential pathway of regulation of SLP-76. <italic>Objective:</italic>In the present study, we have compared the role of Gads alongside that of LAT following activation of the major platelet glycoprotein receptors using mice deficient in the two adapter proteins. <italic>Results:</italic>Gads was found to be required for the efficient onset of aggregation and secretion in response to submaximal stimulation of GPVI and CLEC-2, but to be dispensable for activation following stronger stimulation of the two receptors. Gads was also dispensable for spreading induced through integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> or the GPIb&#x02013;IX&#x02013;V complex. Further, Gads plays a negligible role in aggregate formation on collagen at an arteriolar rate of shear. In stark contrast, platelets deficient in the adapter LAT exhibit a marked decrease in aggregation and secretion following activation of GPVI and CLEC-2, and are unable to form stable aggregates on collagen at arteriolar shear. <italic>Conclusions:</italic>The results demonstrate that Gads plays a key role in linking the adapter LAT to SLP-76 in response to weak activation of GPVI and CLEC-2 whereas LAT is required for full activation over a wider range of agonist concentrations. These results reveal the presence of a Gads-independent pathway of platelet activation downstream of LAT.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CLEC-2</kwd><kwd>Gads</kwd><kwd>GPVI</kwd><kwd>LAT</kwd><kwd>platelet</kwd><kwd>signalosome</kwd><kwd>SLP-76</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Immunoreceptor-tyrosine-based-activation motifs (ITAMs) are characterized by the presence of two YxxL/I motifs separated by 6&#x02013;12 amino acids and are present on the cytosolic chains of a number of hematopoietic-specific immunoglobulin receptors, including Fc receptors, T- and B-cell antigen receptors (TCR and BCR), and the platelet collagen receptor complex, GPVI&#x02013;FcR&#x003b3; chain. This group of receptors signals through Src family kinase-dependent phosphorylation of the conserved tyrosines in the ITAM leading to recruitment of a Syk family kinase via its tandem SH2 domains, and stimulation of a downstream signaling cascade, which results in activation of phospholipase C (PLC) &#x003b3;. A novel variation of this signaling pathway has been described in which the C-type lectin family receptors, CLEC-2, Dectin-1, and CLEC-9A, signal through sequential activation of Src and Syk family tyrosine kinases downstream of a single YxxL sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>].</p><p>Adapter proteins play a critical role in signaling by ITAMs and the ITAM-like receptors described above by forming a protein-scaffold that serves to recruit PLC&#x003b3; to the membrane. This is illustrated by the role of the membrane adapter LAT and the two cytosolic adapters, Gads (Mona/Grap2/GrpL/Grf40) and SLP-76 in regulation of PLC&#x003b3;1 in T cells. Gads binds constitutively to SLP-76 and associates with LAT upon T-cell receptor (TCR) activation forming a LAT signalosome that is critical for activation of PLC&#x003b3;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. Mice deficient in LAT and SLP-76 have a complete inhibition of pre-TCR signaling, leading to an absence of circulating, mature T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]. Similarly, there is a complete loss of activation of PLC&#x003b3;1 by the TCR in LAT-deficient or SLP-76-deficient Jurkat cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>]. In contrast, there is a limited degree of signaling by the pre-TCR in the absence of Gads, resulting in a reduced number of mature T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, disruption of the interaction between SLP-76 and Gads has been shown to impair TCR signaling in Jurkat cells by approximately 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>]. Thus, there is an absolute requirement for LAT and SLP-76 in the activation of PLC&#x003b3;1 by the TCR, whereas the role for Gads can be partially bypassed.</p><p>The LAT signalosome plays an important role in the activation of platelets by the platelet collagen receptor GPVI and the C-type lectin receptor, CLEC-2. However, in contrast to signaling through the TCR, a limited degree of activation of PLC&#x003b3;2 is induced by both receptors in platelets deficient in LAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, CLEC-2 is able to induce a partial activation of PLC&#x003b3;2 in the absence of SLP-76, whereas this adapter is critical for the activation of the phospholipase by GPVI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. Thus, there are important differences in the roles of LAT and SLP-76 in signaling between GPVI and CLEC-2 in platelets, and also with the TCR. Interestingly, SLP-76 is required for activation of PLC&#x003b3;2 downstream of two other major platelet glycoprotein receptors, integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> and GPIb&#x02013;IX&#x02013;V [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>]. However, in both cases, it is controversial as to whether this is mediated downstream of an ITAM-containing protein.</p><p>Very little is known about the role of Gads in platelets. Gads associates with SLP-76 in platelets and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation of GPVI by the synthetic collagen, CRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. In the only functional study using Gads-deficient platelets, Judd <italic>et al.</italic> [15] reported that Gads is dispensable for &#x003b1;-granule secretion in platelets induced by a high concentration of GPVI-specific agonist, convulxin, whereas LAT is essential for this response. In contrast, the same research group has shown that mutation of the Gads binding site on SLP-76 impairs GPVI-induced platelet secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>]. To definitively characterize the role of Gads in platelets, we have carried out an extensive investigation of Gads-deficient platelets following activation by GPVI, CLEC-2, integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>, and GPIb&#x02013;IX&#x02013;V.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Genetically modified mice deficient in Gads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>] and LAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>] were bred as heterozygotes to generate knockouts and littermate controls.

Confirmation that the 38 and 76 kDa bands correspond to LAT and SLP-76 was achieved by immunoprecipitation of both proteins and Western blotting (not shown).</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Gads associates with LAT and SLP-76 in platelets.

In agreement with previous studies, LAT was demonstrated to be critical for GPVI-mediated aggregation and secretion, with only high concentrations of CRP inducing aggregation in the LAT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Further, LAT<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> platelets form a monolayer but are unable to aggregate when flowed over collagen at an arteriolar rate of flow, consistent with the critical role for dense granule secretion in mediating aggregate development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>]. LAT is also critical for secretion and aggregation induced by low concentrations of the CLEC-2 ligand rhodocytin, whereas recovery is seen at higher concentrations. However, LAT does not play a role in signaling by integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> or GPIB&#x02013;IX&#x02013;V. In comparison, Gads has a minor role in mediating platelet activation by GPVI and CLEC-2, as illustrated by the delay in onset and reduction in aggregation and secretion following activation by low but not high concentrations of CRP and rhodocytin, respectively. Further, Gads does not mediate spreading by integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> and GPIb&#x02013;IX&#x02013;V, although this is not surprising, given the lack of a role for LAT in this event. Thus, these results illustrate a differential role for LAT and Gads in supporting platelet activation by GPVI and CLEC-2, whereas neither plays a role in mediating spreading induced by integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> and GPIb&#x02013;IX&#x02013;V.</p><p>The minor role for Gads in supporting GPVI signaling in platelets is in line with its more limited role in TCR signaling relative to that of LAT and SLP-76. For example, mice deficient in Gads have a marked reduction in mature T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>] as a consequence of inhibited pre-TCR signaling, whereas mice deficient in LAT and SLP-76 have no circulating T cells. Further, mutation of the site of interaction of Gads with LAT reduces signaling through the T-cell receptor by approximately 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>] in contrast to the full inhibition of T-cell signaling that is observed in the absence of LAT and SLP-76 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>]. Thus, Gads plays a relatively minor role in both platelets and T cells in comparison with that of LAT and SLP-76, and its major function may be to facilitate the interaction of the two adapter proteins in response to low, threshold levels of receptor stimulation. In theory, the breeding of mice that are deficient in both Gads and LAT is required to confirm a role for Gads in the regulation of LAT in that a similar level of inhibition should be seen in mice platelets deficient in LAT to those deficient in LAT and Gads. However, the relatively small phenotype observed in the absence of Gads would render it difficult to obtain an unequivocal answer on this.</p><p>Platelets express the Gads-related adapter, Grb2, which also binds to LAT and SLP-76. This raises the possibility that a role for Gads could be masked by the presence of Grb2, especially in light of studies in a DT40 cell model reporting that Gads and Grb2 are both able to couple LAT and SLP-76, albeit that Gads does this more efficiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>]. Indeed, this is consistent with the present result, which demonstrates that Grb2 associates strongly with LAT but only weakly with SLP-76, whereas Gads is constitutively associated with SLP-76 (not shown). The strong binding of Grb2 to LAT is explained by the presence of three sites for association of Grb2 with LAT at phosphotyrosines Y171, Y191, and Y226 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>], compared with a single site for Gads at phosphotyrosine Y191, and to a lesser extent Y171 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>]. However, the increased binding of Gads to SLP-76 is explained by the very high affinity of the association between the C-terminal SH3 domain of Gads and a RxxK motif on SLP-76 of 3 n<sc>m</sc> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>]. This is an atypical interaction, as the majority of SH3 domains bind to proline rich sequences with micromolar affinity, including the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2, which binds to a proline rich region in SLP-76 with an affinity of 3 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the present observations and previous data emphasize that SLP-76 and LAT are the key adapters in bringing PLC&#x003b3;2 to the membrane, with SLP-76 being essential for tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the phospholipase. In the absence of LAT, a limited degree of tyrosine phosphorylation activation of PLC&#x003b3; occurs, which is sufficient to enable recovery of aggregation to high concentrations of CRP in the absence of shear. However, platelet aggregation on collagen at arteriolar shear is abolished in the absence of LAT (present results) resulting in increased tail-bleeding and impaired thrombus formation <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>]. Interestingly, a reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk was also observed in the absence of LAT in platelets stimulated by CRP and rhodocytin. This reduction is most likely due to increased accessibility of tyrosine residues in Syk to protein tyrosine phosphatases in the absence of LAT. In addition, however, we have also identified a novel positive feedback role for Syk in mediating its own phosphorylation in rhodocytin-stimulated platelets, which also contributes to this reduction in phosphorylation (Spalton JC, Watson SP, unpublished).</p><p>In comparison to LAT and SLP-76, Gads has a relatively minor role in recruiting SLP-76 to LAT and activation of PLC&#x003b3;2, and does not contribute to platelet aggregation at arteriolar shear. Indeed, it may be that the evolution of a role for Gads in mediating the interaction between LAT and SLP-76 has occurred because of its role in facilitating weak signaling by the pre-TCR to ensure an optimal number of mature T cells in the circulation rather than to facilitate TCR or platelet activation at higher agonist concentrations. Consistent with this theory, Gads can be bypassed in an active PLC&#x003b3; signalosome as PLC&#x003b3; can be recruited to LAT through a direct interaction between LAT Y132 and its N-terminal SH2 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>].</p><p>The differing dependency on LAT and SLP-76 in the GPVI and CLEC-2 signaling cascades could reflect either the presence of a LAT-like molecule in platelets or the presence of a LAT-independent pathway of recruitment of SLP-76 to the membrane. The present study does not distinguish between these two possibilities. However, in a related line of work in the laboratory, we have been unable to find evidence for a functional role of the known LAT-like adapters in mediating platelet activation by GPVI (Pearce AC, Schraven B, Hughes CE, Watson SP, unpublished data). Thus, we favor a model in which SLP-76 and PLC&#x003b3;2 are able to interact at the membrane independent of a LAT-like membrane adapter protein, with Gads and LAT having evolved to increase the magnitude of signaling. Thus, the mechanism of activation of LAT-deficient platelets by GPVI and CLEC-2 may be similar to that used by integrin &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> and GPIb&#x02013;IX&#x02013;V, which induce relatively weak activation through LAT-independent, SLP-76-dependent activation of PLC&#x003b3;2.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that the adapter Gads plays a minor role in mediating platelet activation by GPVI and CLEC-2, emphasizing an alternate pathway through which LAT and SLP-76 regulate PLC&#x003b3;2.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank M.
