Current thinking holds that BCR-ABL forms a multi-protein complex that incorporates several substrates and adaptor proteins and is stabilized by multiple direct and indirect interactions. Signaling output from this highly redundant network leads to cellular transformation. Proteins known to be associated with BCR-ABL in this complex include: GRB2, c-CBL, p62<sup>DOK</sup>, and CRKL. These proteins in turn, link BCR-ABL to various signaling pathways indicated in cellular transformation. In this study we show that a triple mutant of BCR-ABL with mutations of the direct binding sites for GRB2, CBL, p62<sup>DOK</sup> and CRKL, is defective for transformation of primary hematopoietic cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and in a murine CML model, while it retains the capacity to induce IL-3 independence in 32D cells. Compared to BCR-ABL, the triple mutant's ability to activate the MAP kinase and PI3-kinase pathways is severely compromised, while STAT5 phosphorylation is maintained, suggesting that the former are crucial for the transformation of primary cells, but dispensable for transformation of factor dependent cell lines. Our data suggest that inhibition of BCR-ABL-induced leukemia by disrupting protein interactions could be possible, but would require blocking of multiple sites.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase is the molecular hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and its kinase activity is required for disease induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Lugo1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Zhang1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the complicated network of interactions that results, the role and relative importance of individual components has been difficult to establish.</p><p>To determine the necessity of various proteins for BCR-ABL function, a common approach has been to identify a binding site for a specific protein on BCR-ABL, mutate the site and analyze the effect on BCR-ABL function. The ability of BCR-ABL constructs to transform IL-3 dependent hematopoietic cell lines to factor independent growth is a common tool used to assess BCR-ABL function. For example, tyrosine 177 of BCR-ABL is the binding site for the adaptor protein GRB2, which links BCR-ABL to the RAS pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Pendergast1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Puil1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the C-terminus of BCR-ABL, a proline-rich region is a direct binding site for the adaptor protein CRKL.

For example, direct binding of CRKL to BCR-ABL is abolished in the proline-rich deletion mutant, but CRKL interacts indirectly with BCR-ABL and is still tyrosine phosphorylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Heaney1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, to address the role of various signaling pathways simultaneously and to circumvent difficulties posed by the potential for indirect interactions, we created a mutant of BCR-ABL with a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation at amino acid 177 (Y177F), an SH2 domain deletion (&#x00394;SH2) and a deletion of the C-terminal proline-rich region (&#x00394;Pro).

Individual clones were isolated from soft agar cultures and evaluated for expression of BCR-ABL. Several clones expressing BCR-ABL at comparable levels were selected and analyzed for IL-3 dependence by cell proliferation and viability assays. All clones were maintained in the presence of IL-3 prior to assessment of factor independent growth. The parental 32D cells were unable to proliferate in the absence of IL-3, whereas wild type BCR-ABL, the Y177F, &#x00394;SH2, &#x00394;Pro and the triple mutant BCR-ABL grew at comparable rates, indicating the triple mutant is capable of inducing factor independent growth. The result of a representative cell proliferation assay with the triple mutant is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007439-g001">Figure 1A</xref> (data not shown for single mutants). The wild type and triple mutant clones represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007439-g001">Figure 1</xref> were chosen for further study due to similarity in BCR-ABL expression levels.

The emerging view is that BCR-ABL assembles a multi-protein complex whose signaling output leads to cellular transformation. Deciphering the contribution to transformation of individual domains of BCR-ABL or signaling proteins has been problematic as many proteins can interact both directly and indirectly with BCR-ABL. For example, deletion of a proline-rich motif in the C-terminus of BCR-ABL abolishes direct binding of BCR-ABL to the N-terminal SH3 domain of CRKL; however, CRKL remains tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with BCR-ABL in cells expressing this deletion mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Heaney1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This is likely the result of interactions between CRKL and other adaptor or signaling molecules, such as c-CBL or p62<sup>DOK</sup> which have been shown to link CRKL indirectly to BCR-ABL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Bhat1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Bhat2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, an individual domain or binding site can mediate binding to more than one protein. For example, the SH2 domain mediates an association of BCR-ABL with CBL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Sattler2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Bhat1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and p62<sup>DOK</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Bhat2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Even the use of animals that lack specific signaling proteins has not been particularly revealing. In some cases, such as GRB2, the null phenotype is embryonic lethal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Cheng1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In others, such as c-CBL null animals, no defect in BCR-ABL transformation has been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Dinulescu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. This result could be interpreted as a lack of necessity of the specific protein for BCR-ABL function or compensation for the deleted gene by other proteins.</p><p>To investigate the necessity of various signaling proteins for BCR-ABL, we sought to identify a BCR-ABL mutant that remained kinase active, yet lacked transformation capacity. This was accomplished by the construction of a triple mutant including the Y177F substitution in BCR and deletions of the SH2 and the C-terminal proline-rich domains of ABL. In isolation the Y177F, &#x00394;SH2 and &#x00394;Pro single mutants of BCR-ABL are capable of rendering myeloid cells IL-3 independent for growth, but they are much less potent than wild type BCR-ABL for transformation of fibroblasts. In a murine bone marrow transplantation model both the Y177F and &#x00394;SH2 mutants induced leukemia <italic>in vivo</italic>, however in contrast to the myeloid phenotype of the wild type mice the phenotype of these single mutants was lymphoid and latency was increased <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Million1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Roumiantsev1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The C-terminal proline-rich domain has been examined in the p185<sup>BCR-ABL</sup> background as a single mutation and in combination with deletion of the ABL SH3 domain. Mutants expressing a deletion of the proline-rich domain alone and in combination with the SH3 domain were also capable of transforming hematopoietic cells to factor independent growth. The single mutations induced a leukemia similar to wild type when transplanted into mice, however the double mutant induced an undetermined disease with recipients surviving twice as long as wild type recipient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Dai1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Using a triple mutant of BCR-ABL (Y177F, &#x00394;SH2, and &#x00394;Pro), we show that this mutant still confers growth factor independence to 32D cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007439-g001">Figure 1</xref>), but exhibits a profound defect in the transformation of primary hematopoietic cells. To this end, we show that in Whitlock-Witte B-cell transformation assays the ability of the triple mutant to induce outgrowth is completely abrogated. Furthermore, the ability to form myeloid colonies in the absence of cytokines is severely compromised relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007439-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Consistent with these observations, the triple mutant was found to be incapable of inducing leukemia <italic>in vivo</italic> in a bone marrow transduction/transplantation model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007439-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, the mutant described here represents the first report of a BCR-ABL mutant retaining kinase activity that is completely transformation deficient <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>In vitro</italic> kinase assays revealed that the kinase activity of the triple mutant, although reduced compared to wild type, is equal to the activity of the &#x00394;SH2 single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007439-g002">Figure 2</xref>). As the &#x00394;SH2 mutant retains transformation competency in both cell lines and primary cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Oda1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Ilaria1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Roumiantsev1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, this strongly suggests that the reduced kinase activity is not causing the transformation defect.</p><p>Examination of the canonical BCR-ABL signaling pathways in 32D cells showed that only STAT5 activation was maintained at wild type levels, suggesting that activation of STAT5 may be sufficient to induce IL-3 independence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007439-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This is consistent with a report by Onishi and colleagues, that a constitutively active STAT5 mutant is capable of inducing IL-3 independent growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Onishi1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, the significantly reduced activity of the MAP kinase and PI3-kinase/AKT pathways suggest that they are not required for BCR-ABL to induce growth factor independence in the triple mutant cell lines. This is consistent with the findings of Cortez et al, that RAS activation alone is not sufficient for transformation by BCR-ABL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Cortez1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to STAT5 we found that tyrosine phosphorylation of p62<sup>DOK</sup> is maintained in the triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007439-g004">Figure 4</xref>), in contrast to CBL and CRKL tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus it is possible that p62<sup>DOK</sup> phosphorylation in addition to STAT5 is required for factor-independent growth. Many groups have attempted to determine the role of phosphorylated p62<sup>DOK</sup> in cellular signaling and suggest that phosphorylated p62<sup>DOK</sup> plays a role in the negative regulation of growth factor stimulated pathways and/or RAS signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Shah1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data suggest that CBL and CRKL phosphorylation are primarily required for modulation of cellular functions other than factor independent proliferation and survival. For example, signaling through CRKL could affect adhesion and migration via interactions with paxillin, CAS and CBL and by forming complexes with focal adhesion kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Salgia1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. It has also been suggested that CRKL may play a role in signaling via its interactions with integrins, B- and T-cell receptors and various cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Senechal2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. CRKL and CBL have been shown to interact in a multi-protein complex along with PI3-kinase when phosphorylated in BCR-ABL expressing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Sattler2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, phosphorylated CRKL can transform fibroblasts through association with SOS and C3G, thereby activating the RAS pathway, analogous to the role of GRB2 in the activation of the same pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Senechal1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation in the BCR-ABL triple mutant points out the complexity of BCR-ABL signaling. We have shown that CRKL co-immunoprecipitates with the &#x00394;Pro mutant of BCR-ABL in cellular lysates, although this mutant is not capable of directly binding CRKL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Heaney1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, and suggested that this interaction may be mediated by an association between CRKL and CBL, which in turn binds to the ABL SH2 domain in a tyrosine dependent manner. However, in the triple mutant, CRKL tyrosine phosphorylation and the association of CRKL and BCR-ABL are maintained, although the interaction between BCR-ABL and CBL is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007439-g003">Figure 3</xref>). As we know that there is no direct interaction between BCR-ABL and CRKL in the &#x00394;Pro mutant, this suggests that an unidentified protein(s) mediates the indirect interaction between CRKL and BCR-ABL.</p><p>Despite activation of STAT5, the BCR-ABL triple mutant is not able to induce leukemia <italic>in vivo</italic>. As noted, several signaling pathways are significantly impaired in this mutant, including the MAPK and PI3-kinase/AKT pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007439-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The fact that the respective single mutants are leukemogenic suggests that the combination of all three mutations abolishes leukemogenicity by overcoming the redundancy of the system. For example, the BCR-ABL Y177F mutant is deficient in GRB2 binding, but still activates RAS in 32D and BaF3 cells, likely via SH2 domain dependent interaction with GRB2 and SHC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Goga1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The fact that RAS activation via the SH2 domain is preserved in the Y177F mutant could explain why this mutant still maintains leukemogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, the SH2 domain of BCR-ABL has been shown to be required for activation of AKT through its association with the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Skorski1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. The combined impairment of PI3-kinase and RAS activation may explain the triple mutant's inability to transform primary hematopoietic progenitor cells.</p><p>It is not entirely clear which precise functional defect is responsible for the loss of leukemogenic potential. Bone marrow containing similar percentages of GFP positive cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007439.s002">Table S1</xref>) of vector control, wild type or triple mutant were used for transplantation. Proviral integration in hematopoietic tissues from mice transplanted with bone marrow infected with the triple mutant was detected by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007439-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), but not Southern blotting, indicating that only a small fraction of hematopoietic cells contained the triple mutant construct. Our results suggest that hematopoietic cells transduced with the triple mutant are at a selective disadvantage compared to cells transduced with wild type BCR-ABL or empty vector, as their proportion was reduced after engraftment. Further experiments will be required to determine whether this reflects failure of the cells to engraft or failure to expand after engraftment. The data from the B-cell and myeloid colony assays are clearly much more compatible with the second possibility. The data from the primary hematopoietic cells also support this assertion. Given the evidence demonstrating expression of BCR-ABL and of comparable levels of downstream signaling in primary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007439-g006">Figure 6</xref>), the identical nature of the vector backbone in all three constructs used and the fact that cell lines with high expression of the triple mutant were easily derived, low expression of the triple mutant does not appear to be a plausible explanation for the lack of disease in the mice transduced with the triple mutant bone marrow.</p><p>In summary, we show that mutation of BCR-ABL tyrosine 177 to phenylalanine in combination with deletion of the SH2 and proline rich domains abolishes the capacity of BCR-ABL to transform primary hematopoietic progenitor cells, but remains capable of inducing factor-independent growth in cell lines. This implies that a combination of small molecules that simultaneously block Y177 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Kardinal1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, the protein binding SH2 domain and the proline rich region could suppress BCR-ABL induced leukemia despite maintenance of kinase activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Construction of BCR-ABL<sup>p210</sup> mutants</title><p>Constructs containing the point mutation of tyrosine 177 to phenylalanine (Y177F) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Pendergast1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, deletion of the ABL SH2 domain (&#x00394;SH2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Oda1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, and deletion of the proline-rich region of the C terminus (&#x00394;Pro) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007439-Heaney1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, have been described previously. A &#x0201c;triple mutant&#x0201d; construct containing all three changes was created from wild-type BCR-ABL by a series of standard subcloning steps in a modified pGEM5z vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

However, cumbersome terminology such as &#x0201c;BCR-ABL with no mutations in the coding sequences of BCR and ABL&#x0201d; would be required to accurately describe the starting clone.
