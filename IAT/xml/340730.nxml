The genomic regions corresponding to these loops were subjected to structural analysis and they were found to represent different elements (IEs) inserted into the pseudogenes in a manner that gave rise to short target-site direct repeats. IE 36 (500 base-pairs in length) was found to be an intercisternal A-particle solo long terminal repeat (LTR), a 46 nucleotide region of which had undergone five-fold tandem amplification and subsequent mutation. IE 119 (501 base-pairs in length) was also a solo LTR, bearing similarity to the recently-described GLN-3 class of murine retroviral-like elements. IE 118 (865 base-pairs in length) is repeated 1000-2000 times in the mouse genome. It is not related to any known class of mobile elements, but does possess some sequence motifs that suggest it may be an LTR of a hitherto unrecognized family of retroviral-like elements. It also possesses a 26 out of 27 nucleotide identity to a region of the flanking pseudogene, suggesting that it may have suffered gene conversion.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0106-a" xlink:role="3294"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0114-a" xlink:role="3302"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3291"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3292"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3293"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3294"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3295"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3296"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3297"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3298"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3299"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3300"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3301"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3302"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3303"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00252-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3304"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
