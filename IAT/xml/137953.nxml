Analysis of interspecies heterokaryons revealed that xCIRP2 was capable of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and the RG4 domain functioned as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling signal.

In the nucleus, more than 20 species of hnRNP proteins package pre-mRNA into complexes called hnRNPs (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c6">6</xref>). A subset of hnRNP proteins is restricted to the nucleus, while others continuously shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c7">7</xref>). Previous studies on the transport of hnRNP A1 protein identified a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling signal (NSS), the M9 domain, that functions as both a nuclear localization signal and a nuclear export signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c10">10</xref>). Later on, shuttling signals have been identified in RNA-binding proteins such as hnRNP K, HuR and SR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c15">15</xref>). Nuclear import receptors for some of these NSS have been identified, yet export receptors are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c17">17</xref>). These nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins can exit the nucleus accompanying mRNA and affects the cytoplasmic fate of mRNA.</p><p>Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) was initially identified from the mouse testis by cDNA cloning of an RNA-recognition-motif (RRM)-containing RNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c18">18</xref>). CIRP consists of an N-terminal RRM and a C-terminal flanking glycine-rich region containing arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) repeats. This modular structure is similar to those of hnRNP A&#x0002f;B proteins, represented by hnRNP A1, except that hnRNP A&#x0002f;B proteins have two N-terminal RRMs. Mouse CIRP is highly expressed in the testis within the scrotum, which is maintained at temperatures lower than other parts of the body cavity, while its expression is repressed by exposing the testis to heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c19">19</xref>). The expression level of CIRP in cultured mouse cells increases upon a temperature downshift from 37 to 32&#x000b0;C and CIRP mediates the cold-induced cell growth suppression presumably by prolonging the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle, although the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c18">18</xref>).</p><p>CIRP homologs from human, rat, Mexican axolotl, bull frog and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c24">24</xref>). To date three <italic>Xenopus</italic> CIRP homologs were identified: XCIRP, XCIRP-1 and xCIRP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c26">26</xref>). XCIRP protein consists of 163 amino acids showing 74&#x00025; identity to mouse CIRP and its mRNA is highly expressed at a particular stage of pronephros formation at an early developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c23">23</xref>). XCIRP-1 was cloned as a major isoform of <italic>Xenopus</italic> CIRP, which differs from XCIRP in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c26">26</xref>). Microinjection of antisense RNA into <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos produces tailbuds with deformations of the brain and internal organs. Depletion of maternal XCIRP-1 mRNA also disrupts the morphogenetic migration of the blastomeres in pronephros lineage. We reported another <italic>Xenopus</italic> CIRP homolog, xCIRP2, as a major cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c25">25</xref>). xCIRP2 protein consists of 166 amino acids and shows &#x0003e;90&#x00025; identity to XCIRP and XCIRP-1. xCIRP2 3&#x02032;UTR is highly homologous to that of XCIRP-1 and the temporal expression patterns of the xCIRP2 mRNA during <italic>Xenopus</italic> early development is similar to XCIRP-1 mRNA, suggesting that xCIRP2 and XCIRP-1 represent two allelic forms. xCIRP2 mRNA and protein are highly expressed in oocytes, and in an adult frog xCIRP2 protein is most abundant in ovary, testis and brain. In a previous study, we examined the RNA-binding activity of xCIRP2 and demonstrated its cytoplasmic localization in the oocyte and possible association with ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c25">25</xref>). Taken together, it has been clarified that <italic>Xenopus</italic> CIRP plays key roles in differentiation and morphogenesis during early development. However, the molecular mechanisms by which <italic>Xenopus</italic> CIRP regulates RNA metabolism and thereby affects the embryonic development are still elusive.</p><p>Recently, there has been a magnified interest in the regulation of protein function by arginine methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c27">27</xref>). Various hnRNP proteins, including hnRNP A1, were reported to be methylated <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c30">30</xref>). A variety of protein substrates are methylated on arginine residues by protein-arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), a mammalian predominant type I arginine methyltransferase that catalyzes the asymmetric dimethylation of arginine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c35">35</xref>). Previous studies on the substrate specificity of arginine methylation in hnRNP A1 and other RNA-binding proteins identified a preferable recognition motif of (F&#x0002f;G)GG<underline>R</underline>G G(G&#x0002f;F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c36">36</xref>). This sequence includes the RGG domain found in many RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c36">36</xref>). The impact of this modification on <italic>in vivo</italic> function of hnRNP proteins is largely unclear.</p><p>In this report, we describe the identification of a <italic>Xenopus</italic> homolog of PRMT1 as an xCIRP2-binding protein. We examined the subcellular localization of xCIRP2 and identified an NSS containing RGG repeats in xCIRP2, which directed bidirectional trafficking of fusion proteins in cultured cells. Furthermore, we found that methylation of xCIRP2 by xPRMT1 resulted in the accumulation of xCIRP2 in the cytoplasm. Our results suggested that xCIRP2 and possibly mammalian CIRP serve to link RNA metabolism in the nucleus and the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Nucleotide sequence accession number</title><p>The complete nucleotide sequence of xPRMT1 cDNA obtained in this study will appear in the DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank nucleotide sequence databases under accession no.

A BLAST search of protein sequence database revealed that the predicted open reading frame encoded by one of the positive clones, clone 4.32, shows significant homology to mammalian PRMT1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f1">1</xref>). Sequence analysis of clone 4.32 revealed that it was an incomplete clone, lacking the 5&#x02032; region encoding the N-terminal end of the protein. By using the sequence information of an EST clone dab88b08.y1 that corresponds to the 5&#x02032; region of clone 4.32, a full-length cDNA was cloned from a <italic>Xenopu</italic>s cDNA library. This cDNA encoded an open reading frame of 369 amino acids. The primary structural comparison of the predicted open reading frame encoded by the cDNA revealed high homology with human PRMT1 (86&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c40">40</xref>), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> NM&#x0005f;075508 (60&#x00025;), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> CG6554 (62&#x00025;), <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> pam1 (54&#x00025;) and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Hmt1p&#x0002f;Rmt1p (45&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c41">41</xref>).

For <italic>in vitro</italic> methylation, the recombinant xCIRP2 was incubated with xPRMT1 in the presence of <sup>3</sup>H-labeled AdoMet at 37&#x000b0;C for 60 min. Under these conditions, the xCIRP2 protein was methylated by xPRMT1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f2">2</xref>B).</p><p>Earlier studies on partially purified hnRNP particles showed that hnRNP complexes contained an amino acid, <italic>N</italic><sup><italic>G</italic></sup><italic>,N</italic><sup><italic>G</italic></sup>-dimethylarginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c30">30</xref>). In many cases, methylation appears to occur at an arginine residue in an RGG motif. In hnRNP A1, for instance, four arginine residues are dimethylated <italic>in vivo</italic>, three of which are localized in the context of RGG sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c42">42</xref>). We therefore reasoned that xPRMT1 might methylate the C-terminal glycine- and arginine-rich region of xCIRP2 that contains four RGG repeats. To test this, we generated an xCIRP2 deletion mutant (xCIRP2&#x00394;RG4) that lacks an arginine- and glycine-rich region (Arg88&#x02013;Gly130) termed the RG4 domain, which contains four RGG motifs and, as the complement, the RG4 domain fused to GST (GST-RG4) was also prepared (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f2">2</xref>D). Methylation analysis of these proteins by xPRMT1 revealed that the full-length xCIRP2 and GST-RG4 were methylated, whereas xCIRP2&#x00394;RG4 and GST showed no detectable methylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f2">2</xref>C). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f2">2</xref>B lanes 7 and 8, xPRMT1 was weakly labeled with &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;AdoMet. This may have resulted from a self-methylation by xPRMT1 or residual binding of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;AdoMet in its methyl group-donor-binding site observed even after the analysis by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Nevertheless, these results clearly showed that the RG4 domain of xCIRP2 was a PRMT1 substrate for arginine methylation.</p></sec><sec><title>xCIRP2 localizes in oocyte cytoplasm and nuclei of cultured cells</title><p>In our previous report we observed the cytoplasmic localization of xCIRP2 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c25">25</xref>). In contrast, mouse CIRP that is induced in BALB 3T3 cells by a temperature downshift from 37 to 32&#x000b0;C localizes in the nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c18">18</xref>). We then examined the localization of xCIRP2 in somatic cells. The expression vector of GFP fused to xCIRP2 was transfected into human HeLa S3 cells and localization of the fusion proteins was examined under a fluorescence microscope (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f3">3</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f3">3</xref>A, while GFP itself was distributed in both the cytoplasm and nuclei, with a slightly higher signal in nuclei, GFP-xCIRP2 exclusively localized in the nuclei of HeLa S3 cells and several other cultured cells (data not shown), consistent with the previous results for mouse CIRP in BALB 3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c18">18</xref>). Our observations, along with results of these studies, suggest that xCIRP2 shows cytoplasmic localization in the oocytes despite its potential to localize in the nucleus.</p><p>To determine the domains of xCIRP2 that direct the protein to localize in the nuclei of cultured cells, mammalian expression vectors of GFP fused to xCIRP2 deletion mutants were prepared and transfected into HeLa S3 cells as schematically drawn in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f3">3</xref>B. Our domain analysis revealed that the N3, N4, C1, RG1, RG2 and RG4 mutants also showed exclusive nuclear accumulation. However, RG3, RG5 and RG6 localized to the nucleus at reduced concentration and N1, N2, C2 and C3 mutants did not localize to the nucleus. All the mutants that exclusively accumulated in the nucleus contain 43 amino acid residues consisting of typical glycine-rich sequences, RGG repeats and GGYGG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f4">4</xref>A). Strikingly, this region corresponds to the RG4 domain that could be methylated with xPRMT1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f2">2</xref>). So far several arginine- and glycine (RG)-rich type nuclear localization signals have been identified in hnRNP or hnRNP-like proteins. The M9 of hnRNP A1 and the NAB35 of yeast Nab2p poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mRNA-binding protein were compared with the xCIRP2 RG4 sequence and the corresponding region in human CIRP in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f4">4</xref>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c43">43</xref>). To assess the significance of this sequence, a GFP-xCIRP2 deletion mutant, &#x00394;RG4, was transfected into HeLa cells. The GFP-xCIRP2&#x00394;RG4 did not accumulate in the nucleus while the GFP-<italic>Xenopus</italic> RG4 domain localized to the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f4">4</xref>B). We therefore concluded that the nuclear localization signal of xCIRP2 resided in the carboxyl part of the protein corresponding to the RG4 domain. The domain is conserved in other CIRP homologs and we confirmed that the RG4 domain of human CIRP, which contains three RGG repeats, also accumulated in the nuclei of HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f4">4</xref>A and B). Interestingly, our xCIRP2 deletion mutants, which retain RG4, accumulated in the nucleoli in contrast to nucleolar exclusion of GFP-xCIRP2. GFP-RG4 probably diffused into the nucleolus and were retained by non-specific binding of the RGG domain to ribosomal RNA or ribosomal proteins, as speculated for the RS domain of U2AF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c45">45</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>xCIRP2 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein dependent on RG4 domain</title><p>We next explored the conditions under which exogenously expressed xCIRP2 accumulates in the cytoplasm of somatic cells. In a previous study, hnRNP A1 was shown to accumulate in the cytoplasm of cells treated with transcriptional inhibitors such as actinomycin D or DRB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c46">46</xref>). Actinomycin D and DRB are RNA polymerase II inhibitors but their mechanisms of inhibition differ from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c47">47</xref>). The modular structure of xCIRP2 is similar to that of hnRNP A1, which consists of two RRMs and a flanking glycine-rich region containing RGG repeats. Accordingly, HeLa cells transfected with the GFP-xCIRP2 expression vector were treated with transcriptional inhibitors. After treatment with 10 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml actinomycin D or 0.1 mM DRB for 4 h, significant part of GFP-xCIRP2 accumulated in the cytoplasm as compared with the control without the transcriptional inhibitors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f5">5</xref>A). Removal of the reversible transcriptional inhibitor, DRB, resulted in the nuclear accumulation of xCIRP2. The presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, during the course of the experiments did not further affect the localization of the xCIRP2 protein (data not shown, also see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f5">5</xref>B). This suggests that xCIRP2 found in the cytoplasm after treatment with the transcriptional inhibitors was pre-existing xCIRP2 that was exported from the nucleus. Taken together, these results indicate that xCIRP2 is able to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, dependent on ongoing transcription in the nucleus as is hnRNP A1.</p><p>We next made use of interspecies heterokaryon analysis to determine whether xCIRP2 continuously shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f5">5</xref>B). In this experiment, the movement of xCIRP2 from human nuclei to mouse nuclei could be monitored based on the accumulation of GFP fusion proteins in the mouse nuclei of heterokaryons. The advantage of using mouse&#x02013;human heterokaryons lies in the ease with which one can distinguish the two nuclei: the AT-rich mouse centromeres have high affinity for the Hoechst 33342 dye and give rise to bright spots in the murine nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c48">48</xref>). Cell fusion was performed in the presence of cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f5">5</xref>B shows that xCIRP2 expressed in human nuclei was transported and accumulated to the mouse nuclei. Furthermore, in the similar set of experiments, GFP-RG4 was also accumulated in the mouse nuclei. Based on these results we concluded that xCIRP2 is a novel nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and that the RG4 domain has both NLS and NES activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Methylation causes cytoplasmic translocation of xCIRP2</title><p>Having established that the RG4 domain was a target of xPRMT1 for arginine methylation and was responsible for nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of xCIRP2, we wished to examine the effects of methylation on the intracellular localization of xCIRP2. Accordingly, expression vectors of the GFP-fused xCIRP2 and myc-tagged xPRMT1 were transfected into HeLa S3 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f6">6</xref>). Cytoplasmic levels of xCIRP2 increased upon xPRMT1 expression, while cytoplasmic accumulation was not detected in cells not expressing xPRMT1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f6">6</xref>A). xPRMT1 was predominantly detected in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells with the anti-myc antibody. Biochemical fractionation confirmed the increase of xCIRP2 in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f6">6</xref>B).</p><p>To examine whether xCIRP2 exists as the component of large particles in HeLa cells, as is the case in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c25">25</xref>), the cytoplasmic fraction was subjected to further fractionation by ultracentrifugation at 100&#x02009;000 <italic>g</italic>. GFP-xCIRP2 was predominantly found in the pellet (P100) fraction without the xPRMT1 overexpression. This observation suggests that GFP-xCIRP2 in HeLa cells behaved like the endogenous xCIRP2 in the oocytes. When xCIRP2 was accumulated in the cytoplasm upon xPRMT1 expression, xCIRP2 distributed both in the supernatant (S100) and the pellet (P100) fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f6">6</xref>C).</p><p>To confirm that the cytoplasmic accumulation of xCIRP2 was a consequence of arginine methylation, we utilized the potent and specific methyl donor inhibitor, AdOx. AdOx increases <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-homocysteine through its effects on <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-homocysteine hydrolase, resulting in competitive inhibition of methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c51">51</xref>). HeLa S3 cells were incubated in a medium containing 20 &#x000b5;M AdOx for 24 h prior to transfection and AdOx was continuously included in the culture medium until cell fixation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f6">6</xref>D). AdOx treatment resulted in the inhibition of the cytoplasmic accumulation of xCIRP2, albeit the distribution pattern of xRPMT1 did not change. It is therefore unlikely that xCIRP2, which continuously shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, would be trapped by xPRMT1 in the cytoplasm. Collectively our results establish that in higher eukaryotes methylation of arginine residues potentially regulates intracellular localization of RNA-binding proteins, which have RGG-type nuclear localization signals, including xCIRP2.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this report, we found that: (i) xCIRP2 continuously shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, (ii) xCIRP2 is methylated by xPRMT1, (iii) the 43-amino acid sequence, RG4, functions as an NSS, moreover, RG4 included the xPRMT1 target(s) for methylation and (iv) methylation by xPRMT1 mediates the cytoplasmic accumulation of xCIRP2. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling RNA-binding proteins are proposed to associate with (pre-)mRNA in the nucleus, to be involved in RNA export and to affect the subsequent cytoplasmic fate of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c13">13</xref>). Based on the high amino acid sequence homology between xCIRP2 and mammalian CIRPs, we speculate that our results can be generalized to mammalian cells in which CIRP may associate with (pre-)mRNA in the nucleus and exit the nucleus accompanying mRNA. Mouse CIRP mediates the cold-induced growth suppression by prolonging the G<sub>1</sub> phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c18">18</xref>). It is therefore possible that CIRP binds to a specific set of mRNAs required for normal growth rate at lower temperatures and suppressively affect the fate of those mRNAs.</p><p>Although xCIRP2 expressed in HeLa cells accumulated in the nucleus at steady state, treatment of cells with transcriptional inhibitors led to the cytoplasmic accumulation of GFP-xCIRP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f5">5</xref>A). The apparent nuclear accumulation of a continuously shuttling protein can be explained such that the nuclear import rate is much higher than the nuclear export rate of the protein. Indeed, the nuclear export of yeast Npl3p accelerates upon transcriptional inhibition and the authors assume that the duration of transmission of Npl3p through the nucleus is prolonged by association with synthesized RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c52">52</xref>). Consistent with this, the RG4 sequence that resides in the C-terminal glycine-rich region was responsible for the mRNA-binding activity of xCIRP2 (data not shown). Alternatively, it was proposed that specific post-translational modifications of nuclear transport cargoes or receptors might occur to transduce signals from the mRNA production machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c53">53</xref>). In any case, it is likely that treatment with transcriptional inhibitors increases the nuclear export rate and&#x0002f;or decreases the import rate of xCIRP2, which consequently allows the detection of cytoplasmic xCIRP2 (also see below).</p><p>As mouse CIRP was detected in the nuclei of BALB 3T3 cells, xCIRP2 was found in HeLa nuclei, while it was detected in the cytoplasm of the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c25">25</xref> and this study). It is unlikely that import factors for xCIRP2 are missing in the oocyte. Given that treatment with transcriptional inhibitors induces cytoplasmic accumulation of xCIRP2 in HeLa cells, it is still elusive why xCIRP2 localizes in the cytoplasm of oocytes where transcription by RNA polymerase II is active. If one assumes that xCIRP2 is involved in the metabolism of specific mRNAs, it is intriguing to speculate that active transcription of a specific subset of mRNAs regulates the apparent nuclear localization of xCIRP2. In the oocytes, transcription of these mRNAs might be inactive.</p><p>In this study, we showed by yeast two-hybrid analysis that xPRMT1 interacted with xCIRP2. xPRMT1 has significant amino acid sequence homology to other eukaryotic PRMT1s (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f1">1</xref>B). Since the molecular cloning of yeast Rmt1p&#x0002f;Hmt1p, arginine methylation has been the focus of intensive study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c55">55</xref>). The enzymatic methylation of arginine residues is one of the post-translational modifications exclusively found in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c30">30</xref>). Thus, it seems likely that methylation of arginine residues is involved in several fundamental functions, which is a characteristic of eukaryotes. An accurate and complex gene expression in eukaryotes relies on fine control of mRNA metabolism and a variety of RNA-binding proteins containing RGG and&#x0002f;or SR repeats play key roles in this regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c13">13</xref>). It is therefore reasonable to expect that predominant substrates of protein arginine methyltransferases are such RNA-binding proteins. In the case of nuclear proteins prepared from rat liver, 65&#x00025; of <italic>N</italic><sup><italic>G</italic></sup><italic>,N</italic><sup><italic>G</italic></sup>-dimethylarginine is found in hnRNP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c28">28</xref>). Recently, Lee and Bedford identified 10 clones of PRMT1 substrates using high-density protein arrays and, surprisingly, all of them are RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c56">56</xref>). Furthermore, 4 out of the 10 clones were proven to be CIRP. These results and our experiments presented here provide compelling evidence supporting the assumption that mammalian CIRP and xCIRP2 are primary substrates of PRMT1.</p><p>Here, we identified the 43-amino acid sequence, termed RG4, as a methylation site of xCIRP2. Interestingly, the RG4 domain corresponds to a NSS sequence of xCIRP2 and resides in the C-terminal part of xCIRP2 where a major RNA-binding activity of xCIRP2 was located in our preliminary experiment (data not shown). In general, the effects of arginine methylation on RNA-binding activity have not been understood satisfactorily. In previous studies, arginine methylation reduces the activity of hnRNP A1 to bind to coliphage MS2-RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c57">57</xref>), whereas the RNA-binding activity of a synthetic peptide, corresponding to residues 676&#x02013;692 of human nucleolin, is not substantially altered upon arginine methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c58">58</xref>). In addition, methylation by Hmt1p does not affect sequence-specific RNA binding of yeast hnRNP protein, Hrp1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c59">59</xref>). Our preliminary experiments have shown that arginine methylation of the RG4 domain had no effect on the RNA-binding activity of xCIRP2 (data not shown). Further work is definitely necessary to evaluate the effect of methylation on RNA-binding activities.</p><p>Our results showing that methylation affects nucleocytoplasmic distribution of RGG-containing RNA-binding proteins have precedents in yeast. At least three hnRNP proteins, Nab2p, Npl3p and Hrp1p, are methylated by Hmt1p&#x0002f;Rmt1p. Although the <italic>HMT1</italic> gene is not essential for viability, the nuclear export of these hnRNP proteins is blocked in the absence of <italic>HMT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c60">60</xref>). These proteins all contain a glycine- and arginine-rich type nuclear localization signal &#x0005b;(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c15">15</xref>), also see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf638f4">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Although considerable studies of arginine methylation are ongoing, it is still poorly understood whether methylation has an impact on intracellular localization of RNA-binding proteins in higher eukaryotes. Our experiments demonstrated that arginine methylation shifted the distribution of xCIRP2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Although endogenous human PRMT1 is active in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c38">38</xref>), the translocation of xCIRP2 required xPRMT1 overexpression. As it was shown that protein&#x02013; protein interactions are regulated by arginine methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c61">61</xref>) it is plausible that the post-translational modification affects the affinities of nuclear import or export receptors to xCIRP2 through the RG4 domain. Our preliminary experiments showed that the GST-RG4 fusion protein was capable of interacting with importin &#x003b2; and transportin, which mediate nuclear import of proteins bearing classical and RG-rich NLSs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c62">62</xref>) (data not shown). It is possible that methylation of the RG4 domain alters these interactions.</p><p>Mouse CIRP, which might be involved in adaptation to cold stress, is expressed in the nuclei of BALB 3T3 cells following a temperature downshift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c18">18</xref>). Human A18 hnRNP, which is equivalent to human CIRP, translocates to the cytoplasm by UV irradiation in RKO cells and plays a protective role against genotoxic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf638c64">64</xref>). These observations together with our results raise the possibility that xCIRP2 has separate functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The methylation of arginine residues by PRMT1 may be involved in the regulation of such a selective use of CIRP. To test this hypothesis, it must be examined whether PRMT1 activities increase under the conditions such as UV irradiation or presence of transcriptional inhibitors. In our preliminary experiment, however, inhibition of arginine methylation with AdOx did not affect cytoplasmic accumulation of xCIRP2 following treatment with a transcriptional inhibitor (data not shown). Our results suggest that there are at least two mechanisms that lead to cytoplasmic accumulation of xCIRP2: inhibition of transcription and methylation of arginine residues in the RG4 domain.</p><p>It is likely that xCIRP2 has multiple functions in various types of cells, being regulated through the methylation of RG4 domain containing RGG repeats. In somatic cells, xCIRP2 might be involved in pre-mRNA processing as has been proposed for hnRNP A1, while in oocytes, xCIRP2 possibly plays a role in translational control through interaction with mRNA and&#x0002f;or ribosomes. In order to clarify the biological significance of xCIRP2, it is necessary to explore the specific conditions that alter the extent of arginine methylation of xCIRP2 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and embryos as well as in somatic cells.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf638f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> xPRMT1 interacts with xCIRP2.
