The gene spans roughly 16.5 kbp, contains three intervening sequences, and codes for a message of approximately 730 nucleotides. The complete coding region of the gene was sequenced as well as 315 nucleotides of 5' flanking sequence and the entire intron C. Only a single base difference was found when the sequence of the gene was compared with that of the cDNA. Genomic blotting experiments suggest the presence of a single alpha subunit gene. Comparison of the bovine and human alpha subunit genes indicated that the high level of homology observed in the coding regions has been maintained throughout the 5' and 3' untranslated regions, and at least 90 nucleotides of the 5'flanking regions. Additionally, there is an 18 base pair sequence present in both the 5' flanking and 5' untranslated regions of the gene that is homologous to a region of the chick ovalbumin gene. This ovalbumin sequence has been suggested as a binding site for the progesterone receptor-complex.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0295-a" xlink:role="6879"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0289.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6873"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0290.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6874"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0291.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6875"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0292.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6876"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0293.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6877"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0294.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6878"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0295.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6879"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0296.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6880"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0297.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6881"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0298.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6882"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
