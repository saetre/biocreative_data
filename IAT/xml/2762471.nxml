The type 1 fimbriae and the P-fimbriae of uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>(UPEC) have both been described to be important for the establishment of urinary tract infections (UTI). To explore the interactions between the host and bacterium responsible for the different environments of UPEC invasion, we examined the effect of pH and osmolarity on UPEC strain J96 fimbrial expression, and subsequent J96-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression in different uroepithelial cells. The J96 strain grown in high pH with low osmolarity condition was favorable for the expression of type 1 fimbriae; whereas J96 grown in low pH with high osmolarity condition was beneficial for P fimbriae expression. Type 1 fimbriated J96 specifically invaded bladder 5637 epithelial cells and induced IL-8 expression. On the contrary, P fimbriated J96 invaded renal 786-O epithelial cells and induced IL-8 expression effectively. Type 1 fimbriated J96-induced IL-8 induction involved the p38, as well as ERK, JNK pathways, which leads to AP-1-mediated gene expression. P fimbriated J96-induced augmentation of IL-8 expression mainly involved p38-mediated AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B transcriptional activation. These results indicate that different expression of fimbriae in J96 trigger differential IL-8 gene regulation pathways in different uroepithelial cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections that affect humans throughout their life span. UTI occurs in every age group, from newborns to the elderly patients; it has the greatest impact on females of all ages (especially during pregnancy), and males as the kidney transplant recipients or with structural abnormalities of the urinary tract. The most common bacterium that causes UTI is uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>(UPEC). These bacteria are sensitive to a variety of environmental cues such as differences in temperature, nutrients, pH, and osmolality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Human urine has extreme fluctuations in osmolarity and pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The osmolalities in human urine can range from 0.038 to 1.4 mol/kg, with the osmolarity of the urine in kidneys is much higher than that in bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition to osmotic variations, the pH of human urine can vary between 5.0 and 8.0, depending on physiological constraints and the diet of the individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Kidney urine typically has a lower pH than bladder urine because of the dilution effect in the bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Adherence and invasion to uroepithelial cells is a critical step in the ability of bacteria to cause UTI. Attachment is regulated through specific interactions between bacterial surface components (adhesins) and host cell receptors. The adhesins of UPEC exist as filamentous surface organelles, termed pili or fimbriae. Fimbrial adhesins are important virulence factors that allow binding of the bacteria to specific receptors on uroepithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The two adhesins most commonly associated with UTI are type 1 and P fimbriae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Type 1 fimbriae are essential for UPEC colonization of the lower urinary tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], whereas P fimbriae are critical for that of the upper urinary tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. To limit immune exposure and inflammation, the expression of type 1 and P fimbriae is phase variable, which the bacteria can switch between different fimbriated states. Type 1 fimbriae are encoded by a <italic>fim </italic>gene cluster, including the adhesin subunit, FimH. The expression of type 1 fimbriae depends on the orientation of the invertible element located between two inverted repeat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This element contains a promoter which increases the expression of the <italic>fim </italic>subunit genes in phase-on orientation. The binding specificity of P fimbriae is determined by the PapG adhesin. Previous work has demonstrated that activated P-fimbrial gene cluster can act on the <italic>fim </italic>locus to prevent expression of type 1 fimbriae by switching the <italic>fim </italic>gene cluster to phase-off orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It was previously observed that <italic>E. coli </italic>expresses mainly one fimbrial type at a time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This may be important to limit immune exposure and to prevent the physical interference of one adhesin with another.</p><p>Uroepithelial cells function as a physical protective barrier against invasion by UPEC. In addition, they also play a role in local innate immune responses by secreting bioactive substances, such as chemokines, when exposed to pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a member of the CXC chemokine family, plays a pivotal role in regulating neutrophil chemotaxis toward sites of infection, and in inducing urinary tract inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Transcriptional regulation of IL-8 is controlled by a tight regulatory signal network, involving the complex interplay of different mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) cascades in several cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>As mentioned above, the environments in kidney and bladder are different, the epithelial cells isolated from kidney and bladder are expected to have differential responses to different adhesins. We hypothesize that signaling pathways lead to IL-8 secretion in kidney and bladder epithelial cells are different. The goal of this study is to elucidate the signaling network that orchestrates expression of IL-8 by UPEC invasion in different cell types. The results demonstrated that UPEC strain J96 grown in different pH and osmolality conditions expresses different fimbriae, and therefore preferentially targets either kidney or bladder uroepithelial cells for IL-8 production. Furthermore, the signaling pathways leads to IL-8 secretion are different in kidney and bladder uroepithelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>All culture materials were purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA).

Type 1 fimbriated J96-induced IL-8 expression was via ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK phosphorylation and AP-1 activation in bladder epithelial cells. Conversely, P fimbriated J96-induced IL-8 expression was through p38 MAPK phosphorylation and both NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 activation in renal epithelial cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p><p>Expression of the individual fimbriae in UPEC is regulated in response to growth conditions, and most are subject to phase variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

The inversion of the <italic>fim </italic>switch is mediated by the recombinases FimB and FimE.

The cross-talk between different fimbrial gene systems is presumably important for pathogens to survive under changing environmental conditions. P fimbriae are produced by pyelonephritic strains of UPEC and mediate binding to glycolipids that predominate in the kidney. Consequently, P fimbriae have been shown to be critical for UPEC to cause pyelonephritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Type 1 fimbriae bind to glycoproteins present on the bladder epithelial surface and are critical for the establishment of cystitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. UPEC strains expressing either P or type 1 fimbriae have been demonstrated to augment bladder and renal epithelial cell cytokine production compared to isogenic afimbriated strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In the present study, our data have demonstrated that the ability of type 1 fimbriated J96 to invade bladder epithelial cells and P fimbriated J96 or 83972 to invade renal epithelial cells are the key events for the induction of IL-8 expression. In addition, it has been shown that bacterial attachment mediated by different adhesive fimbriae results in the activation of distinct signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The binding of P fimbriated UPEC to renal epithelial cells appears to activate IL-6 expression via a Toll-like receptor 4 (LTR4)-dependent, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-independent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, studies with bladder epithelial cells demonstrated that LPS is the primary bacterial factor activating cytokine production, and that type 1 fimbriae augment the presentation of LPS to LPS receptor on the bladder epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Although the importance of fimbriated UPEC in the pathogenesis of UTI has been suggested, the exact mechanism has not been fully understood. Many inflammatory genes are induced by NF-&#x003ba;B, AP-1, and MAPK activation has been shown to be important for the NF-&#x003ba;B/AP-1-mediated inflammatory process. The MAPK family kinases (e.g., p38, JNK, and ERK) are involved in the induction of IL-8 transcription, although the contribution of each kinase varies depending on cell type and stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The present study demonstrated that in bladder epithelial cells, AP-1, but not NF-&#x003ba;B, activation upon type 1 fimbriated J96 invasion was required for IL-8 expression. Such an AP-1 activation required JNK and p38 phosphorylation (whereas ERK is also involved, but play lesser roles) in type 1 fimbriated J96-induced AP-1 activation and IL-8 expression. Conversely, in renal epithelial cells, the results showed that p38 phosphorylation (whereas ERK and JNK are not involved) was also required for P fimbriated J96 activation of both NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 and the consequential IL-8 expression.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that the specific interactions between different fimbriated UPEC (J96) with distinct human uroepithelial cells to induce IL-8 expression via diverse signaling pathways. UPEC-mediated induction of proinflammatory cytokines (such as IL-8) in human uroepithelial cells provides evidence of UPEC inflammatory activities, which may lead to its pathogenic reactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KWT and CNC designed research; KWT, HTL, TCT, YCW, YTY, KYC and CMC performed research; KWT and CNC analyzed data; and YSJL and CNC wrote the paper.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from Buddhist Dalin Tzu Chi General Hospital (project no.
