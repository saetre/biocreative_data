Both the L1 binding site on 23S rRNA and the L1 repressor target site on L11 operon mRNA share similar proposed secondary structures and contain some primary sequence identity. Several site-directed mutations in the binding region of 23S rRNA were constructed and their effects on binding were examined. For in vitro analysis, a filter binding method was used. For in vivo analysis, a conditional expression system was used to overproduce a 23S rRNA fragment containing the L1 binding region, which leads to specific derepression of the synthesis of L11 and L1. Changes in the shared region of the 23S rRNA L1 binding site produced effects on L1 binding similar to those found previously in analysis of corresponding changes in the L11 operon mRNA target site. The results support the hypothesis that r-protein L1 interacts with both 23S rRNA and L11 operon mRNA by recognizing similar features on both RNAs.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0139-a" xlink:role="10540"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0128.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10529"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0129.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10530"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0130.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10531"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0131.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10532"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0132.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10533"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0133.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10534"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0134.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10535"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0135.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10536"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0136.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10537"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10538"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10539"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10540"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10541"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10542"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10543"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10544"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00164-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="10545"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
