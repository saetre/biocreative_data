To test a simple mutational strategy we designed a targeting vector for the mouse proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene containing a single nucleotide insertion that converts the initial tyrosine codon of beta-endorphin 1-31 to a premature translational termination codon and introduces a unique Hpal endonuclease restriction site. The targeting vector also contains a neo cassette immediately 3' to the last POMC exon and a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase cassette to allow positive and negative selection. Homologous recombination occurred at a frequency of 1/30 clones of electroporated embryonic stem cells selected in G418 and gancyclovir. 10/11 clones identified initially by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy had the predicted structure without evidence of concatemer formation by Southern blot analysis. We used a combination of Hpa I digestion of PCR amplified fragments and direct nucleotide sequencing to further confirm that the point mutation was retained in 9/10 clones. The POMC gene was transcriptionally silent in embryonic stem cells and the targeted allele was not activated by the downstream phosphoglycerate kinase-1 promoter that transcribed the neo gene. Under the electroporation conditions used, we have demonstrated that a point mutation can be introduced with high efficiency and precision into the POMC gene using a replacement type vector containing a retained selectable marker without affecting expression of the allele in the embryonic stem cells. A similar strategy may be useful for a wide range of genes.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0083-a" xlink:role="2616"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0083-b" xlink:role="2616"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0083-c" xlink:role="2616"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2613"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2614"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2615"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2616"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00060-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2617"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
