However, despite several decades of study of bacterial adhesion to inert surfaces, the biophysical mechanisms governing this process remain poorly understood, due, in particular, to the lack of methodologies covering the appropriate time scale. Using micrometric colloidal surface particles and flow cytometry analysis, we developed a rapid multiparametric approach to studying early events in adhesion of the bacterium <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content>. This approach simultaneously describes the kinetics and amplitude of early steps in adhesion, changes in physicochemical surface properties within the first few seconds of adhesion, and the self-association state of attached and free-floating cells. Examination of the role of three well-characterized <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> surface adhesion factors upon attachment to colloidal surfaces&#x02014;curli fimbriae, F-conjugative pilus, and Ag43 adhesin&#x02014;showed clear-cut differences in the very initial phases of surface colonization for cell-bearing surface structures, all known to promote biofilm development. Our multiparametric analysis revealed a correlation in the adhesion phase with cell-to-cell aggregation properties and demonstrated that this phenomenon amplified surface colonization once initial cell-surface attachment was achieved. Monitoring of real-time physico-chemical particle surface properties showed that surface-active molecules of bacterial origin quickly modified surface properties, providing new insight into the intricate relations connecting abiotic surface physicochemical properties and bacterial adhesion. Hence, the biophysical analytical method described here provides a new and relevant approach to quantitatively and kinetically investigating bacterial adhesion and biofilm development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>When bacteria grow on solid surfaces, they can form three-dimensional communities called biofilms. Within these complex structures, bacteria can develop specific tolerance to different microbiocides, causing serious health and economic problems. Investigations of the key molecular events involved in biofilm formation have shown that surface-exposed adhesin proteins promote this process, but many questions remain regarding the mechanisms and biophysics of surface adhesion. We introduced an original approach to investigating the very early steps in bacterial adhesion that uses dispersed colloidal surfaces as microbial adhesion substrates. Using flow cytometry, we performed a quantitative real-time analysis of adhesion kinetics of several strains of the bacterium <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content>, which were genetically engineered to produce well-characterized cell-surface adhesins that are known to promote biofilm development. We provide evidence for previously unknown adhesin-dependent behaviors, such as clear-cut differences in the very initial phases of surface colonization. We also demonstrate that initial adhesion correlates with almost instant surface property changes, and that cell-to-cell association might serve as an amplification mechanism for surface colonization. We therefore provide a new understanding of the intricate relationships between the physico-chemistry of abiotic surfaces and bacterial adhesion.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Combining micrometric colloidal beads as adhesion substrates with flow cytometric analysis allows for a high-resolution analysis that reveals adhesin-dependent behavior in the very first steps of surface colonization by bacteria.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Beloin C, Houry A, Froment M, Ghigo JM, Henry N (2008) A short&#x02013;time scale colloidal system reveals early bacterial adhesion dynamics.

Biofilm-specific tolerance to different biocidal treatments used in health care facilities stimulated the investigation of key molecular events in biofilm formation, and molecular factors promoting bacterial adhesion have been characterized, including surface-exposed adhesins and polysaccharidic polymers.

This is likely due to the multiplicity of parameters involved in the adhesion process, influenced both by biological and environmental factors. On the other hand, most biological approaches to surface colonization rely on procedures that develop on an hourly or daily scale. Hence, interpretations are often made at the final adsorption stage or at equilibrium, when initial adhesion is blurred by subsequent biofilm development steps, thus preventing precise kinetic analysis of the adhesion process &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060167-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternative short-term approaches are therefore needed to provide quantitative and kinetic information on the early stage of bacterial interaction with a surface.</p><p>We introduced a new methodology which takes advantage of advanced flow cytometry (FCM) analyses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060167-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d; to characterize initial bacterial cell surface attachment.

Thus far, stream techniques involved in FCM have appeared incompatible with the study of bacterial adhesion usually studied on macroscopic plane surfaces. We have overcome this apparent antagonism by choosing dispersed surfaces in the form of well-characterized micrometric particles as adhesion substrates in order to explore initial events of surface colonization by the bacterium <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content>. We used charged particles as adhesion substrates, representing the most widespread situation for surfaces immerged in aqueous media due either to their inherent ionization state or to the water ion structure at the interfaces. Then, we examined the contribution of three well-characterized <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> adhesion factors with a time resolution of a few seconds and the precision of one bacterium per particle. This revealed several phases leading to surface colonization, and evidenced clear-cut differences strongly dependent on the nature of the adhesin expressed at the cell surface. We also explored the contribution of cell-to-cell aggregation properties and particle surface physicochemical property changes throughout the colonization process. This analytical procedure therefore opens up new perspectives in the understanding of bacterial adhesion to abiotic surfaces.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Description and Characterization of the Micrometric Colloidal System</title><p>To develop a short&#x02013;time scale method for studying early bacterial adhesion, we used spherical micrometric colloidal particles as adhesion substrates, both positively charged (aminated, NH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and negatively charged (carboxylated, COO<sup>&#x02013;</sup>) with zeta potentials of &#x0002b;45 mV and &#x02212;55 mV, respectively.

Labeling properties were conserved in M63B1 medium, the rather high ionic strength (&#x02248;200 mM versus 150 mM,e.g., for PBS) medium used in this study both for growth of the bacteria and the adhesion assay (see below), indicative of strong and irreversible association, which demonstrated that the chosen pairs of dyes were flexible surface-charge reporters in the heterogeneous context of a bacterial suspension.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>FCM Monitoring of Isolated and Aggregated Bacteria in Suspension</title><p>To determine optimal recording conditions for bacterial adhesion in the colloidal system, we analyzed samples composed of planktonic cultures of fluorescent and non-fluorescent <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> K-12 strains MG1655 and MG1655<italic>gfp</italic>, respectively, mixed at various proportions.

The ratio of the number of cells counted in high and low fluorescence subsets accurately matched values expected from the mixtures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060167-sg002">Figure S2</xref>), indicating that the recorded signals originated from single cells. Indeed, if more than one cell was detected in a single event, then higher number of subsets depending on the number of detected cells would have appeared with intermediate fluorescence intensities.

While this stirring abolished gravity effects, it also screened cell motility. Therefore, although bacterial motility has been shown to play a role in surface colonization under static conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060167-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, its effect is here masked by velocity gradients due to stirring-induced hydrodynamic shear. The question of the role of bacterial self-propulsion through flagellar motility is thus not addressed here. The FCM signal was recorded on aliquots taken at different times from the cell-particle sample using a sample flow speed of 1 &#x003bc;l/s and an acquisition time equal to 5 s. Direct microscopic observation showed that bacteria adhered to colloidal particles, leading to the emergence of a new cluster of higher fluorescence on particle FL1/FSC cytograms, corresponding to particles carrying at least one bacterial cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060167-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and B).

This indicated that, in the presence of curli, cell and particle surfaces did not experience the repulsive potential observed between curli-defective cells and particle surfaces. Nevertheless, in this phase I, MG1655<italic>gfpompR234</italic> cells exhibited a colonization plateau in between three and four attached cells per particle, which represented a rather sparse surface occupation. This could be due to particle surface heterogeneity&#x02014;of molecular nature or concentration&#x02014;resulting in a low density of adhesive sites for bacteria in this first adhesive phase.

As shown above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060167-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), aminated particles suspended in PBS or M63B1 fresh medium did not adsorb the dye. Their FL3 intensity remained at the level of the background, corresponding to particles in the absence of dye. In contrast, when PI was added to the analysis test tubes taken from the incubation sample in the presence of exponentially grown bacteria, we measured a rapid increase in the PI labeling signal both with curli producer and nonproducer bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060167-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). This indicated that the particle surface&#x02014;initially positively charged&#x02014;had turned into a negative surface potential, which enabled PI adsorption. This PI labeling affected both cell-free and colonized particles in the suspension (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060167-sg005">Figure S5</xref>A), suggesting that soluble species present in the bacterial supernatant were responsible for this effect. Consistently, aminated particles resuspended in filter-sterilized culture supernatants were labeled with PI, confirming production by bacterial cultures of anionic molecules. Furthermore, labeling intensity increased when supernatant stemmed from a longer overnight culture (unpublished data). No significant bacterial cell death was observed within the culture before or after incubation, as indicated by the absence of noticeable number of red-labeled bacteria on fluorescence microscopy images.</p><p>Indeed, in case of cell death, the dye contained in our samples would cross cell membrane and accumulate inside the cell through DNA association. Thus, only a small, naturally occurring bacterial lysis, which releases bacterial products in the medium, is expected to take place in our experiments, suggesting that this phenomenon could contribute only marginally to the surface properties changes observed. When COO<sup>&#x02013;</sup> particles were tested, we observed that PI labeling, initially high with such anionic surface functionalization, slightly decreased, suggesting that these surfaces were also modified by cell supernatant, which finally set the exposed surfaces to similar potentials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060167-sg005">Figure S5</xref>B). Zeta potential measurements were performed on particles first incubated in bacterial culture media coming from cultures of the F plasmid-bearing strain and then suspended at 10&#x00025; v/v in water for measurements. Value shifted for cationic particles from &#x0002b;36 mV in unspent medium (&#x0002b;45 in pure water) to &#x02212;32 mV after 15 min incubation in 12-h culture spent medium. Anionic particles displayed slightly reduced negative charge, shifting from &#x02212;65mV in unspent medium to &#x02212;42 mV after medium conditioning, completely corroborating the behavior reported by dyes labeling. Very similar results were obtained with supernatant from MG1655 strain (unpublished data). This surface charge conversion to a negative potential was thus likely to explain the repulsive potential observed against bacteria.</p><p>To further investigate this, MG1655<italic>gfpompR234</italic> or MG1655<italic>gfp</italic>&#x00394;<italic>csgA</italic> bacteria were placed in contact with both positively (NH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and negatively (COO<sup>&#x02013;</sup>) charged particles, simultaneously and in the same sample. PI labeling enabled us to differentiate both types of particles within the sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060167-sg005">Figure S5</xref>C). For both strains, COO<sup>&#x02013;</sup> particle colonization was only slightly reduced compared to colonization on NH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> particles, as if cells sensed very similar surfaces (unpublished data).</p><p>These results indicate that negative surface charge conversion induced by bacterial supernatants determines the surface potential of the interaction with cells independently of the initial surface state. In the absence of curli, this negative and thus repulsive potential dominates the interaction. Expression of curli at the cell surface obviously enabled overcoming this repulsion either by superimposing a much stronger binding force or by allowing the interaction to occur at a longer surface separation distance where the electrostatic potential had dropped. Indeed, in this high ionic strength medium, the Debye length is short and the electrostatic interactions quickly vanish with distance.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>A Second Colonization Phase Observed with Curli-Expressing Bacteria Was Correlated with an Increase in Free-Floating and Surface-Associated Bacterial Aggregates</title><p>After the initial binding phase, the MG1655<italic>gfpompR234</italic> colonization kinetics profile systematically displayed a sudden increase about 10&#x02013;12 min after cell&#x02013;particle contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060167-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060167-g004">4</xref>E).

This strategy enabled the design of a real-time, multiparametric analysis to simultaneously monitor surface attachment, free-floating bacteria, and the surface physico-chemical state in the same sample, with the precision of a single cell and a time resolution of a few tens of seconds, without any separation step. Previous original attempts to assess initial binding kinetics used quartz microbalance equipment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060167-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Although quartz resonance microbalance provides online monitoring of the physical state of the adsorbed cell layer reported by frequency shifts, it cannot be directly related to the numbers of attached cells. In contrast, FCM using colloids as adhesion substrates enabled us to directly monitor adhesion kinetics, providing initial binding rates that are unequivocal parameters of cell-surface association. These parameters are unaffected by bacterial features that are not part of initial adhesion, such as the division rate or resistance to shear or gene-dependent transition leading to biofilm. Moreover, the multi-parametric nature of FCM offered the opportunity of correlating initial adhesion with surface property changes and free-floating cell aggregation shifts, two phenomena involved in surface colonization. FCM kinetics are obtained on large cell populations with high statistical weight even for small subsets (&#x0003e;1&#x00025;). However, unlike microscope imaging, this technique does not allow monitoring the fate of a single bacterial cell over time &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060167-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060167-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We showed that expression of several well-defined adhesion factors induced significant differences in early adhesion profiles recorded after cell surface exposure. We first demonstrated the direct implication of curli and F-conjugative pilus in cell surface attachment within the first minutes of contact. In contrast, the strain constitutively expressing short surface adhesin Ag43 displayed no significant rapid initial surface binding.

Binding could occur either from the formation of a molecular complex between bacterial appendages and binding sites exposed at the particle surface after adsorption of surface active molecules produced by the cell suspension, or from hydrophobic interactions enabling cell strong adhesion on sparse and limited zones distributed over the particle surface. On the other hand, we show here, for all strains studied irrespective of the nature of exposed surface appendages, that surfaces undergo significant charge changes immediately when placed in contact with bacterial suspensions.

This second colonization phase could be due to the accumulation of curli subunits at the surface of the bacteria and developed cooperatively. Suppression of this second phase by chloramphenicol treatment known to stop translation suggests that de novo synthesis of curli during the adhesion process is responsible for curli accumulation (unpublished data).

We show here that these irreversible interactions could take place during the first seconds of the contact independently of a prior reversible step.

It enables determination of initial cell-surface binding kinetics and analysis of initial adhesive behaviors conferred by different bacterial cell surface structures. Beyond initial adhesion, we show that cell&#x02013;cell aggregation properties held by several surface appendages amplify surface colonization once initial adhesion is established. This suggests a biofilm development scenario in which various adhesion factors contribute to different but complementary tasks to colonize the abiotic surface. During this process, micrometric structures such as curli and F-pilus support the formation of initial contact with the surface, the properties of which are strongly influenced by surface-active biomacromolecules. Further elucidation of molecular interactions behind initial steps in bacterial adhesion might help to elaborate original approaches to limiting biofilm development.</p><p>Finally, we believe that quantitative and kinetic dissection of early adhesion events could also represent a powerful way to investigate other aspects of biofilm development, including evaluation of potential antiadhesive compounds, gene expression upon surface contact or strain competition and cooperation during surface colonization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions.</title><p>Constitutive curli producers (MG1655<italic>gfpompR234</italic>) were obtained by transducing, into <italic>gfp</italic>-tagged MG1655 (MG1655<italic>gfp</italic>), the <italic>ompR234</italic> mutation that specifies a gain of function allele of <italic>ompR</italic>, a gene encoding an activator of the curli operon &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060167-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.

Particles were used either with their initial carboxyl functionalization after extensive washing and re-suspension in M63B1 minimal medium, or after surface treatment with polyethylenimine permethobromide a cationic, 6,300 molecular weight, branched polymer according to the principle initially introduced by Decher &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060167-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Briefly, particles were washed in pure water by filtration over 0.60 &#x003bc;m of diameter filter, adjusted to a concentration close to 10<sup>6</sup>/ml and gently stirred for 5 min in the presence of 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> M polyethylenimine (monomer concentration), which corresponds to an excess of positive charges compared to the negative charges of the colloidal particles. The permethylated amine polymer adsorbed rapidly onto the negatively charged particle, producing a net charge inversion and providing a cationic amino-functionalization (NH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> particles). Particles were then washed four times before being concentrated five times in the experiment buffer, usually PBS or M63B1. The quality and stability of the deposit were checked by measuring the zeta potential in water using a Malvern zetasizer nano ZS Malverninstrument: &#x02212;55 mV and &#x0002b;45 mV for COO<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and NH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> particles, respectively. The deposit remained stable for several weeks, therefore confirming the robust adsorption already mentioned by other authors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060167-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.

GFP and green dye PYR emissions were recorded in fluorescence channel FL1 (band pass centered on 530 nm). The PI signal was collected in channel FL3 (&#x0003e;650 nm). Two different acquisitions were performed on each sample to collect either the bacterial signal or the colloid signal (lower FSC and SSC (side scattering) amplifications were used for colloids, but the same fluorescence gain settings were used for both objects). At least 1,500 events were recorded in colloid acquisition and 15,000 in that of bacteria. Data were analyzed using CellQuest (BDIS) and FlowJo (Tree Star) multivariate analysis software.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Adhesion assay.</title><p>Cells and particles were brought into contact in a round-bottom tube.
