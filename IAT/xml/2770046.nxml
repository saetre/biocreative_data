These phenotypes are similar to the ocular abnormalities observed in human patients suffering from Basal Cell Naevus Syndrome (BCNS), a disorder that has been linked to mutations in the human <italic>PTCH </italic>gene (the orthologue of the zebrafish <italic>ptc2</italic>), and point to the utility of the <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutant line as a model for the study of BCNS-related ocular pathologies. Our findings regarding CMZ progenitor proliferation suggest that, in the zebrafish retina, Hh pathway activity may not affect cell cycle kinetics; rather, it likely regulates the size of the retinal progenitor pool in the CMZ.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>During retinal development, proliferation and differentiation must be tightly coordinated in order to produce a tissue of the proper size and containing the correct cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The Hh pathway has been shown to play a critical role in controlling these two seemingly opposite processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Early in retinal development, the optic vesicle is composed of a population of proliferating neuroepithelial cells that will ultimately give rise to the mature retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Differentiation of the retinal neuroepithelium occurs in a succession of temporally overlapping waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the zebrafish, the first cells to exit the cell cycle become retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which differentiate in a Sonic Hh (Shh)-dependent wave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A second Hh-dependent wave of differentiation in the inner nuclear layer (INL) occurs almost simultaneously with the first wave, and is responsible for the differentiation of the multiple cell types of the INL (horizontal, amacrine, and bipolar cells, and M&#x000fc;ller glia) and the rod and cone photoreceptors of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, extra-retinal Hh signaling originating in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has been suggested to direct photoreceptor differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. While the role of the Hh pathway in cell cycle exit and differentiation of retinal progenitors is well described, comparatively less is known about its possible influence on cell fate decisions. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, over-expression of p27Xic1, which promotes cell cycle exit, results in increased numbers of early-born cell types (RGCs), while the over-expression of cyclin E1, which inhibits cell cycle exit, biases cell fate towards late-born cell types (e.g. M&#x000fc;ller glia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Similarly, Shh has been shown to promote early cell cycle exit in the <italic>Xenopus </italic>retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]; however, a direct role of the Hh pathway in dictating retinal cell fate has yet to be established <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>While the cells of the central retina of the zebrafish exit the cell cycle by 60 hours post fertilization (hpf) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], a population of retinal progenitors at the CMZ is maintained and continues to proliferate throughout the animal's lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The spatial pattern of cells within the CMZ, with retinal stem cells at the most peripheral region followed by proliferative retinal progenitors and finally differentiating progenitors more centrally, is thought to recapitulate the temporal sequence of early retinal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Some of the factors that control early retinal development, such as <italic>notch, rx1, pax6a, and vsx2/chx10</italic>, are expressed in the zebrafish CMZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, expression of <italic>gli2</italic>, <italic>gli3</italic>, and <italic>smoothened</italic>, is found at the retinal margin, suggesting a role for the Hh pathway in the stem cell/progenitor population in the CMZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Shh over-expression studies in chick support a role for the Hh pathway as a mitogen in the CMZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], consistent with its described mitogenic effects on retinal progenitors in early zebrafish and mouse retinal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Invaluable knowledge regarding Hh function in the developing retina has been gained from the analysis of Hh pathway mutants in zebrafish. For example, the zebrafish mutants <italic>syu </italic>(<italic>shh</italic>) and <italic>smu </italic>(<italic>smoothened</italic>) have helped elucidate the complex mechanisms of Hh-dependent neural differentiation and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, retinal differentiation is severely defective or altogether absent in these mutants due to defective Hh signaling, making it difficult to arrive at definitive conclusions about the possible role of the Hh pathway in cell fate decisions. To address this issue, we analyzed retinal development in the zebrafish <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutant, in which the Hh pathway is 'over-active'. <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants possess a non-sense mutation in the exon encoding the sixth trans-membrane domain of Patched2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], which is predicted to abolish its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Loss of Patched function results in an 'over-active' Hh pathway due de-repression of Smoothened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Normally, in the absence of Hh ligand, the Patched protein inhibits the activity of Smoothened. Binding of the Hh ligand to its Patched receptor relieves this inhibition, ultimately resulting in increased transcription of Hh target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A non-functional Patched would therefore result in loss of inhibition on, and constitutive activity of, Smoothened in <italic>ptc2 </italic>deficient cells. <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants possess increased proliferation in multiple tissues including the retinal CMZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Utilizing this mutant as a tool, we sought to gain further insight into Hh function with respect to retinal cell fate decisions and to determine how Hh activity influences progenitor proliferation at the CMZ. Our results revealed no significant change in neuronal composition within the retina, but we did note a reduction in differentiated M&#x000fc;ller glia that was accompanied by localized M&#x000fc;ller glial reactivity and abnormalities at the vitreo-retinal interface. In addition, the results of cell cycle analyses suggest that the over-proliferation at the CMZ likely results from an expansion of the progenitor cell population, and not from direct effects of the mutation on cell cycle kinetics within progenitor cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>lep/ptc2 mutants possess enlarged retinas and overgrown irises, while lens and RPE morphology are largely normal</title><p><italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants were isolated based on expanded PCNA staining in multiple tissues including the retinal CMZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. While mutant embryos appear to be of normal size at 5 days post fertilization (dpf) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), their retinas are enlarged (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, E</xref>) and they possess reduced pupil size ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, C</xref>). To characterize ocular tissues in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants, we performed histological analyses at 33 hpf, around the time of the onset of retinal differentiation, and at 5dpf, when the laminar organization of the embryonic retina is complete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>retinas appear largely normal at 33dpf and do not possess increases in retinal cell number relative to phenotypically wild-type siblings (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, B, E</xref>). At 5dpf, however, <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>retinal cells are more tightly packed and mutant retinas contain a larger number of cells as compared to their phenotypically wild-type siblings (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D, E</xref>). Normal retinal lamination of differentiated neurons has been shown to be dependent on Shh signaling <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Lamination is largely normal in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants and all major cell types are present (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D</xref>). Loss-of-function experiments in both frog and mouse have suggested a role for the Hh pathway in the development of the RPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants the RPE is of normal thickness and morphology. The Hh pathway has also been implicated in lens development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and the reduced pupil size present in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants was previously attributed to potential degeneration of the lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. No gross morphological defects are evident in the lenses of <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants at either 33hpf or 5dpf, however. Additionally, histological analyses revealed an abnormality in the anterior segment of <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>eyes where the iris was over-grown and extended further over the lens than in sibling retinas (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). The enlarged iris and the overgrowth of the CMZ are the likely causes of the decreased pupil size, rather than defects in lens morphology.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants possess enlarged retinas and reduced pupil size</bold>.

Shh gain-of-function experiments in <italic>Xenopus </italic>link a faster cell cycle with early cell cycle exit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], which in turn results in an over-production of early-born retinal cell types at the expense of late-born cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. We therefore reasoned that in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>retinas, where the Hh pathway is over-active, early-born cell types would be over-represented while late-born cell types would be reduced in number. Cell counts from histological sections of <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants revealed a statistically significant increase in cell number in all three retinal nuclear layers (GCL, INL, and ONL), as well as in total retinal cells, when compared to those from phenotypically wild-type siblings (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). However, no significant change in the proportion of each layer was observed when the number of cells per layer was calculated as a percentage of total retinal cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). This suggests that all three retinal cell layers are proportionally increased in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>retinas.</p><p>It is possible that in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants, an overactive Hh pathway could alter neuronal composition within each layer. To test this hypothesis, immunohistochemistry using markers for each specific cell type in the INL and ONL was performed on retinal sections at 5dpf, when all cell types are normally differentiated and the embryonic retina is fully developed. Since the GCL layer is almost exclusively composed of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), no further analysis was performed on this layer. In order to analyze cell types within the INL, immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies that mark amacrine cells (5E11), bipolar cells (PKC) and M&#x000fc;ller glia (Glutamine Synthetase, GS), while horizontal cells were detected according to their stereotypical morphology in histological sections. This analysis revealed that while the proportion of each neuronal cell type in the INL was not significantly changed in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants, there was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of differentiated M&#x000fc;ller glia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). For the ONL, immunohistochemistry was performed to detect rods (Zpr3) and each three cone opsins (blue, red/green, and UV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Due to the diffuse nature of the staining of some of the markers used, precise cell counts were not performed on these cell types. However, immunohistochemisty did show that these cell types are present in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>and qualitatively appear unaffected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In all, <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants possess more cells in their retinas and each cell type, except for M&#x000fc;ller glia, was present at identical ratios to those observed in phenotypically wild-type siblings.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>All neuronal cell types in the <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>INL are increased proportionately, while M&#x000fc;ller glia are reduced</bold>.

Interestingly, our immunohistochemical analysis of differentiated M&#x000fc;ller glia revealed disruptions in the integrity of the ILM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B</xref>). Since humans who possess mutations in the <italic>PTCH </italic>gene (orthologue of the zebrafish <italic>ptc2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]) have been previously shown to possess abnormalities in the vitreo-retinal interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], we sought to further investigate this phenotype. High magnification examination of GS-stained retinas revealed disruptions in the integrity of the ILM in 40% of the <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>retinas examined. While M&#x000fc;ller glial endfeet form a tight and continuous boundary at the vitreo-retinal boundary in sibling retinas, the ILM in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>retinas was often discontinuous and disorganized, and endfeet did not appear to properly terminate in the ILM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B</xref>). In <italic>Ptc1</italic><sup>+/- </sup>mice, ocular abnormalities are accompanied by the upregulation of GFAP, a marker of reactive M&#x000fc;ller glia, and ectopic proliferation of M&#x000fc;ller glia in the central retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold><italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants display M&#x000fc;ller glial reactivity and morphological abnormalities in the ILM</bold>.

Higher levels of GFAP were often localized to M&#x000fc;ller glial endfeet in the central retina, adjacent to the optic nerve. However, BrdU incorporation assays in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants at 5dpf did not reveal ectopic proliferation in the central retina (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), suggesting that the upregulation of GFAP is not coupled with M&#x000fc;ller glial proliferation in this context.

At 56hpf, prior to the time that the overgrowth phenotype becomes detectable, <italic>ptc2 </italic>expression was visible at the retinal margin, corresponding to the undifferentiated population of retinal progenitors of the CMZ (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Expression continued to be restricted to the CMZ at 72hpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), consistent with previously reported expression of Hh target genes in the <italic>Xenopus </italic>CMZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Closer inspection of <italic>ptc2 </italic>expression in the CMZ at 72hpf revealed that low-level <italic>ptc2 </italic>expression was detected throughout most of the CMZ, consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Staining was more robust in two distinct CMZ cell populations; the first was immediately apposed to the RPE and the second was a patch of cells at the edge of the CMZ, bordering the differentiated GCL (arrows in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>).

Studies in post-hatch chicks suggest that Shh regulates the proliferation of CMZ progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, Shh over-expression studies in <italic>Xenopus </italic>have revealed a role for the Hh pathway in regulating the length of the cell cycle in the progenitor populations of the CMZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Given the differing roles for Hh pathway activity in these contexts, we wanted to determine whether the over-proliferation in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>retinas was due to an increase in the number of proliferating cells and/or an increase in the proliferation rate of the progenitor cell population in the CMZ. To address these possibilities, we first performed a 'pulse-chase' BrdU analysis on <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>and sibling embryos starting at 64hpf, when a mild retinal phenotype is first detectable. Embryos were sorted according to phenotype and exposed to a short pulse (15 min) of BrdU. Half of the embryos were immediately fixed for sectioning, while the other half were transferred to non-BrdU containing fish water and fixed 8 hours later (72hpf). This enabled us to determine the rate of progenitor proliferation in both <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>and sibling retinas during the 8 hour chase period. The results of these assays revealed that, on average, <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>retinal sections contained 67% more BrdU-positive cells in the CMZs when compared to phenotypically wild-type sibling retinas at 64hpf (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A, B, E</xref>). At 72hpf, after the 8 hour 'chase', the average number of BrdU-positive cells in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>and phenotypically wild-type sibling retinal sections increased by almost identical ratios (2.29-fold changes in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>vs. 2.31 fold change in sibling sections, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C, D, E</xref>). From these data, we can therefore infer that, on average, each proliferating cell gave rise to 2.3 daughter cells during the 8 hour 'chase' period. To further analyze proliferation, we assayed the expression of phosphohistone H3 (PH3) and these analyses revealed that the proportion of CMZ progenitors occupying the M phase of the cell cycle increased by approximately 34% in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>retinas at 64hpf, when compared to their phenotypically wild-type siblings (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E, F, H</xref>). The degree of this increase was almost identical to that observed in progenitor cells occupying the S phase using BrdU as a marker (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A, B, H</xref>), suggesting that the length of the S and M phases was not changed relative to the other. These results support a model in which the expanded CMZ of <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants arises from an expansion of the progenitor cell population therein, and not from changes in the length of the cell cycle in these progenitor cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>The number of proliferating CMZ progenitors is increased in <italic>lep/ptc2</italic>, while proliferation rate is unaffected</bold>.

Cell count analysis of all major retinal neuronal cell types revealed no change in the proportion of each cell type. This finding was surprising in light of the well established role of the Hh pathway in patterning and cell fate decisions throughout the CNS in a number of model systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], as well as studies in <italic>Xenopus </italic>which show that the over-expression of Shh results in early cell cycle exit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and that can, in turn, influence cell fate decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. While mouse <italic>Ptc1</italic><sup>+/- </sup>(the orthologue of the zebrafish <italic>ptc2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]) mutants were found to possess no defects in retinal cell fate specification, <italic>Ptc1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mice could not be examined since they die <italic>in utero </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Our results indicate that Ptc2-dependent Hh signaling does not likely play an integral role in neuronal cell fate decisions in the zebrafish retina. These findings raise the possibility that the second zebrafish Patched protein (Patched1) might compensate for the lack of a functional Patched2. While <italic>patched1 (blowout) </italic>mutant retinas contain all major retinal cell types, the lack of a retinal phenotype might be due to the hypomorphic nature of the mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, this seems unlikely since <italic>patched1 </italic>transcripts are not expressed at detectable levels in retinal tissue throughout development (<italic>data not shown </italic>and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]). The reduced number of differentiated M&#x000fc;ller glia, a late born cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], could feasibly be due to a bias towards early born cell types in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants; however, this potential bias does not affect neuronal composition of the retina at 5dpf. It is possible that a transient bias towards early neuronal cell types could occur early in retinal development, but any differences could masked by neurons added from the CMZ later in development. Conversely, any bias could also be present in neuronal populations that arise at the CMZ, resulting in an unnoticeable change in neuronal composition of the 5dpf <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>retina. With this in mind, it will be interesting to examine the proportion of retinal cell types in juvenile <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants, as some homozygous fish reach two months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Finally, the Hh pathway could play a role in neuronal cell fate decisions in the retina through Hh ligand interactions with other Hh receptors. The Ihog Hh receptors have recently been suggested to compete with Patched for Hh binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and act at levels at, or upstream of, Patched [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Indeed, the vertebrate Ihog homologue Cdo is expressed in the developing mouse retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In the future, it would be interesting to test whether certain aspects of retinal development, such as cell fate decisions, might be Ihog-dependent.</p></sec><sec><title>lep/ptc2 mutants as a possible model for the study of BCNS-related ocular pathologies</title><p>In BCNS patients, abnormalities at the interface between the retina and the vitreous, known as epiretinal membranes (ERMs), are associated with disruptions of the ILM and are thought to result from the overproliferation and ectopic presence of multiple cell types, including glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. BCNS ocular pathologies have been linked to mutations in the human <italic>PTCH </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and have been shown to be associated with reactive M&#x000fc;ller glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. M&#x000fc;ller glial reactivity is often marked by upregulation of GFAP, and <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants possessed regions of elevated GFAP levels. Elevated GFAP levels were consistently localized in the inner retina, where M&#x000fc;ller glial endfeet terminate and contribute to the ILM. Staining with GS, which labels the M&#x000fc;ller glial endfeet, revealed disruptions in ILM integrity in ~40% of mutant retinas assayed. In these cases, M&#x000fc;ller glial endfeet did not terminate properly in the ILM, and the ILM was discontinuous. In some human patients, ERMs are found adjacent to retinal arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]; interestingly, we consistently detected the presence of reactive glial endfeet in localized retinal regions adjacent to the optic nerve and embryonic retinal vasculature. Importantly, no increases in cell death were detected in the retina or optic nerve of <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants, or in M&#x000fc;ller glia themselves (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), ruling out reactivity due to apoptosis. Finally, in other contexts, M&#x000fc;ller glia reactivity is often coupled with ectopic proliferation of these cells during 'reactive gliosis' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. BrdU analysis did not detect ectopic proliferation in the central retinas of <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), indicating that while a subset of these cells was reactive, they did not undergo a proliferative response. While reactive M&#x000fc;ller glia have been shown to be associated with ERMs, it is unclear whether reactive M&#x000fc;ller glia are the cause of these pathologies or, conversely, whether M&#x000fc;ller glia become reactive in response to ERM formation. Further studies will be required to answer this question and to shed light on the cellular and molecular causes of ERM formation.</p></sec><sec><title>The retinal progenitor population of the CMZ is expanded in lep/ptc2 mutants</title><p>Exact roles for Hh pathway activity in proliferating retinal progenitor cells remain unclear.

In <italic>Ptc1</italic><sup>+/- </sup>mice, more retinal progenitors are allocated to the CMZ throughout development and into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. BrdU pulse-chase analysis of the progenitor population at the <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>CMZ suggests that Patched-dependent Hh signaling controls the number of retinal progenitors in the zebrafish CMZ, and does not directly affect the length of the cell cycle in these cells. Importantly, cell counts at an earlier time-point, before the formation of the CMZ, revealed no increase in cell number in <italic>lep/ptc2 </italic>retinas as compared to their wild-type siblings (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>), suggesting that the increase in proliferating progenitors at the CMZ is not simply due to an earlier proliferative event.
