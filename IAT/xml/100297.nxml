Furthermore, we demonstrate that the helicase activity of Srs2 is probably required for the phenotypic suppression of error-free PRR defects. Taken together, our observations link error-free PRR to homologous recombination through the helicase activity of Srs2.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Post-replication repair (PRR) is defined as the cellular process that, in the presence of DNA damage, converts low molecular weight genomic fragments into large molecular weight DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c2">2</xref>). This process is required by the cell to survive an S-phase with unrepaired lethal DNA lesions in the genome; the replication machinery bypasses the damage, and PRR processes fill in the resulting gaps. The gap filling event, or damage tolerance, does not remove the lesion, but allows replication to occur in its presence. The mechanism by which PRR functions to resume replication after encountering a block and to fill in the single stranded regions is largely unknown.</p><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, members of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway are responsible for PRR. Rad6 and associated PRR proteins Rad18 and Rev3 were initially thought to mediate PRR via an error-prone mechanism whereby Rad6 and Rad18 promote the activity of Pol&#x003b6; (consisting of two subunits Rev3 and Rev7). Pol&#x003b6; is a non-essential mutagenic polymerase that is able to replicate over damaged regions of DNA with low fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c3">3</xref>), a process referred to as translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). However, many lines of evidence later suggested that the error-prone mechanism of PRR is not the preferred form of tolerance in eukaryotes (for a recent review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c4">4</xref>). The existence of an error-free PRR pathway was suspected but has not been explored until recently. It is now clear that there are at least two independent error-free PRR pathways mediated by <italic>RAD5</italic> and <italic>POL30</italic>, both under the control of <italic>RAD6</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>RAD18</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c5">5</xref>), and genes encoding a novel ubiquitin conjugating enzyme complex, Ubc13&#x02013;Mms2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c7">7</xref>), promote one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c8">8</xref>) or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c5">5</xref>) of the pathways. <italic>RAD5</italic> encodes an ATPase with zinc-finger&#x0002f;RING finger domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c10">10</xref>) and physically interacts with Rad18 as well as Ubc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c8">8</xref>). The activity of this complex is unknown. The <italic>pol30-46</italic> allele of the yeast PCNA homolog is sensitive to UV, synergistic with <italic>rev3</italic> and defective in PRR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c11">11</xref>). The suspected involvement of Pol30 in PRR is not surprising, as PRR and replication are closely related processes. Another member of the PRR epistasis group is <italic>RAD30</italic>. <italic>RAD30</italic> encodes a non-essential DNA polymerase Pol&#x003b7; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c12">12</xref>) and is believed to function in error-free translesional bypass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c13">13</xref>). <italic>RAD30</italic> belongs to the <italic>RAD6</italic> epistasis group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c13">13</xref>) but its genetic relationship with other members within this pathway remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c5">5</xref>).</p><p>Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of PRR requires investigation of the genetic relationship between the <italic>RAD6</italic> group and other cellular DNA repair&#x0002f;tolerance pathways. Attempts to isolate suppressors of the DNA damage-sensitivity of both <italic>rad6</italic> and <italic>rad18</italic> null mutants (14&#x02013;16) led to the identification of <italic>SRS2</italic> (<italic>RADH</italic>), encoding a non-essential DNA helicase with homology to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Rep and UvrD helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c15">15</xref>). <italic>srs2</italic> single mutants display a moderate sensitivity to a wide variety of DNA-damaging agents; the UV sensitivity of the <italic>srs2</italic> haploid mutant appears to be restricted to irradiation in the G<sub>1</sub>-phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c15">15</xref>).</p><p>Recombination repair in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> is crucial for the repair of double stranded breaks, and consists of two subpathways: homologous recombination repair and non-homologous end joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c17">17</xref>). The ability of isolated <italic>srs2</italic> alleles to suppress the radiation (UV and &#x003b3;-ray) sensitivity of <italic>rad6</italic> and <italic>rad18</italic> cells apparently requires a functional <italic>RAD52</italic>-dependent homologous recombination repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c16">16</xref>).</p><p>The models proposed to explain the relationship between <italic>SRS2</italic>, the <italic>RAD52</italic> pathway and the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway, involve Srs2 as a &#x02018;switch&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c4">4</xref>). The hypothesis that Srs2 functions as a switch between recombination repair and <italic>RAD6</italic>-dependent PRR is supported by at least two pieces of evidence: (i) suppression of the extreme <italic>rad6</italic> and <italic>rad18</italic> sensitivity to various DNA-damaging agents is dependent on the <italic>RAD52</italic> recombination pathway and (ii) <italic>srs2</italic> mutants are hyper-recombinant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c19">19</xref>); Srs2 is thus considered essential to commit the cell to <italic>RAD6</italic>-dependent PRR.</p></sec><sec><title/><p>In view of the complexity of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway, it is important to address three major issues: (i) genetic interactions and molecular events within error-free PRR, (ii) connection between error-free PRR and homologous recombination and (iii) mechanism(s) of <italic>srs2</italic> suppression of PRR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c4">4</xref>). We hypothesize that the precise placement of <italic>SRS2</italic> function with respect to the three independent branches of <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway would provide clues to all the above issues. We report here that the <italic>srs2</italic> mutation is able to completely suppress DNA damage sensitivities of the mutants representing both error-free branches within PRR. It appears that the TLS activities within the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway are less dependent on Srs2, although genetic interactions between <italic>SRS2</italic> and <italic>REV3</italic> have been observed. Finally, we demonstrate that the helicase activity of Srs2 is absolutely required for its function within PRR. Taken together, our results suggest that the Srs2 helicase acts at the level of error-free PRR probably via its control of homologous recombination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and cell culture</title><p>The <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf160tb1">1</xref>.

Deletion of <italic>MMS2</italic> results in a significant increase in spontaneous mutagenesis, and this increase is dependent on the functional <italic>REV3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c6">6</xref>). Furthermore, although <italic>mms2</italic> and <italic>rev3</italic> single mutants display only moderately increased sensitivity to various DNA-damaging agents, the <italic>mms2 rev3</italic> double mutant is extremely sensitive to these agents and the effect of double mutation is clearly synergistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c26">26</xref>). These findings established a two-parallel pathway model and placed <italic>MMS2</italic> in the error-free PRR branch. Given the strong link between <italic>SRS2</italic> and homologous recombination and the assumption that error-free PRR utilizes a recombination mechanism to bypass replication blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c4">4</xref>), we proposed that <italic>srs2</italic> might act to suppress the error-free branch of PRR. Epistasis analysis was performed between <italic>srs2</italic> and <italic>mms2</italic> in order to see if the suppression extended to the subpathways. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf160f1">1</xref>, <italic>srs2</italic> cells display a similar (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf160f1">1</xref>A) or a greater (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf160f1">1</xref>B) sensitivity to UV and MMS, respectively, compared with the <italic>mms2</italic> single mutant. In both cases, the <italic>srs2 mms2</italic> double mutant is as sensitive as the <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant, indicating that <italic>srs2</italic> is epistatic to <italic>mms2</italic>. The fact that the <italic>srs2 mms2</italic> double mutant is no more sensitive than either of the corresponding single mutants clearly places these two genes in the same genetic pathway. However, as <italic>mms2</italic> is no more sensitive to killing by UV and MMS than the <italic>srs2</italic> mutant, one cannot demonstrate a rescuing&#x0002f;suppressing effect of <italic>mms2</italic> phenotype as observed with <italic>rad6</italic> and <italic>rad18</italic> mutants (14&#x02013;16). One is also unable to address whether Srs2 acts upstream of Rad6 and is required for all PRR, or if it is involved specifically within error-free PRR. We reasoned that if the latter is true, the <italic>srs2</italic> mutation should have no effect on the increased mutagenesis observed in <italic>mms2</italic> cells. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf160f2">2</xref>, while the <italic>mms2</italic> single mutation causes an increase in the spontaneous reversion frequency of a <italic>trp1-289</italic> amber mutation up to 30-fold over wild-type levels, the <italic>srs2</italic> mutation completely suppresses the <italic>mms2</italic> mutator phenotype to the <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant level. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the <italic>rev3</italic> mutation. Thus, we conclude that <italic>srs2</italic> is indeed a suppressor of <italic>mms2</italic>, that the mutator phenotype observed in <italic>mms2</italic> cells is dependent on both <italic>REV3</italic> and <italic>SRS2</italic> and that the <italic>srs2</italic> suppressor is probably not specific for <italic>mms2</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>srs2</italic> is epistatic to both branches of error-free PRR</title><p>The error-free PRR activity has been divided into two independent subpathways represented by <italic>RAD5</italic> and <italic>POL30</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c5">5</xref>). <italic>MMS2</italic> and <italic>UBC13</italic> may be involved in only <italic>RAD5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c8">8</xref>) or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c5">5</xref>) subpathways. Hence, it is important to determine whether <italic>srs2</italic> suppresses one or both subpathways of error-free PRR. This effect can be directly assessed as we have shown previously that both <italic>rad5</italic> and <italic>pol30-46</italic> mutants are much more sensitive to UV and MMS than <italic>mms2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c5">5</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf160f3">3</xref>A and B, <italic>rad5</italic> and <italic>pol30-46</italic> single mutants are indeed much more sensitive to MMS than the <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant. In both cases, the corresponding <italic>srs2</italic> double mutants are as sensitive to MMS as the <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant. A similar result has been obtained with UV treatment (data not shown). These results support a hypothesis that <italic>SRS2</italic> is required for both subpathways of error-free PRR. Furthermore, the extreme MMS sensitivity of the <italic>pol30-46 rad5</italic> double mutant is also completely suppressed by <italic>SRS2</italic> deletion, with the triple mutant exhibiting MMS sensitivity similar to the <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf160f3">3</xref>C). Together, these results strengthen the hypothesis that the entire error-free PRR (regardless of the genetic relationship of <italic>RAD5</italic>, <italic>POL30</italic> and <italic>MMS2&#x0002f;UBC13</italic>) is controlled by Srs2.</p><p><italic>RAD30</italic> is an additional member within the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway and, because of its phenotypes with UV-induced mutagenesis, was assigned to error-free PRR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c13">13</xref>). Although we have confirmed that <italic>rad18</italic> is indeed epistatic to <italic>rad30</italic> with respect to UV-induced killing, the <italic>rad30</italic> mutant does not display an increased spontaneous mutagenesis, nor is it synergistic with <italic>rev3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c27">27</xref>; B.Chow and W.Xiao, unpublished observations). Epistasis analysis with <italic>srs2</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf160f4">4</xref>) indicates that the <italic>srs2 rad30</italic> double mutant is more sensitive to UV-induced killing than either of the corresponding single mutants, but is less sensitive than the expected additive effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf160f4">4</xref>A). Similarly, the <italic>rad30</italic> single mutant displays too little sensitivity to killing by MMS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf160f4">4</xref>B) to allow any meaningful conclusions.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>SRS2</italic> and Pol&#x003b6; mutagenesis</title><p>Knowing that <italic>srs2</italic> is epistatic to all error-free PRR mutations, and that <italic>srs2</italic> suppresses the elevated spontaneous mutagenesis of <italic>mms2</italic> mutants, we wished to determine the genetic interactions between <italic>SRS2</italic> and the <italic>REV1</italic>, <italic>REV3</italic>, <italic>REV7</italic> mutagenesis pathway. We chose the <italic>rev3</italic> mutation as <italic>REV3</italic> encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA Pol&#x003b6; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c3">3</xref>) and is required for a broad range of mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c29">29</xref>).</p><p>One concern over the epistasis analysis of <italic>srs2</italic> and <italic>rev3</italic> is that <italic>rev3</italic> displays very moderate sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Nevertheless, its sensitivity to MMS at a high dose is significant and the <italic>srs2 rev3</italic> double mutant appears to be weakly additive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf160f5">5</xref>). This result does not allow us to draw definitive conclusions, and may reflect a complicated genetic interaction between <italic>SRS2</italic> and <italic>REV</italic> mutagenesis. To further address the issue, we performed two sets of experiments. First, we took advantage of the strong synergism between <italic>rev3</italic> and <italic>mms2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c26">26</xref>) and wanted to know whether <italic>srs2</italic> is able to suppress the extreme sensitivity of the <italic>mms2 rev3</italic> double mutant. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf160f6">6</xref> of a gradient plate assay, compared with the isogenic wild-type cells (lane 1), <italic>mms2</italic> (lane 2) is slightly more sensitive to MMS, <italic>rev3</italic> (lane 3) does not display a noticeable sensitivity, whereas the <italic>mms2 rev3</italic> (lane 5) double mutant is extremely sensitive. Deletion of <italic>SRS2</italic> in the double mutant rescued it from killing by MMS to a level indistinguishable from that of <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant (compare lanes 4 and 6). This result appears to favor a notion that <italic>srs2</italic> suppresses all three subpathways within the <italic>RAD6</italic> group. However, it does not rule out the possibility that simple suppression of the <italic>mms2</italic> single mutation in a <italic>mms2 rev3</italic> strain is sufficient to result in the observed phenotype, as the <italic>rev3</italic> single mutation has little effect on MMS-induced killing. Our second experiment was to take advantage of the strong anti-mutagenic effect of the <italic>rev3</italic> mutation, as the <italic>rev3</italic> mutant was initially isolated by its lack of UV-induced mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c31">31</xref>). Hence, we examined the effects of <italic>rev3</italic> and <italic>srs2</italic> mutations on UV-induced mutagenesis by a Trp<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> reversion assay. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf160tb2">2</xref>, the mutation frequency increased in both wild-type and <italic>srs2</italic> cells to a similar extent and in a dose-dependent manner after low-dose UV treatment. In contrast, the <italic>rev3</italic> mutation abolished basal and UV-induced mutagenesis in both wild-type and <italic>srs2</italic> cells. These results indicate that in the absence of Srs2, Pol&#x003b6; is still capable of TLS and that <italic>rev3</italic> is epistatic to <italic>srs2</italic> with respect to UV-induced mutagenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>The helicase activity of Srs2 is probably required for PRR</title><p>The biochemical activity of Srs2 within PRR has not been assigned. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments have shown that Srs2 possesses 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c32">32</xref>), which was shown to be crucial for recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c19">19</xref>). To assess whether this helicase activity is also essential for the PRR function of Srs2, epistasis analysis was performed using a putative <italic>srs2</italic> helicase mutation (<italic>srs2-101</italic>) in combination with <italic>mms2</italic> and <italic>rad5</italic> mutations. <italic>srs2-101</italic> encodes a Srs2 protein with a single P37L amino acid substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c19">19</xref>). This mutation is in the conserved domain I, the ATP-binding domain present in all DNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c33">33</xref>). The P37 residue is within the helicase consensus sequence of (A&#x0002f;P)GXGK(S&#x0002f;T) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c34">34</xref>) and is expected to be defective in the helicase activity. We found that with respect to UV- and MMS-induced killing, <italic>srs2-101</italic> is as sensitive as the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; null mutant, is epistatic to both <italic>mms2</italic> and <italic>rad5</italic> and is able to suppress the extreme sensitivity of <italic>rad5</italic> to the same extent as the <italic>srs2</italic> null mutant (data not shown). These results are consistent with the <italic>srs2-101</italic> suppression of <italic>rad18</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c19">19</xref>). Therefore, the helicase activity of Srs2, and probably its role(s) in homologous recombination, is essential for its <italic>in vivo</italic> function in PRR.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title><italic>srs2</italic> suppresses mutations in both error-free PRR subpathways</title><p>It has been well established that <italic>SRS2</italic> is required for the <italic>RAD6</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>RAD18</italic> pathway (14&#x02013;16) and that <italic>SRS2</italic> acts to channel lesions to the PRR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c16">16</xref>). We have reported previously that there are at least three rather independent branches within the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway; they probably perform either complementary or competitive functions within the stalled replication fork due to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c5">5</xref>). However, while the suppression of <italic>rad6</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>rad18</italic> null mutants by <italic>srs2</italic> is significant and obvious, the double mutants were often more sensitive to UV than the <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant (14&#x02013;16,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c19">19</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that <italic>srs2</italic> may suppress one or two branches within, instead of the entire <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway. To test this hypothesis, we studied the genetic interactions between <italic>SRS2</italic> and the other members of PRR. We found that <italic>srs2</italic> suppresses <italic>mms2</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>rad5</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>pol30-46</italic> to the extent that all the double mutants were as sensitive to UV and MMS as the <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant in their respective strain backgrounds. In other words, in the absence of functional <italic>SRS2</italic>, both branches of error-free PRR are dispensable without noticeable phenotypic alterations. Our observation is consistent with a recent report that <italic>srs2</italic> suppresses <italic>rad5</italic> and <italic>mms2</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>ubc13</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c35">35</xref>); however, it does not agree with the additive effect between <italic>srs2</italic> and <italic>pol30-46</italic> in that report. We noticed significantly different levels of sensitivity of <italic>pol30-46</italic> strains between the two reports, compared with the respective <italic>rad5</italic> and <italic>srs2</italic> mutants, which may underlie the two different results. While our <italic>pol30-46</italic> mutant was much more sensitive to UV and MMS than <italic>srs2</italic> (this study) and was comparable with that of <italic>rad5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c5">5</xref>), the <italic>pol30-46</italic> mutant created by Ulrich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c35">35</xref>) appears to be as sensitive as the <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant. To further confirm the epistatic relationship between <italic>srs2</italic> and <italic>pol30-46</italic>, we created the <italic>pol30-46 rad5 srs2</italic> triple mutant and found that it was still as sensitive as its isogenic <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant. We argue that if <italic>srs2</italic> was only involved in the <italic>RAD5</italic> subpathway, the <italic>srs2</italic> mutation would not completely suppress <italic>pol30-46 rad5</italic> cells to the level of a <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant. Hence, our results support the notion that Srs2 is involved in both error-free subpathways of PRR.</p></sec><sec><title>Srs2 and the mutagenic response</title><p>In both this and another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c35">35</xref>), the less-than-additive or even epistatic effects, with respect to killing by DNA-damaging agents, observed between <italic>srs2</italic> and <italic>rev3</italic> make it difficult for us to draw any meaningful conclusions as to whether <italic>srs2</italic> suppresses the <italic>rev3</italic> mutation. We reasoned that this ambiguous epistatic relationship might reflect the complexity of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway and the molecular events yet to be elucidated. To further investigate this issue, we examined whether <italic>srs2</italic> can rescue the extreme sensitivity of the <italic>mms2 rev3</italic> double mutant. Although the complete phenotypic suppression of the double mutation by <italic>srs2</italic> would support that <italic>srs2</italic> is epistatic to both <italic>mms2</italic> and <italic>rev3</italic>, a conclusion that is in contrast to the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c35">35</xref>), we wish to entertain an alternative possibility that this suppression is specific to <italic>mms2</italic> and that the resulting <italic>rev3 srs2</italic> double mutant may be indistinguishable from the <italic>srs2</italic> single mutant. The UV-induced mutagenesis assay clearly indicates that while <italic>REV3</italic> is absolutely required for damage-induced mutagenesis, <italic>SRS2</italic> is not required for this process, as the <italic>srs2</italic> mutant displays a wild-type level of mutagenesis. <italic>rev3</italic> is actually epistatic to <italic>srs2</italic> with respect to induced mutagenesis, which again indicates that Srs2 acts somewhere upstream of Pol&#x003b6; but is not required for TLS. This result is consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c16">16</xref>) that although <italic>srs2</italic> is epistatic to <italic>rad6</italic> over killing by DNA-damaging agents, the deletion of <italic>RAD6</italic> actually suppresses UV-induced mutagenesis observed in both wild-type and <italic>srs2</italic> mutants. To reconcile the seemingly contradictory results, we attempt to entertain two alternative models. The first model proposes that Srs2 prevents the recombination pathway from access to stalled replication forks and indirectly promotes Rad6-dependent PRR. When error-free PRR is inactive, Srs2 will force stalled forks to be resolved by TLS. This model predicts that <italic>srs2</italic> and <italic>rev3</italic> are additive or even synergistic; however, the observed less-than-additive effect may reflect the interference of Pol&#x003b6; access by Srs2 or other unknown factors. The second model proposes that Srs2 promotes all three branches of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway but prefers the error-free process. Under conditions where error-free PRR is inactive, Srs2 promotes Pol&#x003b6;-mediated TLS. This model predicts that <italic>srs2</italic> is epistatic to <italic>rev3</italic>, which would be consistent with some observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c35">35</xref>; and this study).</p><p>Contrary to the results obtained from induced mutagenesis, there is little doubt that <italic>SRS2</italic> is involved in spontaneous mutagenesis. <italic>srs2</italic> limits the elevated spontaneous mutation rates observed in <italic>rad18</italic> and <italic>rad5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c36">36</xref>) as well as <italic>mms2</italic> (this study) mutants. These observations are reminiscent of the suppression of spontaneous mutagenesis by <italic>rev3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c26">26</xref>) and would support a notion that both Srs2 and Pol&#x003b6; are required for spontaneous mutagenesis. The opposite effects of <italic>srs2</italic> on spontaneous and induced mutagenesis testify to the complexity of the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway. However, it would be consistent with observations that although <italic>rad6</italic> and <italic>rad18</italic> are mutators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c38">38</xref>), they are defective in UV-induced mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c40">40</xref>). While the UV-induced mutagenesis has been traditionally taken as a criterion to determine the involvement of TLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c40">40</xref>), the molecular events affecting the processing of UV-induced lesions may be different from certain spontaneous mutagenesis events that are claimed to be PRR-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c41">41</xref>). An even more interesting possibility is that Srs2 may switch its roles in spontaneous versus induced mutagenesis. In this regard, <italic>POL32</italic>, a new member of <italic>RAD6</italic> group encoding a non-essential subunit of Pol&#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c42">42</xref>) that interacts with both Pol30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c42">42</xref>) and Srs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c43">43</xref>), may provide a missing link. <italic>pol32</italic> is synergistic with <italic>mms2</italic> and epistatic to <italic>rev3</italic>, suggesting that it belongs to the error-prone branch; however, <italic>pol32</italic> suppresses UV-induced mutagenesis but variably affects spontaneous mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c43">43</xref>; M.Hanna and W.Xiao, unpublished results). It is conceivable that Pol32 may serve as a coupling factor between replication and TLS in a manner as Srs2 does between stalled replication folks and error-free PRR. It would be more interesting if Pol32 coordinates between Srs2 and Pol&#x003b4; (via Pol30&#x0002f;PCNA) at the damage site. Obviously the molecular events leading to the roles played by Srs2 and Pol32 need further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Srs2 helicase links PRR and recombination</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> possesses a tolerance pathway, which predominately uses recombination events to bypass irreparable lesions during replication. Although several observations suggest that recombination participates in PRR, an association between recombination and PRR in eukaryotes has not been clearly established. The phenotypes of <italic>srs2</italic> probably provide most of the indirect evidence that links error-free PRR to recombination.</p></sec></sec><sec><title/><p><italic>SRS2</italic> appears to be multifunctional: it is involved in PRR (14&#x02013;16), homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c45">45</xref>) and cell-cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c46">46</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>srs2</italic> mutation is synthetic lethal or causes a poor growth phenotype with mutations in a number of genes, including <italic>RAD50</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c45">45</xref>), <italic>RAD54</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c45">45</xref>), <italic>SGS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c48">48</xref>), <italic>MRE11</italic>, <italic>XRS2</italic>, <italic>TOP3</italic> and <italic>RAD27</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c49">49</xref>). To determine whether the helicase activity of Srs2 is essential for its role(s) in PRR, we utilized a putative helicase-specific mutant known to be hyper-recombinant. This mutation is able to fully rescue <italic>mms2</italic> and <italic>rad5</italic> null mutants to a level indistinguishable from the <italic>srs2</italic> null mutant. Hence, the loss of Srs2 helicase activity appears to result in both stimulation of gene conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf160c19">19</xref>) and suppression of error-free PRR. In this regard, it is reasonable to propose that in the presence of damage-induced replication-blocking lesions, the Srs2 helicase activity acts to produce a DNA structure or intermediate recognizable by member(s) in the <italic>RAD6</italic> pathway but inaccessible to recombination proteins. This process would be preferred by cells before reaching the 2N stage of the mitotic cell cycle. When the Srs2 helicase activity is inactive, some of the lesions will be processed by homologous recombination, which results in increased gene conversion. However, in the PRR pathway mutants such as <italic>rad5</italic>, <italic>rad6</italic>, <italic>rad18</italic>, <italic>pol30-46</italic> and <italic>mms2&#x0002f;ubc13 rev3</italic>, neither PRR nor homologous recombination is able to process the replication blocks, leading to the extreme cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Under this condition, inactivation of <italic>srs2</italic> leads to lesion flow to the <italic>RAD52</italic> recombination pathway and suppression of the PRR mutant phenotype. Hence, while Srs2 appears to act as a master switch between error-free PRR and recombination, and indirectly influence TLS, it becomes more interesting to find out how the Srs2 helicase activity is regulated during the normal cell cycle and in response to DNA damage.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf160f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Sensitivity of <italic>mms2</italic> and <italic>srs2</italic> mutants to UV (<bold>A</bold>) and MMS (<bold>B</bold>).
