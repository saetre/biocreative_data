Indeed, downregulation of EF1&#x003b1; expression by siRNAs led to markedly decreased expression of pAkt1 and to less extent of pAkt2 and was associated with reduced proliferation, survival and invasion of HCC1937 cells.

Proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells are regulated by steroid hormones, growth factors and their receptors through the activation of signal transduction pathways which, in many cases, are aberrantly activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) pathway has crucial roles in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and can be altered at multiple levels, including mutations of the PI-3K catalytic subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] or of its "upstream" or "downstream" regulator/effectors such as PTEN and AKT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Akt/PKB is a serine/threonine kinase that has attracted much attention because of its central role in regulating several cellular processes such as proliferation, angiogenesis, motility and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Activation of Akt in breast cancer portends aggressive tumour behaviour, resistance to hormone-, chemo-, and radiotherapy-induced apoptosis and it is correlated with decreased overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recent studies have identified novel tumor-specific substrates of Akt that may provide new diagnostic and prognostic markers and serve as therapeutic targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In light of the central role of Akt in the regulation of cell survival, specific inhibitors of this kinase might induce apoptosis when used alone or in combination with standard cancer chemotherapeutics. In this regard, suppression of Akt activity by small molecule allosteric inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] sensitizes many tumour cell lines to apoptotis induced by DNA damage, microtubule-binding agents, targeted therapeutics and ionizing radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] suggesting that Akt inhibitors may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in breast cancer. However, the use of Akt inhibitors in anti-cancer therapies should take into account that neoplastic cells express variable levels of Akt isoforms that may have different functions, including the distinct ability of pAkt1 or pAkt2 to regulate migration and invasion of breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>This study was undertaken to identify additional pAkt-interacting proteins and to assess their biological roles in breast cancer cells. To this end, we used anti-pAkt immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry of pAkt-associated proteins; of several interacting proteins containing putative Akt phosphorylation sites (RXRXX S/T &#x003a8;), we selected for further studies the eukaryotic Elongation Factor 1 alpha (EF1&#x003b1;).</p><p>EF1&#x003b1; consists of two isoforms, EF1&#x003b1;1 and EF1&#x003b1;2, that share &#x0003e;90% sequence identity and have the same function in mRNA translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], but markedly different expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Both proteins appear to be involved in tumour development and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and, relative to normal tissues, expression of EF1&#x003b1;1 and EF1&#x003b1;2 is more abundant in breast cancer samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Since EF1&#x003b1;1 is expressed at high levels in normal breast tissues while EF1&#x003b1;2 is barely detectable, overexpression of EF1&#x003b1;2 is more likely be biologically relevant in breast cancer. Recent studies have also correlated the expression of EF1&#x003b1;2 with ER/HER-2 expression, lymph node status, survival, tumor size and p53 mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we investigated the functional relationship between EF1&#x003b1; and Akt and the biological consequences of downregulating EF1&#x003b1; expression for proliferation, survival and invasion of breast cancer cells. We show here that EF1&#x003b1; binds only to pAkt but is not an in vitro substrate of active Akt1 or Akt2. Downregulation of EF1&#x003b1; expression led to decreased expression of pAkt1 and to less extent of pAkt2, inhibited proliferation, colony formation and invasion and promoted apoptosis of HCC1937 cells. The combination of EF1&#x003b1; siRNA with pAkt inhibitors further reduced proliferation, survival and clonogenic potential of HCC1937 cells, suggesting that these effects are, in part, Akt-independent; downregulation of EF1&#x003b1; expression attenuated the inhibition of cell motility induced by Akt inhibitors, consistent with the possibility that complete inhibition of pro-metastatic Akt1 activity by EF1&#x003b1; RNAi promotes a slight increase in the invasiveness of HCC1937 cells. Together, these observations suggest that EF1&#x003b1; is a regulator of Akt activity and that the biological consequences of modulating EF1&#x003b1; expression in breast cancer cells reflect Akt-dependent and -independent mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Identification of phospho-Akt interacting proteins</title><p>To identify novel pAkt- interacting proteins in breast cancer cells, proteins associated with pAkt were analyzed by mass spectrometry. To this end, whole lysates from HCC1937 or SkBr3 breast cancer cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-pAkt antibody and the pAkt interactome was compared to that from anti-Akt1/Akt2 immunoprecipitates (IPs) of pAkt-depleted lysates (data not shown). Proteins interacting with pAkt in SkBr3 cells were also identified by comparing the anti-Akt IPs of untreated cells and of cells treated with the dual pAkt1/pAkt2 (pAkt1/2) Merck's inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The anti-Akt IPs were then subjected to 2-D electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining (data not shown).

To this end, pAkt-interacting proteins were identified by anti-pAkt immunoprecipitation and 2-D electrophoresis followed by in-gel digestion and mass spectrometry analysis of spots exclusively or predominantly present in the pAkt interactome; we reasoned that a protein interacting with pAkt could be a substrate or a modulator of Akt activity. One of the pAkt interacting proteins identified in the proteomic analyses was EF1&#x003b1;. While we were investigating the interaction of EF1&#x003b1; with Akt, Lau <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] showed that EF1&#x003b1; co-immunoprecipitates with HA-tagged Akt2, possibly through a complex with &#x003b2;-tubulin. In our mass spectrometry analysis, the presence of EF1&#x003b1; in the pAkt interactome was confirmed in several experiments, but &#x003b2;-tubulin was not detected, suggesting that EF1&#x003b1; and pAkt can also interact independently of &#x003b2;-tubulin.</p><p>Since our anti-pAkt antibody does not distinguish between the pAkt isoforms, we used antibodies specific for the Akt 1 or the Akt2 isoform and specific Akt kinase inhibitors to assess the presence of EF1&#x003b1; in the Akt1 and Akt2 interactome of HCC1937 cells.</p><p>These analyses revealed that the interaction between Akt2 and EF1&#x003b1; depends on the phosphorylation status of Akt2, the most abundant and active isoform in HCC1937 cells and in breast cancer tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A similar phosphorylation-dependent mechanism is also involved in the Akt1-EF1&#x003b1; interaction, since endogenous EF1&#x003b1; was in complex with Myr-Akt1 but not with the phosphorylation-deficient double mutant T308A/S473A Akt1.</p><p>Many experiments have demonstrated that Akt-dependent signaling pathways are crucial for normal cell growth and that their deregulation influences cellular responses associated with the cancer phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]</p><p>Since abnormal Akt activation is well documented in many human malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and EF1&#x003b1; might have oncogenic effects in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], the interaction between EF1&#x003b1; and pAkt2 (and/or pAkt1) could represent an important mechanism for the regulation of Akt-dependent signaling pathways in cancer.</p><p>Although EF1&#x003b1; associates with pAkt1 and pAkt2 and contains a putative Akt phosphorylation site, our "in vitro" kinase assays indicate that is not an Akt substrate. However, down-regulation of EF1&#x003b1; expression by RNAi led to decreased pAkt expression with an apparently more pronounced effect on the Akt1 isoform, consistent with the reported Akt activation by ectopic EF1&#x003b1;2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The mechanisms involved in the regulation of Akt activity by EF1&#x003b1; are unknown; our finding that EF1&#x003b1; interacts with PDK1 raises the intriguing possibility that it forms a complex with PDK1 and Akt facilitating PDK1 phosphorylation of Akt at Thr 308.</p><p>Downregulation of EF1&#x003b1; expression diminished the clonogenic potential of HCC1937 and SkBr3 cells, suggesting that EF1&#x003b1; regulates this aspect of breast cancer cell phenotype; suppression of Akt activity by Akt inhibitors induced only a modest but not statistically significant decrease of colony formation and combining the EF1&#x003b1; siRNA with Akt inhibitors had only a modest additive effect.</p><p>DNA content analysis revealed that EF1&#x003b1; downregulation and pAkt1/pAkt2 inhibition suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis.</p><p>Since the role of pAkt-substrates in cell cycle progression and apoptosis is well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the effect of EF1&#x003b1; downregulation on the cycle distribution of HCC1937 cells could be due to decreased Akt activity. However, the effect of EF1&#x003b1; siRNA was more potent than that pharmacological inhibition of pAkt1/pAkt2 and was amplified by simultaneous treatment with the pAkt1/pAkt2 inhibitors.</p><p>Together, these data suggest that the effects of EF1&#x003b1; downregulation on proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells are, in part, Akt-independent probably reflecting the role of EF1&#x003b1; in mRNA translation and protein synthesis.</p><p>EF1&#x003b1; depletion by RNA-interference also decreased the invasion of HCC1937 cells, suggesting that EF1&#x003b1; might have a role in tumor metastasis. Previous studies have shown a functional relationship between EF1&#x003b1; expression and invasion; in particular, expression of EF1&#x003b1;2 appears to increase cell migration, EF1&#x003b1; mRNA levels correlate with increased metastatic potential in mammary adenocarcinoma and EF1&#x003b1; protein is overexpressed in metastatic compared to non metastatic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] However, Kulkarni <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] reported that EF1&#x003b1;2 expression is associated with good prognosis and suggested that EF1&#x003b1;2 may not be able to activate an effective metastatic program. The modest effect of EF1&#x003b1; downregulation on the metastatic potential of HCC1937 cells is likely to reflect the partial inhibition of pro-metastatic pAkt2 more than loss of anti-metastatic pAkt1 as pAkt2 is the predominant Akt isoform in HCC1937 cells. Consistent with this interpretation, direct inhibition of Akt activity by the Akt inhibitors used here suppressed the invasiveness of HCC1937 cells more efficiently than EF1&#x003b1; downregulation and the specific Akt2 inhibitor was slightly more potent of the dual Akt1/Akt2 inhibitor, a finding in keeping with Akt1 and Akt2 having distinct roles in regulating the motility of breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The simultaneous EF1&#x003b1; depletion and pAkt inhibition did not reduce further the invasiveness of HCC1937 cells; if anything, the effect of the Akt inhibitors was attenuated by EF1&#x003b1; downregulation, consistent with a more profound inhibition of anti-metastatic pAkt1. However, the effect of active Akt1 on migration and invasion might be cell line and/or cell-type specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], raising the possibility that downregulation of EF1&#x003b1; might have different effects on the migration of other cancer lines, depending on the relative concentration and activity of Akt isoforms. Since the differences in migration induced by the combination of EF1&#x003b1; siRNA and the Akt inhibitors were modest (only that between CTR siRNA plus Akt2 inhibitor versus EF1&#x003b1; siRNA plus Akt2 inhibitor was statistically significant), it is also possible that they reflect experimental variability.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we have shown that EF1&#x003b1; is a pAkt-interacting protein which modulates the activity of pAkt1 and pAkt2 and regulates the proliferation, survival and motility of breast cancer cells. Our results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that EF1&#x003b1; promotes tumorigenesis and indicate that expression of EF1&#x003b1; is required for many properties of breast cancer cells via Akt-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The Akt-dependent effects of EF1&#x003b1; may be, in part, due to the concentration of Akt isoforms, suggesting that investigating the mechanisms responsible for differential Akt isoform expression may be necessary to further understand the role of EF1&#x003b1; in the biology of breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>HA-tagged Myr-Akt1 and T308A/S473A-Akt1 in the pCMV6 vector were the kind gift of Dr. A.
