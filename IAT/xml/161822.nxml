We have investigated the possibility that Akt survival pathway might be involved in the regulation of apoptosis in the uterus during the estrous cycle. Rats with regular estrous cycle (4 days) were killed at different days of estrous cycle (diestrus, proestrus, estrus and metestrus). Uteri were collected and fixed for immunohistochemical staining (IHC) and apoptotic cell death detection by [TdT]-mediated deoxyuridinetriphosphate nick end-labelling (TUNEL) or endometrial protein extracts collected for Western analysis. TUNEL analysis revealed that apoptosis was mainly found at estrus compared to other day of estrous cycle. TUNEL positive cells were apparent in luminal epithelial cells only. No apoptotic cells were observed at proestrus. In contrast, proliferation was maximal at proestrus as confirmed with the expression of CDC47/MCM7 (a cell proliferation marker). Intact form of caspase-3 was maximal at proestrus and was reduced only at estrus. Likewise, presence of a specific cleaved caspase-3 fragment was observed only at estrus and IHC revealed that cleaved caspase-3 signal was found in luminal epithelial cells. PTEN protein, a phosphatase involved in the regulation of Akt phosphorylation, was present at all days of estrous cycle and showed no significant regulation in relation to cycle. Expression of phospho-Akt (the activated form of Akt) was present at metestrus, diestrus, and proestrus but decreased significantly at estrus. Akt protein expression was maximal at estrus. IHC revealed that Akt expression was high in both stromal and epithelial cells at estrus. Further studies using ovariectomized rats demonstrated that 17&#x003b2;-estradiol increased endometrial cell proliferation which was accompanied by an increase of both Akt expression and phosphorylation. These results suggest that increased Akt expression and activity in response to estradiol may be an important mechanism to protect endometrial cells from apoptotic triggering and to induce endometrial cell proliferation, whereas inhibition of Akt activity leads to caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in endometrial cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Apoptosis is a mechanism by which uterine luminal epithelium and glands degenerate in the absence of embryonic factors and regenerate in a cycling fashion through the estrous cycle. Sex steroids (estrogen and progesterone) are directly responsible for the histological and morphogical changes in the uterus during estrous cycle. Studies have shown highest apoptosis expression in lining epithelium at estrus in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and rat .[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Other studies have shown that estrogen induces uterine epithelial cell proliferation and estrogen withdrawal results in cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of apoptosis in the uterus. Since menses are absent in rodents as compared to humans and primates, there must be important mechanisms controlling the balance between survival and death factors in order to maintain integrity of endometrium throughout the estrous cycle, particularly following estrogen-induced proliferation and absence of embryonic signal.</p><p>Akt, a serine/threonine protein kinase also known as PKB, is activated by phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 in response to growth factors or cytokines .[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K). Once phosphorylated Akt has been shown to 1) phosphorylate and block the action of several pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and 2) block cytochrome C release from the mitochondria through the regulation of Bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This is supported by the observation that an activated form of Akt is able to block apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10) gene encodes a 403-amino acid polypeptide with lipid phosphatase activity. The PTEN protein dephosphorylates position D3 of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>) and generates inactive PIP<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. PIP<sub>3 </sub>is a direct product of PI 3-K and regulates PDK1, a kinase that phosphorylates and activates Akt. Thus, PTEN is a key negative regulator of Akt activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Studies using MCF-7 cells showed that 17&#x003b2;-estradiol effects are mediated through PI 3-K pathway and induced Akt phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] indicating that this survival pathway is important for estrogen signaling.</p><p>Caspases are well known and documented proteases involved in the activation of apoptosis. Once activated from their proactive forms, caspases target important proteins involved in cell proliferation and survival (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). Caspase-3 is one of the key executioner of apoptosis. During the execution phase of apoptosis, caspase-3 is responsible or in part for the proteolysis of a large number of substrates, each of which contains a common Asp-Xaa-Xaa-Asp (DXXD) motif originally described by Lazebnik <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We have recently shown that Akt is also a new target for caspase-3 cleavage, indicating that Akt survival pathway inhibition is an important mechanism for apoptosis activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Although the regulation and importance of Akt has been described in other systems, the presence and role of Akt has not been documented in the cycling uterus. Recent studies revealed that Akt phosphorylation on serine 473 as well as its nuclear translocation are stimulated by prolactin in decidual cells and act through PI-3K pathway to exert antiapoptotic effect in rat deciduas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It is suggested that Akt may also be an important and regulated survival factor in endometrium during the rat estrous cycle. In the present study, regulation of apoptosis was measured in rat uterus during the four stages of estrous cycle (proestrus, estrus, metestrus and diestrus). Regulation of Akt survival pathway and caspase-3 activation were investigated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western analysis using phospho-specific and specific-cleaved-caspase-3 antibodies to determine their involvement in the regulation of apoptotic processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>PhosphoPlus Akt (Ser473), PhosphoPlus Akt (Ser473) IHC specific, Akt, PTEN, procaspase-3 and cleaved specific caspase-3 antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs (Mississauga, ON).

Estrous cycle determination was carried out using vaginal smear and animals were classified according to the type of cell present in the smear. TUNEL analysis showed that apoptosis was maximal at estrus, present at metestrus and weakly detectable at diestrus and proestrus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Apoptosis was mainly located in the luminal epithelial cells at estrus. These results were in accordance with results obtained previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. On the other hand, cell proliferation was maximal at proestrus as determined by the expression of CDC47/MCM7 (cell proliferation marker) and was significantly reduced at estrus. Intact form of caspase-3 (Procaspase-3) was maximal at proestrus, metestrus and diestrus but was reduced only at estrus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Caspase-3 was active mainly at estrus, as demonstrated by the presence of a specific cleaved fragment using Western and IHC analyses.

This survival factor is well known in other systems for its inhibitory effect on apoptosis triggering. Apoptosis has been shown to be present in the rat .[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] endometrium during the estrous cycle. Apoptotic index was found to be high at estrus which was accompanied with a low level of estrogen receptor-&#x003b1; and high level of progesterone receptor. Since in the endometrium, growth of epithelial cells is dependent on estrogens and progesterone, and removal of ovarian hormones has been reported to cause cell death in rabbit and hamster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], sex steroids take part actively in the balance of proliferation versus cell death in this tissue. Indeed, the appearance of apoptosis in epithelial cells of the endometrium following ovariectomy or treatment with the antiprogestin RU486 has been described in pseudopregnant rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and in primary cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of apoptosis in the uterus are poorly documented in the literature. We have recently demonstrated in human ovarian cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and rat granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] the importance of Akt phosphorylation status in relation to cell survival and chemoresistance. Many other studies have demonstrated the involvement of Akt on apoptosis inhibition through the activation of several survival factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Since apoptosis has been found in the endometrium and that a recent study showed activation of Akt in response to estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], we hypothesized that Akt might be an important regulator of uterine function throughout the rat estrous cycle. Given that menses are absent in the rodents uterus, there must be precise intra-cellular systems involved in the regulation of cell death and cellular cleaning (proliferation versus apoptosis) in the endometrium after estrogen withdrawal in the absence of embryonic factors.</p><p>As demonstrated previously by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], apoptosis was evident in luminal epithelial cells at estrus and proliferation was maximal at proestrus. As hypothesized, Akt activity/phosphorylation was high at proestrus and Akt was strongly expressed and localized in the lining epithelium and glands. Indeed, Akt activity/phosphorylation decreased at estrus whereas cell proliferation was low as demonstrated by the decrease of CDC47/MCM7 proliferation marker. Although, Akt phosphorylation was reduced at estrus, IHC revealed a specific pattern of phospho-Akt expression in luminal epithelial cells and was distributed mainly at the membrane level facing the uterine lumen. Translocation at the plasma membrane of phospho-Akt from the nucleus and/or cytoplasm suggests that its presence at the membrane level may not allow phospho-Akt to be active in term of survival signaling. A recent study demonstrated that transient membrane association is required for the physiological activation of Akt indicating that correct subcellular localization is crucial for the activation of the kinase, and it may also allow its appropriate inactivation by phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. One example of such phosphatase is phosphatase and tensin homologue tumor suppressor PTEN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], a phosphatase found and active at the plasma membrane .[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. PTEN directly dephosphorylates the phospholipid PIP<sub>3 </sub>which is essential for Akt phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The present results clearly show that PTEN protein was present in the endometrium and was not influenced by hormonal changes observed during the estrous cycle. Indeed, recruitment of Akt at the membrane level may be a mechanism by which PTEN or unknown phosphatases act on Akt to inactivate its function.</p><p>Since the levels of estrogen are maximal at proestrus and further decrease at estrus, we have used ovariectomized rats to determine the possible involvement of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol in the regulation of Akt phosphorylation. Akt and estrogen have been shown to be involved in the regulation and downstream signaling in different systems such as EGF, IGF-1 and GH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) .[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and FSH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] regulation pathways. Recently, using both wild-type (WT) and ER alpha knockout (alpha ERKO) mice, it has been shown that ER&#x003b1; is necessary for IGF-1 induction of uterine nuclear proliferative responses and that IGF-1 signaling is dependent of Akt .[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Moreover in ERKO mice, lower levels of vascular nitric oxide has been found suggesting a crucial role of ER&#x003b1; in the regulation of these processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A recent study showed that there was an apparent increase in Akt activity upon brief stimulation with 17&#x003b2;-E2 in CHO cells transfected with ER&#x003b1; whereas 17&#x003b2;-E2 had no effect on Akt activity in cells transfected with control vector or ER&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The present results clearly showed an increase of Akt phosphorylation in response to 17&#x003b2;-estradiol. As shown in another system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], it is possible that the activation of estrogen receptor may activate Akt phosphorylation through a signaling mechanism not yet identified in the endometrium. PTEN protein expression was constant through the stages of estrous cycle studied indicating that PTEN is a constitutively expressed protein. In the human endometrium, PTEN has been shown to be regulated by progesterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, the rat uterus does not undergo decidualization during the estrous cycle as compared to the menstrual cycle in women. Thus, PTEN might be an important protein involved in embryo implantation processes when decidualization initiate rather than a role during the regulation of estrous cycle in the rat endometrium.</p><p>Recent studies demonstrated that the transcriptional nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-&#x003ba;B) is a direct downstream target of phosphorylated Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B is sequestered (p65 and p50 subunits) in the cytoplasm by the I&#x003ba;Bs inhibitors which are phosphorylation targets of Akt. Upon phosphorylation I&#x003ba;Bs are released and degradated through ubiquitination and NF-&#x003ba;B enter nucleus for gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In the literature, we found that X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) promoter is a target for NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Since we have shown previously in rat granulosa cells and human ovarian surface epithelial cancer cells that XIAP might be involved in the regulation of Akt activity .[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], it is possible that Akt may act on this family of inhibitor of apoptosis protein in order to block apoptosis processes. Whether XIAP or other inhibitor of apoptosis proteins are involved in this process remains to be investigated.</p><p>In conclusion, these results document for the first time the presence and regulation of Akt in the rat endometrium during the estrous cycle and further demonstrate that this survival factor is regulated by 17&#x003b2;-estradiol. Further analysis will be necessary to determine more specifically, the intra-cellular and molecular signal transducers involved in the process of apoptosis in the rat reproductive tract. Whether TNF-&#x003b1; or other cytokines/growth factors such as TGF-&#x003b2;, IGF-1 or EGF may be involved in the regulation of programmed cell death through Akt and inhibitors of apoptosis proteins in the rat uterus remain to be elucidated. Currently, investigations are carried out to further characterize the role and mechanism of Akt on cell survival/apoptosis using endometrial (epithelial and stromal cells) cultured <italic>in vitro </italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work has been supported by a grant from NSERC (238501-01).
