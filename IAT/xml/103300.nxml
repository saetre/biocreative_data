The protein from vertebrates has nine contiguous Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub> zinc fingers which function in nucleic acid binding, and a C-terminal region involved in transcription activation. In order to identify protein partners for TFIIIA, yeast two-hybrid screens were performed using the C-terminal region of <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA as an attractor and a rat cDNA library as a source of potential partners. A cDNA clone was identified which produced a protein in yeast that interacted with <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA but not with yeast TFIIIA. This rat clone was sequenced and the primary structure of the human homolog (termed TFIIIA-intP for TFIIIA-interacting protein) was determined from expressed sequence tags. <italic>In vitro</italic> interaction of recombinant human TFIIIA-intP with recombinant <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of the complex using anti-TFIIIA-intP antibody. Interaction of rat TFIIIA with rat TFIIIA-intP was indicated by co-chromatography of the two proteins on DEAE-5PW following fractionation of a rat liver extract on cation, anion and gel filtration resins. In a HeLa cell nuclear extract, recombinant TFIIIA-intP was able to stimulate TFIIIA-dependent transcription of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> 5S ribosomal RNA gene but not TFIIIA-independent transcription of the human adenovirus VA RNA gene.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transcription of 5S ribosomal RNA genes by RNA polymerase III requires three transcription factors, TFIIIA, TFIIIB and TFIIIC, whereas transcription of tRNA and adenovirus VA RNA genes requires only TFIIIB and TFIIIC (1&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c3">3</xref>). TFIIIB and TFIIIC, but not TFIIIA, associate <italic>in vivo</italic> with polymerase III forming a &#x02018;holoenzyme&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c4">4</xref>). These observations demonstrate the TFIIIIA dependence of polymerase III transcription of 5S genes and indicate that the transcription mechanism is distinct from that of tRNA and adenovirus VA genes. Understanding the biochemical details of vertebrate 5S RNA gene transcription will require elucidation of the structure and function of the protein factors involved in this mechanism. Factor IIIA is a single protein whereas factors IIIB and IIIC contain multiple protein species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c11">11</xref>). Little information is available on the structure of RNA polymerase III initiation complexes in vertebrates whereas more information is available on the structure of these complexes in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c13">13</xref>). In the case of TFIIIA and 5S gene transcription, the yeast and vertebrate systems are not interchangeable <italic>in vitro</italic> and a number of proteins are not shared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c9">9</xref>). The <italic>Xenopus</italic> and human 5S gene transcription systems are interchangeable <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c14">14</xref>).</p><p>Considerable structural and functional information is available concerning TFIIIA isolated from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes. This 38 kDa protein was the first gene regulatory factor discovered to contain zinc and possess repetitive Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub> zinc binding domains referred to as zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c18">18</xref>). These fingers bind the 50 bp internal control region (ICR) of the 5S gene in three groups of three: the N-terminal finger group contacts the 3&#x02032; ICR C-box, the middle group contacts the ICR intermediate element and the C-terminal finger group contacts the A-box 5&#x02032; ICR sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c24">24</xref>). <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA zinc fingers are also involved in binding the 5S ribosomal RNA transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c23">23</xref>). The binding orientation of the TFIIIA zinc fingers on the ICR positions the C-terminal region of the protein pointing upstream toward the start site of 5S RNA transcription. This C-terminal region is conserved in amphibians and human TFIIIA and is essential for transcription activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c28">28</xref>). The structure of yeast TFIIIA differs significantly to that of <italic>Xenopus</italic> and all other known vertebrate TFIIIAs, sharing only &#x0223c;20&#x00025; amino acid sequence identity with frog TFIIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c30">30</xref>). The transcription activation region of yeast TFIIIA does not resemble that of <italic>Xenopus</italic> or human TFIIIA and is located between fingers VIII and IX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c32">32</xref>).</p><p>The identification and characterization of proteins that interact with the C-terminal portion of TFIIIA will aid in the elucidation of the 5S gene transcription activation mechanism in vertebrates. The yeast two-hybrid screen is a useful experimental tool for identifying cDNA clones from a tissue library that code for proteins that can physically interact with a protein of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c33">33</xref>). In the present study, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins which interact with the C-terminal portion of <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA. A 70.6 kDa protein previously not associated with RNA polymerase III transcription was identified that interacts with TFIIIA <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cell extracts.

When expressed in yeast cells, the yeast and <italic>Xenopus</italic> GAL4 constructs yielded fusion proteins of the appropriate size when analyzed by western blotting using either an antibody against the GAL4 DNA binding domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f2">2</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;4) or against <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA (lanes 7 and 8). The larger molecular weight of the yeast TFIIIA fusion (&#x0223c;10K, lanes 3 and 4) reflects the additional amino acids present.</p><p>For the two-hybrid screen, a rat pACT cDNA expression library was used as a source for potential <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA-interacting proteins. This was done because of the availability of this high-complexity library for our studies and because we previously demonstrated that <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA promoted transcription of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> 5S RNA gene to a high degree in a rat <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c28">28</xref>). When this rat library was transformed into yeast expressing the <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA-GAL4 construct, a number of positive clones were observed among four independent screens. Four of the clones that were consistently positive and that were negative when retransformed into yeast cells lacking the TFIIIA-GAL4 fusion were additionally screened against the yeast TFIIIA construct as well as the SNF1 or lamin constructs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f3">3</xref>). Of these four, two were strongly positive for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity (clones 3 and 4) and two were weakly positive (clones 1 and 2) when assayed against the <italic>Xenopus</italic>-GAL4 construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f3">3</xref>A). Of the two strongly positive ones, clone 4 was also strongly positive when assayed with Yeast TFIIIA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f3">3</xref>B), yeast SNF1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f3">3</xref>C) or lamin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f3">3</xref>D). The protein coded by this clone may be interacting with the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Significantly, the other strongly interacting clone for <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA (clone 3) did not interact with yeast TFIIIA, SNF1 or lamin. These results suggest that this clone may code for a protein that interacts with the C-terminal portion of <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA. This putative protein was termed TFIIIA-intP for &#x02018;TFIIIA-interacting protein&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence analysis of the TFIIIA-intP two-hybrid clone</title><p>Clone number 3 from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f3">3</xref> was sequenced and found to contain an ORF coding for 343 amino acids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f4">4</xref>, rat TFIIIA-intP). No N-terminal methionine was observed so this sequence is likely from an incomplete cDNA. This rat sequence was found to share 85&#x00025; identity with a number of human ESTs (see Materials and Methods), including 100&#x00025; identity over a leucine-rich, 36 amino acid stretch. Using these ESTs along with confirmatory sequencing, a complete amino acid sequence for the apparent human homolog for this protein was assembled (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f4">4</xref>), yielding a protein of 617 amino acids with a molecular weight of 70 600. The human sequence has numerous leucine zipper and other leucine-rich regions that are present and conserved with the rat sequence. The sequence contains a potential Cys<sub>2</sub>HisCys zinc finger at residues 553&#x02013;582. The protein is rich in glutamate (14.7&#x00025;) and has an acidic pI. EST database searches in other organisms identified a pig sequence (AU059594) with 92&#x00025; sequence identity to this human sequence. Searches of the completed yeast and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> genomes revealed no apparent homologies to the TFIIIA-intP sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of TFIIIA-intP and TFIIIA recombinant proteins</title><p>Although an <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction between <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA and the proposed rat TFIIIA-intP is indicated by the positive &#x003b2;-galactosidase assay for clone 3 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f3">3</xref>, it was necessary to demonstrate the interaction <italic>in vitro</italic>. In order to demonstrate an <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction between <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA and the human homolog, recombinant forms of both proteins were expressed, purified, and incubated together to allow potential interactions to occur. The binding reaction was subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-TFIIIA-intP antibody followed by IgG selection with protein A&#x0002f;G resin. After selection, complexes were subjected to SDS&#x02013;PAGE and western blotting with anti-<italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f5">5</xref>). Electrophoresed in lane 1 is the recombinant TFIIIA protein; two bands of equal intensity are observed, one at &#x0223c;40 and the other at &#x0223c;30K. The 40K band is the intact <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA protein containing the nine zinc fingers (30K) and the non-finger C-terminal tail (10K). The 30K band migrating below the 40K band is possibly the nine zinc-finger region since the C-terminal region of <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA is protease sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c42">42</xref>) and protease inhibitors were not used in the preparation of the recombinant protein. Lanes 2 and 3 exhibit the protein A&#x0002f;G selected complexes from TFIIIA binding reactions containing or lacking the TFIIIA-intP protein respectively. In the absence of the TFIIIA-intP (lane 3), very little recombinant TFIIIA protein is precipitated, demonstrating that complex selection is dependent on TFIIIA-intP. Markedly more TFIIIA (40K band) is selected in the presence of TFIIIA-intP (lane 2) demonstrating that a complex was formed between <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA and the human TFIIIA-intP. The affinity purified anti-TFIIIA-intP antibody does not immunoprecipitate TFIIIA in the absence of TFIIIA-intP (not shown). It is noted that very little of the 30K band was found in the TFIIIA&#x02013;TFIIIA-intP complex (lane 2); this could be explained by lack of interaction between TFIIIA-intP and any TFIIIA lacking the C-terminal region.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of TFIIIA and TFIIIA-intP from a rat liver extract</title><p>An experiment that would lend physiological significance to the interaction of TFIIIA and TFIIIA-intP observed with recombinant proteins would be to identify an interaction between the native proteins from a cell extract. One way to identify such an interaction would be to demonstrate co-chromatography of rat TFIIIA-intP and rat TFIIIA after several distinct chromatographic separations of the original cell extract. These separations should take advantage of disparate physical characteristics of the proteins&#x02014;e.g., TFIIIA-intP is a 70K acidic protein and TFIIIA is a 38K basic protein. Such co-chromatography would be indicative of the presence of the complex in the cell extract and its maintenance during column fractionation. The separation protocol used in this experiment is depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f6">6</xref>A. A rat liver cytosol was prepared and fractionated on phosphocellulose. Rat TFIIIA-intP was found in the flow-through (because of its acidic nature) when assayed with the anti-TFIIIA-intP antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f6">6</xref>B, lane 1). This flow-through was then fractionated on a DEAE 650 column where the rat TFIIIA-intP fraction eluted at 1 M KCl. This fraction was then subjected to gel filtration; the rat TFIIIA-intP peak was identified and fractionated on DEAE-5PW whose western blot profile is exhibited in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f6">6</xref>C (top panel). Significantly, this chromatographic profile is the same as the chromatographic profile for rat TFIIIA on this column as detected by the <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA antibody (bottom panel). These results indicate that rat TFIIIA and rat TFIIIA-intP proteins co-fractionated as a complex on this column since TFIIIA alone does not bind to DEAE (not shown). The result is also consistent with the complex being present in the original rat cell extract and with its survival through phosphocellulose, DEAE (1 M KCl) and gel filtration chromatography.</p></sec><sec><title>Stimulation of 5S gene transcription by recombinant TFIIIA-intP</title><p>Evidence is presented in the previous experiments indicating that a physical interaction can take place between TFIIIA and TFIIIA-intP. In order to demonstrate whether there is any functional significance to this interaction, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays (using the 0.8 M KCl phosphocellulose fraction from a HeLa cell nuclear extract) were performed to examine for effects of TFIIIA-intP on 5S RNA gene or adenovirus VA RNA gene transcription by RNA polymerase III (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f7">7</xref>). Lanes 1 and 2 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f7">7</xref>A are 5S gene-containing transcription reactions minus or plus recombinant <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA. A 5S RNA signal is observed in the plus recombinant TFIIIA lane and little if any signal is observed in the minus lane. Longer autoradiogram exposures do reveal a weaker 5S RNA band in the minus TFIIIA lane (not shown) indicating that some human TFIIIA is present in this 0.8 M KCl fraction; human TFIIIA was previously observed in this KCl phosphocellulose fraction by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c14">14</xref>). Importantly, addition of the TFIIIA-intP to the TFIIIA-dependent reaction (lane 2) markedly stimulated 5S RNA gene transcription (lane 3). This stimulation by TFIIIA-intP occurs in the absence of exogenously added TFIIIA as is exhibited in lanes 4&#x02013;6. Also exhibited in these lanes is the diminution of the 5S RNA signal upon increasing amounts of the TFIIIA-intP. Such diminution could be caused by a TFIIIA-intP squelching phenomenon with the limiting amounts of endogenous TFIIIA present in the 0.8 M KCl fraction. Any potential effect of TFIIIA-intP on adenovirus VA transcription is exhibited in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f7">7</xref>B. Lanes 1 and 2 exhibit VA RNA transcription in this phosphocellulose column fraction in the absence and presence of the VA RNA gene; lanes 3 and 4 exhibit the transcription product in the presence of the VA gene and recombinant TFIIIA. The lack of signal in the no. 4 TFIIIA lane is due to loss of the ethanol precipitate. Lanes 5 and 6 exhibit the transcription products in the presence of the recombinant human TFIIIA-intP and lanes 7 and 8 exhibit the products in the presence of both recombinant TFIIIA and TFIIIA-intP. Little overall change in signal is observed in these lanes indicating that the TFIIIA-intP does not stimulate VA transcription.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Although a great deal of structural and nucleic acid binding data are available on <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA, little is known about how it activates 5S gene transcription and even less is known about proteins with which it interacts. In this study, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the C-terminal portion of <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA as an attractor and a rat cDNA library as a source of potential partners. One rat cDNA clone was chosen for further study because its protein product in the yeast assay did interact with the <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA attractor but did not interact with the C-terminal portion of yeast TFIIIA or other non-TFIIIA proteins. The complete sequence of the human homolog for this rat protein was assembled from ESTs and found to code for a 70.6 kDa protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f4">4</xref>). As assayed by immunoprecipitation, this recombinant human protein (termed TFIIIA-intP) was able to form a complex <italic>in vitro</italic> with recombinant <italic>Xenopus</italic> TFIIIA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f5">5</xref>). Rat TFIIIA and rat TFIIIA-intP co-chromatographed on DEAE-5PW after three distinct chromatographic separations of a rat cell extract. This observation is consistent with these two proteins being present in a complex on DEAE-5PW as well as in the original cell extract.</p><p>With respect to possible structure(s) in TFIIIA-intP that may interact with the C-terminal portion of TFIIIA, the 70.6K human protein has several motif-rich regions of potential use for protein&#x02013;protein interactions. The N-terminal quarter of the protein has potential leucine zipper regions and acidic amino acid-rich regions. The large middle portion of the protein also has several leucine-rich zipper regions. The C-terminal portion of TFIIIA-intP has a potential Cys<sub>2</sub>HisCys zinc finger, a variant where a cysteine replaces the second histidine in the Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub> zinc coordination sphere (43). Because the original rat clone identified in the two-hybrid screen lacked both these N- and C-terminal portions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f4">4</xref>), the TFIIIA-interacting region is likely within the central leucine-rich central domain. A hydrophobic nature for the TFIIIA&#x02013;TFIIIA-intP interaction is suggested by the observation that the complex of the two proteins (as evidenced by co-chromatography) is stable at high salt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f6">6</xref>).</p><p>Recombinant human TFIIIA-intP stimulated TFIIIA-dependent 5S gene transcription <italic>in vitro</italic> but not TFIIIA-independent human adenovirus VA gene transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f7">7</xref>), a result consistent with TFIIIA specificity in the TFIIIA-intP reaction. What possible functions could TFIIIA-intP have in 5S gene transcription stimulation? Although the protein contains a potential zinc finger in its C-terminal region, we were not able to demonstrate DNA binding by this protein to the 5S gene or non-specific plasmid DNA (not shown). The potential zinc finger in its C-terminal region may have a role in 5S RNA binding like some of the TFIIIA fingers and we have yet to explore that possibility. If its does bind 5S RNA, it does not appear to do this in a protective manner as increasing amounts of the protein <italic>in vitro</italic> reduce the amount of 5S RNA product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd316f7">7</xref>). This could be due to squelching of a limiting amount of endogenous TFIIIA in the fractionated nuclear extract.</p><p>TFIIIA-intP could have a non-DNA binding role in augmenting TFIIIA interaction to the IIIC complex and&#x0002f;or IIIB and&#x0002f;or pol III. Such a role might be analogous to the co-activators of pol II transcription. As a modulator, it could have a role in stimulating a basal rate of 5S gene transcription depending on changing cellular requirements. TFIIIA-intP could also have a role in altering the conformation of TFIIIA from an inactive to an active state. A previous study indicated that the protein we identified as a TFIIIA-intP was found to interact with the adenovirus E3 14.7 kDa protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen and was termed FIP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd316c44">44</xref>). As assayed by fluorescence microscopy, FIP-2 was found in the cell nucleus and the authors suggested that this protein may be a transcription factor because of the numerous leucine zipper-like motifs. Adenovirus is known to enhance RNA polymerase III transcription including 5S RNA synthesis in human cells (45). There may be a mechanistic connection between adenovirus infection and potential FIP-2&#x0002f;TFIIIA-intP stimulation of 5S gene transcription.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd316f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> TFIIIA amino acid structures used in two-hybrid plasmid constructs.
