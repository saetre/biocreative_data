In addition to their capacity to reduce xenobiotics, several of the enzymes act on endogenous compounds such as steroids or eicosanoids. One of the major carbonyl reducing enzymes found in humans is carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) with a very broad substrate spectrum. A paralog, carbonyl reductase 3 (CBR3) has about 70&#x00025; sequence identity and has not been sufficiently characterized to date. Screening of a focused xenobiotic compound library revealed that CBR3 has narrower substrate specificity and acts on several orthoquinones, as well as isatin or the anticancer drug oracin. To further investigate structure-activity relationships between these enzymes we crystallized CBR3, performed substrate docking, site-directed mutagenesis and compared its kinetic features to CBR1. Despite high sequence similarities, the active sites differ in shape and surface properties. The data reveal that the differences in substrate specificity are largely due to a short segment of a substrate binding loop comprising critical residues Trp229/Pro230, Ala235/Asp236 as well as part of the active site formed by Met141/Gln142 in CBR1 and CBR3, respectively. The data suggest a minor role in xenobiotic metabolism for CBR3.</p></sec><sec><title>Enhanced version</title><p><bold>This article can also be viewed as an <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plosone.org/enhanced/pone.0007113/">enhanced version</ext-link> in which the text of the article is integrated with interactive 3D representations and animated transitions.

Each of the receptors was docked with seven ligands: 1,2-naphthoquinone, isatin, oracin, menadione, metyrapone, oxononenal and NNK. In each docking procedure, grid maps representing different properties of the receptor were computed. During the docking, either one of the torsional angles of the ligand was randomly changed or a pseudo-Brownian move was performed. Each random change was followed by 100 steps of local conjugate-gradient minimization against the grid maps. The new conformation was accepted or rejected according to metropolis criteria using a temperature of 600 K. The length (number of Monte Carlo steps) of the docking run as well as the length of local minimization was determined automatically by an adaptive algorithm, depending on the size and number of flexible torsions in the ligand.

Among the best substrates for CBR3 was 1,2-naphthoquinone, for which an activity of 2.5 &#x000b5;mol/(min mg) was observed. Compared to the CBR3 activity for 1,2-naphthoquinone a significant (i.e., &#x0003e;10&#x00025;) activity was observed for 12 out of the 22 tested quinones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007113-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, a preference of CBR3 for orthoquinones is apparent; no activity was found towards menadione, one of the standard substrates used in activity screens for carbonyl reductases. This is in line with the lack of activity against any other quinone in para configuration. Among the non-quinone compounds that were identified as substrates for CBR3 were isatin and oracin, coniferyl aldehyde and acetohexamide.</p><fig id="pone-0007113-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007113.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Activity of CBR1 and CBR3 against selected substrates.</title><p>The threshold for significant activities (measured at 200 &#x000b5;M substrates and 200 nM (&#x0223c;6.6 &#x000b5;g/ml) enzyme concentration) was set to 10&#x00025; of the activity of CBR3 against 1,2-naphthoquinone (2.5 &#x000b5;mol/(min mg)), which was set to 1.0 for comparison.

The most striking of them is the strong difference in the activity towards the two naphthoquinones whose only structural difference is the position of the two carbonyl groups (i.e. para vs. ortho). Furthermore, in contrast to CBR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Wermuth1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Ismail1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, CBR3 shows no activity towards eicosanoids or aliphatic carbonyls like 4-oxononenal. At this point in time the activity observed against coniferyl aldehyde cannot be assigned to a specific chemical group, i.e. double bond or carbonyl group. Further experiments are required to verify product formation for several of the hits identified.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Active site architecture of CBR enzymes</title><p>To understand the substrate specificity differences between CBR1 and CBR3 we determined the structure of human CBR3 by X-ray crystallography and compared it to recently determined human and porcine structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Ghosh1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> of CBR1.

Accordingly, Tyr<sup>193/194</sup> functions as the catalytic acid/base, Ser<sup>139/140</sup> stabilizes the substrate by forming interactions to the substrate carbonyl, and Lys<sup>197/198</sup> forms hydrogen bonds with the nicotinamide ribose moiety, thereby lowering the pK<sub>a</sub> of the Tyr-OH to promote proton transfer. Hydride transfer is from the S-side of C4 of the nicotinamide to the substrate. The role of Asn<sup>113/114</sup> is to stabilize the position of Lys<sup>197/198</sup> via a conserved water molecule, and furthermore, to establish a proton relay at the active site, including coenzyme, substrate, Tyr<sup>193/194</sup>, ribose 2'OH, Lys<sup>197/198</sup>, water, and Asn<sup>113/114</sup>.</p><p>The main distinguishing feature of the crystal structures of human/porcine CBR1 (ternary cofactor inhibitor complex PDB 1wma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>; binary cofactor complex PDB 1n5d <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Ghosh1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>) and human CBR3 (binary cofactor complex, PDB 2hrb) is the conformation of the substrate binding loop: whereas the CBR1 structures show a conformation with a more closed active site, in CBR3 the loop is engaged in crystal contacts with a symmetry related molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007113-g002">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>). Despite extensive crystal screening and attempts to obtain ternary complexes, we were unsuccessful in finding different crystal forms. Inspection of the &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; structure reveals that substrate docking in this conformation is not useful to produce models explaining the observed substrate features. We therefore decided to model the CBR3 sequence using the CBR1 structure as template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007113-g003">Figure 3</xref>), assuming a similar loop arrangement. The loop modelling results in a conformation with all residues in acceptable regions of a Ramachandran plot, moreover docking analysis with different substrates allowed us to successfully identify critical residues for substrate recognition and catalysis. A comparison of the two CBR structures in the loop-closed conformation shows a wide opening to a gorge-like active site. In the CBR1-inhibitor complex structure (1wma), the inhibitor molecule occupies large parts of the entrance and is also covered by a PEG molecule derived from crystallization. CBR1 has a slightly narrower substrate binding cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007113-g004">Figure 4</xref>) than CBR3, mainly as a result of the terminal sulf-methyl group of Met<sup>141</sup>.

In particular, we identified position 229/230 (Trp<sup>229</sup> in CBR1, Pro<sup>230</sup> in CBR3), position 235/236 (Ala<sup>235</sup> in CBR1, Asp<sup>236</sup> in CBR3) and position 141/142 (Met<sup>141</sup> in CBR1, Gln<sup>142</sup> in CBR3) as the most likely candidates for determination of substrate specificity. To analyze the effect of site-directed mutagenetic replacements on activity differences between the two enzymes, we selected isatin and two structural quinone isomers, 1,2- and 1,4-naphthoquinone, as model ortho- and paraquinone substrates.</p><p>A major distinguishing feature between CBR1 and CBR3 is Trp<sup>229</sup>, which is replaced by a prolyl residue in CBR3 (cf <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007113-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The ternary complex of CBR1 with NADP and OH-PP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, a high affinity inhibitor, as well as docking studies with different CBR1 substrates suggest a critical role of this residue for substrate selectivity. As deduced from the CBR1-NADP-1,4-naphthoquinone complex model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007113-g005">Figure 5</xref>), Trp<sup>229</sup> serves two possible functions, namely to provide a chemical moiety for aromatic stacking interactions with the substrate, and also to coordinate a water molecule through the indole nitrogen. This water molecule (Wat1), observed in the structure of human CBR1 (PDB 1wma) is putatively responsible for the CBR1 specificity towards para-quinones. This seems to be further reinforced by the position of another water molecule (Wat2) seen in the structure of CBR1, which matches with the C4-carbonyl group of the pose adopted by 1,4-naphthoquinone docked into the active site of CBR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007113-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). We tested this hypothesis, by replacing Trp<sup>229</sup> by Pro or Phe, as well as by creating a double mutant Trp<sup>229</sup>Pro/Ala<sup>235</sup>Asp. In CBR1 this second position is located close to Trp<sup>229</sup> as well as to the nicotinamide and pyrophosphate portions of the cofactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007113-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Both CBR1 Trp<sup>229</sup> mutants showed significant decrease in activity for 1,4-naphthoquinone and a modest decrease for its ortho- isomer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007113-t002">Table 2</xref>). Data for isatin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007113-t003">Table 3</xref>) showed drastic increase in K<sub>m</sub> for Trp<sup>229</sup>Pro mutant while both Trp<sup>229</sup> substitutions led to faster substrate turnover highlighting the importance of aromatic stacking interactions for substrate recognition and binding. Destabilisation of the active site was much more significant in the Trp<sup>229</sup>Pro/Ala<sup>235</sup>Asp double mutant, where CBR1 residues were exchanged with the corresponding CBR3 residues. It resulted in a 1000-fold increase in K<sub>m</sub> and a 50-fold increase in V<sub>max</sub> towards isatin in comparison to WT CBR1 and in a complete loss of activity towards 1,4-naphthoquinone. Both CBR3 Pro<sup>230</sup> mutants showed some activity towards the para-naphthoquinone but decreased activity for the ortho-naphthoquinone and isatin, as compared with the WT. However, the behaviour of the double Pro<sup>230</sup>Trp/Asp<sup>326</sup>Ala mutant towards naphthoquinones was very similar to the WT CBR3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007113-t002">Table 2</xref>), indicating the possible occurrence of a steric clash between introduced aromatic residue and Asp<sup>236</sup>. In case of isatin, a 2-fold decrease in V<sub>max</sub> was observed for the Pro<sup>230</sup>Phe mutant, while replacing Asp<sup>236</sup> with Ala resulted in a significant drop of the K<sub>m</sub> value, indicating improved binding of the substrate in the active site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007113-t003">Table 3</xref>). These data suggest that the residues at both positions are strongly involved in substrate and product binding, indicated by data with swapped residues that either reduce (CBR1) or increase (CBR3) catalytic efficiencies. These residues are part of a more complex set of factors that combine to determine the activity. A major role within this proposed network of interactions falls to Trp<sup>229</sup> in CBR1.</p><fig id="pone-0007113-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007113.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Active site of human CBR1 with 1,4-naphthoquinone docked into a catalytically competent orientation (the water molecules Wat1 and Wat2 were present in the crystal structure of CBR1, but were not used in the docking).</title><p>The catalytic residues Ser139 and Tyr194 orient the substrate carbonyl, whereas residue Trp229 makes aromatic-stacking interactions and coordination of a water molecule (Wat1) through the indole nitrogen.

found at homologous positions in CBR1 and CBR3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007113-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), and displaying similar side-chain conformations are located on helix &#x003b1;F and form the wall opposite of Trp<sup>229</sup>/Pro<sup>230</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007113-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Replacing this position had a dramatic effect on CBR1: while Met<sup>141</sup>Gln and Met<sup>141</sup>Ala mutants showed modest decrease in activity towards naphthoquinones (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007113-t002">Table 2</xref>), combining these mutations with Trp<sup>229</sup>Pro led to destabilisation of the protein (very low solubility, no activity). The opposite effect was observed for CBR3, with the Gln<sup>142</sup>Met mutant showing a modest increase in activity, and with the double mutants still active towards 1,2- naphthoquinone.</p><p>Taken together, these data highlight the significance of the side-chain chemistry at position 142 in determination of CBR activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The objective of this study was to establish a substrate profile for human CBR3, to compare its enzymatic properties to its paralog CBR1, and to establish determinants for activity and substrate specificity. First, CBR3 catalyzes the carbonyl reduction of a much narrower spectrum of xenobiotic substrates in contrast to the exceptionally broad substrate profile of CBR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Hoffmann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Oppermann1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Matsunaga1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Wermuth1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, no endogenous substrate could be unequivocally detected to this end for CBR3. Of the known CBR1 substrates, only quinone compounds with ortho substitution or compounds like isatin and the cytostatic oracin could be identified as substrates for human CBR3.</p><p>Second, this work establishes the structural basis for narrower substrate specificity in CBR3, and highlights the active site loop found in CBRs as flexible entity that is one critical factor for substrate specificity. Exchange of non-conserved residues between CBR1 and CBR3 in this loop results in position-specific effects that control catalysis. In particular, the data reveal critical roles for Trp<sup>229</sup> and Pro<sup>230</sup> in CBR1 and CBR3, respectively, for activity towards para-quinones. These data suggest that hydrophobic interactions as well as possible contacts made through a water molecule coordinated by the indole nitrogen of Trp<sup>229</sup> could contribute to substrate orientation and possibly product release in the active site. This is supported by the fact, that in the experimental structures, the main-chain of the loop starts to deviate at position 229. This clearly indicates that a major difference between CBR1 and CBR3 is a large, hydrophobic wall built by Trp<sup>229</sup> in CBR1, and a more open substrate site in CBR3, irrespective if the loop modelling, as performed in this work, is correct or not. Other variable residues found on the loop also contribute to a varying extent to substrate specificity, such as residue Asp<sup>236</sup> in CBR3, introducing an additional charge into the active site in comparison to CBR1. Other determinants for activity are residues found at position 141/142, namely Met<sup>141</sup> in CBR1 and Gln<sup>142</sup> in CBR3. Although of similar size, these residues have significant differential effects on catalytic properties of the active site. A preliminary study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-ElHawari1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> showed the whole region encompassing residues 235/236&#x02013;243/244 as crucial in determination of activities of CBR1 and CBR3. Replacing this region in CBR3 with residues from CBR1, combined with Pro<sup>230</sup>Trp mutation, was sufficient for a 1000-fold increase in activity to &#x0223c;40&#x00025; of activity of CBR1. To summarise, the substrate pockets of CBR1 and CBR3 show fundamental differences in size, as manifested through residues found at position 229, as well as in surface properties, as seen with the more polar residues lining the active site in CBR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007113-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Although not specifically tested in this study, it is conceivable that some of the activities observed in this study are related to &#x0201c;propinquity&#x0201d; effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Schlegel1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been previously shown that orthoquinones can be reduced to the corresponding hydroquinones in a manner not involving a protein derived catalytic base, as seen with mutant studies performed on members of the aldo-keto reductase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Schlegel1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> or medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Porte1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Instead, the enzyme is used as a &#x0201c;scaffold&#x0201d; to bring the reduced nicotinamide cofactor and the orthoquinone into close proximity, to allow hydride and direct solvent proton transfer to the adjacent carbonyl groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Schlegel1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This possibility underlines the importance of correct cofactor and substrate positioning in the active site.</p><p>As observed from in silico screening (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genecards">http://www.genecards</ext-link>) and other experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Miura1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, CBR1 is an ubiquitously expressed enzyme with highest levels found in liver and the central nervous system, with a significantly lower transcription level but overlapping expression pattern found for CBR3. This suggests some redundancy in substrate specificity, but could also point to different substrates classes and hence different roles for these paralogous enzymes. CBR1 plays without doubt a major role in the phase I metabolism of xenobiotic compounds including xenobiotic quinones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Hoffmann1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Oppermann1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Matsunaga1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Wermuth2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, a function which we at present cannot wholeheartedly postulate for CBR3, in light of the observed narrow substrate spectrum. In addition, several more recently conducted studies also suggest a critical role for CBR1 in the metabolism of endogenous lipid mediators such as prostaglandins or lipid oxidation products such as the highly reactive and genotoxic 4-oxonon-2-enal, which is produced under oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Doorn1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Doorn3">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. This could relate the observations that CBR1 is involved in metastasis, neurodegeneration and apoptosis to its properties to catalyze prostaglandin and lipid aldehyde inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Wermuth1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Ismail1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007113-Doorn1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, however, final experimental proof for this hypothesis is necessary. In light of these data, the structural differences determined, and the apparent lack of activity of CBR3 towards lipid mediators like prostaglandins or oxononenal we suggest that CBR3 is likely involved in the metabolism of structurally and chemically different substrates. The precise identity of these compounds needs to be established in further metabolomic and molecular genetic studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007113.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Activity screening of human CBR1 and CBR3 against the compounds in the focused carbonyl substrate library.
