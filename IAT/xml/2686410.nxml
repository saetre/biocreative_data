It has a short N-terminal cytosolic domain, a conventional transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. We now show that CD317 is expressed at the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells, where it interacts indirectly with the underlying actin cytoskeleton. CD317 is linked to the apical actin network via the proteins RICH2, EBP50, and ezrin. Knocking down expression of either CD317 or RICH2 gives rise to the same phenotype: a loss of the apical actin network with concomitant loss of apical microvilli, an increase in actin bundles at the basal surface, and a reduction in cell height without any loss of tight junctions, transepithelial resistance, or the polarized targeting of apical and basolateral membrane proteins. Thus, CD317 provides a physical link between lipid rafts and the apical actin network in polarized epithelial cells and is crucial for the maintenance of microvilli in such cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>CD317, also known as BST2 or HM1.24 antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goto et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vidal-Laliena et al., 2005</xref>) and recently designated tetherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neil et al., 2008</xref>), is an integral membrane protein with a novel topology. It has a conventional transmembrane domain (near its N terminus) and a C-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kupzig et al., 2003</xref>). CD317 plays a role in regulating the growth and development of B cells and is highly expressed in human myeloma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goto et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishikawa et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohtomo et al., 1999</xref>); its expression is up-regulated by interferon-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blasius et al., 2006</xref>), and it causes retention of fully formed HIV viral particles at the surface of HIV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van Damme et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>CD317 was initially described as being present at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goto et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishikawa et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohtomo et al., 1999</xref>), but we subsequently demonstrated that it also resides in an intracellular pool and that it cycles between this intracellular pool and the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kupzig et al., 2003</xref>), the internalization step being clathrin dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rollason et al., 2007</xref>). CD317 resides, at least at the cell surface, in cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains (lipid rafts) with the transmembrane domain apparently lying outside the lipid raft and with the raft localization being dependent on its GPI anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kupzig et al., 2003</xref>). Lipid rafts have been implicated as being important in membrane trafficking by helping to segregate proteins for delivery to specific locations and in cell signaling by providing platforms for the transient assembly of signaling complexes (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simons and Toomre, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Viola and Gupta, 2007</xref>). A recent review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Viola and Gupta, 2007</xref>) prefers the term &#x0201c;membrane rafts&#x0201d; to lipid rafts and defines membrane rafts as &#x0201c;small (10&#x02013;200 nm in diameter), heterogenous, highly dynamic, sterol- and sphingolipid-enriched domains that compartmentalize cellular processes.&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Viola and Gupta (2007)</xref> highlight the fact that there have been several studies of integral membrane proteins that tether membrane rafts to the underlying actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kusumi et al. (2005)</xref> has developed the &#x0201c;picket fence&#x0201d; model, originally proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sheetz (1983)</xref>, in which specific integral membrane proteins are linked to the actin cytoskeleton and thereby act as rows of pickets in the plane of the lipid bilayer, limiting the free diffusion of membrane lipids and proteins and thereby serving to establish highly dynamic membrane microdomains. This linking of integral membrane protein &#x0201c;pickets&#x0201d; to the actin &#x0201c;fence&#x0201d; not only generates membrane microdomains, it also ensures proximity of the actin cytoskeleton to the region of the plasma membrane containing the membrane protein pickets, thereby intimately coupling the architecture of the cytoskeleton with that of the plasma membrane. Consistent with this model is the fact that a growing number of integral membrane proteins have been shown to be linked to the actin cytoskeleton, often via a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fanning and Anderson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bretscher et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>We have previously suggested that CD317 resides in the plasma membrane with its GPI anchor in a membrane raft and its transmembrane domain outside of the raft (or at the interface of the raft and nonraft domains; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kupzig et al., 2003</xref>). This would place the N-terminal cytosolic domain of CD317 in a suitable position to interact with the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, we thought it appropriate to test whether CD317 does interact with the actin cytoskeleton.</p><p>In this study, we show that CD317 does interact, indirectly, with the actin cytoskeleton and that it plays a critical role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in polarized epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>CD317 localization in nonpolarized and polarized Caco-2 cells</title><p>We initially chose to determine the localization of CD317 in nonpolarized Caco-2 cells because we subsequently planned to investigate the possible role of CD317 in apical trafficking in polarized epithelia. Caco-2 cells are a good model for such experiments because, when they are grown at confluency on permeable filters for an extended duration (&#x0223c;2 wk), they differentiate into highly polarized monolayers with attributes similar to those of intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grasset et al., 1984</xref>). These include a tall, columnar morphology and tightly packed microvilli. Caco-2 cells can also be grown as nonpolarized cells on plastic or glass. We found that some CD317 is expressed at the surface of nonpolarized Caco-2 cells, but the majority is intracellular, which is a distribution similar to that previously described for rat, mouse, and human CD317 in nonpolarized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kupzig et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blasius et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van Damme et al., 2008</xref>). However, in fully polarized Caco-2 cells, the predominant localization of CD317 is at the apical plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of CD317 in polarized Caco-2 cells, its knockdown in Caco-2 cells, and the effect of knockdown on F-actin.</bold> (A) Localization of CD317 in polarized Caco-2 cells.

We chose to address this possibility by knocking down expression of CD317 using siRNA and then assaying whether this had any effect on the morphology of nonpolarized and polarized Caco-2 cells. CD317 expression was initially knocked down in nonpolarized Caco-2 cells using a plasmid-based siRNA expression system (see Materials and methods). Two different siRNA sequences (see Materials and methods) gave similar results. Stably transfected Caco-2 cells were selected and processed for immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis using antibodies to CD317. This demonstrated that levels of CD317 expression had been reduced in the knockdown cells to &#x0003c;20% of those in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> and Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804154/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804154/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>Colonies of nonpolarized Caco-2 cells in which CD317 expression had been knocked down appeared to have a subtly different phenotype to that seen in colonies of control cells. This led us to investigate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in the CD317 knockdown cells. Colonies of CD317 knockdown cells were shown to possess significantly more-pronounced bundles of F-actin than control colonies as well as distinct filopodia at the periphery of colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Immunoblot analysis of the total actin present in control and CD317 knockdown cells demonstrated that this extra F-actin is not the result of overexpression of actin (unpublished data) and is therefore most likely the result of increased F-actin polymerization.</p></sec><sec><title>CD317 knockdown in polarized Caco-2 cells</title><p>The fact that reducing expression of CD317 in nonpolarized Caco-2 cells results in an alteration in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in those cells led us to ask what effect the reduced expression of CD317 would have on the phenotype of polarized Caco-2 cells (assuming they were still able to polarize after CD317 knockdown). Control Caco-2 cells were grown to confluency and allowed to polarize (as described in Materials and methods). As expected for polarized epithelial cells, the majority of the F-actin in these cells can be seen to be subapical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). CD317 knockdown Caco-2 cells grown to confluency also polarized and exhibited a similar gross morphology to that of control cells. However, there is a significantly different distribution of F-actin in these cells, with an almost complete absence of any detectable subapical F-actin and a preponderance of F-actin bundles at the basal membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). This observation suggested that knockdown of expression of CD317 might affect the organization of apical microvilli in polarized Caco-2 cells because F-actin fibers normally run along the length of microvilli providing mechanical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bretscher, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartles, 2000</xref>). Scanning EM (SEM) analysis of polarized Caco-2 cells showed that although there is a dense network of long apical microvilli on the surface of control cells, the apical surface of CD317 knockdown cells is almost completely devoid of any microvilli; those that are present are sparse, short, and/or stubby (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, right). XZ reconstructions of confocal images of control and CD317 knockdown cells show the altered distribution of F-actin and also that the knockdown cells appear to be shorter than their control counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, middle).

The observed differences in F-actin distribution and in cell height between control cells and CD317 knockdown cells led us to question whether tight junctions were forming correctly in the CD317 knockdown cells. Several assays were performed to address this question. First, confluent monolayers of CD317 knockdown and control cells were grown on permeable membrane supports. The transepithelial resistance was then measured and was consistently found to be 150&#x02013;170 Ohm/cm<sup>2</sup> (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003e; 20) in both control and CD317 knockdown cell monolayers. These data suggested that tight junctions are still present, intact, and functional in the CD317 knockdown cells. As a further test of the integrity of the epithelial monolayer formed by CD317 knockdown cells, apical surface proteins were biotinylated in control and CD317 knockdown cells. Tight junctions are impermeable to biotin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sargiacomo et al., 1989</xref>); so, if tight junctions are intact and functional, only apical membrane proteins should be biotinylated when the apical surface is labeled with biotin. This was what we observed in both control and knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In addition, immunolabeling of ZO-1, a component of tight junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stevenson et al., 1986</xref>), clearly shows that it is present (and appropriately localized) in the knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Thus, tight junctions appear to be present and functional in monolayers of the polarized CD317 knockdown cells despite the major rearrangements in the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, markers of the lateral membrane (&#x003b2;-catenin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Toye et al., 2008</xref>) and apical membrane (sucrase-isomaltase; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hauri, 1985</xref>) are correctly localized in CD317 knockdown polarized cell monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The knockdown phenotype can be rescued by expression of rat CD317</title><p>To show that the effect on the actin cytoskeleton arising as a result of the expression of CD317 siRNA is caused by the reduced expression of CD317 (and not caused by an off-target effect), we chose to attempt to rescue the normal phenotype by expression of the rat orthologue of human CD317 in the CD317 knockdown Caco-2 cells. Rat CD317-GFP is efficiently expressed and targeted to the apical membrane in polarized Caco-2 CD317 knockdown cells (Fig. S1, B and C). We observed that CD317 knockdown cells stably expressing rat CD317-GFP and polarized on permeable membrane supports have the same distribution of F-actin as that observed in control cells (i.e., bundles of basally localized F-actin are lost, and the F-actin is predominantly apically localized; Fig. S1 C).</p></sec><sec><title>The effects of CD317 knockdown are dependent on Rac and Rho</title><p>Activation of the small GTPases Rho and Rac leads to the formation of actin bundles/fibers, although the Rac-induced fibers are also Rho dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ridley and Hall, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ridley et al., 1992</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the actin bundles observed in CD317 knockdown cells might arise as a result of Rac and/or Rho activity and reasoned that if this were the case, transient expression of dominant-negative Rac in the CD317 knockdown cells should abrogate the knockdown phenotype (i.e., the actin bundles observed in the knockdown cells should be lost). This is what we observed; transient expression of a dominant-negative myc-tagged Rac mutant (Rac T17N) inhibits the formation of the characteristic F-actin structures seen in the CD317 knockdown cells (76.75% of cells expressing Rac T17N had reduced or no actin bundles; <italic>n</italic> = 83; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>), whereas transient expression of a dominant-negative cdc42 mutant does not (77% of cells expressing dominant-negative cdc42 showed no change in the degree of actin bundling; <italic>n</italic> = 23; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Furthermore, as would be expected, incubation of CD317 knockdown cells in the presence of 1 &#x000b5;M of the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 for 30 min also leads to loss of these structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>CD317 knockdown leads to activation of Rac.</bold> (A) Alexa Fluor 594&#x02013;phalloidin decoration of F-actin in nonpolarized CD317 knockdown Caco-2 cells transiently expressing either dominant-negative myc-tagged Rac or dominant-negative myc-tagged cdc42 as indicated (x = transfected cells) or after incubation of cells with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 as indicated.

Changes in the Ser19 phosphorylation status of MLC can thus be used as a biochemical readout of Rho activation. We observed that the amount of Ser19-phosphorylated MLC in CD317 knockdown cells is &#x0003e;10-fold that detected in control cells (control cells were untransfected Caco-2 cells, lamin A/C knockdown Caco-2 cells, or CD317 knockdown Caco-2 cells rescued by expression of rat CD317; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref> and Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804154/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804154/DC1</ext-link>). These biochemical data are consistent with the observed phenotype and implicate CD317 in aspects of the regulation of Rac and Rho function in Caco-2 cells. However, they do not provide direct evidence that there is an increase in the level of active Rac in CD317 knockdown cells. To address this directly, we performed a pull-down assay for active Rac (see Materials and methods) using lysate from polarized Caco-2 cells (control lamin A/C knockdown, CD317 knockdown, and rescued CD317 knockdown). This demonstrated an increase in the amount of active Rac in CD317 knockdown cells compared with that in either control or rescued cells, with levels of active Rac being barely detectable in the control and rescued cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref> and Fig. S2 B). Thus, there is an increase in the level of active Rac in polarized Caco-2 CD317 knockdown cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Ezrin is mislocalized in CD317 knockdown cells</title><p>Given that knocking down expression of CD317 in polarized Caco-2 cells leads to a loss of apical microvilli and a change in the regulation of Rho activity, we speculated that ERM proteins might be mislocalized in CD317 knockdown cells. Members of the ERM family of closely related proteins function as cross-linkers between the plasma membrane and actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bretscher et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2002</xref>), and such cross-links are fundamental to the making and maintenance of microvilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yonemura et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saotome et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanono et al., 2006</xref>). Soluble ERM proteins in the cytosol are inactive in terms of their cross-linking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pearson et al., 2000</xref>), but when ERM proteins are activated (involving phosphorylation), they undergo a conformational change that allows them to interact with both actin and, directly or indirectly, with the cytosolic domains of specific integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bretscher et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2002</xref>. Rho activity has also been implicated in the activation of ERM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bretscher et al., 2000</xref>). Because ezrin is normally enriched in apical microvilli in polarized epithelial cells, where it plays a critical role in coupling the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bretscher, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berryman, 1993</xref>), we reasoned that it would be mislocalized in CD317 knockdown cells lacking apical microvilli. As expected, we observed that ezrin localizes to the apical membrane in control polarized Caco-2 cells where there is some colocalization with F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>, top). However, in CD317 knockdown cells, this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>, bottom). It is noteworthy that phosphorylation of ezrin is raised threefold in knockdown cells compared with control cells (both lamin A/C knockdown and rescued CD317 knockdown; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref> and Fig. S3 B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804154/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804154/DC1</ext-link>), implying that the block on the formation of microvilli is not at the level of ezrin activation. These data also demonstrate that reexpression of CD317 in the knockdown cells restores the level of ezrin phosphorylation to that seen in control cells.</p></sec><sec><title>CD317 interacts with RICH2, a protein with both a Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) and Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain</title><p>Having shown that knockdown of CD317 expression leads to a change in organization of the actin cytoskeleton and a concomitant change in localization of ezrin and having implicated Rac and Rho activity in this phenotype, we reasoned that there might be some physical link between CD317 and ezrin and/or Rac and/or Rho or possibly with the actin cytoskeleton itself. Therefore, we chose to screen for proteins that interact with the cytosolic domain of CD317. Our chosen strategy was to use a synthetic peptide, corresponding to the cytosolic domain of CD317 and tethered to a matrix support at its C terminus, to screen a bacteriophage display library (see Materials and methods). The rationale for screening a bacteriophage display library rather than a yeast two-hybrid library was that we reasoned that any interaction with the cytosolic domain of CD317 might require the free N terminus of CD317; this would be blocked by fusion to the yeast partner protein in any yeast two-hybrid bait construct but would remain exposed in the C-terminally tethered peptide that was used to screen the bacteriophage display library. The screen identified 19 sequences encoding potential interactors. This included several proteins we considered to be improbable genuine interactors with CD317 (e.g., hypothetical proteins and ribosomal proteins; Fig. S2 D). However, one protein identified as a candidate interactor was RICH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richnau and Aspenstrom, 2001</xref>). Several features of RICH2 (see the next paragraph) suggested that it might be a genuine interactor with the CD317 cytosolic domain. Therefore, we used three further techniques to confirm the CD317&#x02013;RICH2 interaction. The first was a pull-down assay in which a synthetic peptide, biotinylated at its C terminus and corresponding to the entire cytosolic N terminus of CD317, was immobilized on streptavidin-coated beads and used to isolate a fusion protein of the C-terminal 87 amino acids of RICH2 fused to GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Biotin-coated beads did not bind the GST-RICH2 fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>), and GST did not bind to the beads coated with the CD317 peptide. The second technique was coimmunoprecipitation. In initial experiments, CD317-GFP was immunoprecipitated using an anti-GFP antibody from COS cells expressing CD317-GFP and RICH2-RFP, and the immunoprecipitated material was probed with an antibody to RICH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>, top). In subsequent experiments, endogenous CD317 was immunoprecipitated from polarized Caco-2 cells (or CD317 knockdown Caco-2 cells), and the immunoprecipitated material was probed with an antibody to RICH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>, bottom). RICH2 was detected in material isolated from control cells but not from that isolated from the CD317 knockdown cells, demonstrating that endogenous RICH2 interacts with endogenous CD317. The third technique used to confirm the CD317&#x02013;RICH2 interaction was surface plasmon resonance. The biotinylated synthetic peptide corresponding to the cytosolic N terminus of CD317 was immobilized on a streptavidin-coated gold chip, and the GST-RICH2 fusion protein passed over the chip at different concentrations. The GST-RICH2 fusion protein can be seen to bind to the immobilized CD317 peptide in a dose-responsive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Thus, all three techniques confirmed that RICH2 interacts with the cytosolic domain of CD317, and experiments using the GST-RICH2 fusion demonstrate that the C-terminal 87 amino acids of RICH2 are involved in that interaction.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>CD317 interacts with RICH2.</bold> (A) Immunoblot probed with an anti-RICH2 polyclonal antibody showing the results of a pull-down assay between a GST-RICH2 fusion protein and a synthetic peptide corresponding to the entire cytosolic N terminus of CD317.

RICH2, different isoforms of RICH1, and related proteins share two conserved domains, namely an N-terminal BAR domain and a Rho/Rac/cdc42 GAP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richnau and Aspenstrom, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furuta et al., 2002</xref>). These domains are followed by a variable (in sequence and length) region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). However, RICH2 and isoforms 1 and 2 of RICH1 do share the same C-terminal sequence Glu-Ser-Thr-Ala-Leu (ESTAL), which conforms to a PSD-95/DlgA/ZO-1&#x02013;like (PDZ) domain&#x02013;binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Songyang et al., 1993</xref>) and has been implicated in binding to the protein EBP50 (ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50; also known as NHERF1 [Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger regulatory factor 1]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reczek and Bretscher, 2001</xref>). EBP50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weinman et al., 1995</xref>) is a PDZ domain&#x02013;containing adapter that has been shown to link ERM proteins with the cytosolic domains of specific integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bretscher et al., 2000</xref>). In this case, RICH2 appears to provide a physical link between the cytosolic domain of CD317 and EBP50 and thus to ezrin and the actin cytoskeleton. We reasoned that if this were the case, it should be possible to coimmunoprecipitate EBP50 with CD317. We immunoprecipitated CD317 from lysate from polarized Caco-2 cells (control or CD317 knockdown) and immunoblotted the immunoprecipitates using an anti-EBP50 antibody. EBP50 was detectable in the immunoprecipitate from control cells but not in that from CD317 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref> and Fig. S2 C).</p><p>RICH2 also appears to provide a potential link between CD317 and regulation of Rac and Rho because the central putative GAP domain has been shown to have Rac GAP activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richnau and Aspenstrom, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The BAR domain of RICH2 has been shown to bind membranes and to be capable of inducing membrane tubulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richnau et al., 2004</xref>).

This was also the case for RICH2 in CD317 knockdown Caco-2 cells (unpublished data); thus, CD317 is not required for the membrane association of RICH2.</p></sec><sec><title>RICH2 knockdown in Caco-2 cells leads to a similar phenotype to that arising after CD317 knockdown</title><p>We reasoned that if RICH2 does provide a functional link between CD317, Rac/Rho, and the actin cytoskeleton, knockdown of RICH2 expression should phenocopy knockdown of CD317 expression in Caco-2 cells. To test this hypothesis, the expression of RICH2 was knocked down in Caco-2 cells using the same plasmid-based method that was used to knock down expression of CD317 in these cells. Immunoblot analysis of lysate from control and RICH2 knockdown cells demonstrated that RICH2 levels in knockdown cells had been reduced to &#x0003c;20% of those detected in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref> and Fig. S3 A). The stably transfected RICH2 knockdown Caco-2 cells were then grown to confluence to generate polarized monolayers. These polarized RICH2 knockdown cells phenocopy the polarized CD317 knockdown cells (i.e., a loss of apical F-actin, the presence of distinct bundles of F-actin at the basal membrane, a decrease in the amount of apically localized ezrin [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>], a loss of apical microvilli [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>], and reduced cell height but no loss of transepithelial resistance or of tight junctions or any change in the distribution of apical and basolateral marker proteins [not depicted]). Lamin A/C knockdown cells were used as a control in these experiments and showed a wild-type phenotype with respect to actin organization, microvilli formation, ezrin localization, and cell height. Knocking down expression of RICH2 also led to an increase in the level of active Rac in polarized Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref> and Fig. S2 B), an &#x0223c;10-fold increase in phosphorylation of MLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref> and Fig. S2 A), and an approximately threefold increase in phosphorylated ezrin (when compared with the situation in control cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 F</xref> and Fig. S3 B), closely paralleling what occurs when CD317 expression is knocked down.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of RICH2 knockdown.</bold> (A) Immunoblot analyses (using antibodies to RICH2 and lamin A/C) of lysates from Caco-2 cells in which either RICH2 or lamin A/C levels (as indicated) have been knocked down.

Rac and Rho activities have previously been shown to be required for production of actin-dependent ruffles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall, 1998</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that if the putative Rac GAP domain in RICH2 is indeed functioning as a Rac GAP in vivo (as it has been shown to be in vitro; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richnau and Aspenstrom, 2001</xref>), elevated expression of RICH2 might lead to a reduction in active Rac within cells, which would, in turn, lead to a reduction in actin-dependent ruffles. To test this hypothesis, we expressed an RFP-tagged form of RICH2 (RICH2-RFP) in COS cells and assayed ruffle formation in these and in control, nontransfected cells. Over 90% of control cells exhibited ruffles, whereas &#x0003c;20% of cells expressing RICH2-RFP did so. An R288A mutation in the Rac GAP domain of RICH1 has previously been shown to destroy GAP activity in that protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richnau and Aspenstrom, 2001</xref>). Therefore, we generated the corresponding mutation (R291A) in RICH2-RFP and expressed the mutant protein in Caco-2 cells. Cells expressing R291A RICH2-RFP behaved as control cells, demonstrating that the Rac GAP activity of RICH2 is required to inhibit ruffle formation, which is a result consistent with the Rac GAP domain of RICH2 working as a Rac GAP in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>RICH2 knockdown affects the localization of CD317</title><p>We considered that RICH2 might play a role in tethering CD317 at the apical membrane of polarized Caco-2 cells in much the same way that EBP50 and ezrin have been shown to tether the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haggie et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we performed immunofluorescence analysis of the localization of endogenous CD317 in polarized RICH2 knockdown Caco-2 cells. Initial observations of XY images of methanol-fixed cells suggested that the majority of CD317 was still in the apical membrane in the RICH2 knockdown cells, but some appeared to be intracellular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>, top left, arrows). Immunofluorescence analysis of PFA-fixed (nonpermeabilized) cells showed that CD317 is present at the apical plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>, second row). However, XZ images from methanol-fixed (permeabilized) polarized control and RICH2 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>, third and fourth rows) clearly demonstrate an intracellular population of CD317 molecules in the RICH2 knockdown cells, which is a population of CD317 molecules that is not readily detectable in the control cells.

Monolayers of CD317 knockdown Caco-2 cells have intact tight junctions and show appropriate localization of integral membrane protein markers of both apical and basolateral membranes. In these regards, they are no different than monolayers of polarized control cells. However, monolayers of CD317 knockdown Caco-2 cells do show significant differences to control cells when it comes to organization of the actin cytoskeleton. The knockdown cells show an almost complete loss of the well-defined and dense apical actin network. This network is of fundamental importance as the platform for the actin fibers that provide the mechanical support for the apical microvilli of polarized epithelial cells. We have also identified RICH2 as a membrane protein that interacts directly with the cytosolic domain of CD317 and can interact, via EBP50 and ezrin, with the actin cytoskeleton. The fact that knocking down expression of RICH2 has the same effects as knocking down expression of CD317 is consistent with RICH2 being part of the link between CD317 and the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, CD317 would seem to be acting like a &#x0201c;coat hanger&#x0201d; in the apical membrane of polarized cells with the actin cytoskeleton tethered to it via the RICH2/EBP50/ezrin linkage.</p><p>Clearly, CD317 is not simply acting as a coat hanger in the apical membrane; its presence in the apical membrane also has an effect on the activities of Rac and Rho. Therefore, it is noteworthy that RICH2 possesses a Rac GAP domain. This domain appears to be functional as a Rac GAP in cells because elevated expression of RICH2 leads to a loss of Rac-induced membrane ruffles, whereas a point mutation previously shown to block Rac GAP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Richnau and Aspenstrom, 2001</xref>) prevents RICH2 from having this effect. Furthermore, there are increased levels of active Rac in RICH2 knockdown cells. Thus, in the case of polarized cells, one might speculate that the Rac GAP domain of RICH2 would lead to inactivation of any Rac molecules at the inner leaflet of the apical plasma membrane, thereby ensuring no Rac-dependent remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton at that location. It is noteworthy that the expression of constitutively active Rac has been shown to mediate the disintegration of microvilli in chemokine-activated T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nijhara et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, the inactivation of Rac by the RICH2 GAP domain would help to maintain integrity of the cortical actin network beneath the apical plasma membrane and would help to ensure retention of the actin fibers that give the mechanical support for the apical microvilli of polarized epithelial cells.</p><p>Others have shown that RICH1 can form a complex with a protein designated angiomotin and that this complex is important for the formation, maintenance, stability, and integrity of tight junctions in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wells et al., 2006</xref>). Whereas we observed that tight junctions remain functional and intact after knockdown of RICH2 expression, knockdown of RICH1 expression led to a complete loss of tight junctions. Thus, RICH1 and RICH2 appear to play complementary roles in the establishment and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity.</p><p>Another cytosolic protein, EPI64 (EBP50-PDZ interactor of 64 kD), which binds EBP50 via a C-terminal DTYL motif and thereby links to the actin cytoskeleton via ezrin, plays a critical role in regulating the organization and structure of subdomains within epithelial microvilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanono et al., 2006</xref>). Unlike RICH1 and RICH2, EP164 does not possess a BAR domain or a Rac/Rho/cdc42 GAP domain but has been shown to be a GAP for Rab27A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Itoh and Fukuda, 2006</xref>) and to bind Arf6-GTP, possibly protecting Arf6-GTP from inactivation by a GAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanono et al., 2006</xref>). However, it is unclear how EP164 links to the plasma membrane. What is clear is that there is a growing number of partners for EBP50 that possess a GAP domain and one or more other protein or lipid interaction domain. Therefore, such proteins can provide part of a larger mechanical scaffold to localize specialized regions of the actin cytoskeleton while at the same time regulating the activity of specific small G proteins that play a role in trafficking pathways and/or the regulation of the local organization of the actin cytoskeleton.</p><p>The apical membranes of polarized epithelial cells are sphingolipid and cholesterol rich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schuck and Simons, 2004</xref>). Given its previously demonstrated localization to membrane rafts, its possession of a GPI anchor, and the fact that it is N-glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kupzig et al., 2003</xref>), it is perhaps not surprising that CD317 is localized to the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells. However, clustering of GPI-anchored proteins may well be the most critical event in their apical delivery and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hannan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paladino et al., 2004</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodriguez-Boulan and M&#x000fc;sch, 2005</xref>). Whether CD317 plays any role in organizing membrane rafts in the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells is unclear, but it is clear that CD317 has the potential to function as the type of picket proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kusumi et al. (2005)</xref> linking through to the underlying fence of the actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, if CD317 is arranged as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kupzig et al., 2003</xref>), with the GPI anchor in a membrane raft and the transmembrane domain lying outside of the raft (or at the interface of raft and nonraft membrane), it might be considered to constitute a &#x0201c;tethered picket,&#x0201d; with the GPI anchor being the tether holding the protein in the membrane raft. CD317 would thereby provide a mechanical link between membrane rafts and the actin cytoskeleton, a role not dissimilar to that previously proposed for the tetraspanin protein CD82 in T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delaguillaumie et al., 2004</xref>). The recent designation of CD317 as tetherin, albeit for a totally different reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neil et al., 2008</xref>), would therefore seem entirely appropriate. Such a role for CD317/tetherin would be consistent with the observation that when GPI-anchored proteins arrive at the apical plasma membrane they are transiently immobilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hannan et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>We have recently shown that, in nonpolarized cells, CD317 constitutively cycles between the cell surface and an intracellular compartment. Internalization from the cell surface is clathrin mediated and is dependent on the AP2 adapter complex; indeed, the cytosolic domain of CD317 interacts directly with the &#x003bc;2 subunit of the AP2 adapter complex via an atypical dual tyrosine motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rollason et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the cytosolic domain of CD317 also interacts directly with the &#x003bc;1A subunit of the AP1 adapter complex, and this interaction is required to deliver the protein back to the TGN from an endocytic compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rollason et al., 2007</xref>). An AP1 complex (AP1B), in which the &#x003bc;1A subunit is replaced by a &#x003bc;1B subunit, is specifically expressed in epithelial cells and has been shown to play a role in the delivery of cargo to the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gravotta et al., 2007</xref>). This process is dependent on AP1B recognizing a motif, which is often Tyr based, in the cytosolic domain of cargo integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gravotta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">F&#x000f6;lsch, 2008</xref>). However, adapters other than AP1B may also play a role in the recruitment of clathrin during the formation of transport intermediates involved in delivering proteins to the basolateral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deborde et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, because the cytosolic domain of CD317 possesses a Tyr motif that is recognized by AP1A in nonpolarized cells, one might have anticipated that it would be recognized by AP1B in polarized epithelial cells, leading to the delivery of CD317 to the basolateral surface of those cells. We have found no evidence for this, although it is of course possible that newly synthesized CD317 is initially delivered to the basolateral membrane before delivery to the apical membrane as has been shown to occur for some GPI-anchored proteins and some integral membrane proteins (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodriguez-Boulan and M&#x000fc;sch, 2005</xref>).</p><p>RICH2 interacts with the same region of the CD317 cytosolic domain that is recognized by &#x003bc;1 and &#x003bc;2. The interaction between the cytosolic domain of CD317 and RICH2 at the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells presumably masks the &#x003bc;1/&#x003bc;2-binding site on CD317, thereby preventing its internalization. This is consistent with our observation that CD317 is inefficiently internalized in polarized Caco-2 cells and that no intracellular pool of CD317 can be detected in polarized Caco-2 cells. It is also consistent with our observation that an intracellular pool of CD317 can be detected in RICH2 knockdown cells (this may well be because, in the absence of RICH2, &#x003bc;2 can bind to the cytosolic domain of CD317 and bring about endocytosis of CD317).</p><p>CD317 clearly plays a critical role in the organization of the cytoskeleton in polarized epithelial cells.
