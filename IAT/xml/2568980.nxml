TRAF4 is connected to assembled TJs in confluent epithelial cells, but accumulates in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus when TJs are open in isolated cells or EGTA-treated confluent cells. In vivo, TRAF4 is consistently found at TJs in normal human mammary epithelia as well as in well-differentiated in situ carcinomas. In contrast, TRAF4 is never localized at the plasma membrane of poorly-differentiated invasive carcinomas devoid of correct TJs, but is observed in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of the cancer cells. Moreover, TRAF4 TJ subcellular localization is remarkably dynamic. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments show that TRAF4 is highly mobile and shuttles between TJs and the cytoplasm. Finally, we show that intracellular TRAF4 potentiates ERK1/2 phosphorylation in proliferating HeLa cells, an epithelial cell line known to be devoid of TJs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Collectively, our data strongly support the new concept of TJs as a dynamic structure. Moreover, our results implicate TRAF4 in one of the emerging TJ-dependent signaling pathways that responds to cell polarity by regulating the cell proliferation/differentiation balance, and subsequently epithelium homeostasis. Drastic phenotypes or lethality in TRAF4-deficient mice and drosophila strongly argue in favor of such a function.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The compartmentalization-oriented architecture of the epithelia is a basic property of higher life forms. As cells assemble to form tissues, the organization of the plasma membrane becomes increasingly complex. Epithelial cells interact with each other via specialized cellular junctions that are critical for the normal development and function of the epithelia (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Knust1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Harder1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>). They include adherens junctions (AJ), desmosomes and tight junctions (TJ). TJs encircle cells at the apical end of the lateral membrane to form a paracellular diffusion barrier that regulates epithelial permeability, and an intramembrane diffusion barrier which restricts the apico-basolateral diffusion of membrane components. There are a plethora of mechanisms that control or are controlled by TJs. Thus, TJs have been shown to contribute to epithelial biogenesis and function by regulating cell proliferation, differentiation and polarisation. Moreover, it has been proposed that the assembly state of TJs acts as a sensor for cell density. This implies that TJs can regulate downstream signaling pathways via a multiprotein complex network that constitute the TJ plaque, a process just beginning to be understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Aijaz1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor family is composed of 6 members that share a TRAF domain (TRAF1 to TRAF6). They are adaptor/scaffold molecules that mainly interact with members of the interleukin-receptor (ILRs) or tumor necrosis factor-receptor (TNFRs) families and exhibit functions mostly in the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Chung1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Inoue1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. However, TRAF4 only weakly interacts with 3 members of TNF-R family, namely the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75-NGFR), the lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LT&#x000e2;R), and the glucocorticoid-induced TNF-R (GITR), and its involvement in immune system remains elusive (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Kedinger1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>). These data suggest that TRAF4 might rather be implicated in other biological processes. Different lines of evidence indicate that TRAF4 plays a key function. Indeed, mouse TRAF4 deficiency is embryonic lethal in approximately one third of the homozygote mutants. Surviving animals manifest numerous alterations, including important malformations in the trachea and the axial skeleton (ribs, sternum, tail), and defects in the neural tube closure giving rise to spina bifida phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Regnier1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, a null allele for DTRAF1, the drosophila homologue of TRAF4, is embryonic lethal for drosophila. DTRAF1 is indispensable for the development of imaginal eye discs and the formation of a correct photosensory neuronal array in the brain hemisphere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Cha1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, in the adult, constitutive basal level of TRAF4 expression is observed in most tissues, suggesting a generic biological function for this protein. Finally, TRAF4 has also been observed to be overexpressed in various human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Regnier2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-CamilleriBroet1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here, we show in vitro and in vivo that TRAF4 functions at the discrete TJ submembrane domain. Indeed, TRAF4 is observed at the TJ multiprotein complex areas. Moreover, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis show that association of TRAF4 with the TJ is not a stable event but a highly dynamic process. Thus, TRAF4 is a shuttling protein. These results prompted us to investigate the ability of TRAF4 to activate the ERK1/2 MAP kinase and Akt signaling pathways which have been shown to be down-regulated by functional TJs. When not associated with TJs, TRAF4 acts to increase ERK1/2 phosphorylation in proliferating but not confluent cells. Collectively, our results allow us to assign a biological function to the TRAF4 scaffold protein in favoring the ERK1/2 signalling pathway in response to cell polarity damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Endogenous TRAF4 is found in the plasma membrane, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of normal/immortalized human MCF10A confluent cells</title><p>To date, the sub-cellular TRAF4 localization pattern remains debated. In in vitro experiments, TRAF4 has been reported to localize at the cell membrane, in the cytoplasm, in perinuclear areas or in the nuclei (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Kedinger1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>).

TRAF4 was observed mainly in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003518-g003">Figure 3 A</xref>). In parallel, we performed similar experiments using MCF10A cells transiently transfected with a full-lenght TRAF4 fused to the Flag epitope at its amino-terminal (Flag-TRAF4 ; construct A). The pattern of Flag-TRAF4 was similar to that of endogeneous TRAF4 with the addition of a low nuclear staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003518-g003">Figure 3 B</xref>). We then studied TRAF4 localization in isolated MCF10A cells present in non-confluent culture. In this case, neither endogenous nor transfected Flag-TRAF4 proteins were found at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003518-g003">Figure 3 C and D</xref>), showing that cell-cell contacts are required for the recruitment of TRAF4 to the membrane. Moreover, a stronger cytoplasmic patched staining was observed in Flag-TRAF4 transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003518-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).

The combination of time-lapse imaging with FRAP enables the analysis of the kinetic properties of a given protein in living cells. As photobleaching is an irreversible process, fluorescence recovery comes from proteins already present in the cell. Thus, the recovery kinetics are dependent on the mobility of the protein of interest. Slow recovery indicates low mobility. Thus, we ask whether TJ association of TRAF4 is stable, or whether TRAF4 can dynamically move in and out of TJs. We therefore generated a EYFP tagged TRAF4 fluorescent protein (EYFP-TRAF4) to test the kinetics of TRAF4 recruitment to the TJs using the FRAP technique. MDCK cells were transfected with EYFP-TRAF4, allowed to polarize during 72 hours after transfection and then subjected to FRAP. In order to avoid visualization of intramembrane protein movements, all of the TJs of the cell were bleached. FRAP experiments showed that EYFP-TRAF4 rapidly recovers within the bleached area. Thus 50&#x00025; recovery (t1/2) is observed in 8.3 seconds indicating that TRAF4 is a highly mobile protein. The recovery curve reached a plateau at 75&#x00025; of the initial fluorescence of the pre-bleached area, indicating that only a small proportion of the TRAF4 protein was immobile (immobile fraction&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;24&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003518-g007">Figure 7 A</xref>). The cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity variations were also monitored in either bleached or unbleached cells.

Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt was tested by Western blots using antibodies specifically directed against the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 and Akt. Total ERK1/2 and Akt were detected using specific pan-antibodies. The Flag-TRAF4 was visualized using the 2H1 anti-TRAF4 antibody.

TJs assemble when epithelial cells reach high cell densities and adhere to each other, giving rise to well organized and differentiated functional polarized tissues. We showed that the TRAF domain of TRAF4 is indispensable for this localization. This particular sub-membrane localization of TRAF4 was unexpected as none of the putative TRAF4 partners identified until now corresponds to proteins already reported to be related to TJs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Harder1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Matter1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Saitoh1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

We therefore analyzed TRAF4 TJ addressing in FRAP experiments to track intracellular events in living cells.

Indeed, until now, the TJ was widely viewed as a static structure.

The mechanism of their shuttling is not clearly established. Since TRAF4 is also observed in the nucleus, most notably in invasive malignant tumors known to be devoid of TJs, a similar shuttling between TJs and nucleus cannot be excluded.

It has been proposed that the occludin TJ compound can directly interact with phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) to allow the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 2 phosphate (PIP2) into PIP3, and link TJs to lipid signaling, and indirectly, to the Akt pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Matter1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. However, TRAF4 overexpression does not induce Akt phosphorylation, indicating that TRAF4 is not involved in this pathway.

The best known effectors of Ras are the Raf kinases which stimulate cell cycle entry via ERK/MAPkinase activation, leading to anarchic cell proliferation in cancers. Interestingly, we showed in non-confluent epithelial HeLa cells devoid of TJs that TRAF4 overexpression increases ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that cytoplasmic TRAF4 can enhance this MAPK signaling. Similar TRAF4 activation of ERK1/2 MAPK was recently reported in endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Li1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this context, TRAF4 might contribute to signaling events via the ERK pathway when it is not engaged at TJs.

Thus, TRAF4 activity might be negatively regulated when connected to TJs. Since TRAF4 is never addressed to the plasma membrane in invasive carcinomas, it can be hypothesized that this function on ERK might be constitutively turn on in malignant conditions.</p><p>In conclusion, our collective results allow us to propose a cellular function for the TRAF4 scaffold protein in mediating plasma membrane dynamics in response to cell polarity damage to maintain cell proliferation/differentiation balance and therefore epithelium homeostasis.

After 24 hours, cells were washed in PBS, fixed for 5 minutes at room temperature in 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized 2 times for 10 minutes with 0.1&#x00025; Triton X-100 in PBS. To visualize endogenous TRAF4 with 2H1 antibody, cells were fixed in 50&#x00025; Methanol/50&#x00025; Acetone for 15 minutes at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C; no permeabilization was needed in this case. After blocking with 1&#x00025; BSA fraction V in PBS for 30 minutes, cells were incubated at room temperature with the primary antibodies 2H1 (1/500), anti-Flag (1/10000), anti-E-cadherin (1/250), anti-desmoplakin (1/5; Mannheim Boehringer, Germany), anti-occludin (1/250; Mannheim Boehringer, Germany), anti-ZO-1 (1/50; Zymed Laboratories Inc, CA), for 1 hour. Cells were washed 3 times in PBS and incubated for 1 hour with the appropriate secondary antibodies (1/400). Cy3- or Cy5-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA), Amersham Biosciences, and Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), respectively. Cells were washed 3 times in PBS, and nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 dye. Slides were mounted in Vectashield (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA).

MDCK cells were plated on glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA), transfected (JetPEI&#x02122; technic described above) with fluorescent EYFP-TRAF4. 72 hours later, the cells were incubated in a temperature controlled chamber (37&#x000b0;C), mounted on an inverted Leica SP2 AOBS MP microscope. Bleaching was done with an argon laser (458, 476, 488, 514 nm). Images were collected every 3.3 seconds during 150 s. Images were then averaged and the fluorescence intensity in the bleach zone was measured in the time series. The fluorescence intensity was corrected for background. The fluorescence signal was normalized to the change in total fluorescence using the following formula: Irel<sub>t</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;(T<sub>0</sub>&#x000d7;I<sub>t</sub>)/(T<sub>t</sub>&#x000d7;I<sub>0</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003518-Phair1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.
