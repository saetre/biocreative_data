Using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches we show that expression of the operon is regulated at the level of transcription elongation by a change in the structure of the leader mRNA which depends upon the presence of ribosomal protein L20. L20 binds to a phylogenetically conserved domain and provokes premature transcription termination at the leader terminator. Footprint and toeprint experiments support a regulatory model involving molecular mimicry between the L20-binding sites on 23S rRNA and the mRNA. Our data suggest that Nomura's model of ribosomal protein biosynthesis based on autogenous control and molecular mimicry is also valid in Gram-positive organisms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In prokaryotes, the genes for ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) are to a large extent clustered and, usually, expressed as operons. The regulation of r-protein biosynthesis has been well characterized in the Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In this organism, most ribosomal protein expression has been shown to be feedback regulated at the level of translation. One of the protein products of the operon acts as the key regulator. When it accumulates in amounts exceeding its available binding sites on nascent ribosomal particles, it binds to its own mRNA, at a site called the operator, causing translational repression of the first cistron. Repression is transmitted to the downstream cistrons by translational coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The r-proteins involved in this autoregulatory circuit in general are also able to bind to rRNA directly and this dual RNA-binding activity prompted Nomura and collaborators to propose the mimicry hypothesis of translational repression based on structurally similar mRNA- and rRNA-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). This model has been proven correct in several cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>) and explains how competition between mRNA and rRNA for binding r-proteins allows the bacterium to maintain the balance between r-protein and rRNA levels.</p><p>The primary sequences of r-proteins and to a significant extent even the genetic organization of their genes are well conserved between Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. For example, the largest r-protein gene cluster in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<italic>rif-str-spc</italic>) corresponds to a combination of the <italic>E. coli rif, str</italic> and <italic>spc</italic> clusters and contains a mixture of genes for the transcriptional and translational machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). However, the pattern of transcription and the regulatory mechanisms involved are different; e.g. in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> the S10 r-protein gene cluster seems to form a single 15-kb operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), which in <italic>E. coli</italic> corresponds to three separate transcriptional units, the S10, <italic>spc</italic> and &#x003b1; operons. Ribosomal protein L4 autoregulates the <italic>E. coli</italic> S10 operon at the translational level and by modulating transcription elongation via a mechanism which also requires NusA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, L4 is not involved in the control of the corresponding <italic>B. subtilis</italic> S10 operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus</italic> operons contain exactly the same r-protein genes with the single exception that the <italic>rpsD</italic> gene (S4) is absent from the S10-<italic>spc-alpha</italic> region in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Pointedly, it is S4 which controls the translation of the <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x003b1; operon. The <italic>Bacillus rpsD</italic> gene is monocistronic and autoregulates its own expression via a yet unknown post-transcriptional mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Thus, despite the fact that no details of the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of r-protein synthesis in Gram-positive organisms have yet been elucidated, available evidence suggests that these mechanisms are likely to be quite different from those observed in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>In this article, we focused our attention on the expression of the <italic>B. subtilis infC-rpmI-rplT</italic> gene cluster encoding translation initiation factor IF3 and the r-proteins L35 and L20, respectively. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, these genes form an operon which is regulated by two different control loops, both acting at the translational level. IF3 represses the expression of its own gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and the primary r-protein L20 (<italic>rplT</italic>) acts as a repressor of <italic>rpmI</italic> expression and indirectly downregulates its own expression through translational coupling with <italic>rpmI</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Autogenous control by L20 has been shown to involve mRNA-binding sites upstream of <italic>rpmI</italic> which are structurally similar to its binding site on 23S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) but we could not identify a similar site upstream of the <italic>B. subtilis rpmI</italic> gene. A recent computer-based search for potential attenuation mechanisms in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> had located a putative transcription terminator structure upstream of the <italic>infC</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) whose function is unknown.</p><p>Here, we show that the <italic>B. subtilis rpmI</italic> and <italic>rplT</italic> genes are co-transcribed with <italic>infC</italic> forming an operon which can also include a fourth gene (<italic>ysdA</italic>) of unknown function. Control of this operon involves a dedicated leader sequence upstream of <italic>infC</italic> which does not exist in <italic>E. coli</italic>. L20 can interact with an RNA structure which can fold within the leader and which is part of a complex structural arrangement similar to metabolite controlled riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). L20 acts as the effector molecule for the switch, so that its binding provokes premature transcription termination. We provide evidence that regulation by L20 is probably based on molecular mimicry between its mRNA and rRNA binding sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and culture</title><p>The <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strains used in this study are the prototrophic strain 168 1A2A (BGSC) and derivatives thereof containing an <italic>infC&#x02019;-&#x02018;lacZ</italic> translational fusion (pHMI3) or a Pspac <italic>infC-&#x02018;lacZ</italic> transcriptional fusion (plasmid pHMI10) integrated at the <italic>amyE</italic> locus. <italic>E. coli</italic> JM109 was used for plasmid constructions and <italic>E. coli</italic> JM101 was used to recover concatemeric plasmid forms.

In accordance, sigma A specific &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 promoter elements are found immediately upstream of this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Thus the <italic>infC</italic> mRNA is synthesized with a 201&#x02009;nt leader. Northern analysis using a 1.3-kb PCR fragment covering the three adjacent genes <italic>infC, rpmI</italic> and <italic>rplT</italic> detected a major transcript of 1.4&#x02009;kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). This mRNA corresponds well to a transcript terminated at an intrinsic transcription terminator located downstream of the <italic>rplT</italic> (1.36&#x02009;kb). A fourth open reading frame (<italic>ysdA</italic>), encoding a protein of unknown function, starts 60 nucleotides downstream of the <italic>rplT</italic> stop codon. A transcript including all four genes and extending to a second transcription terminator structure immediately downstream of <italic>ysdA</italic> would have a predicted length of 1.69&#x02009;kb, compatible with a minor mRNA species detected by northern analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Co-transcription of <italic>rplT</italic> and <italic>ysdA</italic> was confirmed by RT-PCR experiments (data not shown) and is corroborated by the absence of obvious promotor sequences between the two open reading frames. The four genes <italic>infC, rpmI, rplT</italic> and <italic>ysdA</italic> thus appear to form an operon transcribed from a single &#x003c3;A type promoter upstream of <italic>infC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). </p><p>The intergenic distance between <italic>B. subtilis infC</italic> and <italic>rpmI</italic> (12&#x02009;bp) is considerably shorter than that between the same genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> (96&#x02009;bp).

We thus focused our attention on the 201-bp leader region upstream of <italic>infC</italic> potentially implicated in the control of the expression of the four-gene operon.</p></sec><sec><title>The leader region of the <italic>infC</italic> operon contains conserved regulatory elements</title><p>A representative alignment of the sequences upstream of the <italic>infC</italic> gene from four Gram-positive organisms highlights the presence of two conserved elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) that are phylogenetically conserved in most low GC Gram-positive organisms. The first comprises a 25-nucleotide stretch, labeled &#x02018;conserved domain&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, positions 19&#x02013;43 of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> leader) and the second corresponds to a stem-loop structure followed by a polyT stretch typical of a factor independent transcription terminator. In the second case, the structure itself rather than the sequence is conserved. A comparison of the folding patterns of <italic>infC</italic> leader mRNAs from various Gram-positive organisms demonstrated the potential to form similar alternative structures which include the two conserved elements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> shows the alternative folding patterns of the <italic>B. subtilis infC</italic> leader mRNA generated by the M-Fold algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) which, with minor manual adjustments, represents a terminator and antiterminator configuration. The antiterminator configuration involves a long distance interaction between bases in the conserved domain and the 5&#x02032; side of the putative terminator hairpin, producing a structure which is reminiscent of metabolite controlled riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The significance of this observation is supported by the covariance, in different organisms, of the residues in the conserved domain and the terminator stem-loop which produce an equivalent structural switch. </p></sec><sec><title>The switch between termination and antitermination structures is functional <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>In order to demonstrate the functioning of the proposed alternative folding patterns in the <italic>infC</italic> leader, we performed single-round <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). With a wild-type template containing the promoter region and the entire <italic>infC</italic> leader, two different transcripts were obtained. One corresponds to the full-length transcript (200&#x02009;nts), and the shorter one (&#x0223c;140&#x02009;nts) is due to a premature transcription arrest at the intrinsic terminator structure. Under the conditions used, 53% of the transcripts were full length indicating that the terminator structure is functional but that about half of the transcripts escapes premature termination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, lane 1). The mutation called &#x02018;A&#x02019; on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> (C<sub>30</sub>C<sub>31</sub> &#x02192; GG) in the loop of the conserved domain should considerably decrease the stability of the proposed antiterminator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In agreement, premature termination of transcription occurred in 90% of the mutant transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, lane 2). The same result was obtained with mutation &#x02018;B&#x02019; (G<sub>111</sub>G<sub>112</sub> &#x02192; CC) in the terminator stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, lane 3). The concomitant transition C<sub>125</sub>C<sub>126</sub> &#x02192; GG was introduced solely to maintain base pairing of the terminator. The G<sub>111</sub>G<sub>112</sub> nucleotides are expected to base pair with C<sub>30</sub>C<sub>31</sub> in the antiterminator configuration and consequently have a similar effect on antiterminator formation as mutation A. Combining the A and B mutations restores base pairing within the antiterminator structure and leads to efficient read-through of the terminator to the same extent as observed with the wild-type template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, lane 4). These data suggest that the proposed switch in RNA structure is functional <italic>in vitro</italic> and necessary for avoiding premature termination of transcription at the <italic>infC</italic> leader terminator. </p></sec><sec><title>Formation of the antiterminator structure in the <italic>infC</italic> leader is required for normal expression <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>In order to verify whether the alternative RNA folding observed <italic>in vitro</italic> is significant for the regulation of the <italic>infC</italic> operon <italic>in vivo</italic> we analyzed the expression of translational <italic>lacZ</italic> fusions with the <italic>infC</italic> gene.

Expression of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity from both A and B mutant fusions is strongly decreased (22- and 12-fold, respectively, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) compared to the wild-type fusion.

We therefore decided in an initial screen to test the nucleotides ATP, GTP and (p)ppGpp for their capacity to alter premature termination at the <italic>infC</italic> leader terminator in single-round <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays. These metabolites are crucial co-factors in the translational process and their concentrations reflect the metabolic state of the cell. During the elongation phase of the assay, ATP and GTP (possible activators) were added in the 0.5&#x02013;5&#x02009;mM range and ppGpp (possible repressor) between 50 and 200&#x02009;&#x000b5;M, while keeping all other nucleotides constant at 25&#x02009;&#x000b5;M. In addition, the expression of an <italic>infC-lacZ</italic> fusion was compared in a wild-type and <italic>relA</italic> mutant strain following induction of the stringent response. None of these experiments revealed any role of these metabolites in the control of the <italic>infC</italic> operon (data not shown).</p><p>We then tested for a potential regulatory role of L20, the only primary ribosomal protein (i.e. r-protein binding directly to rRNA) of the operon. Single-round <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays were performed on a wild-type template in the presence or absence of purified L20 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). The addition of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> L20 or the C-terminal half of the <italic>E. coli</italic> L20 protein, which is sufficient for autogenous control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), clearly inhibited transcription elongation beyond the leader terminator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Since basic proteins like L20 might have a tendency to bind RNA nonspecifically we also tested the almost equally basic <italic>B. subtilis</italic> r-protein L17 and showed that it does not alter transcriptional termination as compared to a control reaction in the absence of exogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lane 4).</p></sec><sec><title>Ribosomal protein L20 causes premature transcription termination <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>We tested the autoregulatory potential of L20 <italic>in vivo</italic> by overexpressing it from a plasmid-borne IPTG inducible <italic>rplT</italic> gene copy. An 8-fold overexpression of L20 (estimated by western analysis) from the recombinant plasmid pHML17 caused a 3-fold repression of a wild-type transcriptional <italic>infC-lacZ</italic> fusion (data not shown). However, under these conditions cell growth was also slowed down 2- to 3-fold making it difficult to distinguish between a specific L20 related effect and a more general growth-rate-related repression. In order to reduce the high &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity from a continuously expressed <italic>lacZ</italic> fusion, we opted for an experimental system where the expression of the <italic>infC-lacZ</italic> fusion was inducible. For that purpose the wild-type promoter of the <italic>infC-lacZ</italic> fusion was replaced with the inducible Pspac promoter. Addition of IPTG thus simultaneously induces the expression of the <italic>infC-lacZ</italic> fusion and that of <italic>rplT</italic> from the recombinant plasmid so that we measured an effect of L20 on the &#x02018;initial rate&#x02019; of &#x003b2;-galactosidase synthesis. After a 20-min expression period, during which cell growth was not significantly affected, we observed a 7-fold reduction in &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression when the <italic>rplT</italic> gene was overexpressed compared to a control strain harboring the parental plasmid (1.5&#x02009;U/mg versus 10&#x02009;U/mg of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity). This indicates that ribosomal protein L20 can act as a repressor <italic>in vivo</italic> and corroborates the <italic>in vitro</italic> data described above.</p><p>We used the same conditions of L20 overexpression as described above (induction for 20&#x02009;min) to analyze its effect on the transcription profile of the wild-type <italic>infC</italic> operon. The results of the northern analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and demonstrate that autogenous repression is caused by premature transcription termination. L20 overproduction (8-fold) from the recombinant plasmid caused a decrease in the amount of read-through transcription from 83% in the uninduced strain to 11% and a concomitant increase in prematurely terminated transcripts. Unexpectedly most of these terminated transcripts were actually shorter than the mRNA ending at the leader terminator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). We further analyzed these transcripts by northern using several oligonucleotide probes complementary to different regions of the <italic>infC</italic> leader to identify which region of the <italic>infC</italic> leader the truncated transcript corresponds to. Only probes which are specific for the 5&#x02032; half of the <italic>infC</italic> leader hybridized to the short transcript. As an example the northern blot using the oligonucleotide probe HP1080 which is complementary to positions +8 to +34 of the <italic>infC</italic> leader is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B. The shorter leader transcript, which is formed in the presence of L20, is detected with the promoter proximal oligonucleotide probe showing that it starts at the original 5&#x02032; end and extends to about 80&#x02009;nt which places its 3&#x02032; end a few nucleotides downstream of the second stem-loop structure which is part of the conserved domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Preliminary data obtained with different endoribonuclease mutants suggest that the small transcript is generated from the normally terminated leader transcript through endonucleolytic processing by RNases J1 or J2 or both ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), data not shown). </p></sec><sec><title>Control of terminator read-through by L20 likely involves molecular mimicry between mRNA and rRNA</title><p>A close analysis of the leader mRNA in the terminator conformation revealed another potentially important secondary structure. The first two (major) helices in the 5&#x02032; half of the <italic>infC</italic> leader (positions 19&#x02013;71) including the conserved domain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) resemble the L20-binding site on eubacterial 23S rRNA. This is most apparent when this region is redrawn as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>. High-resolution ribosome structures from a Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) localized the L20-binding site to the interhelical junction of helices 40 and 41 in 23S rRNA. In addition, a phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) identified two conserved adenosine residues (positions 19 and 20 in the <italic>infC</italic> leader) adjacent to the upper helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). </p><p>Binding of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> L20 to the <italic>infC</italic> leader structure depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> is an attractive hypothesis to explain its role as a repressor of transcription elongation. In fact, L20 binding should stabilize the terminator conformation by inhibiting the formation of the competing antiterminator structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In order to determine which region of the <italic>infC</italic> leader is recognized by L20 we performed footprint experiments using RNase V1 which cleaves double-stranded RNA and RNase T1 which cleaves single-stranded RNA 3&#x02032; to G residues. The <italic>infC</italic> leader transcript (positions 1&#x02013;168) was digested with either RNase V1 or RNase T1 in the presence or absence of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> L20, and the cleavages were located by primer extension on the cleaved product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B) or analyzed directly on a gel using a 5&#x02032; end labeled transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). We observed multiple protections from cleavage by RNase V1 within the conserved 5&#x02032; domain (5&#x02032; helix) and the interhelical junction between the 5&#x02032; and the adjacent 3&#x02032; helix when the <italic>infC</italic> leader mRNA was incubated in the presence of purified <italic>B. subtilis</italic> L20 protein prior to addition of the RNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, blue arrows positions 1&#x02013;3). Binding of L20 also leads to a stabilization of the 3&#x02032; adjacent helix as judged by the appearance of strong RNase V1 cleavages under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, red arrows, positions 4,5). As expected, no significant alterations of the RNase cleavage pattern was observed for the 3&#x02032; half of the <italic>infC</italic> leader which contains the terminator structure (positions 8&#x02013;12). This suggests that L20 actually binds to the region resembling the 23S rRNA-binding site illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> that in the context of the regulatory mechanism described here can also be considered as an anti-antiterminator structure. </p><p>We then carried out a toeprint experiment and, in the presence of L20, observed a single strong stop signal at position U72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This signal is completely absent in control reactions without added proteins or in the presence of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ribosomal protein L17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3). This result corroborates the RNase probing data and indicates that L20 binds in the region covering the conserved domain and the lower half of the 3&#x02032; adjacent helix. The integrity of the two helices is probably crucial for the binding of L20 as can be inferred from studies on the <italic>E. coli</italic> translational operator upstream of the <italic>rpmI</italic> (L35) gene which also binds L20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). We introduced a double mutation called &#x02018;C&#x02019; (C<sub>41</sub>C<sub>42</sub> &#x02192; GG, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) in order to destabilize the 3&#x02032; helix. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> (lanes 4 and 5) L20 is no longer able to induce the reverse transcription arrest observed with the wild-type substrate. </p><p>In conclusion, our data suggest that binding of L20 to the <italic>infC</italic> leader within the phylogenetically conserved region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) probably involves molecular mimicry between rRNA and mRNA structures recognized by the protein.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The data presented here describe the first molecular mechanism controlling the expression of ribosomal proteins in a Gram-positive bacterium. As already suggested by the observed autoregulation of the monocistronic <italic>rpsD</italic> (S4) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), the general principle of autogenous control of ribosomal protein biosynthesis, as observed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, appears to be maintained in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. However, at the molecular level the mechanisms involved in this regulation turn out to be quite different.</p><sec><title>L20-mediated autogenous control probably involves molecular mimicry</title><p>The presence of purified <italic>B. subtilis</italic> L20 protein in single-round transcription assays greatly stimulates premature transcription termination at the leader terminator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Addition of the C-terminal half of <italic>E. coli</italic> L20 containing the 23S rRNA-binding domain has the same effect. This observation suggests that both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> L20 proteins are recognizing a sequence similar to their primary binding site on 23S rRNA. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, a region encompassing two helices including the conserved domain near the 5&#x02032; end of the <italic>infC</italic> leader (referred to as the operator) strongly resembles the L20-binding site on the <italic>E. coli</italic> 23S rRNA. L20 essentially recognizes the interhelical region between helices 40 and 41 on 23S rRNA that is almost identical in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Footprint experiments located the L20-binding site between the two helices that constitute the proposed operator region. The 5&#x02032; helix containing the phylogenetically conserved sequence is well protected by the binding of L20 as can be concluded by the reduction of RNase V1 cleavages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, the 3&#x02032; helix is stabilized as indicated by the appearance of strong RNase V1 cleavages in the upper part of the helix. This suggests that L20 actually binds to both helices. We observed no significant changes in the cleavage patterns in other regions of the <italic>infC</italic> leader mRNA which suggests that the proposed operator is the principal site that is recognized by L20. The toeprint signal observed immediately downstream of the 3&#x02032; helix in the presence of L20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>) confirms the notion that the binding of L20 stabilizes the 3&#x02032; helix. The toeprint was abolished when the 3&#x02032; helix was destabilized by mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). However, we cannot distinguish whether L20 actually needs a fully base-paired 3&#x02032; helix for binding or if it can still recognize the operator in the mutant construct but that the interaction between L20 and the operator is not strong enough to block reverse transcriptase.</p><p>A recent phylogenetic comparison of the <italic>E. coli</italic> translational operator upstream of <italic>rpmI</italic> and eubacterial 23S rRNA suggested some structural requirements for L20 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The basic requirements consist of two adjacent helices, connected by an internal loop with no strict topology but containing two unpaired A residues immediately 5&#x02032; to the upper helix. The primary sequence and length of the internal loop show no conservation except for the two conserved A nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). This suggests that the open configuration of the <italic>Bacillus</italic> operator without a bulge loop connecting the two helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), also allows L20 binding. The high-resolution 3D structure of the <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) revealed that L20 interacts primarily with the phosphodiester backbone around the junction of helices 40 and 41. This explains the requirement for both stems to form and is consistent with our observation that L20 no longer constitutes a &#x02018;road block&#x02019; for reverse transcriptase when the base of the lower helix is destabilized by mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>It should be mentioned that the correct folding of the operator domain is extremely sensitive to alterations of its base composition. We have tried to introduce single base substitutions at the putative L20-binding site to further validate the proposed model. However, these experiments would only be conclusive if complementary changes that restore base pairing also enable the correct folding of the operator. This is not the case, even complementary base changes in this region lead to a complete rearrangement of the local secondary structure when analyzed by the M-fold algorithm (data not shown). For this reason we have not included more data on operator mutations.</p><p>The &#x02018;conserved domain&#x02019; primary sequence spanning 26 bases near the 5&#x02032; end of the <italic>infC</italic> leader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) is an integral part of the operator, forming essentially the upper helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Given the extent of sequence conservation in diverse organisms within the firmicutes it cannot be excluded that the primary sequence of the upstream domain might also be important for the binding of L20 to the <italic>infC</italic> operator.</p><p>Our data suggest a regulatory model based on molecular mimicry between the L20-binding sites on ribosomal and messenger RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). When rRNA is synthesized at high rate (i.e. rapid growth) L20 is titrated by rRNA leaving little protein available for binding to the operator. On the contrary, when the rRNA concentration decreases excess L20 will bind to the operator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A). This renders the nucleotides necessary for the long-range antiterminator interaction inaccessible thereby provoking premature transcription termination. Thus, the operator can also be viewed as an anti-antiterminator, a secondary structure trapped by the binding of L20, hence favoring termination. </p><p>The regulatory model implies that the default state of the transcription attenuation system is read-through. In fact, expression of <italic>infC-lacZ</italic> fusions is greatly reduced in mutant constructs affecting the formation of the antiterminator (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, efficient read-through of the terminator is also observed in <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays in the absence of exogenous L20. Under these conditions the operator is free to engage in a long-range base-pair interaction with the 5&#x02032; half of the terminator stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B). The existence of this antiterminator structure is consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> effects of complementary mutations which maintain the proposed interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The antiterminator is thermodynamically slightly more stable than the terminator (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic> values of &#x02212;16.9 versus &#x02212;15&#x02009;kcal/mol for the respective helices) but more importantly its formation is kinetically favored (it can form before transcription of the terminator structure is complete).</p><p>Based on sequence comparisons and analysis of alternative folding patterns we found that the control system identified in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is probably also operative in most low GC Gram-positive bacteria. The phylogenetically most conserved element is the operator itself which corroborates the regulatory model presented here.</p><p>Molecular mimicry involving ribosomal protein L20 seems to constitute an important aspect in the regulation of the <italic>rpmI-rplT</italic> operon in both <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> even though the control mechanisms are totally different in the two organisms. Nomura's model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) of the regulation of r-protein biosynthesis based on autogenous control and molecular mimicry is thus valid not only in <italic>E. coli</italic> but also in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and probably other Gram-positive organisms as well. However, while in the original model autocontrol was proposed to take place at the translational level, the mechanism decribed here shows that ribosomal protein expression can also be regulated effectively at the level of transcription. Our data seem to confirm that the concept of molecular mimicry albeit based only on a few examples is very powerful and capable of being integrated into a wide variety of control mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>A regulatory mechanism that controls the entire operon</title><p>Since all four genes of the <italic>Bacillus infC</italic> operon are co-transcribed from a single promoter this implies that L20-mediated control influences the expression of the entire operon, <italic>infC, rpmI, rplT</italic> and <italic>ysdA</italic>. However with very few exceptions (e.g. <italic>Oceanobacillus</italic>) the <italic>ysdA</italic> gene is not conserved as part of the <italic>infC</italic> operon even in closely related species and in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> the short intergenic region between the <italic>rplT</italic> and <italic>ysdA</italic> genes contains a sequence capable of folding into an intrinsic transcription terminator. The YsdA protein has no assigned or suspected function. Using the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> YsdA protein sequence for a BLAST search we found orthologs essentially in <italic>Bacilli, Clostridia</italic> and proteobacteria but also in some <italic>Euryarcheota</italic> and <italic>Dyctostelium</italic>. In many cases, most notably in the <italic>beta</italic>-, <italic>gamma</italic>- and <italic>delta</italic>-subfamilies of the proteobacteria the <italic>ysdA</italic> ortholog is part of a larger protein predicted to have nucleic-acid-binding characteristics.</p><p>In <italic>E. coli</italic> translational feedback regulation by L20 only represses the expression of the gene for L35 (<italic>rpmI</italic>) and that of its own gene by translational coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In principle, it makes sense to co-regulate the expression of translation factor IF3 (<italic>infC</italic>) and ribosomal proteins; efficient translation of proteins requires a good coordination of the synthesis of ribosomes and translation factors. However, the latter are present in the cell at 0.2&#x02013;0.3 molecules per ribosome that is enough to saturate free 30S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The <italic>B. subtilis infC</italic> gene like that of <italic>E. coli</italic> has an atypical AUU start codon which, at least in <italic>E. coli</italic>, is sufficient to autoregulate its translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). It is possible but remains to be verified whether the <italic>B. subtilis infC</italic> gene is also subject to translational autoregulation. This would allow to fine-tune the biosynthesis of IF3 independently of the downstream <italic>rpmI</italic> (L35) and <italic>rplT</italic>(L20) genes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank J.
