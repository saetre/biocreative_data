Within the tumor microenvironment, the secreted protein milk fat globule epidermal growth factor&#x02013;8 (MFG-E8) stimulates disease progression through coordinated &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin signaling in tumor and host cells. MFG-E8 enhances tumor cell survival, invasion, and angiogenesis, and contributes to local immune suppression. We show that systemic MFG-E8 blockade cooperates with cytotoxic chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapy, and radiation therapy to induce destruction of various types of established mouse tumors. The combination treatments evoke extensive tumor cell apoptosis that is coupled to efficient dendritic cell cross-presentation of dying tumor cells. This linkage engenders potent antitumor effector T cells but inhibits FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T reg cells, thereby achieving long-term protective immunity. Collectively, these findings suggest that systemic MFG-E8 blockade might intensify the antitumor activities of existing therapeutic regimens through coordinated cell-autonomous and immune-mediated mechanisms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Cancer pathogenesis involves not only the cell-autonomous defects that arise from alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors but also the impact of host antitumor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Cancer cells that have escaped immune control are selected for the ability to exploit factors present in the tumor microenvironment to further disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Among this array of soluble moieties, inflammatory cytokines including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IL-1&#x003b2; play key roles through triggering NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;, STAT-3&#x02013;, and MyD88-dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>GM-CSF is another cytokine frequently produced in the tumor microenvironment, where it may contribute to either tumor protection or promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Through studies of GM-CSF&#x02013;deficient mice, we identified milk fat globule epidermal growth factor&#x02013;8 (MFG-E8) as a critical determinant of the pro- and antiinflammatory activities of the cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). MFG-E8 is a secreted phosphatidylserine-binding protein that signals through &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> and &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>5</sub> integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Under steady-state conditions, GM-CSF induces MFG-E8 expression in mononuclear phagocytes, enabling the efficient uptake of apoptotic cells, the production of TGF-&#x003b2; and CCL22, and the maintenance of FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T reg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Under conditions of cellular stress, however, the ligation of Toll-like receptors dampens MFG-E8 expression, whereupon GM-CSF elicits CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells through an MFG-E8&#x02013;independent pathway. Thus, the levels of MFG-E8 present in the tumor microenvironment might modulate the functions of GM-CSF during carcinogenesis.</p><p>In malignant melanoma, MFG-E8 expression is increased in tumor cells and/or infiltrating myeloid elements upon progression to the vertical growth phase, the stage in which melanoma cells acquire the competence for invasion and dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). In a mouse melanoma model, MFG-E8 augmented tumorigenicity and metastatic capability through Akt- and Twist-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). MFG-E8 enhanced melanoma cell resistance to apoptosis, induced an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and stimulated invasion and angiogenesis. MFG-E8 also contributed to local immune suppression by evoking FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T reg cell infiltrates and suppressing Th1 reactions and NK and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cytotoxicity.</p><p>Because MFG-E8 is expressed at high levels in diverse tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), including melanoma, this soluble protein might serve as a general target for cancer therapy. In contrast to most oncologic treatments, which primarily address either the tumor or host separately, MFG-E8 antagonists might affect both compartments. Indeed, shRNA knockdowns of MFG-E8 sensitized tumor cells to cytotoxic agents and small molecule inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases in vitro, whereas MFG-E8 blockade with a dominant-negative mutant potentiated tumor immunity generated with irradiated, GM-CSF&#x02013;secreting tumor cell vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Based on these results, we hypothesized that systemic targeting of MFG-E8 might contribute to tumor destruction in several complementary ways. In this paper, we show that antibodies to MFG-E8 cooperate with conventional cancer therapies to effectuate sustained control of established mouse tumors through the coupling of cell-autonomous and host-mediated pathways.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Combinatorial therapy with systemic MFG-E8 blockade</title><p>To explore the therapeutic potential of anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 antibodies, we first characterized the moderately immunogenic MC38 colon carcinoma model that is syngeneic to C57BL/6 mice. At 10 d after intradermal inoculation, when tumors were well established (&#x0223c;25 mm<sup>2</sup>), the systemic administration of gemcitabine, a cytotoxic agent with modest activity in patients with colon carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), afforded a small delay in MC38 tumor growth in a dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Although a blocking anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 mAb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) displayed minimal antitumor activity when infused alone, combination treatment with gemcitabine resulted in tumor regressions that were sustained throughout the duration of the study (4 mo). A rabbit polyclonal anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) showed comparable efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), whereas an isotype control mAb was inactive (not depicted), establishing the specificity of the response. Synergistic antitumor effects were also obtained when the anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 antibodies were administered beginning 3 or 7 d after gemcitabine but not when infused before chemotherapy, indicating that the sequence of the combination was important for activity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082614/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>MFG-E8 antibody blockade synergizes with cytotoxic therapies to mediate tumor destruction.</bold> (A) Established MC38 carcinomas (25 mm<sup>2</sup>) were treated with systemic gemcitabine (GEM) and/or an anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 mAb, as indicated.

As with gemcitabine, these combination therapies achieved prolonged tumor control, in contrast to the limited impact of individual agents. MFG-E8 blockade also intensified the activity of an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor and an antivascular endothelial growth factor receptor&#x02013;2 (VEGFR-2) mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Additionally, a short course of radiation therapy directed toward subcutaneous MC38 lesions was rendered more efficacious when combined with anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Synergistic effects of anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 antibodies and chemotherapy were similarly observed in the poorly immunogenic B16 melanoma model. In this system, combinations of MFG-E8 blockade with doxorubicin, etoposide, or dacarbazine achieved significant tumor control, although gemcitabine proved inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref> and not depicted). Moreover, the combined administration of anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 antibodies and doxorubicin also triggered the destruction of established EL-4 thymomas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082614/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). Collectively, these experiments reveal the ability of systemic MFG-E8 blockade to intensify the antitumor effects of conventional oncologic therapies in diverse tumor models.</p></sec><sec><title>MFG-E8 blockade enhances drug-induced apoptosis</title><p>Because standard cancer treatments displayed only modest single-agent activity against various types of tumors, we wondered whether the anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 antibodies might modulate tumor cell killing. In this context, we previously showed that MFG-E8 triggered Akt activation in tumor cells through &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin signaling, which resulted in an attenuation of etoposide-induced death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). In accordance with these findings, MFG-E8 was not detectable in MC38 and B16 cells at baseline, whereas cells that survived an overnight exposure to diverse chemotherapeutic drugs manifested significant MFG-E8 expression, which was evident intracellularly, at the surface membrane, and in culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>; and not depicted). &#x003b3; irradiation also induced MFG-E8 surface expression on EL-4 thymoma (EG.7-OVA) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Furthermore, stable drug-resistant variants of MC38 cells, which were generated through prolonged exposure to escalating concentrations of gemcitabine, CPT-11, or 5-FU in vitro, and similarly derived doxorubicin-resistant B16 cells demonstrated much higher levels of MFG-E8 compared with the parental tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref> and not depicted).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Drug-resistant tumor cells express MFG-E8.</bold> (A) MC38 carcinoma and B16 melanoma cells were treated with various cytotoxic agents under serum-free condition for 24 h, and intracellular MFG-E8 expression in viable cells (annexin V<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/propidium iodide<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) was determined with flow cytometry.

The addition of rabbit polyclonal anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 serum manifested comparable effects (unpublished data). The induction of apoptosis with the combined therapy also resulted in a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (unpublished data). Moreover, the combination therapies triggered increased levels of tumor apoptosis in vivo. MC38 tumors harvested from mice that received gemcitabine plus anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 antibodies showed enhanced caspase 3 activation as compared with tumors isolated from mice treated with either agent alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Similarly, B16 melanomas manifested elevated caspase 3 activation after combined dacarbazine and MFG-E8 blockade. These results support the idea that MFG-E8 blockade compromises tumor cell viability in a cell-autonomous fashion, although the increased caspase activation in vivo might partially reflect the death of stromal elements within the tumor microenvironment. The anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 antibodies may also attenuate tumor angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), which might contribute to tumor cell death as well. Collectively, these results reveal a role for MFG-E8 in mediating resistance to cytotoxic therapy and suggest that anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 antibodies might serve as a complementary strategy to intensify drug-induced tumor cell killing.</p></sec><sec><title>Combinatorial therapy with MFG-E8 blockade stimulates T cell immunity</title><p>Because MFG-E8 plays a key role in T reg cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), we investigated whether the antitumor activities of combined chemotherapy and MFG-E8 blockade might also involve host immunity. In accordance with this idea, anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 antibodies failed to increase the minimal killing of MC38 cells achieved with gemcitabine in immunodeficient nonobese diabetic&#x02013;severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Moreover, antibody depletion experiments established that CD8<sup>+</sup> and to a lesser extent CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but not NK cells, were required in wild-type mice for tumor destruction with the combination therapy, although the antitumor effects became significant compared with gemcitabine alone 40 d after combined therapy even with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). These findings suggest that the cell autonomous modes of tumor cell killing with MFG-E8 blockade are not sufficient to maintain durable control of the established cancers. Consistent with a key role for T cells in the generation of long-lived and specific protective immunity, treated mice rejected a subsequent lethal challenge with MC38 tumor cells but not B16 melanoma or MCA-205 fibrosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>The therapeutic activity of MFG-E8 antibody blockade and chemotherapy involves host immunity.</bold> (A) NOD-SCID mice harboring established MC38 carcinomas (25 mm<sup>2</sup>) were treated with systemic GEM and anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 mAb.

Small molecule inhibitors of oncogenic tyrosine kinases and antibody blockade of VEGF serve as prototypes of rationally designed agents that antagonize major pathogenic mechanisms in cancer cells and the host, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). Although these treatments afford important clinical benefits, most patients achieve only partial responses and eventually succumb to progressive disease caused by the emergence of drug-resistant variants. However, analogous to the ways in which antimicrobial agents cooperate with host reactions to effectuate sterilizing immunity for some serious infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), cancer treatments might be significantly improved through concurrently targeting the tumor and host. The results presented in this paper illustrate the potential for systemic MFG-E8 antibody blockade in combination with conventional oncologic therapies to accomplish this dual targeting.</p><p>MFG-E8 promotes cancer progression through coordinated &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin signaling in tumor cells, vascular elements, and infiltrating myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Although the administration of anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 antibodies alone resulted in only modest tumor destruction and immune stimulation, the coupling of drug-induced tumor cell death to MFG-E8 blockade effectuated the sustained regressions of established colon carcinomas, melanomas, and lymphomas. A key component of this therapeutic synergy is the ability of anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 antibodies to attenuate tumor cell resistance to cytotoxic treatments, likely because of the inhibition of Akt activation. Some degree of intrinsic tumor cell sensitivity to the cytotoxic agent appears necessary for this enhancement, though, because gemcitabine, which failed to provoke B16 cell death in vitro (unpublished data), proved inactive in vivo in combination with MFG-E8 blockade. An additional mechanism by which anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 antibodies might increase tumor cell killing, particularly in conjunction with anti&#x02013;VEGFR-2 antibodies, may involve a more robust inhibition of the tumor blood supply, as MFG-E8 is required for VEGF-induced angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Moreover, knockdown of MFG-E8 in MC38 carcinoma cells exposed to chemotherapy also reduced VEGF production (unpublished data).</p><p>Upon the induction of tumor cell death in vivo with cytotoxic treatments, MFG-E8 blockade favored the establishment of an immunogenic tumor microenvironment. This conversion reflected the dual capacity of anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 antibodies to antagonize &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin&#x02013;driven immune suppression and to promote efficient Fc receptor&#x02013;mediated dendritic cell cross-presentation. In this context, recent analysis of mice harboring a myeloid cell&#x02013;specific KO of &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub> integrins has underscored the importance of this receptor in attenuating inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), perhaps through the induction of Twist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), an antagonist of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Consistent with these results, we found that MFG-E8 blockade resulted in increased IL-12 production. This proinflammatory cytokine contributed to tumor protection, as revealed through studies of p35-deficient mice, although other factors such as IL-23, TNF-&#x003b1;, and type I IFNs may play important roles as well. Accumulating evidence has also highlighted the ability of mAbs to opsonize tumor cells for efficient cross-presentation by dendritic cells, thereby engendering potent antitumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Collectively, these factors may promote the development of dense intratumoral infiltrates composed of abundant CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells but only limited FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T reg cells. It is tempting to speculate that this broad T cell response may suppress the emergence of drug-resistant tumor cells and mediate long-term protection against tumor recurrence. In accordance with this idea, previous experimental and clinical studies have shown that a high ratio of effector T cells to T reg cells is tightly linked with sustained tumor destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>).</p><p>Recent work has illustrated that some cytotoxic therapies, including anthracyclines and taxanes, may induce a form of immunogenic cell death in which the release of calreticulin and high mobility group box 1 from dying tumor cells serves as an innate activating signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Cytotoxic therapies may additionally trigger the DNA damage response to up-regulate tumor cell expression of NKG2D ligands, thereby eliciting NK and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Moreover, agonistic antibodies to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors, which are frequently expressed on cancer cells, mediate potent antitumor effects in association with other immunotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Our results elucidate several novel antitumor mechanisms through which systemic MFG-E8 blockade may potentiate the efficacy of conventional oncologic therapies by coordinately targeting tumor cells and components of the tumor microenvironment. Perhaps the coupling of anti&#x02013;MFG-E8 antibodies to tumor cell death might be considered a new strategy for in vivo cancer vaccination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>C57BL/6, NOD-SCID, and OVA transgenic OT-II mice were obtained from SRL or the Jackson Laboratory and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions.
