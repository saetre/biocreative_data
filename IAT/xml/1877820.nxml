We describe five individuals who share phenotypically related CNS malformations and in some cases urinary tract defects, and also haploinsufficiency for the <italic>NFIA</italic> transcription factor gene due to chromosomal translocation or deletion. Two individuals have balanced translocations that disrupt <italic>NFIA</italic>. A third individual and two half-siblings in an unrelated family have interstitial microdeletions that include <italic>NFIA</italic>. All five individuals exhibit similar CNS malformations consisting of a thin, hypoplastic, or absent corpus callosum, and hydrocephalus or ventriculomegaly. The majority of these individuals also exhibit Chiari type I malformation, tethered spinal cord, and urinary tract defects that include vesicoureteral reflux. Other genes are also broken or deleted in all five individuals, and may contribute to the phenotype. However, the only common genetic defect is <italic>NFIA</italic> haploinsufficiency. In addition, previous analyses of <italic>Nfia<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> knockout mice indicate that <italic>Nfia</italic> deficiency also results in hydrocephalus and agenesis of the corpus callosum. Further investigation of the mouse <italic>Nfia</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Nfia</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> phenotypes now reveals that, at reduced penetrance, <italic>Nfia</italic> is also required in a dosage-sensitive manner for ureteral and renal development. <italic>Nfia</italic> is expressed in the developing ureter and metanephric mesenchyme, and <italic>Nfia</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Nfia</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibit abnormalities of the ureteropelvic and ureterovesical junctions, as well as bifid and megaureter. Collectively, the mouse <italic>Nfia</italic> mutant phenotype and the common features among these five human cases indicate that <italic>NFIA</italic> haploinsufficiency contributes to a novel human CNS malformation syndrome that can also include ureteral and renal defects.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Central nervous system (CNS) and urinary tract abnormalities are common human malformations, but their variability and genetic complexity make it difficult to identify the responsible genes. Analysis of human chromosomal abnormalities associated with such disorders offers one approach to this problem. In five individuals described herein, a novel human syndrome that involves both CNS and urinary tract defects is associated with chromosomal disruption or deletion of <italic>NFIA</italic>, encoding a member of the Nuclear Factor I (NFI) family of transcription factors. This syndrome includes brain abnormalities (abnormal corpus callosum, hydrocephalus, ventriculomegaly, and Chiari type I malformation), spinal abnormalities (tethered spinal cord), and urinary tract abnormalities (vesicoureteral reflux). <italic>Nfia</italic> disruption in mice was already known to cause hydrocephalus and abnormal corpus callosum, and is now shown to exhibit renal defects and disturbed ureteral development. Other genes besides <italic>NFIA</italic> are also disrupted or deleted and may contribute to the observed phenotype. However, loss of one copy of <italic>NFIA</italic> is the only genetic defect common to all five patients. The authors thus provide evidence that genetic loss of <italic>NFIA</italic> contributes to a distinct CNS malformation syndrome with urinary tract defects of variable penetrance.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Lu W, Quintero-Rivera F, Fan Y, Alkuraya FS, Donovan DJ, et al (2007) <italic>NFIA</italic> haploinsufficiency is associated with a CNS malformation syndrome and urinary tract defects.

In many cases, congenital birth defects are believed to result from the combined effect of many genes, often with an environmental contribution, and frequently culminate in perinatal demise. Thus, for many cases, extended families do not exist, and approaches to disease gene identification based on linkage analysis are not possible. In addition, many developmental disorders are genetically heterogeneous, making the ascertainment of single contributory genes difficult.</p><p>The analysis of human balanced chromosome rearrangements offers a potential approach to this problem. Although unforeseen rearrangements and position effects may supervene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;, and a background rate of birth defects exists, human translocations provide powerful tools to identify genes that are essential to human development. Translocations may result in haploinsufficiency, the generation of fusion transcripts, or position effects, or act in combination with a second loss-of-function allele. The Developmental Genome Anatomy Project, DGAP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dgap.harvard.edu">http://dgap.harvard.edu</ext-link>), has as its specific goal the ascertainment, recruitment, and analysis of individuals with chromosomal rearrangements and developmental disorders. A conspicuous class of such disorders is that involving the formation of the CNS and visceral organs.</p><p>Within the CNS, the corpus callosum is the largest interconnecting white matter tract in the brain, and it connects the association fibers of both hemispheres. Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is among the most common brain malformations in humans, with an incidence of 1 per 4,000 live births &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b003">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; and a prevalence as high as 3&#x00025;&#x02013;5&#x00025; in individuals with neurodevelopmental disabilities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. In human embryos, the corpus callosum begins to develop at 11&#x02013;12 wk gestation when the first fibers cross the midline to form the genu in the region of the commissural plate, and subsequent development proceeds from anterior to posterior, with formation of the anterior body, posterior body, and splenium, followed by a progressive enlargement that reflects the rapid expansion of the cerebral hemispheres &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Abnormalities of the corpus callosum can occur through a number of mechanisms, including defects in the genesis or survival of neuronal cells whose axons form the corpus callosum, and defects in axonal outgrowth, pathfinding, and midline crossing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. The etiology of ACC is thus heterogeneous and multifactorial, and both autosomal recessive and X-linked recessive mechanisms have been described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; (see also Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man &#x0005b;OMIM, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db&#x0003d;OMIM">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db&#x0003d;OMIM</ext-link>&#x0005d;). ACC is associated with certain chromosomal rearrangements &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; and occurs as a component of other genetic syndromes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; and metabolic conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, but its genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic pleiotropy have limited identification of the responsible genes to only a few of the more than 20 distinct loci that are associated with ACC, including one on the short arm of Chromosome 1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In addition to other CNS defects with which ACC is frequently associated, ACC may occur in conjunction with visceral organ malformations. For example, ACC and its associated brain and spinal cord lesions have been linked to vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), cystic kidney disease, renal agenesis and insufficiency, and neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, a condition that includes neurogenic bladder and VUR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b013">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, single gene mutations may produce developmental defects in both the CNS and urinary tract. We show here that a novel human syndrome involving both CNS and urinary tract defects is associated with disruption or deletion of the <italic>NFIA</italic> gene at 1p31.3, which encodes a member of the Nuclear Factor I (NFI) family of transcription factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

Similar studies indicate that two other <italic>Nfi</italic> family members, <italic>Nfib</italic> and <italic>Nfic</italic>, are essential for lung, brain and tooth development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the role that NFI transcription factors play in human disease has been unknown. Our results establish that <italic>NFIA</italic> haploinsufficiency is a likely contributor to a range of CNS defects, including ACC, hydrocephalus, ventriculomegaly, Chiari type I malformation, and tethered spinal cord, and that renal defects can also result from a disturbance in ureteral development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CNS and Urinary Tract Defects in Individuals with 1p31 Rearrangements</title><p>We investigated five individuals enrolled in DGAP (i.e., DGAP104, 089, 174, 205&#x02013;1, and 205&#x02013;1s), each with a similar spectrum of CNS defects, and in three cases, of urinary tract defects.

All five also share abnormalities of the corpus callosum, and partly share other CNS phenotypes, including ventriculomegaly, congenital hydrocephalus, Chiari type I malformation, and tethered spinal cord. All five individuals also have developmental delay and three exhibited seizure disorders. Three of the five also have urinary tract defects, including VUR. Prior work established that <italic>Nfia</italic> loss of function in the mouse results in ACC and abnormal development of the hippocampal commissure, two major axonal tracts that connect the cerebral hemispheres, and an associated hydrocephalus that develops in rare postnatal survivors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. We also found that the mouse <italic>Nfia</italic> mutant recapitulates the VUR phenotype in these humans. Therefore, although other affected genes may contribute to the overall phenotype, these cases suggest that <italic>NFIA</italic> haploinsufficiency can account for the observed CNS and renal defects.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that a contribution to the developmental phenotypes identified here from additional genes that reside within various deletion intervals, or that also suffer disruption by breakpoints, is not excluded. In all five cases, additional genes besides <italic>NFIA</italic> are also disrupted or deleted, so that in no single case is a defect in <italic>NFIA</italic> the only genetic abnormality. While DGAP104 only inactivates <italic>NFIA</italic> and <italic>C20orf32</italic> and the latter is an unlikely contributory factor, the most extreme cases are DGAP089 and the DGAP205 half-siblings, which contain deletions that involve 39 and 47 genes, respectively. Because these two deletions involve different chromosomes, none of the deleted genes are shared. However, in both cases, many more genes are affected than just <italic>NFIA</italic>, and some may participate in the observed phenotypes. For example, two cases described in the literature report 2q deletions that overlap with the del(2)(q14.3q21) in DGAP089, and these also involve ACC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.

Indeed, as noted, it is quite plausible that in any individual DGAP case, the observed phenotype represents the additive effect of <italic>NFIA</italic> haploinsufficiency plus other loci that are deleted or disrupted. On the other hand, at least 20 discrete loci have been implicated in ACC alone, so that the failure to detect intragenic mutations in <italic>NFIA</italic> is not surprising. Ultimately, formal definition of the <italic>NFIA</italic> hemizygous loss-of-function phenotype would be strengthened by identification of intragenic loss-of-function <italic>NFIA</italic> mutations.</p><p>Lastly, it is well recognized that both chromosomal translocations and deletions may engender position effects that alter gene expression at considerable distances from the site of a chromosomal aberration (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;).

The mouse <italic>Nfia</italic> mutant results from a small exon 2 deletion, yet still accurately recapitulates many features of the human phenotype. Therefore, one would have to posit the existence of a conserved regulatory element within the exon 2 deletion region that would act on genes 3&#x02032; to <italic>Nfia</italic>, which exhibit conservation of synteny between mouse and human. However, the genes immediately neighboring <italic>NFIA</italic> are not known to play a role in CNS or kidney development. These include <italic>C1orf87</italic> (GeneID 127795) and <italic>TM2D1</italic> (beta amyloid binding protein, GeneID 83941), which reside approximately 1 Mb 5&#x02032; and 200 kb 3&#x02032; of <italic>NFIA</italic>, respectively. Additional genes that reside at larger distances from <italic>NFIA</italic> might be affected by a position effect, but none are obvious candidates.

Hydronephrosis usually results from an obstruction in the flow of urine at the level of the UPJ or UVJ.

The presence of hydronephrosis in <italic>Nfia</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>Nfia</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mutants therefore suggests that the observed renal defects reflect a primary disturbance in ureteral development.</p><p>A striking finding in <italic>Nfia</italic> mutant embryos and newborns is the presence of clear ureteral abnormalities: megaureter, abnormal ureteral folding, abnormalities at the UVJ and UPJ, and in a small number of cases, partial duplication of the ureter. These findings are consistent with the strong expression of <italic>Nfia</italic> in the developing nephric duct and ureter at E9.5&#x02013;13.5. The ureteral duplication phenotype, distinct from normal patterns of ureteric bud branching &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030080-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;, very likely explains the finding of a partial duplex kidney.

Because of placenta previa and persistent vaginal bleeding, DGAP104 was delivered at 31 wk via elective cesarean section and weighed 1,980 g with Apgar scores of 9/10/10. She was diagnosed with prematurity, hydrocephaly, Chiari I malformation, tethered spinal cord, congenital hydronephrosis, left hypoplastic kidney, bilateral inguinal hernia, hyaline membrane disease grade 2, and gastroesophageal reflux. Imaging studies indicated a thin posterior corpus callosum and an open aqueduct with progressive ventricular enlargement. She was delayed in reaching developmental milestones; at 2 y, she exhibited major motor delay with inhibited movement and was wheelchair bound. Speech was also delayed, and limited to a few words. At 6 y 7 mo of age, DGAP104 received a performance IQ score of 42, verbal IQ score of 68, and global IQ score of 52 on the Weschler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised test (WPPSI-R).</p><p>To relieve hydrocephalus, which caused progressive macrocephaly, seven neurosurgical operations were performed over 5 y, including a third ventriculocisternostomy, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt with a flow-regulated valve, and several revisions because of hyperdrainage or blockage of the shunt. At 7 d of age, abdominal ultrasonography revealed bilateral hypoplastic kidneys and bilateral dilatation of the renal pelvis. At 1 y, ultrasound showed left and right kidney lengths of 45 mm and 51 mm, respectively (mean length for age, 52 mm), and both kidneys lacked corticomedullary differentiation. At 2 y, the left kidney length was 49 mm and the right 58 mm (mean length for age, 55 mm), but both lacked discernable corticomedullary differentiation. At 5 y, the left kidney was 53 mm and the right 61 mm (mean length for age, 66 mm). DGAP104 first exhibited left grade II VUR by VCUG at 1 y. At 2 y, VUR increased to grade III with a right vesicoureteral junction diverticulum, and pyelonephritis developed that required ureteral reimplantation surgery (Cohen operation).

Seizure onset occurred at 19 mo, with treatment until age 6 y and no recurrences thereafter. He rolled to one side at 10 mo, to either side at 14 mo, and sat at 14 mo. At 3 y, he received the Bayley Scales of Infant Development test (2nd edition, BSID-II), and earned a Mental Developmental Index (MDI) that fell below the standard score of 50 with an age equivalent of 4 mo. He also received the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales test (parent form VABS), and obtained an adaptive behavior composite score of 45 corresponding to an age equivalent of 7 mo. He cruised at 4 y, and walked at 5 y. DGAP089 underwent a brain MRI at 6.5 y that revealed a hypoplastic corpus callosum with enlarged frontal horns, parallel in configuration, without evidence of increased intracranial pressure. The MRI also showed polymicrogyria and an 8-mm nodule along the lateral wall of the left frontal horn that likely represented a gray matter heterotopia. Renal ultrasound performed at 6.5 y was normal. There was no significant change in the physical examination and no focal sensorimotor deficits were noted. When last examined at age 8 y (2005), DGAP089 was no longer wearing leg braces, was able to walk and run on his toes, and could eat table foods without difficulty, but was not toilet trained. Speech consisted of about three words in appropriate context, and he was being taught American Sign Language (ASL). He could gesture, but was unable to follow commands, and engaged in self-stimulatory behavior.</p><p><italic>DGAP174.</italic> DGAP174 was born to a 20-y-old mother at 37 wk by cesarean section and weighed 2,770 g (95th percentile) with length 49.5 cm (25th percentile) and occipitofrontal circumference 37.5 cm (75th percentile). Pregnancy was uncomplicated by teratogenic exposures or maternal illness. A second trimester prenatal ultrasound showed agenesis of the corpus callosum and enlarged ventricles. A CT scan of the brain in the immediate postnatal period confirmed the prenatal findings, and revealed ventriculomegaly with parallel lateral ventricles representing longitudinal bundles of Probst, and a tethered spinal cord. A small ventricular septal defect was also noted at birth. Chromosome analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed 46,XY,t(1;3)(p22;q21)dn. The neonate was discharged and seen again at 13 d of age in the genetics clinic. He was found to have metopic stenosis and bitemporal narrowing that was surgically corrected at 5 mo of age. Neurological exam revealed normal tone and reflexes. At 8 mo of age, he was noted to be gaining weight rapidly, unrelated to any change in eating pattern. Follow-up at 12 mo revealed delay in gross motor development, macrocephaly without hydrocephalus, and height, weight, and length above the 95th percentile for his age. Additionally, a dimple on the posterior aspect of the right helix, creases behind each earlobe, and esotropia secondary to telecanthus and epicanthal folds were noted. A left inguinal hernia was detected at 24 mo. Also at 24 mo, glasses were prescribed to correct hypertropia and strabismus, and all milestones were on track except for speech. At 36 mo, expressive language was still delayed. Due to macrosomia, the patient underwent bone age testing, which was age appropriate. A brain MRI at 36 mo of age revealed Chiari I malformation and dysplasia of the anterior aspect of the left temporal fossa in addition to complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. At 57 mo of age, DGAP174 underwent several developmental tests. His IQ score was 68 on a Leiter International Performance Scale (LIPS) test, corresponding to an age equivalent of 36 mo. He received a standard score of 60 in the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Revised, Form M; PPVT-R) corresponding to an age equivalent of 35 mo. His standard score for the Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI) was 67, which also corresponded to an age equivalent of 35 mo. At 6 y of age, he underwent a successful Chiari decompression and repair of the tethered spinal cord. At that time, he was diagnosed with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and is currently on Ritalin. He was noted to have right hemihypertrophy and scoliosis, for which he was referred to an orthopedics clinic.

Both half-siblings had congenital CNS and urinary tract defects while their mother was phenotypically normal. DGAP205&#x02013;1 had the Bayley Scales of Infant Development test (BSID) at 4.5 y of age and received scores corresponding to an age equivalent of 18 mo for overall development, 20 mo for cognition, and 17 mo for fine motor. At age 5 y, DGAP205&#x02013;1 was functioning at an age equivalent of ~2.5 y. At age 10 y he was functioning at an age equivalent of ~7 y, and was 4 ft tall and weighed ~65 lb. DGAP205&#x02013;1 has limited verbal skills and uses a combination of words and signs for communication. He has not had any formal testing at 10 y of age, but can only read and spell three-letter words. DGAP205-1s received the Bayley Scales of Infant Development test (BSID) at 2 y of age, and the Stanford-Binet test at 9 y. Both tests demonstrated moderate global cognitive impairment (scores not available). At 9 y of age, she was functioning academically at a kindergarten level.
