However, the mechanism by which this pathway is activated in cells exposed to NO is not known.

Our data show that the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 undergoes ASK1-JNK1 mediated degradation upon exposure to NO, and that cells deficient in either <italic>Ask1</italic> or <italic>Jnk1</italic> are protected against NO-induced cell death. NO can inhibit the mitochondrial electron transport chain resulting in an increase in superoxide generation and peroxynitrite formation. However, scavengers of ROS or peroxynitrite do not prevent NO-induced cell death. Collectively, these data indicate that NO degrades MCL-1 through the ASK1-JNK1 axis to induce BAX/BAK-dependent cell death.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to have both protective and deleterious functions. This molecule is critical for multiple physiological functions, yet plays a role in many pathological states, including neurodegenerative disease and cancer. A major target of NO is cytochrome oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain (ETC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Brown1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Bolanos1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. NO binds COX reversibly to regulate cellular respiration. Although NO's ability to modify biological molecules has proven to be physiologically important, NO-dependent modifications may contribute to cell death through S-nitrosylation of proteins or the formation of peroxynitrite. Prolonged exposure to NO inhibits complex I of the ETC likely through <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Clementi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Inhibition of complex I by NO has been hypothesized to result in an elevated release of oxidants from the ETC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Moncada1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. An increase in oxidants in the presence of NO favors the formation of the highly reactive molecule peroxynitrite which can activate p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to initiate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Go1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Schieke1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The BCL-2 family of proteins regulate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. These proteins can be divided into two subclasses, the anti-apoptotic proteins (BCL-2, BCL-X<sub>L</sub>, BCL-w, MCL-1 and A1), and the pro-apoptotic proteins which include the multi-domain BCL-2 proteins (BAX, BAK and BOK) and the BH3-only proteins (including BIM, BID, PUMA, BAD and NOXA). In healthy cells, BAX and BAK exist as monomers in the cytosol and at the mitochondrial outer membrane, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Hsu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In response to a death stimulus, the BH3-only proteins are activated transcriptionally and/or by post-translational modifications and cause the oligomerization of BAX and BAK resulting in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). This allows proteins that normally reside in the intermembrane space, such as cytochrome c, to enter the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Antonsson1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Wei1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. When cytochrome c is released into the cytosol, it forms a complex with APAF-1 and pro-caspase-9 in an ATP-dependent manner resulting in the formation of the apoptosome which in turn activates downstream executioner caspases resulting in apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Li1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Liu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>BH3-only proteins and the anti-apoptotic proteins are upstream regulators of BAX and BAK activation yet the exact mechanism by which these proteins initiate apoptosis is not completely understood. Currently, there are two models that describe how these proteins mediate BAX and BAK activity, the indirect activation model and the direct activation model. The indirect activation model postulates that in healthy cells, anti-apoptotic proteins associate with BAX and BAK and repress their activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Willis1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In response to a death stimulus, BH3-only proteins interact with the anti-apoptotic proteins, displacing them from BAX and BAK resulting in MOMP. This model assumes that BAX and BAK are kept in check by anti-apoptotic proteins. The direct activation model divides the BH3-only proteins into &#x0201c;activators&#x0201d; (BID, BIM and PUMA) and &#x0201c;sensitizers&#x0201d; (all other BH3-only proteins). This model proposes that the anti-apoptotic family members prevent cell death by disrupting signaling upstream of BAX and BAK by binding to the &#x0201c;activator&#x0201d; BH3-only proteins and negating their function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Letai1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In response to a death stimulus, the &#x0201c;sensitizer&#x0201d; BH3-only proteins bind to the anti-apoptotic proteins, releasing the &#x0201c;activators&#x0201d; and allowing them to induce apoptosis by directly activating BAX and BAK. Despite suggesting different mechanisms of action, both models agree that the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins need to be negated for BAX and BAK mediated MOMP.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the loss of BAX and BAK, prevents NO induction of cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Messmer1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Lee1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. As mentioned, BAX and BAK activation is regulated by BH3-only proteins yet it is not known which BH3-only proteins are involved in NO-induced cell death. Furthermore, the signaling pathways that are initiated by NO to activate BAX/BAK-induced cell death are also unknown. In the present study, we investigated which signaling pathways and BH3-only proteins cause the negation of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins to cause NO-induced cell death.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Nitric oxide-induced cell death requires the intrinsic apoptotic proteins, BAX, BAK and Caspase-9, and causes release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria</title><p>To investigate the mechanism by which long-term exposure to NO cause's cell death we used the slow-releasing NO donor, diethylenetriamine (DETA)-NO.

Our data show that BAX and BAK are activated by NO and that cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria. The combined loss of BAX and BAK, or the individual loss of Caspase-9, completely prevents NO-induced cell death indicating that these proteins are required for this pathway.</p><p>Activation of BAX and BAK is dependent on interactions between anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins. There are currently two models that attempt to explain how these interactions orchestrate BAX and BAK activation. Despite differences in these models, both agree that BH3-only proteins are major upstream regulators of BAX and BAK activity. Both models agree that BIM, BID and PUMA are potent activators of apoptosis but through distinct mechanisms. The indirect activation model views these proteins as potent because they are able to bind and inhibit all of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins, whereas other BH3-only proteins have selective partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Willis2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. In this model, the negation of BCL-2 proteins is sufficient to induce BAX and BAK activation. The indirect activation model proposes that anti-apoptotic BCL-2 members negate the activity of BAX or BAK in healthy cells. In response to a death stimulus, BH3-only proteins such as BIM bind to the anti-apoptotics and displace them from BAX and BAK. By contrast, the direct activation model proposes that BIM, BID and PUMA are potent because they can directly activate BAX and BAK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Letai1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Kim1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we find that cells collectively deficient in <italic>Bim</italic> and <italic>Puma</italic> with reduced <italic>Bid</italic> expression still die in response to NO. We speculate that a BH3-only protein other than BIM, BID, PUMA, BAD or NOXA negates the anti-apoptotics in response to NO or that NO promotes binding of multiple proteins to anti-apoptotic BCL-2 members, negating their activity.</p><p>A major mechanism for negating anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein is through degradation. For example, MCL-1 is degraded in response to a variety of death stimuli including DNA damage, cytokine withdrawal, and anoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Brunelle1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Cuconati1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Nijhawan1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Song1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Jourdan1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. NO induces proteosomal degradation of MCL-1 even in the absence of BAX and BAK, suggesting this is an early event in the pathway. Previous studies indicate that the BH3-only protein NOXA stimulates MCL-1 degradation upon exposure to a death stimulus. Furthermore, MCL-1 protein is ubiquitinated at five critical lysine residues that are required for degradation. Surprisingly, NO causes MCL-1 degradation in the absence of NOXA, and a mutant form of MCL-1, that can not be ubiquitinated at the five critical lysine residues, is also degraded. Collectively, these data indicate that MCL-1 is degraded by a non-canonical mechanism that does not involve NOXA or ubiquitinylation of MCL-1 at five specific lysine residues.</p><p>The signaling pathways that negate anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins to allow BAX and BAK activation are not fully understood.

Our data indicate that p38&#x003b1; and JNK2 are dispensable in NO induced cell death, but <italic>Jnk1</italic> null cells are markedly protected from NO-induced cell death. Furthermore, NO does not induce MCL-1 protein degradation in the absence of <italic>Jnk1</italic>. These results indicate that in the absence of <italic>Jnk1</italic>, cell survival is due to the maintenance of MCL-1.</p><p>ASK1 activates the JNK signaling pathway under conditions of high oxidative stress.

ROS oxidize cysteine residues of the Trx protein causing it to dissociate from ASK1 resulting in its activation through autophosphorylation. Indeed, MCL-1 protein levels were maintained in <italic>Ask1</italic> deficient cells and these cells did not undergo cell death. However, we found no evidence that the NO-induced cell death pathway was dependent on oxidative stress. This was surprising since NO can inhibit the mitochondrial respiratory chain and increase oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Poderoso1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. In our experiments, NO was able to block oxidative phosphorylation. We speculate that NO might cause direct <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylation of the cysteine residues of Trx thereby liberating ASK1 to induce cell death.</p><p>In summary, our data reveal that NO negates anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, in part through the activation of the ASK1-JNK1 pathway, which leads to BAX/BAK-dependent cell death. These findings have implications for the role of inflammation in cancer progression. Recent data indicate that inflammation can exacerbate cancer progression. MCL-1 and BCL-X<sub>L</sub> are up-regulated in many types of cancers. Activated macrophages, which release high levels of NO during inflammation, are capable of destroying neoplastic cells. However, if BCL-2 proteins are upregulated in tumor cell this would prevent NO-dependent cell death resulting tumor progression. This would further select tumor cells that have elevated levels of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins and make them resistant to chemotherapy or radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p><italic>Bax<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/Bak<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, <italic>Caspase-9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, <italic>Bim<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, <italic>Bad<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, <italic>Bid<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, <italic>Puma</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>Noxa</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>Jnk1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>,<italic>Jnk2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, <italic>Ask1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, p38<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs and their wild type controls were cultured as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Brunelle1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007059-Emerling1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Bim<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/Puma<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> MEFs and their wild type controls and PT67 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/liter glucose, <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen).
