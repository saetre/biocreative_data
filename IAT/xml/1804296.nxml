The genes for killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) have been cloned and their functions and expression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been partially clarified.

Thus, we measured KIR expression on lymphocytes in patients with RA, and assessed the correlation between KIR expression and disease activity. <italic>Patients and Methods</italic>. In the cross-sectional study, 15 patients (9 females and 6 males) who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for RA were assessed. In the longitudinal study, patients who were followed-up for 3 months were assessed. CD158a/b expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of RA patients was analyzed using flow cytometry. <italic>Results</italic>. No significant correlation between KIR expression and CRP, ESR, or IgM-RF was observed. There was no remarkable change in the expression of KIRs between the baseline and after 3 months. Additionally, in the 5 patients whose expression of KIRs particularly changed, the time-related changes in the expression of KIRs were independent from those of inflammation parameters and IgM-RF. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. There was no correlation between KIR expression and disease activity; therefore, the clinical use of KIR expression should be limited, while unnatural KIR expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of RA, but not a recruitment of chronic inflammation to induce joint damage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="section" id="sec1"><title>1. INTRODUCTION</title><p>The molecular cloning of novel NK receptors (NKRs) was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and it was subsequently shown that the receptors transmit negative signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In human, NKRs can be divided into 3 classes: immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors, including killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs) and leukocyte Ig-like receptors (LIRs), lectine-like receptors (CD94/NKG), and natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), including NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>KIRs are expressed on many NK cells and on subpopulations of T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and have been implicated in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and scleroderma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], where associations have been found with 3-domain KIRs (KIR2DL1, 2, and 3) known to recognize HLA-C alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We have also demonstrated that the expression of KIR2DL1 on CD8+ T cells was reduced in patients with RA compared to healthy subjects, and that the upregulation of KIR2DL1, 2, and 3 by treatment with IL-2 was weaker in RA patients than in healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Low KIR expression on CD8+ T cells in RA might be associated with the mechanism of self-attacking characteristics of autoimmune diseases. Also, the low response of KIRs to IL-2 suggests that patients with RA might be highly susceptible to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (TB). Based on these findings, it is considered that the status of KIR expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of RA as well as susceptibility to microbes such as TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>RA is a chronic destructive joint disease and a heterogeneous syndrome. Therefore, the disturbance of KIR expression in RA raises an interesting question: does KIR expression on peripheral lymphocytes in patients with RA change with disease activity or not? However, changes in KIR expression on lymphocytes have not yet been analyzed in RA patients.</p><p>Here, we measured KIR expression on lymphocytes in patients with RA, and assessed the correlation between KIR expression and disease activity and changes in KIR expression during the disease course.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2. PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec2.1"><title>2.1.

The characteristics of these patients were as follows: mean &#x000b1; SD age of 62.0 &#x000b1; 9.4 years (range: 42&#x02013;72), mean &#x000b1; SD disease duration of 8.1 &#x000b1; 6.2 years (range: 2&#x02013;24), mean &#x000b1; SD ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) 48 &#x000b1; 35 mm/h (range: 28&#x02013;86), mean &#x000b1; SD CH50 (serum complement titer/50% hemolytic unit of complement) 36.9 &#x000b1; 7.0 U/mL (range: 28&#x02013;52), anatomical stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] 2.2 &#x000b1; 1.4, and functional class 2.1 &#x000b1; 0.5.

There was no correlation between the counts of CD158a-expressing cells and disease activity, although there was a tendency towards a correlation between CD158a-expressing cells and ESR. Also, the counts of CD158b-expressing cells did not correlate with classical inflammatory parameters (CRP: C-reactive protein, and ESR) and IgM-RF.</p><p>The changes of CD158a- and CD158b-expressing cells during the followup of 3 months.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the changes in the populations of cells expressing CD158a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(a)</xref>) and CD158b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1(b)</xref>) during the followup of 3 months. Ten of the RA patients did not show changes in the expression of CD158a and CD158b. Two patients showed an expansion of the populations of both CD158a- and CD158b-expressing cells. In contrast, 3 patients showed decrease in the populations of both CD158a- and CD158b-expressing cells. However, time-related changes in the expression of CD158a/b were independent from those of inflammation parameters and IgM-RF in the 5 cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Additionally, there were no differences in clinical features among the three groups: (i) patients with no changes in KIR expression, (ii) patients with a decrease in KIR expression, and (iii) patients with an increase in KIR expression (data not shown).</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec4"><title>4. DISCUSSION</title><p>The biological functions of KIRs have been thoroughly investigated. In brief, NK cell function is generally regulated by a balance between signals transmitted by inhibitory and stimulatory receptors. Ligand binding to inhibitory receptors recruits phosphatases that dephosphorylate downstream activation proteins, thereby terminating the activating-signaling pathway. Thus, activation of NK cell function occurs when there is a net excess of stimulatory over inhibitory signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated findings supporting the important functions of NK cells in regulating autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We have also demonstrated that the population of CD8+CD158a+ cells was reduced in patients with RA compared to healthy subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Similarly, Nakiri et al have reported that among patients with RA, NKB1+CD8+ T cells decreased significantly in comparison to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It is considered that the low population of KIR-expressing cells in T cells might be associated with the mechanism of self-attacking characteristics of autoimmune diseases, and that an unnatural expression of KIRs may contribute to the pathogenesis of RA. However, it has not been demonstrated whether KIR expression correlates with disease activity in RA.</p><p>As far as we know, this is the first report to assess the correlation between KIR expression and disease activity. In this study, we did not find a significant relationship between CD158a/b expression on peripheral lymphocytes, classical inflammatory parameters (CRP and ESR), and IgM-RF. These findings suggest that unnatural KIR expression contributes to one of the triggers of RA pathogenesis, but not a recruitment of chronic inflammation to induce joint damage. Other investigators have revealed that the KIR2DS2 gene was significantly enriched among patients with vasculitis in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, we have observed the changes in the population of CD158a/b-expressing cells. In this followup, time-related changes in the population of KIR-expressing cells were independent from those of inflammation parameters and IgM-RF. Additionally, the patients were divided into 3 groups according to the pattern of changes in the population of KIR-expressing cells. However, there was no difference in the clinical features among the 3 groups: (i) patients with no changes in KIR expression, (ii) patients with a decrease in KIR expression, and (iii) patients with an increase in KIR expression. We also did not find any correlation in the disease activity between these 3 groups. These findings may also suggest that unnatural KIR expression contributes to one of the triggers of RA pathogenesis, but not a recruitment of chronic inflammation to induce joint damage. To support this hypothesis, further analysis of KIR expression on the cells of several lineages is required.</p><p>Finally, there was no correlation between KIR expression and disease activity; therefore, the clinical use of KIR expression should be limited, while unnatural KIR expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of RA, but not a recruitment of chronic inflammation to induce joint damage.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of
