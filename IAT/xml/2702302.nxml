Loss of either TSC1 or TSC2 in TSC hamartomas leads to activation of mTORC1 and suppression of AKT. Recent studies indicate that inhibition of mTORC1 with RAD001 (everolimus) leads to rebound activation of AKT, which could protect tumors from drug-induced cell death. Here we examine the potential benefit of inhibition of both mTOR and AKT signaling in a mouse model of TSC, using a dual pan class I PI3K/mTOR catalytic small molecule inhibitor NVP-BEZ235.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using ENU to enhance <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+- </sup>kidney tumor development, both RAD001 (10 mg/kg PO 5 d/week) and NVP-BEZ235 (45 mg/kg PO QD) had equivalent effects in suppressing tumor development during a 4 week treatment period, with a 99% reduction in tumor cell mass. Marked reduction in activation of mTORC1, induction of cell cycle arrest, and absence of apoptotic cell death was seen in mice treated with either drug. However, when either was discontinued, there was prompt recovery of tumor growth, with extensive proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both mTORC1 blockade alone and combined PI3K-mTOR blockade lead to suppression of tumor development but not tumor elimination in this TSC model.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal dominant tumor suppressor gene syndrome, in which involvement of the brain, kidneys, and lungs cause the greatest clinical problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Seizures, mental retardation, developmental delay, and autistic features are common during childhood in these patients, and in many patients these clinical issues persist into adulthood. However, after puberty, additional major clinical problems in TSC are the progressive development of renal angiomyolipoma (AML) and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Both of these lesions are made up of unusual smooth muscle-like and other cells which express both melanosomal markers and VEGF-D. Although progression of these lesions is quite variable from patient to patient, loss of renal function due to either progressive growth of AMLs and/or conversion into a malignant renal tumor is seen in about 5% of TSC patients. Pulmonary LAM is seen nearly exclusively in female TSC patients, and leads to progressive respiratory limitation and failure also in about 5%. LAM is also seen independent of the TSC syndrome, typically in a more severe and progressive form.</p><p>Tsc mouse models have been generated consisting of both knock out and conditional alleles of <italic>Tsc1 </italic>and <italic>Tsc2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

Several studies have shown the benefit of rapamycin and other mTORC1 inhibitors in the treatment and prevention of renal tumors in Tsc mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Loss of TSC1/TSC2 in TSC hamartomas leads to both activation of mTORC1, as well as feedback inhibition of AKT, through downregulation of IRS and PDGFR expression and other mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This has led to speculation that treatment of TSC hamartomas with mTORC1 inhibitors might lead to restoration of AKT activation, as seen in vitro with treatment of TSC1/TSC2 null cells, and in some patients with malignant disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which may compromise clinical benefit. Here, we explore the potential benefit of the mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) in comparison to a dual pan-class I PI3K/mTOR catalytic inhibitor NVP-BEZ-235 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] in the therapy of Tsc2 mouse kidney tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mouse procedures</title><p><italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+- </sup>mice, originally generated in this laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], were serially crossed with C57BL/6J mice for over 5 generations, and were then mated with pure 129S1/SvImJ mice to generate <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+- </sup>mixed strain C57BL/6J:129S1/SvImJ mice. These mixed strain mice were used in all experiments. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Humane Use and Care of Laboratory Animals, and the study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Children's Hospital, Boston. N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU, Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared in ethanol at 200 mg/ml, diluted in phosphate-citrate buffer, and administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection at 60 mg/kg.</p></sec><sec><title>Standard histology and tumor assessment</title><p>Standard histology sections were prepared from mouse kidneys after 10% formalin fixation and cutting into five 1&#x02013;2 mm sections. Both gross and microscopic kidney pathology was read by a blinded observer (KP) and scored according to a modification of a formula used previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The kidney tumor score for kidney cystadenomas was determined as a summed score for all lesions in a kidney, scoring each individual tumor grossly as follows: 1 for tumors &#x0003c;1 mm; 2 for 1 to 1.5 mm; 5 for 1.5 to 2 mm; 10 for &#x0003e; 2 mm. Microscopic kidney tumor scores were determined similarly, except that the score for each lesion was multiplied by 2 if the tumor had a papillary component, and by 4 if it was a solid adenoma. The percent cellularity of cystadenomas was determined as the percent of the tumor that contained proliferating cells as opposed to cyst cavity; pure cysts had a score of 0% cellularity while solid adenomas had a score of 100% cellularity. Comparison between sets of mice for tumor measurements were made using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Antibodies used were: pS6(S235/236) clone 91B2, active caspase-3 clone 5A1 from Cell Signaling Technology, Bedford, MA; pS6(S240) clone DAK-S6-240 M7300, pAKT(S473) clone 14&#x02013;5, Ki-67 clone TEC-3 M7249, and pMAPK(pTpY202/4) clone 24-2-2 from DAKO S/A, Denmark; PCNA (PC10) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For immunohistochemistry, kidneys were rapidly removed, sliced in thirds and fixed overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in 10% formalin. Paraffin sections were cut and stained by the immunoperoxidase technique, following standard methods of deparaffinization, antigen retrieval using Dako Target Retrieval solution, DAB incubation, and counterstaining with hematoxylin. The percent Ki-67 or PCNA labeling, or percent of cells expressing active caspase 3, within a lesion was determined by direct counting of at least 300 cells by a blinded observer (IM).</p></sec><sec><title>Drug handling and administration</title><p>RAD001 was provided by Novartis in a proprietary vehicle at 20 mg/ml. Prior to each administration, RAD001 was diluted in water to 0.5&#x02013;2 mg/ml, and was given at 10 mg/kg by gavage every day 5 days per week. NVP-BEZ235 was provided by Novartis as a powder, and was mixed in 10% 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone and 90% PEG-300 at 8 mg/ml. It was prepared fresh prior to each administration, and was given at either 15 mg/kg or 45 mg/kg by gavage every day. In the first treatment cohort, mice were treated with placebo (10% 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone and 90% PEG-300) by gavage 5 days per week. This was not done in subsequent cohorts.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>ENU acts as a carcinogen to enhance renal tumor growth in <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+- </sup>mice</title><p>Kidney tumor growth in <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+- </sup>mice follows a variable though predictable pattern with an effect of strain on tumor severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], (unpublished). In most strains, age 12 months is the earliest at which significant kidney tumors are seen. To accelerate the rate of development of renal tumors, we treated <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+- </sup>mice with ENU, an alkylating agent which causes point mutations. We explored the effects of administration of a single IP dose of ENU at several different times during mouse development, evaluating tumor severity at 6 months of age [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. To minimize effects of genetic background, we studied mice that were heterozygous for the C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ strains. We found that ENU given at ages from E13 to P21 (administered to the pregnant dam in the first case) was effective at increasing the incidence and severity of kidney cystadenomas in the <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+- </sup>mice, as assessed by gross evaluation [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. ENU treatment at these ages in wild type mice of the same strain mix led to rare renal tumors (e.g. only one &#x0003c; 1 mm tumor in 10 mice treated with ENU at P9) at age 6 months. Microscopic assessment of the ENU-treated <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+- </sup>mice confirmed this enhancement in tumor development (data not shown). Administration of ENU at any of P9, E19, or E13 appeared to have similar outcomes, with nearly identical kidney tumor scores (see Methods for details) [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. We chose to use P9 administration for simplicity in the following studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of RAD001 alone and in combination with NVP-BEZ235 in the ENU-accelerated <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+- </sup>kidney tumor model</title><p>We explored the potential benefit of mTORC1 inhibition with RAD001 in the ENU-accelerated <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+- </sup>kidney tumor model. RAD001 was highly effective in reducing the gross tumor score, microscopic tumor score, and percent solid tumor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;C</xref>) in these mice, after a 4-week period of treatment at 10 mg PO QD 5 days out of seven each week, beginning at age 20 weeks. Combining the reduction in overall tumor size with reduction in cellularity indicates that there was an approximate 99% reduction in tumor development. In addition, the residual lesions seen in the RAD001-treated mice generally had a flattened epithelium, in contrast to the enlarged columnar-like epithelial cells seen in untreated mice [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]. We also examined the acute effects of treatment with RAD001 in this model. Tumor analysis 3&#x02013;5 days after initiation of therapy demonstrated that RAD001 markedly reduced expression of pS6(S240) and pS6(S235/236), consistent with mTORC1 blockade [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>]. In addition, the Ki-67 labeling index in the short-term treated tumors was reduced from an average of 6% to an average of 1% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>]. However, there was no indication of induction of apoptosis or necrosis in the tumors, as expression of activated caspase-3 was very low in the treated tumors (0&#x02013;1% cells) similar to that seen in untreated tumors [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4A</xref>] (in contrast to control nude mouse tumor xenograft samples, data not shown). In addition, there was no consistent effect on MAPK signaling, as assessed by staining for pMAPK(pTpY202/4) (data not shown), in the treated tumors. However, RAD001 treatment caused an increase in pAKT(S473) levels in the tumors, which were very low in tumors from untreated mice [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>]. Total S6 and AKT protein levels were similar in normal kidney and in the tumors, and did not appear to change significantly with treatment with either compound [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>]. Four week treatment with RAD001 also did not lead to significant apoptosis in these kidney tumors, though it did cause continued suppression of proliferation [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Renal tumor development blocked by administration of RAD001 with or without NVP-BEZ235 in the ENU-treated <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+- </sup>model</bold>.

Improvement was seen in both gross and microscopic kidney tumor scores, with a more modest change in tumor cellularity. These observations are probably due to the activity of NVP-BEZ235 as a direct mTOR inhibitor, affecting both mTORC1 and mTORC2, in addition to its PI3K inhibition activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Consistent with this effect, NVP-BEZ235 inhibits phosphorylation of S6 at the S235/236 sites in Tsc2 null murine embryo fibroblast cell lines at 10&#x02013;100 nM, and has a potent anti-proliferative effect on these cells with an IC50 of 3 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of RAD001 and NVP-BEZ235 as therapy for the ENU-accelerated <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+- </sup>kidney tumor model</title><p>Since NVP-BEZ235 had effects in inhibiting mTOR, and at low doses could reduce tumor development in this model, we treated a cohort of ENU-treated <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+- </sup>mice with NVP-BEZ235 at full dosage, 45 mg/kg PO QD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and compared outcome with RAD001 treatment.

Tumor cellularity also appeared reduced in general, though the presence of a single solid adenoma in an NVP-BEZ235-treated mouse ran against this trend.

In addition, we demonstrate that there is very effective suppression of cell growth within these lesions, as assessed by reduction in Ki-67 positivity, with a lack of apoptosis or tumor cell death. Pathway inhibition with reduction in markers of mTORC1 activation, pS6(S240) and pS6(S235/236), was also seen, consistent with the expected mechanism of action of the drug. However, marked tumor regrowth occurred by 8 weeks after discontinuation of RAD001, though some persistent reduction in overall tumor burden could be appreciated in comparison to never-treated mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). We find these observations to be in striking parallel to those made in AML patients, taking into account the markedly different growth rates of renal AMLs in patients in comparison to renal cystadenomas in this model. They suggest that rapamycin/RAD001 has a cytostatic effect, effectively blocking the growth of the renal AMLs and likely reducing cell size, but without tumor cell death. Upon drug removal, there is regrowth of tumors. Further, they suggest the possibility that continued mTORC1 inhibition may have benefit for maintaining growth suppression of these tumors.</p><p>It is well-recognized that the mTOR signaling pathway in which TSC1/TSC2 participate is more complex than first thought, with a number of feedback inhibitory effects of loss of the TSC protein complex on AKT activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, the related mTORC2 complex has a major if not sole role in phosphorylating and enhancing activation of AKT at Serine 473 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In most tumor cell lines, including Tsc1 null and Tsc2 null MEF cell lines, treatment with rapamycin or RAD001 leads to phosphorylation of AKT at the S473 site, and increased activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. There has been concern that this effect could mitigate any positive treatment effect of mTORC1 inhibitors on tumor growth. Here we assessed the possibility that combined PI3K-AKT-mTOR blockade with NVP-BEZ235 could lead to a better therapeutic outcome in this <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+- </sup>kidney tumor model. We found that the short-term effects of NVP-BEZ235 were similar to those of RAD001 with a major reduction in cell proliferation, lack of apoptosis or cell death, and reduction in markers of mTORC1 activation. NVP-BEZ235 has PI3K inhibitory activity at low nM levels in vitro for all PI3K&#x003b1; including mutant forms, and has been shown to reduce pAKT(S473) levels in xenograft models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. As expected, pAKT(S473) levels were low in the kidney tumors from untreated <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup>+- </sup>mice, and were increased by treatment with RAD001, but not NVP-BEZ235. In addition, in vitro studies demonstrate that in full serum pAKT(S473) levels are low in Tsc2 null MEF lines, are increased somewhat with RAD001 treatment, and reduced somewhat by NVP-BEZ235 treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Despite the short-term effects of treatment with NVP-BEZ235, we found that in both the 4 week course of drug, and 4-week course with 8-week off drug follow-up, that RAD001 and NVP-BEZ235 had indistinguishable effects, with marked regrowth of tumor following treatment cessation. Thus, these observations suggest that the reactivation of mTORC1 in TSC-related neoplasms that might occur with rapamycin/RAD001 treatment has no significant clinical effect, at least in this Tsc model tumor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have conducted a trial of the pure mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001 and the combined PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 in a mouse model of TSC in which the mice develop renal cystadenomas. Both drugs were highly effective at tumor growth suppression, and there was no difference between combined PI3K-mTOR blockade in comparison to mTORC1 inhibition alone. When treatment was discontinued, rapid tumor regrowth was seen after each drug. In this model, both drugs appear to have a primarily cytostatic effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>(TSC): Tuberous sclerosis; (AML): angiomyolipoma; (LAM): lymphangioleiomyomatosis; (ENU): N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This work was partially supported by Novartis Pharma AG.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KP performed most of the experimentation in this project, including mouse treatment, pathology preparation, and tumor scoring.
