Here, we present a new long-lived yeast deletion mutation,afo1 (for aging factor one), that confers a 60% increase in replicative lifespan. AFO1/MRPL25 codes for a protein that is contained in the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. Double mutant experiments indicate that the longevity-increasing action of the afo1 mutation is independent of mitochondrial translation, yet involves the cytoplasmic Tor1p as well as the growth-controlling transcription factor Sfp1p. In their final cell cycle, the long-lived mutant cells do show the phenotypes of yeast apoptosis indicating that the longevity of the mutant is not caused by an inability to undergo programmed cell death. Furthermore, the afo1 mutation displays high resistance against oxidants. Despite the respiratory deficiency the mutant has paradoxical increase in growth rate compared to generic petite mutants. A comparison of the single and double mutant strains for afo1 and fob1 shows that the longevity phenotype of afo1 is independent of the formation of ERCs (ribosomal DNA minicircles). AFO1/MRPL25 function establishes a new connection between mitochondria, metabolism and aging. </p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</kwd><kwd>yeast mother cell-specific ageing</kwd><kwd>TOR complex</kwd><kwd>rapamycin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) mother cell-specific aging has been shown to be based on the asymmetric distribution of damaged cellular material including oxidized proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>]. The mother cell progressively accumulates this material and ages depending on the number of cell division cycles, while the daughter "rejuvenates" and enjoys a full lifespan. Young daughter cells and old (senescent) mother cells can be efficiently separated based on their different size, by elutriation centrifugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. </p><p>At least some biochemical and genetic mechanisms of aging are conserved throughout the evolution of eukaryotes. A prominent hypothesis postulates that the progressive deterioration of mitochondrial metabolism leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that oxidize vulnerable cellular proteins and lipids, while damaging the genome. The cell's genetic response to this oxidative stress may appear as a "genetic program of aging". In this light, some of the current aging theories could well be interrelated and compatible among each other (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>]). </p><p>The TOR signaling pathway is highly conserved from yeast to human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. It regulates nutrient responses by modulating the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of transcription factors including Sfp1p, which governs ribosome biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Down-regulation of TOR kinase induces entry into stationary phase and stimulates autophagy, a process that is vital for survival in conditions of starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. TOR kinase activity may also be involved in the retrograde response of cells that adapt their nuclear transcriptome to defects in mitochondrial respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Yeast possesses two closely related proteins, Tor1p and Tor2p, forming two "TOR complexes" among which only one, TORC1 (containing either Tor1p or Tor2p and active in growth control), is inhibited by rapamycin. Deletion of <italic>TOR2 </italic>is lethal due to its essential function in TORC2 (acting on determination of cell polarity). Deletion of <italic>TOR1 </italic>leads to an increase in mitochondrial respiration and protein density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] and to a 15% increase in replicative lifespan, thus establishing a link between nutrition, metabolism, and longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. </p><p>In this paper we are presenting a novel long-lived mutant of yeast that establishes a new connection between mitochondria, metabolism and aging. The life-prolonging mutation affects a gene encoding a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, leads to respiratory deficiency, and relies on <italic>TOR1 </italic>to confer longevity. </p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>A novel yeast mutant with reduced replicative aging </title><p>We compared the transcriptome of senescent yeast mother cells (fraction V) with young daughter cells (fraction II) after separating them by elutriation centrifugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. Senescent cells were found to upregulate 39 genes and to down-regulate 53 transcripts. Deletion mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>] corresponding to these 92 genes were tested for their resistance or hypersensitivity to five different oxidants (hydrogen peroxide, <italic>tert</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP), diamide, cumene hydroperoxide, and menadione). Only two mutants were found to be consistently resistant against more than one oxidant (and not hypersensitive to any other oxidant). Among these two mutants only one, deleted for YGR076C/<italic>MRPL25 </italic>(later termed <italic>AFO1</italic>, see below) caused a mother cell-specific lifespan expansion on the standard media used by us (SC + 2% glucose) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This deletion mutation conferred resistance to diamide and t-BHP and a somewhat weaker resistance to hydrogen peroxide, as well as a 50% reduced ROS production (as compared to the BY4741 &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>mutant). ROS production was measured by quantitation of fluorescence signals obtained after dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. The mutant displayed a 60% increase in the median and a 71% increase in the maximum lifespan (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The mutant only grew on media containing fermentable carbon sources and hence is respiration deficient. We therefore asked if the respiratory deficiency caused the increased replicative life span. However, a <italic>bona fide </italic>BY4741 &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>mutant did not show any extension in replicative life span (as compared to BY4741 WT cells), meaning that lack of respiration is not sufficient to confer longevity to mother cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We also tested if <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394; cells displayed the retrograde response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] by measuring <italic>CIT2 </italic>transcription and no effect of the <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394; mutation could be discerned (see Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SF1">1</xref>). We conclude that the elongation of lifespan observed here is not caused by respiratory deficiency and is independent of the retrograde response as defined by Jazwinski [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and Butow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. </p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><title><italic>AFO1 </italic>codes for a mitochondrial ribosomal protein </title><p><italic>AFO1 </italic>(YGR076C) codes for MrpL25p, identified by proteomic analysis as a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Because of its remarkable longevity phenotype, we re-named the gene <italic>AFO1</italic>(for aging factor one). A recombinant construct in which Afo1p was fused in its C-terminus with GFP (Afo1-GFP) was transfected into a heterozygous <italic>afo1&#x00394;</italic>strain. Tetrad dissection revealed that the Afo1-GFP could replace endogenous Afo1p to enable growth on a non-fermentable carbon source. Confocal fluorescence microscopy confirmed that the protein is located in mitochondria irrespective of the cellular age and the genetic background (supplementary material, Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SF2">2</xref>). The deletion mutant <italic>afo1&#x00394; </italic>exhibited a &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>petite phenotype, meaning that it failed to grow on glycerol media and lacked DAPI-detectable mitochondrial DNA. The mutant also showed negligible oxygen consumption when growing on glucose (data not shown). However, in contrast to a <italic>bona fide </italic>BY4741 &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>petite mutant, which grew much more slowly than WT cells on standard media with 2% glucose as carbon source, the <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394; mutant grew as rapidly as WT cells. The growth properties of the mutant and its metabolic implications will be published in detail elsewhere. The average size of the <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells in exponential phase was equal to that of WT cells, while cells of the &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>strain were about 20% larger. Importantly, disruption of the <italic>AFO1 </italic>gene in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>cells restored rapid growth, hence reversing the growth defect induced by the absence of mitochondrial DNA. </p><p>To obtain definite genetic proof that the <italic>AFO1 </italic>deletion caused the resistance against oxidative stress and the extension of the life span described above, we performed co-segregation tests in meiotic tetrads after out-crossing the <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394; strain in an isogenic cross. In 10 unselected tetrads, which all revealed a regular 2:2 segregation, we observed strict co-segregation of G418 resistance indicating the presence of the gene deletion, respiratory deficiency, and resistance against hydrogen peroxide stress (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2A">2A</xref>). We also tested the lifespan of all four haploid progeny of one tetrad and found consistent co-segregation of the deletion allele of <italic>afo1 </italic>with extended lifespan (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2B">2B</xref>). Furthermore, we also tested if the phenotype of the mutant might result from changes of the expression of the two neighboring genes of <italic>AFO1</italic>. No such effect was apparent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2C">2C</xref>). We conclude that lack of <italic>AFO1 </italic>results in long lifespan and the oxidative stress resistance. </p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Lifespans of isogenic strains <italic>afo1&#x00394;</italic>, wild type BY4741 and BY4741 &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>.

For this, we investigated the lifespan, growth properties and oxidative stress resistance of two additional deletion mutants in the genes <italic>MRP17 </italic>and <italic>PPE1</italic>, encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins of yeast. YKL003C&#x00394; (<italic>mrp17&#x00394;</italic>) was found to be resistant against diamide, t-BHP and juglone, but was hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide and had a normal lifespan. YHR075C&#x00394; (<italic>ppe1&#x00394;</italic>) was resistant against diamide, yet had a normal lifespan (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Therefore, the effect of the <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394; deletion mutant on lifespan is gene-specific. </p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p> Lifespans of the strains deleted for <italic>ppe1 </italic>and <italic>mrp17. </italic>The single deletion strains for YKL003C (encoding for Mrp17p) and YHR075C (encoding for Ppe1p), both of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit, were tested for their lifespan. The strains were constructed in the BY4741 background. The measured lifespans were not significantly different from wild type (p&#x0003c;0.02). </p></caption><graphic xlink:href="aging-01-622-g003"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2_3"><title>Longevity mediated by the <italic>afo1 </italic>deletion is mediated by the <italic>TOR1 </italic>pathway </title><p>Two independent lines of evidence revealed that the <italic>afo1 </italic>deletion confers longevity and oxidative stress resistance through the <italic>TOR1 </italic>signaling pathway. First, we chromosomally integrated a C-terminally GFP-labeled version of the transcription factor, Sfp1p, at the <italic>SFP1 </italic>locus under the control of the native promotor in strains <italic>afo1&#x00394;, </italic>BY4741 WT and BY4741 &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>. Sfp1p is activated by the TOR1 and PKA pathways and is regulated by shuttling between the nucleus in its active form and the cytoplasm upon deactivation. Sfp1p is a major regulator of cytoplasmic ribosome synthesis and, consequently, of cellular growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. As expected, addition of the Tor1p inhibitor rapamycin to WT cells induced the translocation of Sfp1p from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In the <italic>bona fide </italic>BY4741 &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>strain, Sfp1p was found constitutively in the cytoplasm, even in the absence of rapamycin. In stark contrast, in the <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394; mutant, Sfp1p was constitutively present in the nucleus, and rapamycin failed to induce the nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation of Sfp1p (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4A">4A</xref>). Similar results were obtained with an alternative Tor1p inhibitor, arsenite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Arsenite induced the nucleocyto-plasmic translocation of Sfp1p in WT cells, while Sfp1p stayed in the cytoplasm of &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>cells and in the nuclei of <italic>afo1 </italic>mutant cells, irrespective of the addition of arsenite (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4B">4B</xref>). Rapamycin failed to inhibit the growth of <italic>afo1 </italic>mutant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Altogether, these data suggested that <italic>TOR1 </italic>signaling might govern the longevity of <italic>afo1 </italic>cells. The relation between <italic>TOR1 </italic>and <italic>AFO1 </italic>was further explored by epistasis experiments using double mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The lifespan of the double deletion strain (<italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>tor1&#x00394;</italic>) was similar to the lifespan of the <italic>tor1 </italic>deletion strain, i.e. about 15% longer than wild type (in good agreement with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]). However, the double mutant <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394;,<italic>tor1&#x00394; </italic>strain aged more rapidly than the single mutant <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394; strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We conclude that a functional <italic>TOR1 </italic>gene is needed for exerting the lifespan-prolonging effect of <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394;. </p><p>We constructed single and double knockout <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>sfp1</italic>&#x00394; mutant strains and tested their mother cell-specific lifespan and oxidative stress resistance. The median lifespan of <italic>sfp1</italic>&#x00394; cells was shortened considerably as compared to WT cells, and the lifespan of the double <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>sfp1</italic>&#x00394; mutant was longer than that of the <italic>sfp</italic>1&#x00394; mutant, yet shorter than WT and <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6A">6A</xref>). Hence, the very short lifespan of <italic>sfp1</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells is partially rescued by the <italic>afo1 </italic>mutation. Like the double <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394;,<italic>sfp1</italic>&#x00394; mutant, <italic>sfp1&#x00394; </italic>cells displayed a major growth defect. When the <italic>sfp1</italic>&#x00394; strain was made &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>with ethidium bromide, cell growth was not further inhibited (data not shown). Comparison of the strains on plates containing 1.6 mM t-BHP revealed that <italic>afo1&#x00394; </italic>is moderately resistant, while single <italic>sfp1&#x00394; </italic>and double <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394;,<italic>sfp1</italic>&#x00394; mutants exhibited a similar degree of high resistance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6B">6B</xref>). Taken together, these results show that the lifespan-extending effect of <italic>afo1&#x00394;</italic>is most likely independent of the presence of <italic>SFP1</italic>. </p><fig id="F4A" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4A.</label><caption><p>Influence of rapamycin on subcellular localization of the transcription factor, Sfp1p.

As shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], old mother cells of the wild type display all of the known markers of yeast apoptosis while these markers are absent from young cells. To tackle this problem, we isolated young (fraction II) and old cells (fraction V) from WT and <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394; cells by elutriation centrifugation and tested several markers of apoptosis such as externalization of phosphatidyl serine and DNA strand breaks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Our data clearly indicated that <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394; cells did not lose the ability to undergo apoptosis. In spite of a 60% longer median lifespan, senescent mother cells finally succumbed to apoptosis. We conclude that the components of the programmed cell death pathway that a yeast cell has at its disposal, do not cause replicative aging, but that <italic>vice versa </italic>replicative aging finally leads to cell death via apoptosis. </p><p>We also investigated whether the longevity phenotype of the <italic>afo1&#x00394; </italic>mutant might be mechanistically related to the production of extrachromosomal rDNA minicircles (ERCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. <italic>FOB1 </italic>encodes a protein required for the unidirectional replication fork block in rDNA replication.

Thus, the lifespan-extension observed in the <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394; strain occurs in the presence of ERCs and is not further increased when ERCs are absent, consequently ERCs do not influence longevity in the <italic>afo1&#x00394; </italic>strain. </p><fig id="F6A" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 6A.</label><caption><p>The double mutant strain, <italic>sfp1&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>afo1&#x00394;</italic> was constructed as described in the Materials and Methods section, tested for lifespan, and compared with both single mutant strains and the wild type.

As an indicator of the retrograde response, expression of the peroxisomal Cit2p citrate synthase is usually measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. Yeast strains displaying a strong retrograde response increase their replicative lifespan as &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>strains over that of the corresponding &#x003c1;<sup>+</sup>strain. The retrograde response is generally suppressed in 2% glucose but strong on raffinose as sole carbon source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. We have measured <italic>CIT2 </italic>transcription under the conditions used in this study and found no increase in the transcript of this gene (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SF1">1</xref>), explaining why the &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>strain in the BY4741 series shows the same lifespan as wild type. When raffinose was used as a carbon source, <italic>CIT2 </italic>transcription was increased, and as expected, an increase in the lifespan of the <italic>bona fide </italic>BY4741 &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>strain was observed (unpublished observation). However, during growth on 2% glucose when the retrograde response is absent in our strain background, we do observe the increase in lifespan described in the present paper. We therefore conclude that the mechanism leading to this increase must be different from the retrograde response. </p><p>The lifespan elongation described for the <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394; mutant strain depends on a signal transmitted from mitochondria to the nucleo-cytoplasmic protein synthesis system and has a strong influence on replicative aging, vegetative growth, and oxidative stress resistance (see below). We propose to call this regulatory signaling interaction &#x0201e;mitochondrial back-signaling" to dis-tinguish it from the retrograde response described by Jazwinski [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>] and Butow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>]. </p></sec><sec id="s3_2"><title>Evidence for involvement of the TOR1 pathway in longevity of the <italic>afo1 </italic>deletion strain </title><p>The nature of the signal created by Afo1p is unknown, especially since we found this ribosomal protein to be located in mitochondria in all physiological situations tested, including senescent yeast mother cells. Nonetheless, two independent lines of evidence support the notion that increased activity of <italic>TOR1 </italic>determines the longevity of the <italic>afo1 </italic>deletion mutant. First, in the double mutant deleted for both <italic>TOR1 </italic>and <italic>AFO1</italic>, a lifespan is observed that is only moderately longer than that of the wild type and is identical with the lifespan of the <italic>tor1</italic>&#x00394; single mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Thus, paradoxically, the relatively small but significant elongation of the lifespan of &#x003c1;<sup>+</sup>respiring <italic>tor1</italic>&#x00394; cells depends on inactivation of Tor1p, while the large increase in lifespan in the non-respiring <italic>afo1&#x00394; </italic>cells depends on activity of the Tor1p. Second, rapamycin fails to abolish the nuclear location of the transcription factor, Sfp1p, an indicator of Tor1p activity, in <italic>afo1&#x00394; </italic>cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4A">4A</xref>). Likewise, arsenite, another inhibitor of Tor1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>], fails to abolish the nuclear location of the transcription factor, Sfp1p, in <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394; cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4B">4B</xref>). Sfp1p is well known to be one of the major metabolic regulators of growth and ribosome biosynthesis, which is limiting for growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. The data presented here seem to indicate that Sfp1p activity in the nucleus could be crucial for longevity. The double mutant experiments shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> indicate that the <italic>sfp1</italic>&#x00394; and the <italic>afo1</italic>&#x00394; mutations exert their influence on longevity independently of each other. Moreover, we tested TORC1 kinase activity in WT, &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>and in <italic>afo</italic>1&#x00394; cells (data not shown) and found that the long-lived mutant, like the &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>strain displayed only very weak TORC1 kinase activity. These results indicate that the Tor1p activity needed for longevity in the mutant might be feedback-regulated by Sfp1p and/or maybe independent of TORC1kinase activity. </p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Apoptotic markers in old mother cells (fraction V) of the mutant <italic>afo1&#x00394; </italic>strain.

These experimental results show once again that replicative aging is multifactorial and that the limiting factor for the determination of the replicative lifespan may be very different for different strains and for different growth conditions. The physiological characterization of the long-lived mutant shows a relationship of the yeast replicative aging process to two cellular processes that have also been found to determine aging in higher organisms: i) nutritional signaling through the highly conserved TOR pathway, and ii) generation of and defense against internally generated oxidative stress molecules (ROS). </p></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p><underline>Media. </underline> The following media were used in this study: complex medium (YPD) containing 1% yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone and 2% (w/v) D-glucose; synthetic complete glucose medium (SC-glucose) containing 2% (w/v) D-glucose, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulphate, 0.5% ammonium sulphate and 10 mL complete dropout; synthetic complete raffinose (SC-raffinose), synthetic complete glycerol medium (SC-glycerol) or synthetic complete lactate medium (SC-lactate), containing the same ingredients as SC-glucose, except that 2% (w/v) D-glucose is replaced by 2% (w/v) raffinose, 2% (v/v) glycerol or 3% (w/v) lactate as a carbon source; synthetic minimal medium (SD) containing 2% (w/v) D-glucose, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulphate and 0.5% ammonium sulphate.

Before the separation, the cells were grown in 100 mL of YPD medium at 28&#x000b0;C on a rotary shaker for 24 h. Then, the cells were harvested at 3000 rpm and resuspended in 1X PBS buffer (8 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, 1.44 g of Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.24 g of KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 1 L) at 4&#x000b0;C. The elutriation chamber was loaded with 4.2 mL of cell suspension corresponding to about 109 cells. To separate cell fractions with different diameters, the chamber was loaded at a flow rate of 10 mL/min and a rotor speed of 3200 rpm. Cells with a diameter &#x0003c;5 &#x003bc;m were elutriated (fraction I). To collect fraction II (diameter 5-7 &#x003bc;m), the flow rate was set to 15 mL/min and a rotor speed to 2700 rpm. Fraction III (diameter 7-8.5 &#x003bc;m) was elutriated at 2400 rpm., fraction IV (diameter 8.5-10 &#x003bc;m) at 2000 rpm. and, finally, fraction V (diameter 10-15 &#x003bc;m) at 1350 rpm.

Median lifespan is the best-suited single parameter to describe a lifespan distribution. To determine whether two given lifespan distributions are significantly different at the 98% confidence level, Breslow, Tarone-Ware and log-rank statistics were used. All statistical calculations were performed using the software package SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). </p><p><underline>Sensitivity to oxidants. </underline> Plate tests for sensitivity to oxidants were performed by spotting cell cultures onto SC-glucose plates containing various concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(2-4 mM) and t-BHP (0.8-2 mM).

Sensitivity was determined by comparison of growth with that of the wild-type strain after incubation at 28&#x000b0;C for three days. RNA preparation and Northern analysis RNA was prepared from log-phase cells in SC-glucose and SC-raffinose with the RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen, Vienna, Austria). Heat-denatured RNA samples (10 &#x003bc;g) were separated by electrophoresis (5 h, 5 V/cm) in a 1.3% (w/v) agarose gel containing 0.6 M formaldehyde, transferred to a nylon membrane, and immobilized by irradiation with UV light (UV Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

A sample was taken for confocal microscopy (cells without rapamycin treatment). The rest of the culture was treated for 4 hours with 100 nM rapamycin (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA, USA) and further inoculated at 28&#x000b0;C. Before cells were used for confocal microscopy, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh SC-glucose medium.
