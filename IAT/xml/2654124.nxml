Fzo1 and Mgm1 are conserved guanosine triphosphatases that reside in the outer and inner membranes, respectively. At each membrane, these conserved proteins are required for the distinct steps of membrane tethering and lipid mixing. The third essential component is Ugo1, an outer membrane protein in the mitochondrial transport protein family. We show that Ugo1 is a modified member of this family, containing three transmembrane domains and existing as a dimer, a structure that is critical for the fusion function of Ugo1. Our functional analysis of Ugo1 indicates that it is required distinctly for both outer and inner membrane fusion after membrane tethering, indicating that it operates at the lipid-mixing step of fusion. This role is distinct from the fusion dynamin-related proteins and thus demonstrates that at each membrane, a single fusion protein is not sufficient to drive the lipid-mixing step, but instead, this step requires a more complex assembly of proteins.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondrial fusion is a conserved and functionally important process that evolved to create a more connected compartment that facilitates content exchange and access to mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Hoppins et al., 2007</xref>). Unlike other fusion events, mitochondrial fusion is not mediated by SNAREs but instead is driven by the action of dynamin-related proteins (DRPs). DRPs are GTPases that, through their ability to self-assemble, control a variety of membrane remodeling events. Through an analysis of mitochondrial fusion in vitro, we have demonstrated that two distinct DRPs are essential for fusion. Specifically, the transmembrane proteins Fzo1 (yeast)/Mfn1/2 (mammals) and Mgm1 (yeast)/Opa1 (mammals) drive outer and inner mitochondrial membrane fusion, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Meeusen et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2006</xref>). Data suggest a model in which, in the initial stages of fusion, outer and inner membrane tethering is mediated by the self-assembly of mitochondrial fusion DRPs in trans via intermolecular coiled-coil interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ishihara et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Koshiba et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Meeusen et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Griffin and Chan, 2006</xref>). Analysis of mutant alleles of the fusion DRPs indicates that membrane tethering is separable from subsequent lipid content mixing, which completes the membrane fusion process, and that the mitochondrial fusion DRPs are essential at both stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Meeusen et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>To date, the only non-DRP essential for mitochondrial fusion is Ugo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sesaki and Jensen, 2001</xref>). Although Ugo1 is localized to the outer membrane, it is classified as a member of the mitochondrial transport/carrier protein family by virtue of possessing signature energy transfer motifs (ETMs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Belenkiy et al., 2000</xref>). Mitochondrial transport proteins are typically inner membrane proteins composed of three homologous carrier repeats of &#x0223c;100 amino acids, which each contain two helical transmembrane domains (TMDs). Based on the structure of the mitochondrial ATP/ADP carrier, the ETMs are thought to act together to close the central pore formed by the six TMDs through an intramolecular salt bridge network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pebay-Peyroula et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nury et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with its classification, there are three ETMs present in Ugo1; however, the third motif lacks a critical and conserved charged residue. Mutational analysis of the first two ETMs in Ugo1 indicates that both are important for fusion but that the second motif is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Coonrod et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Hydropathy analysis of Ugo1 predicts that, like other transport proteins, there are six regions that may function as TMDs. However, protease protection analysis of Ugo1 has demonstrated that its C terminus is in the intermembrane space (IMS), and the N terminus is localized in the cytosol, constraining Ugo1 to an odd number of TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sesaki and Jensen, 2001</xref>). These findings were initially interpreted to indicate that Ugo1 contains a single TMD; however, more recent protease protection analysis indicates that Ugo1 contains either three or five membrane-spanning regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Coonrod et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Interaction data indicate that Ugo1 potentially connects the outer and inner membrane fusion DRPs via two nonoverlapping, independent Fzo1 and Mgm1 interaction regions within the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of Ugo1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sesaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sesaki and Jensen, 2004</xref>). A small C-terminal deletion of Fzo1 simultaneously abolishes the Fzo1&#x02013;Ugo1 interaction and causes loss of mitochondrial fusion activity in vivo, suggesting that the Fzo1&#x02013;Ugo1 interaction is mechanistically important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sesaki and Jensen, 2004</xref>). However, the exact functional relevance of this interaction is not known. Indeed, the mechanistic role of Ugo1 in fusion is not known, specifically whether it is required for outer or inner membrane fusion or if it functions at either the membrane tethering or lipid-mixing steps. In this study, we have determined the role of Ugo1 in fusion by characterizing its structure and function in vitro, where we can resolve membrane tethering and lipid-mixing steps of outer and inner membrane fusion events. Our findings demonstrate that Ugo1 plays a unique, postmembrane tethering role in mitochondrial fusion. This role is distinct from the fusion DRPs and thus demonstrates that at each membrane, a single fusion protein is not sufficient to drive the lipid-mixing step, but instead, this stage requires a more complex assembly of proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Ugo1 contains three TMDs</title><p>Determination of Ugo1 topology is critical to understand its function in mitochondrial fusion, specifically in evaluating its tertiary and quaternary structure and its interactions with the outer and inner membrane fusion DRPs, Fzo1 and Mgm1. To determine the exact topology of Ugo1, we generated anti-Ugo1 antibodies and created functional, internally epitope-tagged Ugo1 alleles for use in protease protection experiments.</p><p>We examined the topology of Ugo1 by treating isolated mitochondria with the exogenous protease trypsin. Mitochondria were isolated from a strain expressing a functional C-terminal influenza HA epitope-tagged Ugo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wong et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with published observations, in intact mitochondria, we detected a protected C-terminal fragment of Ugo1 of &#x0223c;23 kD, which indicates that the C terminus resides in an internal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, compare lane 1 with lane 5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sesaki and Jensen, 2001</xref>). To further explore Ugo1 topology, we used a polyclonal antibody to the N-terminal 125 amino acids of Ugo1 and observed that several Ugo1 fragments in the range of 17&#x02013;20 kD were protected from trypsin digestion in intact mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, compare lane 6 with lane 10). Under these conditions, the outer membrane marker Fzo1 was digested completely, indicating that the cytosolic face of the outer membrane was fully accessible to the protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In addition, both IMS (cytochrome b2 and the C-terminal soluble domain of Tim23) and matrix (Abf2) marker proteins were protected from proteolysis, confirming that the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes were intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). However, when both inner and outer mitochondrial membranes were disrupted by treatment with detergent, complete proteolysis of Ugo1 was observed, as detected by both polyclonal and anti-HA antibodies and marker proteins in all mitochondrial compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of Ugo1 topology.</bold> (A and B) Mitochondria were left intact (lanes 5 and 10), converted to mitoplasts (lanes 3 and 8; mitoplast supernatant, lanes 4 and 9), or solubilized (lanes 2 and 7) before treatment with (+) or without (&#x02212;) trypsin (lanes 1 and 6) and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the indicated antisera.

In mitoplasts, the matrix marker Abf2 was protected from trypsin digestion, indicating that the inner membrane was intact, whereas, as expected, the IMS protein cytochrome b2 and the C-terminal IMS domain of Tim23 were both degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Under these conditions, the HA-tagged C terminus of Ugo1 behaved exactly like the Tim23 IMS marker and was also sensitive to digestion in mitoplasts, which is in agreement with published data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, compare lane 3 with lane 5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sesaki and Jensen, 2001</xref>). This result indicates that the C terminus of Ugo1 resides in the IMS. Significantly, the N-terminal Ugo1 species detected using polyclonal anti-Ugo1 antibodies were accessible to trypsin digestion in outer membrane&#x02013;permeabilized mitoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, compare lane 8 with lane 10). Ugo1 was readily proteolyzed in detergent-solubilized mitochondria, and no Ugo1 species were detected in the supernatant of the mitoplast fractions, indicating that they are not intrinsically protease resistant and instead are protected in mitochondria from proteolysis by an intact outer membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, lanes 2 and 7 and lanes 4 and 9).</p><p>Our polyclonal antibodies directed to the first Ugo1 125 residues revealed an IMS region that was previously undetected because prior analyses relied on an N-terminal epitope-tagged version of Ugo1 that was accessible to protease in intact mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sesaki and Jensen, 2001</xref>). Thus, our data indicate that there are at least two regions of Ugo1 localized to IMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). In combination with hydropathy plot analysis, these protease protection data predict that there is an N-terminal IMS region between the first and second predicted TMDs in Ugo1 of &#x0223c;100 amino acids. These data are consistent with three models of Ugo1 topology in which Ugo1 contains three or five TMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p><p>To distinguish between these models, we generated versions of Ugo1 with internal HA tags located in predicted loop regions that follow potential TMDs ending at amino acid 393 (Ugo1<sup>HA393</sup>) or 438 (Ugo1<sup>HA438</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Both Ugo1<sup>HA393</sup> and Ugo1<sup>HA438</sup> were functional as assessed by their ability to rescue the mitochondrial DNA loss and glycerol growth defects of <italic>&#x00394;ugo1</italic> cells (unpublished data), indicating that they are correctly targeted to the outer membrane and are suitable for topology analysis. Protease protection analysis of intact mitochondria isolated from yeast strains expressing Ugo1<sup>HA393</sup> and Ugo1<sup>HA438</sup> revealed that the HA epitope in both versions is protease resistant but becomes sensitive to trypsin proteolysis in outer membrane&#x02013;permeabilized mitoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, lanes 1, 3, and 5). These data indicate that regions of Ugo1 at amino acid 393 and 438 are localized to the IMS. Consistently, these regions were readily proteolyzed in detergent-solubilized mitochondria and were not detected in the supernatant of the mitoplast fractions, indicating that they are protected from proteolysis by an intact outer membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, lanes 2 and 4). We conclude from these data that there are no TMDs in the C-terminal half of Ugo1.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Ugo1 contains three membrane-spanning domains.</bold> (A) A schematic of Ugo1 as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> with arrows indicating the locations of internal triple HA tags.

Our data place the N-terminal 14-kD portion of Ugo1 and the loop between the second and third TMD in the cytosol and the loop between the first and second TMD and the 23-kD C-terminal region in IMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). This topology is consistent with the ability of Ugo1 to independently interact with the outer and inner membrane fusion DRPs, Fzo1 and Mgm1, as significant portions that likely represent interaction regions are positioned appropriately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sesaki and Jensen, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Dimerization of Ugo1 creates a modified version of a typical transport protein</title><p>In contrast to inner membrane carrier proteins, we have determined that Ugo1 possesses only three TMDs. However, similar to transport proteins, the first and third TMDs of Ugo1 possess ETMs that form critical intramolecular salt bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). It has been shown that the charged residues in ETM in the third TMD and not in the first TMD of Ugo1 are important for mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Coonrod et al., 2007</xref>). Given the divergence of Ugo1, we considered the possibility that ETMs in Ugo1 form intermolecular rather than intramolecular salt bridges. In this case, ETMs would participate in the formation of a six TMD Ugo1 dimer, which would be similar to the mitochondrial transport family topology.</p><p>To test this possibility, we focused our analysis on the quaternary structure of Ugo1. Specifically, we determined the native size of Ugo1 in yeast mitochondria by high resolution clear native PAGE (hrCN-PAGE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Wittig et al., 2007</xref>). After solubilization with digitonin, mitochondrial proteins were subjected to hrCN-PAGE that was capable of resolving 70&#x02013;700-kD-sized protein species. By Western analysis with polyclonal antibodies directed against the N terminus of Ugo1, we observed that the most abundant form of Ugo1 in wild-type mitochondria was a species with an apparent molecular mass of 115 kD, which is consistent with the size of a Ugo1 dimer (Ugo1 M<sub>r</sub> 57,470; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, lane 1). This species was not detected with antibodies directed against either Fzo1 or Mgm1 and was present in mitochondria lacking Fzo1 or Mgm1 but was absent in mitochondria isolated from a <italic>&#x00394;ugo1</italic> strain, which is consistent with the interpretation that this 115-kD species represents a Ugo1 homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, lane 2; and not depicted). To further test that Ugo1 exists as dimer, we coexpressed Ugo1-HA and Ugo1-Flag in cells and asked whether they interact in mitochondria by immunoprecipitation analysis. We observed that anti-HA antibodies immunoprecipitated Ugo1-HA and Ugo1-Flag from chemically cross-linked mitochondrial extracts as detected by Western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). This interaction was specific as judged by the fact that anti-HA immunoprecipitation of Ugo1-Flag was dependent on the HA-tagged form of Ugo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, compare lane 2 with lane 4). In addition, analysis of the reciprocal immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag antibodies detected a Ugo1-Flag&#x02013;Ugo1-HA interaction, further supporting our conclusion that Ugo1 forms a dimer in the mitochondrial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, lane 6).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Native Ugo1 forms a 115-kD homooligomer that requires the conserved ETMs.</bold> (A) Mitochondria isolated from &#x00394;ugo1 plus empty vector or &#x00394;ugo1 expressing either <italic>UGO1</italic>, Ugo1<sup>D134R</sup>, Ugo1<sup>R137D</sup>, Ugo1<sup>D312R</sup>, or Ugo1<sup>R315D</sup> were solubilized in 1.5% digitonin and analyzed by hrCN-PAGE and immunodetection with Ugo1 polyclonal antiserum.

The graph represents the quantification of digitonin lysate Ugo1 total protein level normalized to porin as detected by SDS-PAGE analysis versus that detected in the 115-kD Ugo1 species resolved by hrCN-PAGE analysis. Quantification was performed using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200809099R_GS_Fig3"/></fig><p>To test the possibility that the ETMs participate in the formation of the 115-kD Ugo1-containing complex, we examined Ugo1 native structure in four charge reversal Ugo1 point mutants: D134R, R137D, D312R, and R315D. To examine Ugo1 quaternary structure, mitochondria from strains expressing Ugo1<sup>D134R</sup>, Ugo1<sup>R137D</sup>, Ugo1<sup>D312R</sup>, or Ugo1<sup>R315D</sup> were solubilized and analyzed by hrCN-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Ugo1 polyclonal antibodies. This analysis revealed that, as compared with Ugo1 in wild-type mitochondria, all four mutations cause a decrease in the abundance of 115-kD Ugo1 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;6). Mutations in the first ETM, Ugo1<sup>D134R</sup> and Ugo1<sup>R137D</sup>, caused a less severe decrease in the abundance of the 115-kD Ugo1 species compared with the equivalent mutations in the second motif, Ugo1<sup>D312R</sup> and Ugo1<sup>R315D</sup>, which is consistent with the report that fusion activity in vivo is more dependent on the second ETM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Coonrod et al., 2007</xref>). To rule out the possibility that mutations in ETMs simply caused a decrease in the steady-state level of Ugo1, the same samples that were analyzed by hrCN-PAGE were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE to resolve Ugo1 monomers. In contrast to our observations with hrCN-PAGE, Western analysis of SDS-PAGE indicates that all mutant Ugo1 protein levels were comparable with those observed in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). To further test our conclusion that the charge reversal mutations in the second ETM destabilized the Ugo1 dimer, we examined the hydrodynamic properties of digitonin-solubilized mitochondrial extracts by sucrose gradient centrifugation. This technique is likely to be less stringent than hrCN-PAGE; thus, we compared wild type to Ugo1<sup>D312R/R315D</sup>, which contains both charge reversals in the critical second ETM and cannot support fusion in vivo and is thus more severe than the single charge reversals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Coonrod et al., 2007</xref>). As expected, similar to the Ugo1<sup>D312R</sup> and Ugo1<sup>R315D</sup> single mutants, analysis of Ugo1<sup>D312R/R315D</sup> mitochondria by hrCN-PAGE demonstrated that a 115-kD Ugo1 species is absent. Consistently, analysis of the hydrodynamic properties of Ugo1 by sucrose gradient centrifugation indicated that the sedimentation profile of Ugo1<sup>D312R/R315D</sup> is distinct from wild type as is the calculated sedimentation coefficient for Ugo1<sup>D312R/R315D</sup> (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809099/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809099/DC1</ext-link>). Specifically, we observed that the sedimentation coefficient calculated using standards for Ugo1<sup>D312R/R315D</sup> was smaller than wild-type Ugo1, whereas the sedimentation coefficients for the internal control porin were comparable from extracts prepared from Ugo1<sup>D312R/R315D</sup> and Ugo1 mitochondria (Fig. S1).

Significantly, and in contrast to the distinct outer and inner membrane defects associated with <italic>fzo1</italic> and <italic>mgm1</italic> mutant mitochondria, respectively, our analysis revealed that <italic>ugo1<sup>ts</sup></italic> mitochondria are defective for either outer or inner membrane fusion in an allele-specific manner.

These structures contain two or more matrices whose inner membranes are tightly aligned along an interface, surrounded by a single outer membrane that is also tightly aligned with adjacent inner membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Analysis of S1 <italic>ugo1<sup>ts</sup></italic> mitochondria by EM confirmed our observations from the fluorescent outer membrane fusion assay. Specifically, the amount of outer membrane&#x02013;fused structures observed in <italic>ugo1-4</italic> and <italic>ugo1-5</italic> reactions was comparable with the amount observed in wild-type and <italic>mgm1-5</italic> reactions, indicating that outer membrane fusion is unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>, black bars).

We have previously shown in vitro that Fzo1 is required on both mitochondrial partners for efficient outer membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Meeusen et al., 2004</xref>). Also, mutations in the C-terminal heptad repeat of Mfn2 block mitochondrial fusion and cause an accumulation of aggregated mitochondria in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Koshiba et al., 2004</xref>). The spacing between mitochondria within these aggregates is comparable with the dimensions of the antiparallel dimer structure formed by two C-terminal heptad repeat regions in vitro, which is consistent with the hypothesis that they represent stalled Mfn1/2-tethered organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Koshiba et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We looked for outer membrane&#x02013;tethered structures that were functionally relevant for mitochondrial fusion in our yeast in vitro assay under S1 conditions. Under S1 conditions with wild-type mitochondria, EM analysis revealed a population of closely associated mitochondria (22%, <italic>n</italic> = 350; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). To discern structures that were engaged from those that were touching indiscriminately, we counted only those with distinct morphological features consistent with membrane-tethered intermediates (4.5%, <italic>n</italic> = 350; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Specifically, in regions of mitochondrial association, we looked for the outer membranes to be reciprocally deformed and evenly spaced apart with an electron-dense region between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A [arrows] and B [boxes]</xref>). These structures were less abundant under S2 conditions that promote both outer and inner membrane fusion, which is consistent with the interpretation that they are productive intermediates (1.6%, <italic>n</italic> = 400). To further determine whether these structures are bona fide outer membrane&#x02013;tethered intermediates, we localized Fzo1 by immuno-EM analysis of wild-type mitochondria under S1 assay conditions. Consistent with its proposed role in outer membrane tethering, we observed that Fzo1 is localized on the outer membrane and is enriched at the interface of adjacent tethered mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>, gold particles). In addition, S1 reactions containing <italic>fzo1-1</italic> and wild-type mitochondria treated with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GMP-PCP (&#x003b2;,&#x003b3;-methyleneguanosine 5&#x02032;-triphosphate) accumulated outer membrane&#x02013;tethered structures to levels greater than those observed in wild-type S1 reactions, which is consistent with being blocked at a step preceding outer membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Meeusen et al., 2004</xref>).

Thus, we tested the ability of the temperature-sensitive mutant Ugo1 proteins to interact with Fzo1 and Mgm1. Immunoprecipitation of Ugo1 was performed on chemically cross-linked mitochondria isolated from <italic>ugo1<sup>ts</sup></italic> strains using anti-HA antibodies. After immunoprecipitation, cross-links were reversed with reducing agents and precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.

It seems likely that this modified structure, in comparison with typical transport protein family members, evolved to tailor the structure of Ugo1 to its function in mitochondrial fusion. Specifically, at the cost of additional TMDs, Ugo1 contains a large IMS domain at the C terminus that is likely important for its interaction with Mgm1 at the inner membrane and/or its role in membrane fusion.</p><p>Analysis of the role of ETMs in Ugo1 structure indicates that they participate in the formation of a Ugo1 115-kD species that is likely a homodimer. We postulate that ETMs participate in dimer formation via an intermolecular salt bridge network. This is in contrast to the mitochondrial transport protein family in which the motifs take part in intramolecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pebay-Peyroula et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, a Ugo1 dimer contains six TMDs, which is a feature common to members of the mitochondrial transport protein family, albeit with a different predicted structural symmetry. Thus, although Ugo1 is a divergent member of this family, the basic function of ETMs may be similar in that they are structurally important for the formation of a six TMD unit. The effect of the charge reversal mutations within the first and second ETMs on Ugo1 function as scored by mitochondrial morphology correlate with dimer stability, but importantly, they differ in severity. Thus, in the simplest model for the dimer formation, the interface would be comprised of trans-interactions between identical motifs in each Ugo1 partner. In conventional mitochondrial transport proteins, the salt bridges lock the TMDs together on the matrix side of the inner membrane, and these must be broken for a substrate to be transported. Thus, it is also possible that Ugo1 dimer formation is dynamic and in this capacity may facilitate postmembrane tethering fusion events.</p><p>A role for Ugo1 in the fusion of both outer and inner membranes is supported by our discovery of <italic>ugo1</italic> mutations that selectively block each fusion event. This observation raises the question of how an outer membrane protein can affect both outer and inner membrane fusion events. The interaction of Ugo1 with both Mgm1 and Fzo1 suggests a simple model in which Ugo1 functions as an adapter to coordinate fusion. However, given that loss of function does not correlate with loss of the interaction of Ugo1 with Fzo1 and/or Mgm1, our data suggest that Ugo1 plays a role more complex than that of a simple adapter. Although the role of Ugo1 in outer and inner membrane fusion is genetically resolvable, mutations in both phenotypic classes cause the destabilization of the Ugo1 115-kD species, suggesting that the Ugo1 dimer stability is important but not sufficient in each fusion event. However, in this context, it should be noted that hrCN-PAGE analysis is stringent and thus likely underestimates the steady-state level of the Ugo1 115-kD species in vivo.</p><p>Our data also indicate that Ugo1 function is required only after membrane tethering has occurred, likely at the lipid-mixing step of both outer and inner membrane fusion. At present, we can only speculate on the exact mechanistic role of Ugo1 in fusion. One rational possibility is that Ugo1 functions by regulating outer and inner membrane fusion DRP assembly and/or disassembly, which are activities critical for mitochondrial fusion. In this manner, Ugo1 may also temporally and spatially couple the fusion of the outer and inner membrane. Although immunoprecipitation data indicate that Ugo<sup>ts</sup> proteins are capable of interacting with Fzo1 and Mgm1, higher resolution assays are required to determine whether these mutant proteins are defective in the formation of potentially transient assembled Fzo1 and Mgm1 structures at sites of fusion. A second possibility for Ugo1's function in fusion is suggested by the transporter-like structure of Ugo1. Specifically, Ugo1 could function as more than a dynamic DRP scaffold during fusion and may, by an unknown transport event, facilitate lipid mixing by more directly modulating the lipid and/or chemical environment at the site of fusion.</p><p>Although there is no readily identifiable mammalian orthologue to Ugo1 at present, there are &#x0223c;50 members of the transport/carrier protein family in humans, raising the possibility that one exists. Indeed, based on immunoprecipitation analysis, the mammalian outer and inner membrane fusion DRPs, Mfn1 or Mfn2 and Opa1, are present in a complex in mammalian mitochondria (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809099/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809099/DC1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Guillery et al., 2008</xref>). Like Fzo1, Mfn1 and Mfn2 possess only a very small loop of amino acids in IMS, which is unlikely to be sufficient to directly mediate a stable interaction with OPA1 at the inner membrane. Indeed, in yeast, the Fzo1&#x02013;Mgm1 interaction is dependent on Ugo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sesaki et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the existence of an Mfn1/2&#x02013;Opa1 complex suggests that a mammalian functional, if not structural, equivalent of Ugo1 exists and that the fundamental mechanism of mitochondrial fusion is highly conserved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibody production and purification</title><p>Antiserum was raised against His<sub>6</sub>-tagged fusion proteins comprised of full-length mouse dihydrofolate reductase and the N terminus of Ugo1 (residues 1&#x02013;125) or an internal region of Fzo1 (residues 422&#x02013;516; Covance).
