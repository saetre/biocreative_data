Here, we performed a mutation-based functional analysis of TRIM5&#x003b1;-mediated MLV restriction. Our results reveal that changes at tyrosine<sup>336</sup> of human TRIM5&#x003b1;, within the variable region 1 of its C-terminal PRYSPRY domain, can expand its activity to B-MLV and to the NB-tropic Moloney MLV. Conversely, we demonstrate that the escape of MLV from restriction by wild-type or mutant forms of huTRIM5&#x003b1; can be achieved through interdependent changes at positions 82, 109, 110, and 117 of the viral capsid. Together, our results support a model in which TRIM5&#x003b1;-mediated retroviral restriction results from the direct binding of the antiviral PRYSPRY domain to the viral capsid, and can be prevented by interferences exerted by critical residues on either one of these two partners.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Mammalian cells are endowed with intrinsic lines of defence against retroviruses, which notably contribute to limiting the cross-species transmission of these pathogens. TRIM5&#x003b1; is one such restriction factor, which acts by recognizing the capsid of incoming retroviruses through its C-terminal PRYSPRY domain. Human TRIM5&#x003b1; potently blocks the so-called N-tropic murine leukemia virus (MLV), but is ineffective against the closely related B-tropic and Moloney strains. In this study, we demonstrate that substitution of a single amino acid in the PRYSPRY domain of this protein expands its antiviral activity to these other MLV strains.

These data confirmed that TRIM5&#x003b1; can be altered to act in a CA110-independent manner. However, in the context of Mo-MLV, this capsid residue plays a pivotal role. Mo-MLV could indeed escape all forms of TRIM5&#x003b1;-mediated blockade when alanine<sup>110</sup> of its capsid was changed to glutamate.

The present study, which demonstrates that the consequences of mutations in the huTRIM5&#x003b1; PRYSPRY V1 can be counterbalanced by changes in the MLV capsid, and vice versa, lends strong credence to such a model.</p><p>This work stands out by its identification of a residue, tyrosine<sup>336</sup> of huTRIM5&#x003b1;, which limits the spectrum of MLV targets of this antiviral to the sole N-tropic MLV. A number of amino acid substitutions at this position, as well as a deletion of this residue, confer huTRIM5&#x003b1; with the additional ability to block B-MLV, and introduction of a lysine even expands restriction to Mo-MLV. Understanding fully the mechanism of this gain of function would require a determination of the tri-dimensional structure of the TRIM5&#x003b1;-capsid complex. In its absence, the crystal structures of the PRYSPRY domain of related proteins, PRYSPRY-19q13.4.1, GUSTAVUS and TRIM21, suggests that the V1 region of huTRIM5&#x003b1; could form a protruding loop with tyrosine<sup>336</sup> situated underneath and in direct contact (at a less than 4 &#x000c5; distance) with residues in the V2 loop, which could limit the conformational flexibility of V1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b020">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the PRYSPRY V1 loops of TRIM5&#x003b1; and these other proteins differ in length, precluding firm analogy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, tyrosine<sup>336</sup> may prevent the docking of V1 into its putative capsid-binding site by steric hindrance. This would be consistent with the finding that changes that most effectively broaden the spectrum of action of huTRIM5&#x003b1; are the removal of this tyrosine or its substitution by small amino acids. However, the observation that Y<sup>336</sup>K further expands the restriction spectrum of huTRIM5&#x003b1; not only to B- but also to Mo-MLV suggests that this model may be overly simplistic. Arginine<sup>332</sup> of huTRIM5&#x003b1; was similarly found to interfere with ability of huTRIM5&#x003b1; to restrict HIV-1 and SIV<sub>mac</sub> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. In this case too, distinct amino acid changes differentially affected the strength with which either one of these two viruses was inhibited, suggesting that both positive and negative influences are at play. As well, our failure to generate a TRIM5&#x003b1; variant capable of blocking both N- and B-MLV on the one hand and HIV-1 on the other hand, by combining mutations at positions 332 and 336, points to more complex influences within V1 itself. <italic>cis</italic>-acting interferences have also been noted in Fv1, where the C-terminal part of Fv1<sup>b</sup> was shown to prevent this factor from blocking B-MLV, and where substitution of lysine<sup>358</sup> of Fv1<sup>n</sup> by alanine could extend the restriction spectrum of this antiviral to N-MLV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>On the viral capsid side, our study indicates that at least four positions (CA82, CA109, CA110 and CA117) interdependently condition MLV susceptibility to huTRIM5&#x003b1;, whether in its wild-type or mutant forms. The influence of each of these four residues varies according to both the virus involved and the sequence of the TRIM5&#x003b1; PRYSPRY V1 region. Here, all viruses tested escaped wild-type huTRIM5&#x003b1; if they harbored a glutamic acid at position 110 of capsid. As such, E<sup>110</sup> dominantly interfere with restriction. However, a recent study demonstrated that wild-type huTRIM5&#x003b1; could efficiently block an MLV retroviral vector packaged with a capsid derived from a primate endogenous retrovirus (PtERV) carrying a glutamic acid at this position &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. As well, we found here that the protective effect of E<sup>110</sup> could be abrogated by substitutions of Y<sup>336</sup> in huTRIM5&#x003b1;, in which case CA82 and CA117 became determinant. Indeed, with N- and B-MLV-derived viruses, an aspartate at CA82 additionally allowed escape from TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Y</sub>336<sub>A</sub>, and a histidine at CA117 from TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Y</sub>336<sub>A</sub> and TRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Y</sub>336<sub>K</sub>. When CA110 was occupied by an arginine, the picture was completely reversed, as this residue dominantly potentiates susceptibility. Finally, with an alanine at CA110, H<sup>117</sup> and D<sup>82</sup> induced escape from wild-type TRIM5&#x003b1;, albeit in a CA109-dependent fashion, yet viruses remained sensitive to Y<sup>336</sup>-mutated forms of the restriction factor.</p><p>A picture is thus emerging from these data, whereby CA110 plays the role of primary determinant of restriction, with CA82, CA109 and CA117 acting as secondary modulators in a V1-conditioned fashion. However, the restriction pattern obtained with derivatives of Mo-MLV, which differs from the N- and B-MLV strains used here at nine CA positions besides these four, does not fully fit with this model, indicating its modulation by at least some of these other CA residues. Notably, a recent study demonstrated the importance of CA214 in potentiating Fv1<sup>n</sup>-mediated restriction of Mo-MLV only when CA110 was occupied by a glutamate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>MLV CA82, CA109, CA110 and CA117 were also demonstrated to exert combinatorial influences on Fv1-mediated restriction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. In spite of this parallel, sequences leading to resistance or susceptibility to Fv1 and huTRIM5&#x003b1; are not identical. For instance, whereas Fv1<sup>b</sup> and huTRIM5&#x003b1; both potently restrict CA<sub>E</sub>110<sub>A</sub> B-MLV, an additional N<sup>82</sup>D mutation allows escape from huTRIM5&#x003b1; (this work) but not from Fv1<sup>b</sup> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Also, huTRIM5&#x003b1;<sub>Y</sub>336<sub>A</sub>-mediated blockade of B-MLV is relieved by change at CA117, which was previously shown not to affect restriction by Fv1<sup>n</sup> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The structure of the amino-terminal part of the N-MLV capsid in its hexameric state was resolved at a 2.5 &#x000c5; resolution &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030200-g008">Figure 8</xref>). A monomer consists of two-stranded &#x003b2;-hairpins followed by six &#x003b1; helices. Interestingly, CA82, CA109, CA110 and CA117 are situated at the edge of a cavity formed by helices 4 to 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030200-g008">Figure 8</xref>). CA82 sits between helix 4 and 5 at the top of this pocket, across from CA109 and 110 on helix 6. CA117 is further down along the helix 6 side of the cavity. At least two scenarios can thus be envisioned for the binding of huTRIM5&#x003b1; to the MLV capsid. First, it might rely on the sum of individual interactions between TRIM5&#x003b1; residues, for instance in the PRYSPRY V1 loop, and capsid amino acids including 82, 109, 110 and 117. The non-essential nature of any of these four capsid positions for susceptibility or resistance to TRIM5&#x003b1; argues against this model, even though it is conceivable that the abrogation of some of these interactions might be compensated by the strengthening of others. In a second scenario, the TRIM5&#x003b1;-binding site would be located deeper in the pocket. This part of the protein is constituted by residues that are highly conserved, hence most probably play essential structural functions prohibiting mutation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Escape could then be achieved by mounting obstacles to TRIM5&#x003b1; penetration into this pocket through changes at the more flexible yet critically placed CA82, CA109, CA110 and CA117 residues. By analogy, it is interesting to note that the cyclophilin-binding loop of the HIV-1 capsid, which has been postulated to interfere with the blockade of this virus by wild-type huTRIM5&#x003b1;, hangs over a very similar pocket formed by helices 4 to 7 of the structurally homologous lentiviral capsid &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. As such, this loop, whether bound to or modified by cyclophilin A (CypA), could function as a lid to prevent huTRIM5&#x003b1; from accessing its HIV-1 CA binding site. However, recent data, which indicate that the positive effects of CypA binding to CA on HIV-1 replication do not depend upon the presence of huTRIM5&#x003b1; suggest that a strict parallel cannot be established between restriction of MLV and HIV by the cellular antiviral &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b040">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030200-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><fig id="ppat-0030200-g008" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Highlighting of Functionally Critical Positions on the Structure of the MLV Capsid</title><p>Visualization of the previously defined structure of the N-terminal domain of the N-MLV capsid in its hexameric state, each monomer being given a different color.
