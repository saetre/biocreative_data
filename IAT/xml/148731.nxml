DNA damage can lead to mutations during replication. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the damage-induced mutagenesis pathway requires the Rev1 protein. We have isolated a human cDNA homologous to the yeast REV1 gene. The human REV1 cDNA consists of 4255 bp and codes for a protein of 1251 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 138 248 Da. The human REV1 gene is localized between 2q11.1 and 2q11.2. We show that the human REV1 protein is a dCMP transferase that specifically inserts a dCMP residue opposite a DNA template G. In addition, the human REV1 transferase is able to efficiently and specifically insert a dCMP opposite a DNA template apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site or a uracil residue. These results suggest that the REV1 transferase may play a critical role during mutagenic translesion DNA synthesis bypassing a template AP site in human cells. Consistent with its role as a fundamental mutagenic protein, the REV1 gene is ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
