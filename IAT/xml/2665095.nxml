In response to pathogens such as <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>, SA is synthesized and activates widespread gene expression. In <italic>gh3.12/pbs3</italic> mutants of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, induced total SA accumulation is significantly compromised as is SA-dependent gene expression and plant defense. AtGH3 subfamily I and II members have been shown to conjugate phytohormone acyl substrates to amino acids <italic>in vitro</italic>, with this role supported by <italic>in planta</italic> analyses. Here we sought to determine the <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical activity and kinetic properties of GH3.12/avrPphB susceptible 3 (PBS3), a member of the uncharacterized AtGH3 subfamily III. Using a novel high throughput adenylation assay, we characterized the acyl substrate preference of PBS3. We found PBS3 favors 4-substituted benzoates such as 4-aminobenzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate, with moderate activity on benzoate and no observed activity with 2-substituted benzoates. Similar to known GH3 enzymes, PBS3 catalyzes the conjugation of specific amino acids (<italic>e.g.</italic> Glu) to its preferred acyl substrates. Kinetic analyses indicate 4-aminobenzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate are preferred acyl substrates as PBS3 exhibits both higher affinities (apparent <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> = 153 and 459 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>, respectively) and higher catalytic efficiencies (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub><italic>/K<sub>m</sub></italic> = 0.0179 and 0.0444 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, respectively) with these acyl substrates compared with benzoate (apparent <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> = 867 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>, <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> = 0.0046 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>). Notably, SA specifically and reversibly inhibits PBS3 activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 15 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>. This suggests a general mechanism for the rapid, reversible regulation of GH3 activity and small molecule cross-talk. For PBS3, this may allow for coordination of flux through diverse chorismate-derived pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by <grant-sponsor>National Science Foundation Arabidopsis 2010</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>MCB-0420267</grant-num> (to M.

The <italic>pbs3-1</italic> ethyl methanesulfonate mutant was first isolated in a screen for enhanced susceptibility to avirulent <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> DC3000, carrying the effector <italic>avrPphB,</italic> resistance to which is mediated by the plant resistance (<italic>R</italic>) gene <italic>RPS5</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). Our subsequent analysis with Roger Innes revealed that the <italic>pbs3-1</italic> mutant is also more susceptible to virulent <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains, including <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>maculicola</italic> ES4326, suggesting a more general role for <italic>PBS3</italic> than in directly mediating effector-<italic>R</italic> gene interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Furthermore, in response to <italic>P. syringae</italic> pathovars, the <italic>pbs3-1</italic> EMS mutant and the <italic>pbs3-2</italic> T-DNA insertion line exhibited reduced total SA accumulation and expression of the SA-dependent pathogenesis-related gene <italic>PR1</italic> (At2g14610) in comparison with wild type plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). The mutation in <italic>pbs3-1</italic> was then mapped and cloned, and PBS3<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">2</xref> was found to be AtGH3.12 (At5g13320), a member of the AtGH3 multigene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>).</p><p>The first GH3 gene was characterized by Guilfoyle and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>) as an early auxin-responsive gene from <italic>Glycine max</italic>. Homologs have since been identified in many other plant species and in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). The GH3 family is part of the broader acyl-adenylate/thioester-forming enzyme family, also called the firefly luciferase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). This superfamily consists of enzymes that catalyze a variety of reactions with a common first step as follows: the transfer of AMP from ATP to the carboxylic acid group of an acyl substrate, forming an activated acyl-adenylate intermediate. GH3 enzymes are unique within this superfamily in that amino acid conjugation occurs in the absence of a thioester intermediate. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows the reaction catalyzed by GH3 enzymes, with benzoate as the acyl substrate. To date, biochemical activity has only been demonstrated for select plant GH3 enzymes (discussed below). Furthermore, mechanistic analyses are hampered by the lack of sequence conservation between GH3 and other acyl-adenylase/thioester-forming superfamily members and no structural information for any GH3 family member.</p><p>The known acyl substrate specificity of the 19 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtGH3 proteins corresponds to their phylogenetic relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) that divides the family into three groups (supplemental Fig. S1). Group I includes JAR1, which catalyzes the formation of JA-Ile, an active form of the phytohormone jasmonate (JA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). JA-Ile promotes the interaction of the F-box protein COI1 with JAZ JA repressor family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). This interaction results in degradation of the JAZ repressor by the ubiquitin ligase-dependent 26 S proteasome followed by the activation of the associated JA-dependent responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Group II is composed of several proteins that catalyze the formation of auxin-amino acid conjugates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Conjugation of indole-3-acetate (IAA) with Asp and Glu targets the phytohormone IAA for catabolism, whereas Ala and Leu conjugates of IAA appear to be inactive storage forms of IAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). IAA directly binds to TIR1, the F-box subunit of SCF<sup>TIR1</sup>, enabling its interaction with the Aux/IAA family of auxin transcriptional repressors, degradation of the repressor, and activation of IAA-associated responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). In contrast, IAA-amino acid conjugates are too bulky to fit into the auxin binding pocket of TIR1 and do not promote complex formation between TIR1 and Aux/IAA repressors.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">3</xref> Group III, which includes PBS3 (AtGH3.12), contains proteins for which the substrate specificity has not yet been reported, as these proteins were inactive on tested substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>).</p><p>The amino acid conjugation reaction catalyzed by characterized GH3 enzymes plays a critical role in plant hormone homeostasis and plant-microbe interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Not only do plants regulate active phytohormone forms through amino acid conjugation, but some plant pathogens also manipulate phytohormone conjugation and response. For example, <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>savastanoi</italic> encodes an IAA-AA synthetase that is required for full virulence on oleander (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> DC3000 and <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>maculicola</italic> ES4326 synthesize the phytotoxin coronatine, an analog of JA-Ile, that activates JA-Ile-dependent responses and is required for full virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). Notably, the HopW1-1 effector of <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>maculicola</italic> ES4326 targets PBS3, altering host SA signal transduction pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>).</p><p>Because PBS3 is a GH3 protein and <italic>pbs3</italic> mutants exhibit SA-deficient phenotypes, we proposed that PBS3 acts upstream of SA, on SA, or on a compound that could compete with SA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). In the last case, such a compound might bind to a metabolic or regulatory enzyme that normally binds SA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Here we systematically examine the acyl substrate and amino acid preference of PBS3 followed by determination of the kinetic and catalytic properties of PBS3. In addition, for the first time for any GH3 member, we assess the influence of putative inhibitors on enzymatic activity. The impact of each of the two point mutations in the lack of function <italic>pbs3-1</italic> EMS mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>) is also ascertained. Together, these findings provide a framework to explore the role of PBS3 in pathogen-induced SA accumulation and disease resistance. Furthermore, they support an underexplored and significant role for 4-substituted benzoates in plant-pathogen interactions.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Materials and General Protocols</italic>&#x02014;All specialty reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified.

The resulting construct, pET-His-PBS3, contains an N-terminal histidine tag fused to the coding region of <italic>AtPBS3.</italic> Crude cell extracts were prepared from a 2-liter culture of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Rosetta2 (DE3) cells transformed with pET-His-PBS3 grown in TB media containing 0.2% glucose, 50 &#x003bc;g/ml kanamycin, and 30 &#x003bc;g/ml chloramphenicol. Cultures were grown at 37 &#x000b0;C to mid-log phase and shifted to 18 &#x000b0;C, and 0.1 m<sc>m</sc> isopropyl 1-thio-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-galactopyranoside was added to induce His-PBS3 synthesis. Cells were harvested after shaking overnight (&#x0223c;25 g wet weight) and stored at &#x02013;20 &#x000b0;C. His-PBS3 was then purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His-Bind resin (Novagen) according to manufacturer's directions. His-PBS3 was the only visible protein when 10 &#x003bc;g of this eluant was resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized using Coomassie Blue. Thrombin (Novagen) was used to cleave the histidine tag. As His-PBS3 and thrombin-cleaved PBS3 displayed similar activity on a set of five acyl substrates, His-PBS3 was utilized unless specified. Protein concentrations were determined by a Bradford assay modified for 96-well plate format using Coomassie Blue G-250 (EM Biosciences) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Aliquots of the purified recombinant PBS3 proteins (5.3&#x02013;9.5 mg/ml in 100 m<sc>m</sc> Tris, pH 7.7, 10% glycerol, 1 m<sc>m</sc> DTT) were stored at &#x02013;80 &#x000b0;C. The same batch of enzyme was used for each set of assays reported in a single figure or table, with assays repeated with enzyme from at least one other batch to confirm results. In all assays, the appropriate enzyme concentrations were utilized such that velocity was linear with increasing enzyme concentration.</p><p><italic>Generation and Purification of PBS3 Mutants</italic>&#x02014;Amino acid substitutions were introduced into the pET-His-PBS3 plasmid using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with forward primer 5&#x02032;ccacgtgttgtttggtaatgaaggagtcgcttgataatgtttac and reverse primer 5&#x02032;gtaaacattatcaagcgactccttcattaccaaacaacacgtgg to make the E502R mutation and forward primer 5&#x02032;gatgtcgattcaaagacggatcgaccgggcctctcgagataagagtggtg and reverse primer 5&#x02032;caccactcttatctcgagaggcccggtcgatccgtctttgaatcgacatc to make the I519T mutation. The double mutant was made using the pET-His-I519K plasmid with the E502R forward and reverse primers. The His-tagged single and double mutant proteins were purified as described for wild type PBS3, above.</p><p><italic>Adenylation Reaction</italic>&#x02014;His-PBS3 adenylation activity was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by coupling the production of pyrophosphate to oxidation of NADH using pyrophosphate reagent (Sigma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). The reagent contained the coupling enzymes fructose-6-phosphate kinase, aldolase, triose-phosphate isomerase, glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, and appropriate substrates and cofactors, including NADH. The pyrophosphate reagent was reconstituted in 4 ml of double distilled H<sub>2</sub>O and used at a volume of 65 &#x003bc;l per 200-&#x003bc;l reaction. For the screen of substrates, reaction mixtures (200 &#x003bc;l) were in 45 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole, pH 7.4, and contained 5.0 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> ATP, 1 m<sc>m</sc> DTT, 0.1&#x02013;10 m<sc>m</sc> substrate, and 100 &#x003bc;g of His-PBS3 enzyme in addition to the pyrophosphate reagent. For determination of kinetic parameters for ATP, reactions contained 50 &#x003bc;g/ml His-PBS3 enzyme, pyrophosphate reagent, 1 m<sc>m</sc> DTT, and 10 m<sc>m</sc> acyl substrate. The concentration of ATP was varied while either (<italic>a</italic>) maintaining a 1.5:1 Mg<sup>2+</sup> to ATP ratio or (<italic>b</italic>) with 10 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Three replicates were performed for each substrate or concentration value. The reactions were initiated with the addition of substrate to a 96-well plate preheated to 30 &#x000b0;C and analyzed using a Spectromax Plus microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). The change in absorbance at 340 nm was measured every 10&#x02013;15 s for at least 20 min and converted to velocity by least squares fitting of each curve using the accompanying program SOFTmax PRO 3.0 with manual assessment/confirmation of the linear range. The velocity of a no His-PBS3 control was subtracted; this velocity was on average 0.16 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>/min. An extinction coefficient of 6.22 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> cm<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> for NADH was used to convert velocity values from milli-absorbance units/min to micromolar/min. Kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting initial velocity values to the Hanes equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>).</p><p><italic>Amino Acid Conjugation Reaction (Full Reaction)</italic>&#x02014;Reaction mixtures (200 &#x003bc;l) were in 50 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and contained 5.0 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> ATP, 1.0 m<sc>m</sc> DTT, 1.0 m<sc>m</sc> acyl substrate, 1.0 m<sc>m</sc> amino acid, and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml His-PBS3 enzyme. Reactions were incubated at 30 &#x000b0;C for 2 h and monitored by TLC and/or HPLC. Reaction mixtures and standards were spotted on silica gel 60 F<sub>254</sub> plates (EMD Biosciences) and developed in either 30:60:10 dichloromethane/ethyl acetate/formic acid or 8:1:1 isopropyl alcohol/ammonium hydroxide/water (for basic and hydrophilic amino acids). The method used to detect the conjugates varied by substrate. pABA conjugates were detected by staining TLC plates with vanillin reagent (6% (w/v) vanillic acid and 1% sulfuric acid in ethanol) and by visualizing TLC plates under short wavelength UV. 4-HBA, vanillic acid, and <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamic acid conjugates were detected by visualizing TLC plates under short wavelength UV light. BA conjugates were detected by HPLC using a UV detector at 233 nm. HPLC conditions are the same as those used in the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> determination (see below). SA was analyzed by TLC visualized under short wavelength UV light and by HPLC using a fluorescence detector (ex<sub>305</sub>/em<sub>407 nm</sub>); however, no spots or peaks associated with SA-conjugates were detected.</p><p><italic>K<sub>m</sub> Determinations</italic>&#x02014;Reaction mixtures (200 &#x003bc;l) were in 50 m<sc>m</sc> Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and contained 5.0 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.0 m<sc>m</sc> ATP, 1 m<sc>m</sc> DTT, 10 m<sc>m</sc> glutamate, varying concentrations of 4-HBA, pABA, or BA, and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml His-PBS3 (reaction with 4-HBA) or 125 &#x003bc;g/ml His-PBS3 (reactions with pABA and BA). Acyl substrate concentrations ranged from 50 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> to 5 m<sc>m</sc>. Reactions were quenched every 2 min by diluting the reaction mixture 10-fold into 2.5% HCl. Samples were filtered through a 0.2-&#x003bc;m Millex-LG syringe filter (Millipore), and a 50-&#x003bc;l aliquot was injected into a Shimadzu SCL-10AVP series HPLC system equipped with a Shimadzu SPD-10AVP photodiode array detector and a Shimadzu RF-10AXL fluorescence detector. A 5-&#x003bc;m, 15 cm &#x000d7; 4.6-mm inner diameter Supelcosil LC-ABZPlus column (Supelco) preceded by a LC-ABZ-Plus guard column was pre-equilibrated in 5% acetonitrile with 25 m<sc>m</sc> potassium phosphate buffer (initial HPLC buffer), pH 2.5, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The elution program and detection method varied by substrate. For BA, the initial HPLC buffer was run for 10 min and then changed to 52% acetonitrile and 48% 25 m<sc>m</sc> potassium phosphate buffer over 12 min. Under these conditions, BA-Glu eluted at 15.5 min and BA at 19 min. Elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 233 nm. Authentic samples were used to generate calibration curves for BA (<italic>y</italic> = 0.0397<italic>x</italic>) and BA-Glu (TCI America; <italic>y</italic> = 0.0407<italic>x</italic>), with <italic>x</italic> in absorbance units and <italic>y</italic> in nanomolar compound. For pABA, pABA eluted at 7.5 min and pABA-Glu eluted at 5.0 min using the BA program. Elution was monitored by fluorescence at ex<sub>290</sub>/em<sub>340 nm</sub>. Authentic samples were used to generate calibration curves for pABA (<italic>y</italic> = 0.2585<italic>x</italic>) and pABA-Glu (<italic>y</italic> = 0.1045<italic>x</italic>), with <italic>x</italic> in fluorescence units and <italic>y</italic> in nanomolar compound). For 4-HBA, the initial HPLC buffer was run for 4 min and then changed to 52% acetonitrile and 48% 25 m<sc>m</sc> potassium phosphate buffer over 7 min. Elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 254 nm. An authentic sample of 4-HBA was used to generate a calibration curve (<italic>y</italic> = 0.0274<italic>x</italic>), and synthesized 4-HBA-Glu (see below) was used to generate a calibration curve (<italic>y</italic> = 0.0318<italic>x</italic>) with <italic>x</italic> in UV absorbance area units and <italic>y</italic> in nanomolar compound. Under these conditions, 4-HBA eluted at 9.7 min and 4-HBA-Glu eluted at 8.3 min. The reaction velocity with each substrate concentration was determined from a linear fit of four time points. Kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting initial velocity values to the Hanes equation as above, with data from at least six substrate concentrations. Nonlinear curve fitting using Synergy KaleidaGraph version 4.0 gave very similar results.</p><p><italic>Mass Spectrometry to Verify 4-HBA-Glu Formation</italic>&#x02014;A 5-&#x003bc;m, 15-cm &#x000d7; 4.6-mm inner diameter Prevail C18 column (Alltech) preceded by a 7.5-cm &#x000d7; 4.6-mm guard column was pre-equilibrated in 5% acetonitrile with 25 m<sc>m</sc> formate buffer, pH 2.8 (initial HPLC buffer), at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The initial buffer was run for 7 min and then changed to 52% acetonitrile over 15 min. The putative 4-HBA-Glu peak eluting at 11.3&#x02013;11.9 min was collected and dried down under vacuum. This sample was rerun using our standard HPLC assay for verification. Samples for LC-MS analysis were resuspended in a 50:50 mixture of 25 m<sc>m</sc> ammonium formate and acetonitrile and analyzed using a Thermo Fisher Surveyor HPLC with a Phenomenex C18 2 &#x000d7; 150-mm column and a Thermo Fisher LCQ classic mass spectrometer at the Vincent Coates Foundation Mass Spectrometry Laboratory (Stanford University). LC-MS with electrospray ionization-positive ion analysis employed a C18 column with similar elution scheme. MS-MS fragmentation was performed on the putative dominant ion peak for further confirmation of compound identity. The sample was also analyzed by nanospray infusion on the Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Waters Micromass Q-TOF hybrid quadrupole time of flight) with MS-MS performed on 268.1 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>.</p><p><italic>Synthesis of 4-HBA-Glu Standard</italic>&#x02014;As 4-HBA-Glu is not commercially available, it was synthesized for calibration of the HPLC. Briefly, 4-acetoxybenzoic acid was converted to the acyl chloride and condensed with diethyl <sc>l</sc>-glutamate to form diethyl 4-acetoxybenzoyl-<sc>l</sc>-glutamate. The protecting groups were removed in base to yield 4-HBA-Glu as a white crystalline solid with 99% purity by HPLC. The structure was confirmed by <sup>1</sup>H NMR and <sup>13</sup>C NMR. See supplemental Method S1 for complete procedures and spectral data.</p><p><italic>Inhibition Studies</italic>&#x02014;Inhibition of PBS3 amino acid conjugation was assessed with SA using our HPLC assay to monitor pABA-Glu formation. Reaction conditions were the same as for the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> experiment (above), with the addition of SA (5&#x02013;600 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>). A pABA concentration equivalent to the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> (150 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) was used.

Therefore, we sought to establish whether PBS3 is truly active on chorismate (and prephenate) or is active on breakdown products of these compounds. Known breakdown products of chorismate are phenyl pyruvate, prephenate, and 4-HBA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, PBS3 was highly active on 4-HBA with low activity on the nonaromatic prephenate (10.1 nmol/min/mg), and no significant activity on the aromatic breakdown product phenyl pyruvate. To determine whether the observed activity on chorismate and prephenate was because of 4-HBA contamination, we performed HPLC analysis on our freshly prepared chorismate and prephenate solutions. 4-HBA was present in our chorismate solution at a level sufficient to account for the observed PBS3 activity on chorismate (33.5 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> 4-HBA in 1 m<sc>m</sc> chorismate). Therefore, PBS3 does not appear to be active on chorismate. On the other hand, we did not detect 4-HBA in our 1 m<sc>m</sc> prephenate solution, even after incubation for 1 h under assay conditions (30 &#x000b0;C, pH 7.4). This suggests that the low adenylation activity of PBS3 with 1 m<sc>m</sc> prephenate is valid.</p><p>To further examine the acyl substrate preference and specificity of PBS3, compounds structurally related to the active acyl substrates identified above were examined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

The compounds on which PBS3 exhibited the highest velocity, 4-HBA (135.2 nmol/min/mg) and pABA (91.1 nmol/min/mg), are substituted at the <italic>para</italic>-position and were favored over BA. In contrast, substitution at the <italic>meta-</italic> position with either &#x02013;OH or &#x02013;NH<sub>2</sub> resulted in significantly lowered PBS3 adenylation activity compared with BA, with adenylation activities of 13.3 and 11.5 nmol/min/mg for 3-HBA and 3-ABA, respectively. Finally, substitution at the <italic>ortho</italic> (2&#x02013;) position was strongly disfavored with PBS3 exhibiting essentially no activity on SA or 2-ABA.</p><p>We then investigated the impact of additional hydroxyl or methoxy (&#x02013;MeO) substitutions on PBS3 adenylation activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Again <italic>para</italic>-hydroxyl-substituted benzoates were favored with <italic>ortho</italic>-hydroxyl-substituted benzoates strongly disfavored as follows: 4-HBA &#x0003e; BA &#x0003e; 3,4-DHBA &#x0003e; 3-HBA &#x0226b; (SA; 3,4,5-THBA; 2,4-DHBA; and 2,3-DHBA). At the <italic>meta</italic>- position, MeO substitutions were preferred over additional hydroxyl substitutions. For both vanillate (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzoate) <italic>versus</italic> 3,4-DHBA and syringate (4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzoate) <italic>versus</italic> gallate (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate), PBS3 exhibited at least 4-fold higher adenylation activity with the MeO compared with the hydroxyl substitutions. Additional modifications (hydroxyl substituents) to pABA also reduced PBS3 adenylation activity, with loss of activity associated with substitution at the 2-position. PBS3 activity was 91.1 nmol/min/mg with pABA (4-ABA) compared with 30.4 nmol/min/mg with 4-A-3HBA and 1.11 nmol/min/mg with 4-A-2HBA.</p><p>To further examine the effect of different substituents at the <italic>para-</italic>position of benzoate, we compared the adenylation activities of PBS3 on 4-HBA, 4-fluorobenzoate, pABA, 4-amino-methylbenzoate (4-AMeBA), and 4-aminoethylbenzoate (4-AEtBA) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The highest activity was observed on 4-HBA, with activity on pABA and 4-fluorobenzoate somewhat lower but still high, followed by a dramatic reduction in activity with the bulkier acyl substrates 4-AMeBA and 4-AEtBA.</p><p><italic>PBS3 Catalyzes the Formation of Amino Acid Conjugates</italic>&#x02014;Once potential acyl substrates were identified, a subset was tested for conjugation to amino acids by recombinant PBS3. Because 4-HBA displayed the highest velocity in the adenylation assay (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>), we first tested the ability of PBS3 to catalyze the conjugation of amino acids to 4-HBA. Of the 20 amino acids, TLC spots indicative of the 4-HBA-AA conjugate were reproducibly detected for reactions with Glu, His, and Lys, with a faint spot visible for Met (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). Very faint spots indicative of the amino acid conjugate were sometimes visible for reactions with Ile, Leu, Val, Thr, Ser, and Trp. A subset of these PBS3 reaction mixtures was then analyzed by HPLC to verify the presence of novel peaks consistent with the formation of specific 4-HBA-amino acid conjugates. Novel peaks indicative of 4-HBA-AA conjugate formation were observed by HPLC for reactions with Glu, His, Met, Thr, and Ser. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref> shows the chromatogram for the PBS3 reaction mixture with 4-HBA and Glu. The putative 4-HBA-Glu conjugate was only formed in the presence of PBS3 and required Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP in the reaction mixture (data not shown). To verify the identity of 4-HBA-Glu, which is not commercially available, the fraction corresponding to the putative 4-HBA-Glu conjugate was collected and analyzed by LC-MS with electrospray ionization-positive ion analysis and by nanospray infusion Q-TOF MS with MS/MS. The mass spectrum of the putative 4-HBA-Glu conjugate is consistent with it being the protonated 4-HBA-Glu conjugate (C<sub>12</sub> H<sub>14</sub>NO<sub>6</sub>) with <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> = 268.1. MS/MS analyses of the dominant ion peak (M + H) at 268.1 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> result in major ion intensities at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> = 251.0 consistent with loss of &#x02013;OH, and fission products <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> = 130 and 121 likely associated with cleavage of the amide bond (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>inset</italic>). Our mass spectra data are similar to those reported for other benzoyl-amino acid conjugates in which fragments consistent with cleavage of the amide bond were also observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). In addition, 4-HBA-Glu was chemically synthesized and analyzed by <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR (see supplemental Methods S1). The chemically synthesized 4-HBA-Glu displayed identical HPLC retention time and UV spectral properties to the 4-HBA-Glu from enzymatic reactions catalyzed by PBS3. This further confirms that PBS3 catalyzes the formation of 4-HBA-Glu <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Conjugation of pABA by PBS3 was also tested with the 20 amino acids and monitored by TLC. Unlike the results with 4-HBA, only a spot for pABA-Glu was detected either by UV light (similarly to 4-HBA) or vanillin staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). The <italic>R<sub>f</sub></italic> value of this putative pABA-Glu conjugate was similar to that of the commercially available standard. pABA-Glu formation by PBS3 was also followed by HPLC. The conversion of pABA to pABA-Glu occurred only with PBS3 in the reaction mixture. As PBS3 also formed additional amino acid conjugates with 4-HBA, we confirmed that similar amino acids conjugates were not formed with pABA by analyzing a subset of these reactions by HPLC. We did not detect putative pABA-His, pABA-Met, or pABA-Ser peaks by HPLC (data not shown).</p><p>Other compounds with high velocity (BA and vanillate), moderate velocity (<italic>trans</italic>-cinnamate), and minimal velocity (SA) were also tested as acyl substrates in the Glu conjugation reaction. TLC analyses showed that recombinant PBS3 catalyzed the conjugation of Glu to vanillate and <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>) but not to SA. As none of a variety of stains tested worked satisfactorily for BA, we assessed the BA reaction mixture by HPLC. We detected formation of the BA-Glu conjugate from BA and Glu by PBS3, with commercially available BA and BA-Glu used as standards. To further confirm that PBS3 was unable to form the SA-Glu conjugate, we assessed the SA reaction mixture by HPLC. Although SA was readily detected by fluorescence, no novel peaks indicative of SA-Glu were apparent. These results validate the use of the adenylation assay to study substrate specificity by confirming that those acyl substrates with high velocity in the adenylation assay were also capable of forming amino acid conjugates, whereas those substrates with essentially no activity using the adenylation assay (<italic>e.g.</italic> SA) were not.</p><p>We found that 4-HBA and pABA conjugates were formed with Glu (<sc>l</sc>-glutamic acid) but not Asp.

We found that the single and double mutations resulted in a complete loss of activity (&#x0003c;0.5 nmol/min/mg) as measured by the adenylation assay with 4-HBA, pABA, or BA as acyl substrates. Wild type recombinant PBS3 exhibited activity similar to that found with previous enzyme preparations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The loss of biochemical activity associated with these mutations is consistent with the similar phenotypes we observed for the recessive <italic>pbs3-1</italic> EMS mutant and the null <italic>pbs3-2</italic> T-DNA insertion mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>).</p><p><italic>Kinetic and Catalytic Properties of PBS3</italic>&#x02014;Similar to other characterized GH3 enzymes, the exclusion of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or ATP from the reaction mixture resulted in loss of PBS3 activity (data not shown). To determine the pH requirements of the reaction, we performed TLC analyses on the reaction mixtures using either pABA or vanillate as the acyl substrate with Glu as the amino acid at pH 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5. Clearly visible products were observed for the reactions at pH 8.0 and 8.5 but not at pH 7.5 (data not shown).</p><p>To further characterize the PBS3 benzoyl amino acid synthetase reaction, we determined its kinetic properties using the following three biologically relevant acyl substrates with the highest adenylation activity: 4-HBA, pABA, and BA. For these analyses, we first determined the apparent K<italic><sub>m</sub></italic> value for ATP using 4-HBA and pABA as acyl substrates to ensure we used sufficient ATP in our kinetic assays. Using the coupled adenylation assay, we found PBS3 exhibited standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent K<italic><sub>m</sub></italic> for ATP of 791 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> (with 4-HBA) and 636 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> (with pABA). We then determined the apparent K<italic><sub>m</sub></italic> of PBS3 for the acyl substrates 4-HBA, pABA, and BA at pH 8.5 with saturating Mg<sup>2+</sup>, ATP, and Glu. The concentration of the Glu conjugate produced in the reactions was quantified by HPLC over time, with the results summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. With all three acyl substrates, we found PBS3 exhibited standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The corresponding Hanes plots indicated that PBS3 had the highest affinity for pABA (K<italic><sub>m</sub></italic> = 153 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>), followed by 4-HBA (<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> = 459 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) and BA (<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> = 867 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>).

PBS3 exhibited similar catalytic efficiencies for 4-HBA and pABA (0.0444 and 0.0179 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, respectively) with reduced catalytic efficiency with BA as the acyl substrate (0.0046 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc><sup>&#x02013;1</sup> min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>).

As the <italic>pbs3</italic> mutants appear to be compromised in SA biosynthesis, if this hypothesis is correct, we would expect the following: 1) PBS3 substrate(s) inhibit SA biosynthetic activity and/or 2) PBS3 product(s) activate SA biosynthetic enzymes. In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, pathogen-induced SA biosynthesis requires the inducible isochorismate synthase AtICS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). AtICS1 catalyzes the reversible conversion of chorismate to isochorismate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). Isochorismate is likely then converted to SA by an IPL with the concomitant release of pyruvate, as it is in bacteria that synthesize SA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). Therefore, we wanted to determine whether the PBS3 substrates 4-HBA or pABA or the PBS3 product pABA-Glu impacts the activity of known SA biosynthetic enzymes (AtICS1 and the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isochorismate pyruvate lyase PchB). We used the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PchB enzyme as a surrogate for a putative, yet-to-be identified, <italic>Arabidopsi</italic>s IPL. All assessments were performed with substrate concentrations at the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value for the respective enzyme. We employed a coupled spectrophotometric assay to assess the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate by AtICS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) and found no statistically significant difference in activity with the addition of 200 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> 4-HBA, pABA, or pABA-Glu. This was also true when assessed with 1 m<sc>m</sc> 4-HBA, pABA, or pABA-Glu. Furthermore, we found that the conversion of isochorismate to SA by PchB was also unaffected by these compounds.</p><p><italic>PBS3 Activity Is Inhibited by SA but Not by Other Phytohormones</italic>&#x02014;As PBS3 impacts SA metabolism and the most active acyl substrates of PBS3 are structurally similar to SA, we then sought to determine whether SA could inhibit PBS3 activity. To test this, we assayed the effect of increasing concentrations of SA on PBS3-catalyzed pABA-Glu formation. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, SA dramatically reduced the amino acid conjugation activity of PBS3 with an estimated IC<sub>50</sub> of 15 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>. To determine whether the inhibition of PBS3 by SA was competitive, we added excess (saturating) pABA to the reaction mixture with 15 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> SA (the IC<sub>50</sub>). Full activity with maximal velocity was restored (data not shown). This suggests that SA acts as a competitive inhibitor of PBS3 activity.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of PBS3 activity by SA.</bold> SA inhibits the formation of pABA-Glu catalyzed by PBS3.

Adenylation reactions, such as those catalyzed by this superfamily, require Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP to complex with the phosphoester oxygens and enhance the electrophilicity of the phosphorus atoms. As expected, we found PBS3 activity requires Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP. We also found alkaline pH is necessary for amino acid conjugation, but not the adenylation reaction, probably to deprotonate the attacking nucleophile, the &#x003b1;-NH<sup>+</sup><sub>3</sub> group of the amino acid substrate (p<italic>K<sub>a</sub></italic> &#x0223c;9.5). This is consistent with the pH requirements of other characterized GH3 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) but is not a hallmark of all superfamily members. The reactions catalyzed by other superfamily family members, such as CoA ligases, do not use an amino acid as the nucleophile, and thus an alkaline pH would not be required as it is for PBS3.</p><p>We are limited in our analysis of PBS3 by the lack of a crystal structure for a GH3 enzyme and by the limited sequence conservation with other acyl-adenylate/thioester-forming superfamily members. However, the AMP-binding motifs of PBS3 are evident, and the importance of these motifs has been clearly demonstrated for GH3 enzymes. For example, in JAR1, mutation of a conserved residue of AMP-binding motif I results in a complete loss of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). To date, no other known motifs have been identified in PBS3 or other GH3 enzymes. However, our study of the impact of the point mutations contained in <italic>pbs3-1</italic> on PBS3 activity, with loss of adenylation activity for both E502K and I519T PBS3 mutants, suggests that the highly conserved C-terminal region of PBS3, including loop residue Ile-519 (see supplemental Fig. S2), may participate in substrate binding or catalysis.</p><p>In terms of acyl substrate specificity, PBS3 had the highest velocity with 4-HBA and pABA (4-ABA) of the compounds tested (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). However, bulkier groups at the <italic>para</italic>-position, such as 4-AMeBA or 4-AEtBA, were not well tolerated. Substitution at the <italic>meta-</italic> and <italic>ortho-</italic>positions led to substantially lower reaction velocity with <italic>ortho</italic> substitutions resulting in lack of activity, perhaps due to steric hindrance. <italic>Meta</italic> substitutions were tolerated and more electronegative substituents such as MeO provided a 4-fold enhancement of activity compared with &#x02013;OH substitutions. In addition, our results comparing PBS3 activity with benzoate <italic>versus</italic> phenylacetate suggest that it is important for the carboxylate group to be attached directly to the aromatic ring, likely for resonance stabilization. The fact that PBS3 exhibited moderate activity with <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamate, which has a double bond between the carboxylic acid and aromatic ring, supports this conclusion. However, another explanation for the lack of activity with phenylacetate is that although the cinnamates and benzoates display a planar geometry, phenylacetate does not, and thus may be perceived quite differently by the active site.</p><p>The observed substrate preference of PBS3 for subsets of benzoates is similar to that observed for glycosyltransferases and CoA ligases active on benzoate substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). Despite the clear preference for benzoates, PBS3 was also moderately active on <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This is unusual, as glycosyltransferases and CoA ligases active on benzoates have not been reported to have significant activity on cinnamates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>). Similar to PBS3, the few characterized GH3 proteins have exhibited clear substrate preferences while remaining active on a fairly broad range of substrates. For example, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Group II GH3 proteins are capable not only of adenylating IAA <italic>in vitro</italic> but also adenylating other compounds with auxin activity, including indole-3-pyruvate, indole-3-butyrate, and the structurally distinct phenylacetate and naphthalene acetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). We also observed that SA inhibits both the adenylation and full (adenylation and amino acid conjugation) PBS3 reactions. Furthermore, the restoration of maximal PBS3 velocity when excess pABA is added to the reaction mixture with 15 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> SA suggests SA acts as a competitive inhibitor of PBS3. In this capacity, SA most likely competes with the acyl substrate (<italic>e.g.</italic> pABA) for the active site in a mutually exclusive fashion. Although less frequently observed, it is also possible that SA could act as an allosteric competitive inhibitor, binding a distinct site on PBS3.</p><p>Although PBS3 tolerates a range of benzoates as substrates, there is a strict requirement for Glu as the amino acid substrate with pABA. No activity was observed with the other 19 amino acids, including Asp which differs from Glu by only one methylene group. In addition, modified forms of Glu were inactive. This suggests a precise configuration of the active site for <sc>l</sc>-glutamic acid. The strict requirement for Glu is unusual among the few characterized GH3 enzymes, which are capable of conjugating the addition of multiple amino acids to the acyl substrate <italic>in vitro</italic>. For example, JAR1 catalyzes the addition of jasmonate to at least 11 amino acids and the ethylene precursor 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). JAR1 does not, however, appear to form Glu or Asp conjugates. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Group II GH3 proteins also catalyze the formation of multiple IAA-amino acid conjugates <italic>in vitro</italic>, including those with Glu and Asp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Some of these IAA-conjugating proteins, such as GH3.17, exhibit a strong preference for either Glu or Asp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Surprisingly, with 4-HBA as the acyl substrate, PBS3 can utilize a number of amino acids, including Glu but not Asp (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). What accounts for this difference in amino acid specificity? PBS3 exhibits &#x0223c;3-fold higher affinity for pABA than for 4-HBA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Perhaps the pABA-AMP intermediate more precisely fits the active site, constraining acceptable amino acids for use in the conjugation reaction. In terms of <italic>in planta</italic> activity, this would depend upon the relative availability of acyl and amino acid substrates.</p><p><italic>Kinetic Parameters of PBS3 and Physiological Relevance of Substrates</italic>&#x02014;We found that PBS3 had the highest affinity for pABA (<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> = 153 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>), compared with 4-HBA (459 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) and BA (867 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). One <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value that has been reported previously for a GH3 family member is that of JAR1 for (&#x02013;)-jasmonic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). This value, 190 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>, is similar to what we found for PBS3. The <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for PBS3 with 4-HBA (20.36 min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>) was 7- and 5-fold higher than the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> with pABA or BA, respectively. This resulted in similar catalytic efficiencies for 4-HBA and pABA, compared with that of BA, which was much lower. Taken together, these findings suggest 4-HBA and pABA as likely substrates <italic>in planta</italic>. However, to assess the relevance of our findings, we must consider the physiological concentrations of the substrates of PBS3. How do the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values we have determined compare with physiological concentrations of these substrates?</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, pathogen-induced BA levels have been rarely reported, although BA levels of &#x0223c;4 nmol/g FW, assessed using gas chromatography-MS, were detected at 2 days post-inoculation with a virulent <italic>P. syringae</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). As pathogen-induced BA levels have not been measured with sufficient temporal (or spatial) resolution to be confident in physiological concentrations, we also reviewed reports of the affinity of pathogen-inducible <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> enzymes for BA to provide insight into relevant physiological concentrations. The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> glucosyltransferases with the highest activity and affinity for BA have reported apparent <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values for BA of 260 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>) and 540 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>) for UGT74F1 and 80 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>) for UGT74F2. The apparent <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SA/BA methyltransferase AtBSMT1 for BA is reported to be 65 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). These affinities suggest that physiological concentrations of BA are insufficient to support efficient catalysis by PBS3 using BA as the acyl substrate. Therefore, given the low affinity (<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> = 867 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) and catalytic efficiency of PBS3 with BA, it appears that BA may not be the favored substrate of PBS3 <italic>in planta</italic>.</p><p>pABA-Glu has been detected in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves at 0.3 nmol/g FW and is thought to be present as a breakdown product of folates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). Folates consist of three subunits as follows: a pterin moiety, pABA, and varying numbers of glutamic acids. They are essential cofactors in one-carbon transfer reactions, which are central to plant metabolism, and are involved in the synthesis of methionine, pantothenate, purines, pyrimidines, and thymidylate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). It may be that pABA-Glu is not just a breakdown product of folate but is actually synthesized <italic>de novo</italic> in response to biotic stress. Although an increase in pABA or pABA-Glu has not been detected in response to pathogen attack in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, pABA-Glu is not likely to be efficiently isolated using standard procedures for the measurement of metabolites like SA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). The apparent <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value of the pABA-glucosyltransferase for pABA was found to be 120 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>), which is quite similar to the value we found for PBS3. Perhaps the formation of pABA-Glu conjugates is a way for plants to restrict access of the pathogen to free pABA. Bacteria can commonly import pABA but few have been found that import pABA-Glu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). Furthermore, there is precedent for pABA limitations on the growth of phytopathogens, as observed for growth of a folate auxotroph of <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> on tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). Therefore, pABA remains an attractive candidate as a potential substrate for PBS3 <italic>in planta</italic>.</p><p>4-HBA is typically known as an intermediate in the synthesis of ubiquinone, a lipid-soluble electron carrier of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>). Therefore, all plants normally produce 4-HBA in small quantities. However, some plants use 4-HBA in the synthesis of specialized metabolites such as shikonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>), and 4-HBA is often found associated with the plant cell wall, typically as a component of lignin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). Pathogen (or elicitor-)-induced synthesis of 4-HBA and incorporation into the plant cell wall has been reported for a number of plants, including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>) and carrot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>). For example, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in response to virulent and avirulent <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> DC3000, 4-HBA accumulated to 0.2 nmol/mg cell wall by 72 hours post-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>) or &#x0223c;5 nmol/g FW (calculated using our milligrams of cell wall/g FW conversion factor obtained with this cell wall preparation protocol). Enzymes that use 4-HBA as a substrate include five putative <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> 4-HBA glucosyltransferases, which exhibit <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values of 210&#x02013;290 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> for 4-HBA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>) and <italic>Lithospermum erythrorhizon</italic> geranyldiphosphate, 4-HBA geranyltransferases involved in shikonin synthesis, with reported <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values for 4-HBA ranging from 18.4 to 45.9 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>). Therefore, 4-HBA remains an attractive candidate for the <italic>in planta</italic> substrate for PBS3, with 4-HBA/4-HBA-Glu perhaps playing a role in pathogen-induced cell wall remodeling.</p><p>As the analytical methods required to extract, enrich, and detect these putative conjugates are highly specific, our <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis now allows us to employ methods specific to these compounds and to the analysis of compounds incorporated into the cell wall. To date, <italic>in planta</italic> activities of GH3 enzymes appear consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> findings. For example, IAA-Asp is one of the dominant IAA-amino acid conjugates formed by GH3.6 as evaluated by TLC, and overexpression of GH3.6 results in a 4.5-fold increase in IAA-Asp in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Similarly, <italic>jar1</italic> mutants exhibit &#x0003e;7-fold reduction in JA-Ile levels, and JA-Ile is a dominant JA-amino acid conjugate observed by TLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Consistent with the preference of PBS3 for Glu, the only endogenous benzoyl-amino acid conjugates detected <italic>in planta</italic> have been either Glu or Asp conjugates (<italic>e.g.</italic> pABA-Glu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>), 4-HBA-Glu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>), SA-Asp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>), and BA-Asp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>)). As PBS3 is not active with Asp, it will be interesting to determine whether another <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GH3 family member exhibits overlapping acyl substrate specificity but altered AA preference, as is the case for the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> GH3 family members acting on IAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). This possibility may also require the use of a PBS3 overexpresser to detect significantly altered levels of putative Glu conjugates.</p><p><italic>How Does PBS3 Function Impact SA Metabolism and SA-dependent Gene Expression?</italic>&#x02014;Previous analyses of <italic>pbs3</italic>/<italic>gdg1</italic>/<italic>win3</italic> mutants by us and others showed that the lack of function of AtGH3.12 (PBS3) reduced total (free and glucose-conjugated SA (SAG)) pathogen-induced SA accumulation, activation of SA-dependent gene expression, and disease resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>). Furthermore, exogenous application of SA to <italic>gh3.12</italic> mutants induced the expression of SA-dependent genes such as <italic>PR1</italic> and rescued the enhanced disease susceptibility phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>). Therefore, the most likely position for PBS3 function would be upstream of SA biosynthesis. The action of PBS3 upstream of SA rather than on SA itself is further supported by the observed substrate specificity of PBS3, with PBS3 being inactive on SA (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). It is not likely that PBS3 functions through modulation of the activity of SA biosynthetic enzymes, as we found the activity of AtICS1 and a surrogate IPL were not affected by favored PBS3 substrates or products. Furthermore, if PBS3 acted in this way to promote SA biosynthesis and subsequent formation of the SAG conjugate, it would not make sense for PBS3 activity to then be inhibited by low concentrations of SA (IC<sub>50</sub> = 15 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> SA). Of interest, AtBSMT1, which catalyzes the formation of MeSA from SA, functions at these low concentrations of SA (<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> = 16 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> for SA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value of the pathogen-induced <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SA glucosyltransferase 1 (UGT 74F1; At2g43840), which converts free SA to SAG, is 190&#x02013;230 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> for SA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>), suggesting higher concentrations of SA are required for SAG formation. <italic>In situ</italic> quantification of free SA has not been reported in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In tobacco, tobacco mosaic virus inoculation resulted in free SA accumulation of 6.5 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> at 16 hpi with maximal detected local concentrations of &#x0003e;200 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> at 40 hpi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, it is likely that PBS3 functions upstream of SA, early in the defense response when SA levels are low. In this scenario, PBS3 activity leads to conjugate formation (<italic>e.g.</italic> 4HBA-Glu), which signals or primes SA biosynthesis. PBS3 activity is then no longer required once SA synthesis has been sufficiently initiated. The inhibition of PBS3 by SA serves as a mechanism to rapidly reduce synthesis of the conjugate when it is no longer necessary for SA priming. In this scenario, we would expect a reduced conjugate (<italic>e.g.</italic> 4-HBA-Glu) concentration as the defense response progresses. A role for PBS3 upstream of SA in a regulatory capacity is also supported by recent expression profiling comparing expression of wild type and a variety of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants in defense signaling at 24 hpi with <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>maculicola</italic> ES4326 using a custom mini array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>). In this study, PBS3 was placed upstream of SA and NPR1, as the <italic>pbs3</italic> mutation impacted the expression of many more genes than the standard SA biosynthesis and signaling mutants <italic>ics1</italic>(<italic>sid2</italic>), <italic>eds5</italic>, and <italic>npr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>). Of interest, the expression of chalcone synthase, a key enzyme directing flux to flavonoid biosynthesis from 4-coumaroyl-CoA, was strongly down-regulated at 24 hpi with <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>maculicola</italic> in wild type and <italic>ics1</italic> but was up-regulated in the <italic>pbs3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>). In other systems such as elicited carrot cell cultures, up-regulation of 4-HBA synthesis and enhanced flux through the general phenylpropanoid pathway was associated with down-regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis from 4-coumaroyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>). This suggests that flux from 4-coumaroyl-CoA to phenylpropanoid cell wall precursors may be up-regulated to facilitate the observed cell wall remodeling. Therefore, it is possible that PBS3 coordinately modulates pathogen-induced SA, 4-HBA, and their associated responses with 4-HBA playing a role in cell wall remodeling and the direction of chorismate flux (from 4-coumaroyl-CoA) for this purpose. Future work will address this possibility and potential mechanisms of action. For example, given the known function of phytohormone-AA conjugates in promoting or inhibiting the ubiquitin ligase-dependent proteasomic degradation of the associated transcriptional repressor, it is tempting to speculate that 4-HBA-Glu may act in a similar manner. With our knowledge of the <italic>in vitro</italic> specificity of PBS3 gained through this study, potential PBS3 products could be used in assays with candidate F-box proteins and repressors to identify F-box-repressor interactions mediating SA and/or 4-HBA-associated signaling (similar to Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> for JA). This is critical as these interactions require binding of the appropriate molecule, <italic>e.g.</italic> JA-Ile for JA signaling.</p><p>In summary, this study further supports the critical role of amino acid conjugation of small molecules in phytohormone regulation and homeostasis. To date, this conjugation is catalyzed by members of the GH3 enzyme family. Here we characterize the <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of the first GH3 subfamily III member to be analyzed, PBS3 (AtGH3.12). In the process, we developed a high throughput adenylation assay to screen for preferred acyl substrates of GH3 enzymes. This high throughput assay can be applied to the identification of substrates for other GH3 enzymes for which no acyl substrates have been identified or inferred through analysis of mutant phenotypes. We also determine kinetic parameters for recombinant PBS3 and demonstrate that PBS3 is specifically inhibited by low concentrations of SA. This is important as it presents a novel mechanism for rapidly and reversibly fine-tuning the activity of small molecules, including phytohormones. It could also be a mechanism for rapid and reversible cross-talk between phytohormones or other small molecules, such as SA and 4-HBA. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses of PBS3 suggest a potential, underexplored role for 4-HBA (and/or pABA) and their respective amino acid conjugates in plantmicrobe interactions and provide a framework to explore the mechanism by which PBS3 impacts pathogen-induced SA accumulation and disease resistance. In addition, using knowledge of the substrate preferences and biochemical and kinetic properties of PBS3, one could test and optimize PBS3 for use in biotechnological applications. For example, PBS3 might be used to remove and purify 4-HBA, an inhibitory by-product of cellulosic ethanol production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>). 4-HBA, hydrolyzed from the 4-HBA-AA conjugate, could then be sold to the liquid crystal polymer industry, as it is a preferred monomer used in the manufacture of liquid crystal polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Marcus Strawn (Wildermuth laboratory) for purified isochorismate, recombinant Arabidopsis isochorismate synthase (AtICS1), recombinant P. aeruginosa isochorismate pyruvate lyase (PchB), and valuable discussions regarding this research.
