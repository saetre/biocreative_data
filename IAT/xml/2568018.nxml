Experimental data based on dominant-negative approaches suggest that the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a regulator of Wnt signaling and the cytoskeleton, regulates polarity of neuroectodermal precursors and neurons, helping specify one neurite as the axon, promoting its outgrowth, and guiding axon pathfinding. However, such dominant-negative approaches might affect processes in which APC is not essential. We completely removed both APCs from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larval neural precursors and neurons, testing whether APCs play universal roles in neuronal polarity. Surprisingly, APCs are not essential for asymmetric cell division or the stereotyped division axis of central brain (CB) neuroblasts, although they do affect cell cycle progression and spindle architecture. Likewise, CB, lobular plug, and mushroom body neurons do not require APCs for polarization, axon outgrowth, or, in the latter two cases, axon targeting. These data suggest that proposed cytoskeletal roles for APCs in mammals should be reassessed using loss of function tools.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>K.

They arise from polarized neural progenitors that divide asymmetrically (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Solecki et al., 2006</xref>). One key question in neural development is how polarity is established and maintained. Neural polarity requires conserved machinery used in all animal cells, including Rho family and Par proteins. The Par3&#x02013;Par6&#x02013;aPKC complex is an apical marker in epithelial cells and neural precursors and plays critical roles in asymmetric distributing cell fate determinants and aligning mitotic spindles (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldstein and Macara, 2007</xref>).</p><p>One superb model of neuronal polarity is cultured hippocampal neurons (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</xref>). They undergo ordered changes from multipolar extension of many immature neurites to selection of one as the axon followed by rapid axon growth. Other neurites become dendrites. The Par3 complex localizes to nascent axon tips, and altering Par protein function disrupts polarity and thus axon outgrowth. To influence axon outgrowth, the axon selection machinery must influence the actin and microtubule (MT) cytoskeletons. The Par complex is proposed to regulate GSK3 kinase, which in turn regulates MT-associated proteins like Tau and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), linking the Par complex, the cytoskeleton, and axon outgrowth (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Solecki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</xref>).</p><p>APC is an attractive candidate polarity regulator. APC and GSK3 negatively regulate the Wnt effector &#x003b2;-catenin (&#x003b2;-cat), and Wnt signaling can shape cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">N&#x000e4;thke, 2006</xref>). APC plays a separate role in cytoskeletal regulation in part through effects on MT stability and cortical association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">N&#x000e4;thke, 2006</xref>). One illustrative example involves polarized astrocyte migration in which APC is suggested to act at the end of a cdc42&#x02013;GSK3&#x02013;Par complex pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2003</xref>). APCs may also regulate neural precursor polarity. In fly embryos, neural precursors (neuroblasts [NBs]) divide asymmetrically, whereas other ectodermal cells divide symmetrically. APC2 RNAi depletion led epidermal cells to divide asymmetrically like NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al., 2001</xref>). In other stem cell types, APCs help orient mitotic spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yamashita et al., 2003</xref>) or regulate exit from the stem cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van de Wetering et al., 2002</xref>), which are roles they might also play in neural precursors.</p><p>Several studies suggest that APC is essential for neuronal polarity and axon extension. The Snider and Jan laboratories provided the first connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2004</xref>). NGF triggers GSK3 inactivation specifically at axon tips, allowing APC to localize there. When they misexpressed truncated APCs that they propose are dominant negative, axon outgrowth was significantly reduced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al. (2004)</xref> proposed that local GSK3 inhibition in growth cones allows APC to regulate MTs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shi et al. (2004)</xref> suggested that APC helps transport Par3 to the axon tip. Several papers extended these studies but suggested other mechanisms. One suggested that GSK3 and APC act, at least in part, through &#x003b2;-cat via direct cytoskeletal/adhesive effects and via Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Votin et al., 2005</xref>). The other suggested that GSK3 regulates membrane trafficking to neurites, perhaps via APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gartner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collin et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, APC inactivation by CALI (chromophore-assisted laser inactivation) affects growth cone migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koester et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting an additional role in axon guidance. These studies suggest that APC is a GSK3 effector acting on the cytoskeleton to direct axon polarization, outgrowth, and guidance, a model now widely accepted in reviews (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldstein and Macara, 2007</xref>) and textbooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Squire et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>These experiments have two important caveats. First, none used genetic loss of function to reduce or eliminate APC function; instead, they expressed truncated APC fragments, reasoning that these are dominant negative, or used CALI to inactivate APC and possibly its binding partners. Because APC has many cytoskeletal partners, truncated APCs may sequester these in inactive complexes and thus have indirect effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCartney et al., 2006</xref>). These issues are critical, as is shown by Par3. Although cell culture studies supported a Par3 role in neuronal polarity, (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shi et al., 2003</xref>) loss of function analysis in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> demonstrated that this is not an essential Par3 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rolls and Doe, 2004</xref>). Second, most studies did not consider the possibility that APC inactivation alters Wnt signaling. Because Wnts regulate asymmetric divisions, neuronal migration, and axon outgrowth in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Silhankova and Korswagen, 2007</xref>) and inhibit NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chou et al., 2000</xref>), APC might affect axon outgrowth by affecting Wnt signaling.</p><p>We tested the hypothesis that APCs play a fundamental cytoskeletal role in polarity of neuronal progenitors and neurons. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we have the unique ability to simultaneously eliminate function of both APCs using protein-null alleles, revealing how complete APC loss affects polarization of neural precursors and their neuronal progeny.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>APCs are not essential for asymmetric division or spindle orientation in central brain (CB) NBs</title><p>APC2 is asymmetrically localized in larval CB NBs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akong et al., 2002</xref>). These neural progenitors undergo a series of asymmetric divisions, giving rise to ganglion mother cells (GMCs) that remain associated with the NB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Progeny of GMCs remain associated as a cluster and differentiate as neurons. CB NB asymmetric divisions occur with a persistent spindle orientation with each new daughter born next to the previous daughter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akong et al., 2002</xref>). This persistent orientation is thought to involve a series of cues, including a fixed centrosome, cortical cues, and cortical interactions of astral MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Siller et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rebollo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rusan and Peifer, 2007</xref>). APC2's striking asymmetric localization suggested it helps orient spindles as it does in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yamashita et al., 2003</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>CB NBs do not require APCs for asymmetric cell division.</bold> (A) Larval brain.

Both flies and mammals have only two APC family members. <italic>Drosophila</italic> offers unique tools allowing us to completely eliminate APC function using well-characterized protein-null alleles of both genes. <italic>APC2<sup>g10</sup></italic> has a stop codon in the Arm repeats (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807079/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807079/DC1</ext-link>) and is clearly protein null, as we demonstrated by immunoblotting with an N-terminal antibody; <italic>APC2<sup>g10</sup></italic> does not produce detectable truncated proteins, whereas alleles with later stop codons do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCartney et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>APC1<sup>Q8</sup></italic> also truncates APC1 very early in the second of seven Arm repeats (Fig. S1 A). It is protein null with APC1 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 1998</xref>). Maternal-zygotic <italic>APC2<sup>g10</sup> APC1<sup>Q8</sup></italic> double mutant embryos die with strongly activated Wnt signaling; cell fates and Arm levels are similar to those of null alleles of other destruction complex proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCartney et al., 2006</xref>). We used mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee and Luo, 2001</xref>) to generate GFP-marked double null mutant cells (<italic>APC2<sup>g10</sup> APC1<sup>Q8</sup></italic>) with GFP-marked wild-type clones as controls. In some cases, we also generated cells null for <italic>APC1</italic> and carrying <italic>APC2<sup>d40</sup></italic>. <italic>APC2<sup>d40</sup></italic> produces strongly reduced levels of a truncated protein like those seen in human tumors and is strong but not null with respect to Wnt signaling. It also has dominant-negative effects on cytoskeletal events in syncytial embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCartney et al., 2006</xref>). To ensure that all residual wild-type APC was depleted or diluted, we waited 3&#x02013;4 d after induction; during this time, CB NBs undergo 30&#x02013;50 divisions, and clone volume increases &#x0223c;20-fold. We confirmed APC2 depletion by APC2 antibody staining <italic>APC2<sup>d40</sup> APC1<sup>Q8</sup></italic> clones; perdurant wild-type protein plus levels of truncated <italic>APC2<sup>d40</sup></italic> protein were reduced to background levels (Fig. S1, compare B with C). APC1 protein accumulates at low levels in NBs and high levels in neuronal axons; this staining is abolished in <italic>APC1<sup>Q8</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akong et al., 2002</xref>). To confirm that residual wild-type APC1 was depleted in <italic>APC2<sup>g10</sup> APC1<sup>Q8</sup></italic> clones, we stained these with APC1 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayashi et al., 1997</xref>). Staining was reduced to background levels (Fig. S2), which was especially apparent in CB neuron axons where staining is usually prominent.</p><p>We hypothesized that loss of both APCs would abrogate asymmetric division or eliminate persistent spindle alignment. Surprisingly, neither property was disrupted. We assessed asymmetric divisions using CD8-GFP, revealing membranes, nuclei, and spindles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>), or Tau-GFP, marking spindles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, F and G</xref>). Double mutant NBs (both <italic>APC2<sup>g10</sup> APC1<sup>Q8</sup></italic> and <italic>APC2<sup>d40</sup> APC1<sup>Q8</sup></italic>) exhibited apparently normal asymmetric divisions with high fidelity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D&#x02013;G</xref>; Table S1, and Videos 1&#x02013;3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807079/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807079/DC1</ext-link>). Furthermore, mutant NBs maintained a persistent division axis as in wild type, with the new daughter always born next to the previous daughter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A&#x02013;C</xref>; Table S1, and Videos 4&#x02013;6). Because cortical polarity proteins regulate spindle alignment in many cell types, we examined the relationship between cortical polarity and spindle orientation. This was normal for both apical (aPKC; Fig. S3, A and B) and basal (Miranda; Fig. S3, C and D) markers. Finally, adherens junction proteins remained asymmetrically localized (Fig. S3, E&#x02013;J). Thus, APCs are not essential for the decision between symmetric and asymmetric divisions here, as was suggested in embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, APC loss must not eliminate MT&#x02013;cortical interactions critical for CB NB spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Siller et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2006</xref>), as loss of APC does in some cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Green and Kaplan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caldwell et al., 2007</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>CB NBs do not require APCs for persistent spindle positioning.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) Time-lapse images; NB clones followed for two rounds of division.

We examined both parameters in <italic>APC</italic> double mutants. Although spindle structure was grossly normal, a subset of cells exhibited spindle defects. Wild-type spindles are symmetric and straight along the axis between centrosomes (98% are symmetric, with only 2% (1/54) of spindles bent to follow the cortex; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). In APC double mutants, bent spindle frequency was significantly increased; 17% of <italic>APC2<sup>g10</sup> APC1<sup>Q8</sup></italic> NBs had bent spindles (4/24; P &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>).

In control clones, CB neurons remain associated and send out a single fasciculated nerve (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, D and G</xref>). In striking contrast to predictions from dominant-negative studies in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Votin et al., 2005</xref>), double mutant CB neurons successfully initiate and extend an axon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C, E, F, H, and I</xref>). Furthermore, their axons fasciculate to form a single nerve. In wild type, actin and <italic>Drosophila</italic> E-cadherin accumulate at high levels in fasciculated axons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B [glancing section along fasciculated axons] and J</xref>, [white arrows, axon in cross section]). In <italic>APC2<sup>g10</sup> APC1<sup>Q8</sup></italic> double null axons, both proteins had a similar polarized accumulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 J</xref>, yellow arrows).

Thus, we tested whether APCs play general roles in this process. One disadvantage of CB NBs is that there are &#x0223c;100 CB NBs and neuronal progeny of each have distinct axon projection patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pereanu and Hartenstein, 2006</xref>), making it very difficult to assess precision of axon targeting in clonally derived mutant neurons. Thus, we turned to two other larval neuronal populations with stereotyped axon projection patterns. We first examined lobular plug neurons, which have cell bodies at the lateral edge of the optic lobe and axons projecting medially to the laminar neuropil (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, right). Clonal lobular neurons double null for both <italic>APC</italic>s had axonal projections indistinguishable from control wild-type clones; they polarized and sent out axons that projected medially to the neuropil (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, K&#x02013;M</xref>). Thus, APCs are not essential for axon outgrowth or guidance decisions of these neurons with relatively simple axon trajectories.</p><p>Our final test used some of the best characterized larval neurons, the mushroom body (MB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>). They have highly reproducible axon and dendrite projections with fasciculated axons that first project ventrally and then turn and bifurcate in separate dorsal and medial projections (we visualized MBs using the MB-specific GAL4201Y driver; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A, B, E, and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 1995</xref>).

One clone made an axon outgrowth error (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, I and I&#x02032;</xref>), which may reflect a modest role for APCs in this complex guidance decision or may be a random error unrelated to APC.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>APCs are not required for MB axon targeting.</bold> (A and E) Posterior-dorsal (A) and anterior views (E) of third instar MB.

However, medullar axon outgrowth defects result from activated Wnt signaling caused by APC loss rather than APC cytoskeletal roles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, J and K</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayden et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, we tested whether activated Wnt signaling alters MB axons by expressing activated Armadillo, the Wnt effector. This had no effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, L and M</xref>), suggesting MB neurons do not respond to Wnt signaling. Activated Wnt signaling also does not alter CB neuron axon outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akong et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that in axons where Wnt signaling is not crucial, axon outgrowth and targeting do not require APC.</p><p>Together, our data provide the first direct test of the hypothesis that APC is a universal mediator of symmetric versus asymmetric divisions or axon polarization and outgrowth in vivo. APCs play key roles in asymmetric divisions in male germline stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yamashita et al., 2003</xref>). RNAi in the embryonic ectoderm also suggested a role in division symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al., 2001</xref>), although a subsequent loss of function study called this into question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCartney et al., 2006</xref>). CB NBs do not require APCs for division asymmetry or persistent spindle orientation despite APC2's striking asymmetric localization. <italic>APC</italic>-null cells also undergo asymmetric divisions in the larval medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayden et al., 2007</xref>), whose architecture is epithelial and thus more like the mammalian cortex. Thus, APCs do not play a key instructive role in matching cortical polarity to spindle cues in CB NBs. We cannot rule out a supporting role in CB NBs, which helps to ensure extremely high fidelity asymmetric division, perhaps acting in parallel with other pathways like those mediated by Mud or the apical polarity cues. Perhaps in different tissues, different pathways work additively but the contributions of each vary. Clearly, in the male germline, loss of APCs disrupts the fidelity of asymmetric division, but even in that tissue APC mutant spindles are mispositioned in only a subset of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yamashita et al., 2003</xref>). This could be tested by double mutant analysis.</p><p>APC loss did prolong the cell cycle, as occurs in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Draviam et al., 2006</xref>), but this delay did not prevent successful completion of mitosis. Spindle structure was also affected with an increased frequency of bent spindles, but these defects did not disrupt asymmetric division.</p><p>We next tested the hypothesis that APCs are key effectors of neuronal polarity, axon outgrowth, and growth cone guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Votin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koester et al., 2007</xref>). However, in three different neuronal populations, axon outgrowth and fasciculation were normal in APC's absence, and in lobular plug and MB neurons, axon targeting was also unaffected. These data compellingly demonstrate that APCs do not play conserved roles in axon polarization and outgrowth in all neurons.</p><p>How do we explain the discrepancies between our and earlier data? First, APCs may not play a universal role in neuronal polarity in either flies or mammals, with effects in hippocampal neurons the result of methods used to disrupt APC function. Because GSK3 has many substrates, including MAPs like Tau, GSK3 manipulation may affect substrates other than APC. Misexpression of APC fragments may sequester binding partners (e.g., GSK3, ASEF, and KIF3) with important roles in cytoskeletal regulation, blocking polarization even if APCs themselves play no essential role. Consistent with this, truncated APC2 has dominant-negative effects on cytoskeletal events in early embryos in which APC2 plays only a modest role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCartney et al., 2006</xref>). Second, effects in hippocampal neurons could reflect APC's role in Wnt signaling rather than a direct role in polarization. Wnts regulate axon outgrowth in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, flies, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yoshikawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Silhankova and Korswagen, 2007</xref>). Perhaps Wnts regulate hippocampal axon outgrowth. Interestingly, while our manuscript was under review, a study appeared suggesting that Wnt signals regulate growth cone structure and migration in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons, perhaps via changes in APC localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Purro et al., 2008</xref>). Of course, it is possible that machinery regulating neuronal polarity differs between flies and mammals, although this is not the case for epithelial polarity (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldstein and Macara, 2007</xref>).</p><p>These possibilities can now be tested in mice. Conditional APC knockout in the developing brain would directly test whether APC is critical for axon outgrowth. Furthermore, if effects are seen, one can test whether these are mediated by Wnt signaling using activated &#x003b2;-cat and dominant-negative TCF (T cell factor) to activate or block Wnt signaling. Similar work revealed that APC's role in chromosome instability is mediated, at least in part, via Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoki et al., 2007</xref>). Our results suggest that these experiments should be a high priority for future research.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Fly strain and genetic crosses</title><p>Genes and alleles are described at Flybase.org.
