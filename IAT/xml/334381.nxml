The GT1 element in the context of the uteroglobin promoter is active in Ishikawa cells, a human endometrial cell line, but not in HeLa cells. Here we report the cloning by recognition site screening of two factors (SPR-1 and SPR-2) which bind to this GT1 motif. SPR-1 and SPR-2 are homologues of the transcription factor Sp1. All three proteins are closely related members of a gene family encoding proteins with very similar structural features. Like Sp1, SPR-1 and SPR-2 contain glutamine and serine/threonine rich amino acid stretches. Most significantly, the DNA binding domains of all three proteins are highly conserved and they recognize GT as well as GC boxes identically. SPR-2 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously, whereas SPR-1 transcripts are abundant in the brain but barely detectable in other organs. The possible function of these factors for the activity of the uteroglobin promoter is discussed.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0017-a" xlink:role="5523"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0018-a" xlink:role="5524"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5519"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5520"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5521"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5522"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0017.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5523"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0018.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5524"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0019.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5525"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
