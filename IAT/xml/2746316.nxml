Favorable tumors, which are usually detected by mass screening based on increased levels of catecholamines in urine, regress spontaneously via programmed cell death (PCD) or mature through differentiation into benign ganglioneuroma (GN). In contrast, advanced-type NB tumors often grow aggressively, despite intensive chemotherapy. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of PCD during spontaneous regression in favorable NB tumors, as well as identifying genes with a pro-death role, is a matter of urgency for developing novel approaches to the treatment of advanced-type NB tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>We found that the expression of <italic>lysosomal associated protein multispanning transmembrane 5</italic> (<italic>LAPTM5</italic>) was usually down-regulated due to DNA methylation in an NB cell-specific manner, but up-regulated in degenerating NB cells within locally regressing areas of favorable tumors detected by mass-screening. Experiments <italic>in vitro</italic> showed that not only a restoration of its expression but also the accumulation of LAPTM5 protein, was required to induce non-apoptotic cell death with autophagic vacuoles and lysosomal destabilization with lysosomal-membrane permeabilization (LMP) in a caspase-independent manner. While autophagy is a membrane-trafficking pathway to degrade the proteins in lysosomes, the LAPTM5-mediated lysosomal destabilization with LMP leads to an interruption of autophagic flux, resulting in the accumulation of immature autophagic vacuoles, p62/SQSTM1, and ubiqitinated proteins as substrates of autophagic degradation. In addition, ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies appeared in degenerating NB cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We propose a novel molecular mechanism for PCD with the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles due to LAPTM5-mediated lysosomal destabilization. LAPTM5-induced cell death is lysosomal cell death with impaired autophagy, not cell death by autophagy, so-called autophagic cell death. Thus LAPTM5-mediated PCD is closely associated with the spontaneous regression of NBs and opens new avenues for exploring innovative clinical interventions for this tumor.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuroblastoma (NB) is a malignant tumor consisting of undifferentiated neuroectodermal cells from the neural crest and the most common solid tumor in children. Most primary tumors occur within the abdomen, with the adrenal medulla affected in about 50&#x00025; of NB patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Brodeur1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Maris1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The clinical behavior of NB is heterogeneous: favorable tumors, which are usually detected by mass screening based on increased levels of catecholamines in urine, regress spontaneously via programmed cell death (PCD) or mature through differentiation into benign ganglioneuromas (GN) in patients under 1 year of age, with minimal or no therapeutic intervention; while advanced-type NBs, usually clinically detected, often grow rapidly to become fatal in older children, despite intensive chemotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Brodeur1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Maris1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The spontaneous regression and maturation of favorable NBs coincide with the neuronal differentiation and massive cellular suicide during the normal development of the nervous system, indicating that NB cells in favorable tumors may retain the genetic program of their normal counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Schwab1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it has been considered that NB cells within regressing tumors may undergo apoptosis (a form of PCD), involving the neurotrophin signaling pathway through TrkA (receptor) and nerve growth factor (NGF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Maris1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Oue1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However some groups failed to find evidence of a correlation between apoptosis and factors associated with spontaneous regression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Tonini1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Kitanaka1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, a previous electron microscopic analysis revealed that degenerative changes including the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles are a conspicuous feature of NBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Kodet1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, and it has also been proposed that the spontaneous regression of NBs may occur via a H-Ras-associated non-apoptotic mechanism with the appearance of autophagic vacuoles in a caspase-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Kitanaka1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

This slow process suggests that the degenerating NB cells in the late phase of PCD are a small proportion in favorable NB tumors found by mass-screening and then exenterated surgically, and therefore some genes having a pro-death role in PCD may yet to be expressed in mass-screened NB tumor samples. To develop a breakthrough in therapy against advanced-type NBs, which can not regress spontaneously, it is important to identify genes having a critical role in spontaneous regression/maturation and to understand those molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Here, we found <italic>lysosomal associated protein multispanning transmembrane 5</italic> (<italic>LAPTM5</italic>) to be closely associated with the spontaneous regression of mass-screened NB tumors. Whereas the expression of this gene was usually down-regulated through DNA methylation in favorable and unfavorable NB tumor samples, it was up-regulated in degenerating NB cells within locally regressing areas of mass-screened tumors. Moreover, overexpression of this gene induced caspase-independent lysosomal cell death due to lysosomal destabilization with lysosomal-membrane permeabilization (LMP), with the accumulation of immature autophagic vacuoles and ubiquitinated proteins, leading us to propose novel characteristics for PCD during the spontaneous regression of NBs.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Down-regulation of <italic>LAPTM5</italic> expression through DNA methylation in NB cells</title><p>Previously, we developed a DNA methylation-screening system, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array-based methylated CpG island amplification (MCA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Toyota1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> (BAMCA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Inazawa1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, and identified tumor-related genes down-regulated through DNA methylation in human cancers, including neuroblastoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Misawa1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, expression of <italic>LAPTM5</italic> was restored in correlation with a decrease of the methylation level after treatment with 5-aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine, a demethylating drug, in IMR32 and GOTO cells, although the expression level of LAPTM5 after the restoration was lower than that in normal adrenal glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007099-g001"><bold>Figure 1A, 1B</bold></xref>). We next determined the mRNA level by quantitative RT-PCR and the frequency of methylation at two CG sites (CG-I and &#x02013;II) upstream of TSS of <italic>LAPTM5</italic> by the methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension (Ms-SNuPE) method in primary NB tumors, including favorable (stage-1, -2, -3 and 4S) tumors detected by mass screening and unfavorable (stage-4a) tumors (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007099.s007">Figure S3</xref></bold>). Methylation was detected in all primary NB tumors examined and there was no significant difference in mRNA level and methylation status among tumors at each stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007099-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>). In addition, bisulfite sequencing revealed that the CG sites around the TSS of <italic>LAPTM5</italic> were highly and widely methylated in NB tumors and frequently demethylated in benign ganglioneuromas (GNs) that had developed from NB tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007099-g001"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>). Notably, the frequency of methylation at the two CG sites, especially CG-II, was significantly decreased in GNs compared with NB tumors (66.4&#x00025; to 43.0&#x00025; for CG-I; <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0002, 50.3&#x00025; to 20.9&#x00025; for CG-II; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007099-g001"><bold>Figure 1E</bold></xref>). Furthermore, we examined the level of LAPTM5 protein in NB tumor sections by conducting an immunohistochemical analysis using a specific antibody and confirmed that the protein is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells as reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Levine1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007099-g001"><bold>Figure 1F</bold></xref>).

Interestingly, our immunohistochemical analysis revealed the LAPTM5 protein to be highly expressed in the NB cells within regressing areas (the degenerating NB cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007099-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). We further confirmed a report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Kitanaka1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> that H-Ras was also highly expressed in such areas (<bold>Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007099.s008">Figure S4</xref></bold>).

These regressing areas with LAPTM5-positive degenerating NB cells were much more frequently observed in the mass-screened NB tumors (42 of 54 tumors, 77.8&#x00025;), than in the clinically detected NB tumors (1 of 17 tumors, 5.9&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007099-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>). Furthermore, only one clinically detected tumor with LAPTM5-positive degenerating areas was classified as favorable (stage-2, well-differentiating). In addition, the immunostaining of cleaved caspase-3 revealed that LAPTM5-positive degenerating NB cells were essentially negative at least when the cleaved caspase-3 was present in SH-SY5Y cells induced into apoptosis by treatment with Cisplatin (CDDP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007099-g002"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>), suggesting that caspase-independent cell death might occur in LAPTM5-positive degenerating NB cells.

To test this idea, we first investigated whether LAPTM5 was accumulated on treatment with inhibitors for the intracellular protein degradation system (proteasomal or lysosomal degradation). When GOTO cells at 1 day after Ad-LAPTM5 infection were treated with a proteasomal inhibitor (ALLN or MG132) or a lysosomal inhibitor (Bafilomycin A1; Baf.A1 or NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) for 1 day, a remarkable accumulation of LAPTM5 was detected by western blotting, compared with that in Ad-LAPTM5-infected GOTO cells without each of these treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007099-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>).

Moreover, we examined the effect of inhibiting the accumulation of LAPTM5 with specific siRNA to confirm that the accumulation is required for the induction of cell death. When LAPTM5 siRNA-transfected GOTO cells were infected with Ad-LAPTM5, and cultured with or without Baf.A1 or ALLN, a remarkable inhibition of LAPTM5&#x02032;s accumulation was confirmed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007099-g003"><bold>Figure 3F</bold></xref>).

At this time, it is not clear how the accumulated LAPTM5 contributes to the lysosomal destabilization in degenerating NB cells and how the non-accumulated LAPTM5 functions in differentiating NB cells, adrenal medulla cells, or ganglion cells in GNs. A recent report demonstrated that LAPTM5 plays an important role in the lysosomal degradation of specific substrates in T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Ouchida1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in &#x0201c;differentiating NB cells&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;matured neuroblastic cells&#x0201d; as well as in T cells, LAPTM5 may also function in the lysosomal degradation system for specific substrate(s). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> study showed that LAPTM5 intrinsically localizes to trafficking vesicles from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosomes in NB cells, and consecutive overexpression of LAPTM5 leads to the accumulation of LAPTM5-positive vesicles together with losses of the Golgi apparatus and punctate pattern of lysosomes. It has been reported that LAPTM5 contributes to vesicle trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to lysosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Pak1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, the accumulation of LAPTM5-positive vesicles may lead to a disruption of intracellular vesicle trafficking in the Golgi-lysosome pathway, resulting in lysosomal destabilization, accompanied by interruption of provision of lysosomal contents into the lysosomes, in &#x0201c;degenerating NB cells&#x0201d;. Interestingly, a recent report showed that a down-regulation of lysosomal membrane proteins, LAMP1 and LAMP2, increased sensitivity to the lysosomal cell death and those accumulation induced by inhibition of lysosomal proteases contribute to the resistance to lysosomal cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007099-Fehrenbacher1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>On the other hand, our study also revealed that the lysosomal disruption by treatment with lysosomal inhibitor led to the accumulation for these vesicles (by a decrease of removal in the lysosomes), although LAPTM5-positive vesicles were usually transported into the lysosomes, and to be degraded. A dysfunction of proteasomal protein degradation also led to the accumulation of LAPTM5-positive vesicles. Thus, this protein may be also degraded by ubiquitin-proteasome system to regulate the production of LAPTM5-positive vesicles.
