A large family of DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) proteins has emerged as protein palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs). However, mechanisms that regulate these PATs in a physiological context remain unknown. In this study, we efficiently monitored the dynamic palmitate cycling on synaptic scaffold PSD-95. We found that blocking synaptic activity rapidly induces PSD-95 palmitoylation and mediates synaptic clustering of PSD-95 and associated AMPA (&#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)-type glutamate receptors. A dendritically localized DHHC2 but not the Golgi-resident DHHC3 mediates this activity-sensitive palmitoylation. Upon activity blockade, DHHC2 translocates to the postsynaptic density to transduce this effect. These data demonstrate that individual DHHC members are differentially regulated and that dynamic recruitment of protein palmitoylation machinery enables compartmentalized regulation of protein trafficking in response to extracellular signals.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Posttranslational modification, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and lipid modification, adds functional regulation to proteins beyond genomic information. Lipid modification increases protein hydrophobicity and plays a critical role in protein trafficking, targeting, and function. Thioester-linked palmitate modifies signaling proteins, enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, ion channels, and scaffolding proteins and is involved in diverse aspects of cellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">El-Husseini and Bredt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Resh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Linder and Deschenes, 2007</xref>). Recent global proteomic analyses have further expanded the known complement of palmitoylated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al., 2008</xref>). Palmitoylation is unique in that it is a reversible modification and is proposed to be regulated by specific extracellular signals. Recent cell biological analyses revealed that some palmitoyl substrates such as small GTPases, Harvey Ras/neuroblastoma Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rocks et al., 2005</xref>), and trimeric G proteins G&#x003b1;o (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chisari et al., 2007</xref>)/G&#x003b1;q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsutsumi et al., 2009</xref>) constitutively shuttle between the plasma membrane and the Golgi membrane by a palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle. This palmitate cycling generates and maintains the specific intracellular compartmentalization of substrates in nonpolarized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rocks et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 represents a major palmitoylated protein in neurons and plays critical roles in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Migaud et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">El-Husseini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kennedy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim and Sheng, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Funke et al., 2005</xref>). PSD-95 provides a platform for the postsynaptic clustering of crucial synaptic proteins, including AMPA (&#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) and <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors and cell adhesion molecules. The postsynaptic targeting of PSD-95 depends on protein palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Topinka and Bredt, 1998</xref>). Importantly, palmitate cycling on PSD-95 is dynamically regulated by receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">El-Husseini et al., 2002</xref>). Upon glutamate receptor stimulation, accelerated depalmitoylation of PSD-95 dissociates PSD-95 from postsynaptic sites and causes AMPA receptor (AMPAR) endocytosis. This receptor activation&#x02013;induced depalmitoylation has also been reported in G&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wedegaertner and Bourne, 1994</xref>). Thus, agonist-dependent depalmitoylation down-regulates synaptic strength and G protein signaling. However, it is not yet clear whether addition of palmitate to proteins is accelerated in response to extracellular signals.</p><p>The dynamic regulation of palmitate cycling should be finely tuned by palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) and palmitoyl protein thioesterases (PPTs). Transmembrane proteins containing a DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) Cys&#x02013;rich domain (DHHC proteins) have recently emerged as PATs in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartels et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lobo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Linder and Deschenes, 2004</xref>). At least 23 mammalian DHHC proteins exist, and a systematic screening method has identified specific enzyme&#x02013;substrate pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernandez-Hernando et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ponimaskin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsutsumi et al., 2009</xref>). The DHHC family is present in species ranging from yeast to human and to plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hemsley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hemsley and Grierson, 2008</xref>). Several DHHC genes are associated with diseases, including cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oyama et al., 2000</xref>), schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukai et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2008</xref>), mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mansouri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raymond et al., 2007</xref>), and Huntington&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yanai et al., 2006</xref>). Although the large DHHC family plays essential roles in a range of physiological functions, how the DHHC PAT family is regulated and thereby dynamically controls palmitate cycling remains uncertain.</p><p>In this study, we found that suppression of neuronal activity induces palmitoylation and synaptic accumulation of PSD-95. This activity-sensitive PSD-95 palmitoylation recruits synaptic AMPARs. Dendritically localized DHHC2 mediates this rapid synaptic palmitoylation of PSD-95. In contrast, Golgi-resident DHHC3 constitutively palmitoylates PSD-95. These experiments indicate that large DHHC family members are individually regulated, which enables their participation in specific physiological processes such as synaptic plasticity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) reveals the synaptic accumulation of PSD-95 upon activity blockade</title><p>To follow changes in synaptic PSD-95 accumulation over time, we first performed time-lapse imaging of cultured hippocampal neurons transfected with PSD-95&#x02013;GFP by TIRFM, which excites only molecules within 100 nm of the cover glass. TIRFM preferentially visualizes wild-type (WT) PSD-95&#x02013;GFP as discrete punctae on dendrites, which are not seen with cytosolic palmitoylation&#x02013;deficient (CS) mutant PSD-95 or GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). We confirmed comparable expression levels of PSD-95 (WT) and PSD-95 (CS) in transfected culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). These data confirm that palmitoylation mediates membrane trafficking and synaptic clustering of PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Topinka and Bredt, 1998</xref>). Because PSD-95 visualized by TIRFM apposes presynaptic synaptophysin and VGLUT1 and overlaps postsynaptic NR1 NMDA receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>), TIRFM tracks synaptic PSD-95. When ionotropic glutamate receptor activity was blocked by kynurenic acid (Kyn), the intensity of PSD-95&#x02013;GFP by TIRFM steadily increased over 2 h, whereas the intensity of PSD-95 (CS) did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200903101/DC1">Video 1</ext-link>). This Kyn-induced PSD-95 increase was blocked by coapplication of 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), which is a palmitoyl acyl transfer inhibitor. PSD-95 signals did not detectably change within 2 h of 2-BP treatment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). These results indicate that newly occurring palmitoylation mediates this synaptic accumulation of PSD-95. Tetrodotoxin (TTX), a blocker of action potentials, also increased PSD-95 accumulation. The dynamic change of PSD-95 intensity was specific to palmitoylation as the localizations of GFP-Rac1-CLLL (Cys-Leu-Leu-Leu), a geranylgeranylated CaaL motif, and synaptophysin-GFP, a presynaptic protein, did not change upon Kyn treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Synaptic PSD-95 accumulation upon activity blockade was also confirmed by antibody staining of native PSD-95 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, C and D</xref>). The effect of Kyn or TTX on PSD-95 accumulation does not reflect newly synthesized PSD-95, as cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, did not affect the Kyn- or TTX-induced PSD-95 increase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200903101/DC1">Fig. S1, A and B</ext-link>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200903101/DC1">Video 2</ext-link>). Thus, PSD-95 palmitoylation increases at the postsynaptic membrane upon activity blockade. These results are complementary to receptor activation&#x02013;induced depalmitoylation of PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">El-Husseini et al., 2002</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>TIRFM imaging of activity-sensitive PSD-95 palmitoylation.</bold> (A) Compared with epifluorescent microscopy (Epi; green), TIRFM selectively reveals punctae from GFP-tagged PSD-95 (WT) (top; red) but not palmitoylation-deficient PSD-95 (CS) (bottom; red) in cultured hippocampal neurons.

As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">El-Husseini et al., 2002</xref>), treating neurons for 12 h with 2-BP reduced PSD-95 palmitoylation (palmitoylated PSD-95 = 13 &#x000b1; 15% of control cells; P &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). When we treated neurons for 2 h with Kyn, the amount of palmitoylated PSD-95 significantly increased (198 &#x000b1; 13% of control cells; P &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Blocking glutamate receptors with a combination of APV (D-[-]-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid), which blocks NMDA receptors, and CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione), which blocks AMPARs, also enhanced PSD-95 palmitoylation within 2 h (palmitoylated PSD-95 = 184 &#x000b1; 23% of control cells; P &#x0003c; 0.01). 2-BP blocked the rapid enhancement of PSD-95 palmitoylation, indicating that inhibition of depalmitoylation is not solely responsible and that newly occurring palmitoylation mediates this effect. This activity-sensitive PSD-95 palmitoylation is stoichiometric, as Kyn and APV + CNQX quantitatively shifted the PSD-95 band upward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>; Fig. S1 C; and Fig. S2 B).

Our previous study demonstrated that PSD-95 PATs are DHHC2, -3, -7, and -15, which are phylogenetically divided into two subfamilies, DHHC3/7 and DHHC2/15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukata et al., 2004</xref>). G&#x003b1;q PATs are DHHC3 and -7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsutsumi et al., 2009</xref>), and GluR2 PAT is DHHC3 (Fig. S2 C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayashi et al., 2005</xref>). These substrate selectivities allowed us to ask whether synaptic activity regulates a specific PAT subfamily (i.e., DHHC2/15). We metabolically labeled hippocampal neurons with [<sup>3</sup>H]palmitic acid for 2 h in the presence or absence of Kyn. We found that Kyn-enhanced PSD-95 palmitoylation was partially blocked by a dominant-negative (DN) mutant, DN-DH2/15, which specifically inhibits the DHHC2/15 subfamily (palmitoylated PSD-95 = 61 &#x000b1; 15% of Kyn-treated control cells; P &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukata et al., 2004</xref>). The partial effect of DN-DH2/15 is probably caused by the infection efficiency of DN-DH2/15. Under our conditions, &#x0223c;50% of neurons were expressing DN-DH2/15, which correlates with the extent of inhibition (&#x0223c;40% inhibition). Although the involvement of other PATs cannot be completely ruled out, our results strongly suggest that the DHHC2/15 subfamily plays a major role in activity-sensitive PSD-95 palmitoylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential regulation of PSD-95 palmitoylating enzymes in neurons</title><p>We next examined the cellular locus for PSD-95 palmitoylation.

DHHC3 stably localizes at the Golgi apparatus and constitutively palmitoylates numerous substrates, including G&#x003b1;, GluR2, and PSD-95. In contrast, dendritically localized DHHC2 senses changes in synaptic activity and rapidly translocates near postsynaptic membranes. Synaptically translocated DHHC2 induces rapid, specific, and stoichiometric palmitoylation and synaptic accumulation of PSD-95 and thereby AMPAR recruitment at postsynaptic sites. Thus, activity-sensitive DHHC2 translocation marks sites for AMPAR accumulation through compartmentalized PSD-95 palmitoylation. Complementing these findings, previous works showed that the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> DHHC17/HIP14 homologue localizes primarily to presynaptic terminals and acts on presynaptic Cys string protein and SNAP-25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ohyama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stowers and Isacoff, 2007</xref>). The DHHC family members show distinctive subcellular distributions and different intracellular dynamics upon physiological stimuli. These distinctive properties provide mechanisms for specific control of protein palmitoylation by the large family of DHHC proteins.</p><p>Recent fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and photoconversion analyses revealed that several palmitoylated proteins such as Harvey Ras/neuroblastoma Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rocks et al., 2005</xref>), G&#x003b1;o (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chisari et al., 2007</xref>), and G&#x003b1;q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsutsumi et al., 2009</xref>) rapidly shuttle between the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus. This constitutive shuttling comprises four steps: (1) palmitoylation by the Golgi-resident DHHC proteins, (2) trafficking to the plasma membrane, (3) depalmitoylation by a putative PPT and rapid cytosolic diffusion, and (4) transient trapping at the Golgi for repalmitoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rocks et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsutsumi et al., 2009</xref>). In neurons, where the Golgi apparatus is segregated from the axon and dendrites, we suggest that Golgi-localized DHHC3 mediates the constitutive palmitoylation of PSD-95 at the cell body. In dendrites, PSD-95 depalmitoylated at the postsynaptic membrane diffuses from dendritic spine to shaft, is repalmitoylated on DHHC2-positive vesicles, and is redirected to postsynaptic membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). When synaptic activity is blocked, DHHC2 vesicles translocate from dendritic shafts to sites near the postsynaptic membrane. This allows DHHC2 to repalmitoylate PSD-95 in the spine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). Thus, mobile DHHC2 induces a local increase of PSD-95 palmitoylation, which leads to AMPAR recruitment. We propose that extracellular signals translocate specific DHHC PATs and create a new route for substrate shuttling between loci of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation, leading to efficient and precise substrate targeting. Such a compartmentalized regulatory mechanism of DHHC PATs may contribute to spatiotemporal regulation of signaling molecules in polarized neurons, epithelial cells, and migrating cells.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for compartmentalized synaptic palmitoylation of PSD-95 by mobile DHHC2.</bold> (A) Certain palmitoylated proteins such as the G&#x003b1; subunit shuttle between the plasma membrane and the Golgi in nonpolarized cells.

This approach allowed us to follow dynamic changes in membrane-associated PSD-95&#x02013;GFP over time in individual neurons. However, one may ask whether endogenous PSD-95 shows similar dynamics and whether TIRFM visualizes a limited set of synaptic contacts. The TIRFM limitation was supplemented with epifluorescent and confocal microscopic analyses on endogenous PSD-95. Also, our biohemical approaches, including metabolic labeling and the ABE method, showed that blocking synaptic activity quantitatively increases endogenously palmitoylated PSD-95, supporting the specificity of TIRFM imaging as a method for monitoring palmitoylated proteins in living cells.</p><p>A previous study reported that glutamate receptor activation accelerates depalmitoylation of PSD-95, dissociates PSD-95 from postsynaptic sites, and causes AMPAR endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">El-Husseini et al., 2002</xref>). This sequence suggested that a PPT serves as the regulatory trigger. In contrast, our work demonstrates that activity blockade&#x02013;induced PSD-95 palmitoylation up-regulates synaptic AMPARs. Thus, the palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle of PSD-95 bidirectionally contributes to AMPAR homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">O&#x02019;Brien et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006</xref>). By analogy, &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor activation markedly accelerates depalmitoylation of G&#x003b1;s, shifts G&#x003b1;s to the cytoplasm, and down-regulates &#x003b2;-adrenergic receptor&#x02013;mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wedegaertner and Bourne, 1994</xref>). Collectively, these studies suggest that palmitate cycling may generally mediate homeostasis of receptor-mediated signaling.</p><p>Recently, it was shown that both PSD-95 and PSD-93 play important roles in AMPAR trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elias et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we found that knockdown of PSD-95 alone completely blocks the TTX- or Kyn-induced recruitment of AMPARs to the synapse. One may wonder why knockdown of PSD-95 alone completely blocks the TTX- or Kyn-induced AMPAR recruitment. We quantified expression levels of PSD-95 and PSD-93 in our cultured 18-d in vitro (DIV) hippocampal neurons by quantitative Western blotting. We found that PSD-95 expresses about eight times as much as PSD-93 (Fig. S3 B). Furthermore, we found that PSD-93&#x02013;&#x003b2;, one of the major PSD-93 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Firestein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parker et al., 2004</xref>), is specifically palmitoylated by the DHHC3 and -7 subfamily but not by the DHHC2 and -15 subfamily (Fig. S3 C), indicating that PSD-93&#x02013;&#x003b2; palmitoylation is differently regulated from PSD-95 palmitoylation. Furthermore, it was reported that palmitoylation of PSD-93&#x02013;&#x003b1; and PSD-93&#x02013;&#x003b2; is not necessary for their postsynaptic targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Firestein et al., 2000</xref>).

Elucidation of molecular mechanisms for palmitoylation lays a foundation to understand its role in physiological and pathological conditions. Because DHHC enzymes show substrate specificity, DHHC PATs represent exciting therapeutic targets.

We used BLOCK-iT RNAi Designer (Invitrogen) to select the targeting sequences, and the following targeting sequences were used (targeting both rat and human sequences): miDHHC2, 5&#x02032;-GGTGAACAATTGTGTTGGATT-3&#x02032; (alternative sequence, 5&#x02032;-TGTGCATAGTGTCCATGGAAA-3&#x02032;; both sequences yielded similar results); miDHHC3, 5&#x02032;-TGAGACGGGAATAGAACAATT-3&#x02032;; and miLacZ, 5&#x02032;-GACTACACAAATCAGCGATTT-3&#x02032; (as a negative control). After subcloning these oligonucleotides into pcDNA6.2-EmGFP-miR (Invitrogen), EmGFP was replaced with mCherry, and the pre-miRNA expression cassette of pcDNA6.2-mCherry-miR (or pcDNA6.2-EmGFP-miR) was transferred to the pCAGGS vector with a &#x003b2;-actin promoter. PSD-95 was knocked down as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elias et al., 2006</xref>), replacing GFP of pLLox3.7 (American Type Culture Collection) with mCherry.

All animal experiments described herein were reviewed and approved by the ethical committee in our institutes and were performed according to the institutional guidelines concerning the care and handling of experimental animals. Neurons were seeded at a density of 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells per 3.5-cm glass-based dish (Iwaki) in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B-27 supplement (Invitrogen) and 2 mM Glutamax (Invitrogen). 8&#x02013;10-DIV neurons were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and observed (18&#x02013;21 DIV) at 37&#x000b0;C in a microincubator (MI-IBC-IF; Olympus) with an inverted microscope (IX81; Olympus) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 100&#x000d7; NA 1.45 oil TIRFM objective lens, an ImageEM charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (C9100-13; Hamamatsu Photonics) and Meta Imaging software version 7.1 (MDS Analytical Technologies). A 488-nm laser was used as a light source. Time-lapse images were taken every 10 min with a laser-based zero drift autofocusing system (IX81-ZDC; Olympus), which adjusts the focal plane to the initial focal plane just before each imaging frame. The video files (QuickTime Movie) were produced with ImageReady 2.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc.). To quantitate changes in PSD-95&#x02013;GFP, DHHC2-GFP, or pH-GluR1 intensity by TIRFM, we randomly chose fields, and the punctae (&#x0003e;1.25 &#x000b5;m in diameter) were quantitated in every frame. Fluorescent intensities from TIRF images were analyzed using MetaMorph software version 7.1 (MDS Analytical Technologies). The ratios of intensities at 0&#x02013;120 min (for PSD-95 and DHHC2) or 0&#x02013;12 h (for GluR1) in 50&#x02013;100 randomly selected punctae (three to eight independent experiments) are shown. Kymographs were produced using Meta Imaging software version 7.1.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence analysis of hippocampal neuron culture</title><p>Cultured hippocampal neurons (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells) were seeded onto 12-mm coverslips in 24-well dishes. 18&#x02013;28-DIV neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/120 mM sucrose/100 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked with PBS containing 10 mg/ml BSA for 10 min on ice. For staining of DHHC2 and VGLUT1, neurons were fixed with methanol for 10 min at &#x02212;30&#x000b0;C. For mouse anti-DHHC2 antibody, Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;conjugated anti&#x02013;mouse IgG<sub>1</sub> subtype specific (Invitrogen) was used as a secondary antibody. For surface GluR1 and GluR2 staining, GluR1 and GluR2 receptors were &#x0201c;live&#x0201d; labeled with an antibody to an extracellular epitope of GluR1 (EMD) or GluR2 (Millipore) by incubating neurons in conditioned medium for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Neurons were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and blocked as described above. Surface GluR1 and GluR2 were visualized with Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;conjugated secondary antibody. Fluorescent images were taken with a confocal laser-scanning microscopy system (LSM5 Exciter; Carl Zeiss, Inc.) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63&#x000d7; NA 1.40 oil immersion objective lens. For knockdown experiments, 8&#x02013;12-DIV neurons were transfected with pCAGGS-mCherry-miR vectors by Lipofectamine 2000. At 8&#x02013;10 d after transfection, neurons were stained with anti-DHHC2, DHHC3, PSD-95, GluR1, GluR2, and stargazin/TARP antibodies. To quantitate the intensity of PSD-95 clusters and surface GluR1, surface GluR2, or TARP clusters (costained with PSD-95), we randomly chose 10&#x02013;15 fields from two independent neuronal cultures (on treated and age-matched sister control cultures) and analyzed the three largest caliber proximal dendrites (20 &#x000b5;m long; at least 400 clusters). We measured the mean intensities of individual clusters (&#x0003e;1 &#x000b5;m diameter) along these dendritic segments. Microscope control and all image analyses were performed with ZEN software (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Brightness and contrast adjustments were applied to the whole image using Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems, Inc.). For some experiments, immunolabeled samples were observed by TIRFM and epifluorescent microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>ABE method</title><p>The ABE method was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al., 2008</xref>) and modified for cultured neurons. After treating 18&#x02013;28-DIV hippocampal neurons (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/6-well dish) with the indicated antagonists or inhibitors, neurons were washed with PBS containing 10 mM <italic>N</italic>-ethyl-maleimide (NEM) twice and solubilized with 0.1 ml of lysis buffer (LB; 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, and 50 mM NaCl) containing 2% SDS and 10 mM NEM.

The protein was diluted into 0.8 ml LB with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1 mM NEM and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. NEM was removed by three sequential CM precipitations. Precipitated protein was solubilized in 0.2 ml of buffer SB, and then 0.8 ml HB (1 M hydroxylamine, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mM biotin-HPDP) or buffer TB (1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mM biotin-HPDP) was added. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature and subjected to CM precipitation.

After brief centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 30 &#x000b5;l neutravidin-agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing the beads with LB containing 0.1% SDS and 0.2% Triton X-100, bound proteins were suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.001% bromophenol blue) with 10 mM DTT (without &#x003b2;ME; &#x02212;&#x003b2;ME) and boiled at 90&#x000b0;C for 2 min. To see the palmitoylation-dependent mobility shift of PSD-95, the cell lysate was treated similarly (&#x02212;&#x003b2;ME). To reduce the sample completely, the lysate was separately treated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 2% &#x003b2;ME at 100&#x000b0;C for 5 min (+&#x003b2;ME).
