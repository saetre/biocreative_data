Using a model plant-pathogenic fungus, <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, here we report the most comprehensive analysis of T-DNA integration events in fungi and the development of an informatics infrastructure, termed a <underline>T</underline>-DNA <underline>a</underline>nalysis <underline>p</underline>latform (TAP).

Analysis of the TTLs showed that T-DNA integration was biased among chromosomes and preferred the promoter region of genes. In addition, irregular patterns of T-DNA integration, such as chromosomal rearrangement and readthrough of plasmid vectors, were also observed, showing that T-DNA integration patterns into the fungal genome are as diverse as those of their plant counterparts. However, overall the observed junction structures between T-DNA borders and flanking genomic DNA sequences revealed that T-DNA integration into the fungal genome was more canonical than those observed in plants. Our results support the potential of ATMT as a tool for functional genomics of fungi and show that the TAP is an effective informatics platform for handling data from large-scale insertional mutagenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the completion of genome sequencing of the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Goffeau <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>), over 50 fungal genome sequences have been released, with more than 20 additional sequencing projects currently underway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Park <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). This wealth of genome sequence data accelerates the progress of studying fungal biology via genome-wide mutagenesis of fungal genes in both random and targeted manners. Although the most efficient way of studying the function of individual genes is to disrupt the gene of interest and detect any resulting phenotypic alterations, genome-wide targeted mutagenesis has been reported only for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Winzeler <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Giaever <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), mainly due to its idiosyncratically high efficacy for homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Baudin <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>).</p><p>An alternative approach is a large-scale, random insertional mutagenesis using <underline>r</underline>estriction <underline>e</underline>nzyme-<underline>m</underline>ediated <underline>i</underline>ntegration (REMI) or transposon-based methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Sanchez <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Sweigard <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hamer <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Villalba <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). However, these mutagenesis techniques have limitations that render them inappropriate for large-scale functional genomic analysis, which include unsolicited deletion and rearrangement of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Mullins <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) and biased insertion patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hamer <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Recently, <italic><underline>A</underline>grobacterium <underline>t</underline>umefaciens</italic>-<underline>m</underline>ediated <underline>t</underline>ransformation (ATMT) has been widely used as a means of large-scale insertional mutagenesis of fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Idnurm <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Walton <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Blaise <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> is a plant-pathogenic bacterium that is capable of transferring part of its plasmid, a region known as the T-DNA, into the genome of host plants. ATMT has been used to produce a large number of insertional mutant plants in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Alonso <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>) and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Jeon <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Sallaud <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), demonstrating its utility as a functional genomics tool. The host range of <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> can be extended to include <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Bundock <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>) and diverse filamentous fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">de Groot <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). With its versatility in transforming various fungal tissues and high efficiency, the number of successful fungal transformations via ATMT has rapidly increased (up to 64 species) in the past 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Michielse <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Lacroix <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The primary goal of large-scale random insertional mutagenesis is to generate mutations in most genes in a genome for functional studies. To evaluate the potential of T-DNA as an insertional mutagen in plants and to understand the mechanisms and characteristics of T-DNA integration, flanking sequences of many T-DNA insertion sites have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Alonso <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Schneeberger <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). In plants, T-DNA integration exhibited a strong bias towards the 5&#x02032; upstream regions of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Alonso <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Schneeberger <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Analysis of junction sequences showed that the right border (RB) of T-DNA tends to be more conserved than the left border (LB), presumably resulting from the attachment of VirD2 proteins to RB, and that filler sequences and microhomology exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Forsbach <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). In addition, tandem arrays of multiple T-DNA insertions, deletion of T-DNA target sites, translocation associated with T-DNA insertion, and simultaneous integration of T-DNA with the vector backbone have also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Forsbach <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In fungi, information on the pattern of T-DNA integration has been very limited, with only a few T-DNA insertion sites having been characterized in several species transformed using <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Bundock <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Mullins <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Leclerque <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Analysis of &#x0223c;100 T-DNA transformants of <italic>Leptosphaeria maculans</italic> was conducted to elucidate T-DNA integration patterns in this filamentous fungus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Blaise <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Although this analysis included the largest number of transformants characterized to date, its scope was still limited and insufficient for a comprehensive understanding of T-DNA integration patterns in filamentous fungi. Here we describe the analysis of T-DNA insertion sites in 1246 transformants of <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, and the parallel development of a web-accessible informatics system, termed the <underline>T</underline>-DNA <underline>a</underline>nalysis <underline>p</underline>latform (TAP), that serves as an electronic warehouse and an analysis pipeline for T-DNA integration data. <italic>M. oryzae</italic> causes rice blast disease and is an important model organism for investigating fungal infection-related development and pathogenicity because of its genetic tractability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Talbot, 2003</xref>). The genomic sequences of both the fungus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Dean <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Yu <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>) are available, providing a unique opportunity to study a host&#x02013;parasite interaction from both sides using functional genomics approaches.</p><p>Handling and sharing large volumes of T-DNA insertion data in plants require the development of an informatics platform supporting data management and analysis. Several databases like FLAGdb, ATIDB, RiceGE and GABI-KAT have been developed to address such needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">An <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Pan <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Samson <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). However, to our knowledge, a comparable informatics platform for fungi has not been reported. Our systematic analysis of the distribution and patterns of T-DNA integration in the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome through combination of biological data with the TAP will serve as a model system for ATMT-mediated functional genomic analysis of fungi.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Construction of the TAP and characterization of T-DNA-tagged locations</title><p>We recently reported the generation of 21 070 transgenic <italic>M. oryzae</italic> strains using ATMT and provided a comprehensive phenotypic analysis of these transformants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Jeon <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). To gain insight into T-DNA integration patterns in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, we analysed chromosomal location and structure of inserted T-DNA in 1246 transformants, including 174 <underline>r</underline>andomly <underline>s</underline>elected <underline>t</underline>ransformants (RSTs) and 1109 transformants exhibiting <underline>p</underline>henotypic <underline>d</underline>efects <underline>t</underline>ransformants (PDTs) in the previous screening (35 of them were coincidentally shared between two groups). From these transformants, <underline>t</underline>hermal <underline>a</underline>symmetry <underline>i</underline>nter<underline>l</underline>aced-PCR (TAIL-PCR) produced 2116 readable sequences, of which 1439 (68.0%) contained both a T-DNA border and fungal genome DNA, and 587 (27.7%) and 90 (4.3%) sequences only contained genomic DNA and T-DNA/vector sequences respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Thus, over 95% (2026 of 2116) of sequences were suitable for determining T-DNA-<underline>t</underline>agged <underline>l</underline>ocations (TTLs) in the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome. The sequences without border were still regarded as genomic sequences existing adjacent to T-DNA's border, because they were rescued by border-specific primers. The remaining 90 sequences with no matches to <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome sequences were excluded from subsequent analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>To effectively archive and analyse data from these TTLs, we developed an informatics platform, termed the TAP, consisting of a data analysis pipeline, a T-DNA database and a user-friendly web interface. The TAP was designed to effectively use the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome sequence data stored in the in-house genome data warehouse, called the <underline>c</underline>omparative <underline>f</underline>ungal <underline>g</underline>enomics <underline>p</underline>latform (CFGP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cfgp.snu.ac.kr">http://cfgp.snu.ac.kr</ext-link>; J. Park <italic>et al</italic>., unpublished) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>), for analysing patterns and genome features associated with T-DNA insertion. The analysis pipeline conducted a two-step analysis for individual sequences rescued from T-DNA insertion sites. In the first step, junction structure and chromosomal position of each T-DNA insertion were determined through <sc>blast</sc> searches against the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome sequence data and the pBHt2 vector, a binary vector used in ATMT. In the second process, any sequences shorter than 26 bp were filtered out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Sessions <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), and multiple insertion positions within a 35 bp window were clustered as one TTL to prevent overestimation of the number of independent TTLs.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Organization of the TAP and the flow chart of sequence data processing. The TAP consists of a data analysis pipeline, a T-DNA database and a user interface. The automated process of analysing rescued sequences (sequences of TAIL-PCR products) via the pipeline is shown in a flow chart. Those sequences are matched to a <sc>blast</sc> search, and then the parser program extracts the following information: chromosome number, type of border, integrated positions and TTLs. The T-DNA database transforms the insertion information to reveal genome-wide distribution patterns. Outputs are shown via a user-friendly web interface.

The GC ratio, CG/AT skew and DNA bendability (see below) around each insertion site were made available for viewing. In addition, statistical data, including chromosomal distribution of TTLs and TTL frequency, were also included in the TAP to illustrate overall features associated with T-DNA insertion in the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome. The data described below were generated in real time using the TAP.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of TTLs in the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome</title><p>Whereas 70 flanking sequences (3.5% of 2026) matched with repetitive sequences such as MsR02/RETRO7, MAGGY and MGLR3/MG-SINE transposons (see <italic>Experimental procedures</italic>), the majority (96.5%) of TTLs corresponded to single-copy regions of the genome. Although in most transformants, a single copy of T-DNA was inserted at one locus (82% in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>), integrations of T-DNA at multiple loci and an insertion of tandem-repeated T-DNAs in one locus were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B and C</xref> respectively, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Identification schemes for T-DNA junction types in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. TAIL-PCR products from transformants with a single T-DNA insertion (A), multiple insertions at different locations (B), or multiple tandem or inverted insertions (C) were sequenced. Resulting sequences were subjected to <sc>blast</sc> searches (black vertical arrow) and analysed for junction type (see <italic>Experimental procedures</italic>). Those that produced a single fragment in TAIL-PCR and matched a T-DNA border (yellow) and a flanking genomic region (grey) without a gap were considered &#x02018;precise junctions&#x02019; (type i) (51). In some cases, multiple fragments were amplified in TAIL-PCR at two different genomic regions (type iii; grey and dark grey). The transformant was regarded as having mixture of &#x02018;precise&#x02019; and &#x02018;imprecise&#x02019; junctions (types i and ii respectively), and treated as two TTLs. The imprecise junction was defined as the sequence matched to both a border and a flank with a gap (type ii) (51). When multiple T-DNA (blue bar with yellow borders) were integrated into the same location with tandem or inverted arrays, multiple flanking regions could appear (C). According to the concentration of co-amplified PCR products, sequencing results were classified as type ii (similar in both dark and light grey products), type iii (more dark grey product), type iv (similar in both grey and blue product), type v (more blue product) or type vi (more grey products). In the <sc>blast</sc> search, different locations or kinds of matching results were shown by the different line levels and colours.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi0066-0371-f2"/></fig><p>For determination of TTLs, we adopted the definitions used for analysing T-DNA integration patterns in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Mayerhofer <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>), in which each junction between the T-DNA border and genomic DNA was classified as &#x02018;precise&#x02019; or &#x02018;imprecise&#x02019;. In defining &#x02018;imprecise&#x02019; junctions, we included junctions containing a stretch of undeterminable base calls or another genomic region (a gap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B and C</xref>), whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Mayerhofer <italic>et al</italic>. (1991)</xref> included only filler sequences of unknown origin. Junctions exhibiting a T-DNA border immediately joined to a single region of the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genomic DNA were designated as &#x02018;precise&#x02019;, and their TTLs were assigned at the beginning of flanking genomic sequences. In the case of &#x02018;imprecise&#x02019; junctions, corresponding TTLs were determined as the point next to the border end. Of 1439 sequences, 845 and 594 were determined to be precise and imprecise junctions respectively; in total, they corresponded to 764 independent TTLs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Sequences composed only of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genomic DNA sequences were also included in TTL determination, with the starting position of a sequence being defined as the insertion site. The 587 genomic DNA-only sequences led to 346 independent TTLs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). A total of 1110 TTLs were identified from the 2026 sequences derived from 1246 transformants.</p></sec><sec><title>Genome-wide features associated with TTL distribution</title><p>We analysed the distributions of 1110 TTLs on chromosomes, and in genic and intergenic regions, based on the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome in the CFGP. Because most of the TTLs were derived from phenotype-defective transformants, we first tested overall randomness in the RST and PDT groups. The distribution patterns of TTL frequency between two groups displayed a clear correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.303, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; <italic>0.05</italic> in Pearson method), but neither correlated with a purely random model generated through Monte Carlo simulation (data not shown). In addition, two groups exhibited almost identical distribution patterns on chromosomes and in genetic elements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Tables S3 and S4</xref>). Thus, all TTLs were pooled and subsequently analysed as one group.</p><p>To confirm whether T-DNAs were evenly distributed, 10 000 simulations using Monte Carlo methods were performed based on a purely random model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). The distribution of simulated samples (green dots) showed no significant correlation to that of observed TTLs (blue bars), indicating that the TTL distribution in this organism did not follow the purely random model (<italic>r</italic> = 0.154, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; <italic>0.05</italic>). When analysed at the chromosomal level, 44% of the total TTLs were observed on chromosomes 1 and 2 (one in every 30 kb), which was higher compared with other chromosomes, and exceeded the expected numbers by more than 20% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, chromosomes 4, 5 and 7 contained less than 80% of the expected T-DNA insertions (one insertion in every 50 kb; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

More TTLs were observed in the genic region than in the intergenic region of the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome (799 and 311 respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). As supported by the chi-squared test (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), the observed numbers represented 94% and 120% of the expected numbers, suggesting that T-DNA integration seemed to be slightly biased towards the intergenic region in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. Within the genic region, a higher frequency of T-DNA insertions was observed in the promoter region (defined as 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional starting point; 415 of 799) than the coding or 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (UTRs, defined as 500 bp downstream of end codon; 256 and 128 respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The observed number of TTLs in the promoter region was twofold higher than the expected number of TTLs, suggesting a strong bias towards T-DNA insertions in this region. Among the 256 TTLs in coding sequences (CDS), 196 (77%) and 60 (23%) were found in the exon and intron regions respectively; the observed frequencies were negatively correlated with the expected value (43% and 76% respectively). To further investigate the nature of bias in the genic region, TTL frequencies around the start and the end of CDS were examined (blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>). At the start of CDS, more TTLs were found in the promoter region (average 25.7) than in the CDS region (average 11.3). A similar tendency of TTL distribution was found around the end of CDS (12.7 in 3&#x02032; UTR and 10.4 in CDS on average of 500 bp region). To determine whether this TTL pattern exhibited any relationship with base composition, the GC ratio was analysed. The GC ratio (red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>) was plotted over the TTL frequencies, which showed dramatic changes at the start and end of CDS. Near the CDS start, the GC ratio increased sharply from 47% to 56% within 100 bp, and the number of TTLs decreased from 23 to 15. Near the CDS end, the overall tendency was also negatively correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A</xref>). In summary, a high GC ratio appeared to be negatively correlated with T-DNA integration, suggesting that T-DNA preferred AT-rich regions.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of T-DNA-tagged locations around genes.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="100%"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type of region</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Length (kb)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. of observed TTLs</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. of expected TTLs<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf2-1">a</xref></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Density (no. per Mb)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Value of &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf2-2">b</xref></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>P</italic>-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Genic</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 954</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;799</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;852</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.0</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.31</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.07</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Coding region</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19 888</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;256</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;530</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.9</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">141.93</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.00<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf2-3">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exon</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 937</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;196</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;451</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.6</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">144.72</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.00<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf2-3">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intron</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 951</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;&#x02002;60</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;&#x02002;79</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.3</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.44</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.04<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf2-3">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5&#x02032; promoter (&#x0003c; 1 kb)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 613</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;415</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;176</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.8</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">322.95</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.00<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf2-3">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3&#x02032; UTR (&#x0003c; 0.5 kb)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 453</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;128</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;146</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.5</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.05</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.15</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intergenic</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 667</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;311</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02002;258</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.2</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.98</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.00<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf2-3">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41 624</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1110</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1110</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf2-1"><label>a</label><p>Expected numbers were calculated according to the chromosome length.</p></fn><fn id="tf2-2"><label>b</label><p>Chi-squared test is based on the difference between observed and expected values.

This dataset was compared with a control set that consisted of the same amount of sequence data from random positions which have been generated using the Monte Carlo method with 10 repeats. The GC ratios were first profiled for these two datasets using a 50 bp window with 5 bp intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>). Overall, the GC ratio (red line) was lower than that of the control dataset (average 51.5%, green line), again supporting the positive correlation between T-DNA insertion and AT-rich regions. Another feature was that a relatively high GC ratio was observed in the vicinity of TTLs (&#x000b1; 50 bp from the insertion position), compared with the remaining areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4B</xref>). This suggested that the vicinity of T-DNA insertion sites differed from the other regions in terms of the base composition. Second, the DNA bending property, or bendability, was analysed for these sequence datasets, because recent reports suggested a relationship between bendability and T-DNA insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Schneeberger <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).

One of them is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4C</xref>. Regions proximal to TTLs (average bendability = 15.9) were more bendable than distant regions (15.6, where smaller values indicate less bending).

A pair of flanking primers (arrow; a and b) amplified a 2.5 kb band in the transformant (lane 2), compared with wild-type (lane 1). B. Multiple T-DNA integration at one site. Southern blot analysis confirmed the insertion of three T-DNAs in one location (ATMT0060C3), based on two restriction enzymes that cut inside (lane H) or outside (lane A) the T-DNA. A pair of flanking primers (c and d) amplified a 4.0 kb band in wild-type (lane 1) but no band in the transformant (lane 2). Additionally, the combination of border and flanking primers (c-rb and d-rb) proved that both sides of the repeated T-DNAs ended with RB (lanes 3 and 4). C. Chromosomal rearrangement. The translocation between chromosomes 1 and 3 occurred in transformant ATMT0879C6 as a result of T-DNA integration (red hexagon). This rearrangement was confirmed by PCR amplification using mixed combination of deduced primers specific for flanking areas (lanes 1 and 2, 1f/1r; lanes 3 and 4, 3f/3r; lanes 5 and 6, 1f/3r; lanes 7 and 8, 3f/1r).

A primer combination of rb-c and rb-d (lanes 3 and 4) confirmed the T-DNA insertion, whereas the corresponding band appeared in the wild-type, not in the transformant because the repeated T-DNA was too large to be amplified (lane 1 and 2). Readthrough samples were found in two transformants. Transformant ATMT0144A2 had a binary vector backbone sequence adjacent to the RB cleavage site accompanied by repeated T-DNAs.

The primer sets (1f/1r and 3f/3r) amplified bands from the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6C</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;4), which were absent in the transformant, whereas the exchanged sets (1f/3r and 3f/1r) amplified bands only in the transformant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6C</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;8).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In combination with rapidly increasing fungal genome sequence data, ATMT has been proposed as a powerful tool for fungal functional genomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Michielse <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Lacroix <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The recent application of ATMT in a large-scale mutant hunt in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> supported this proposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Jeon <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Despite its potential, only limited information is currently available on the patterns and mechanisms of T-DNA integration in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Bundock <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Bundock <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). A comprehensive informatics platform for archiving and analysing the anticipated flood of T-DNA-tagged sequences is needed to maximize the utility of ATMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Walton <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Blaise <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). In this study, using <italic>M. oryzae</italic> as a model fungal host for ATMT, we comprehensively analysed 2116 sequences associated with T-DNA insertion sites via a novel informatics platform called the TAP, which can also be utilized to handle T-DNA flanking sequences from other organisms.</p><p>TAIL-PCR was used to rescue genomic sequences flanking T-DNA insertion sites because of its convenience in high-throughput processing of a large number of transformants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Singer and Burke, 2003</xref>). Among 2116 readable sequences, 2026 (96%) matched genomic regions of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). The success rate in isolating T-DNA flanks from <italic>M. oryzae</italic> was higher than those reported in plants, which ranged from 60% to 80% in large-scale experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Sallaud <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Presumably, this was a result of the relatively simple T-DNA integration pattern in this fungus compared with plants.</p><p>Although T-DNA integration was initially thought to be random, its randomness has been controversial with recent data indicating non-randomness of T-DNA insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Tinland, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Michielse <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Early studies based on small number of samples indicated random distributions of T-DNA insertions throughout target genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Thomas <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">AzpirozLeehan and Feldmann, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Barakat <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Bundock <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). However, more recent large-scale studies based on over 1000 sequences have indicated that T-DNA insertions are not truly random relative to genetic elements and sequence compositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Sessions <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Our genome-wide analysis using 1110 TTLs also indicated certain biases in both genic distribution and sequence composition. T-DNA insertions were biased towards promoters and against gene-coding regions. In addition, overall GC ratios around the insertion sites were lower than simulated control values. Such T-DNA preference was thought to be related to the base composition of insertion sites, because eukaryotic promoters and gene-coding regions are relatively well conserved as AT and GC-rich regions respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Hurst <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). In rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, T-DNA insertions were favoured in promoter, 3&#x02032; UTRs and intergenic regions, all of which are relatively AT-rich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Alonso <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Sallaud <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Pan <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Thus, this distinct bias towards promoters or AT-rich regions may not be specific to certain organisms, but may be a conserved feature in the T-DNA integration mechanism.</p><p>As noted in previous studies of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Schneeberger <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), the prominent peak in predicted bendability around T-DNA insertion sites in our study supports the reasoning that regions with higher flexibility are preferred targets for T-DNA integration. As a physical property, bendability plays important roles in interactions between DNA sequences and DNA binding proteins, such as nucleosome and DNase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Satchwell <italic>et al</italic>., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Brukner <italic>et al</italic>., 1995a</xref>). Previous reports suggested that highly bendable regions promote open chromatin structure and active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Widlund <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Vinogradov, 2003</xref>). Although it is unclear whether T-DNA integrates directly to open chromatin, findings to date suggest that DNA bendability is one of the factors contributing to T-DNA preference for the promoter regions, where RNA polymerase has been known to interact actively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Dlakic <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In a few cases, as consequences of T-DNA integration, various genetic abnormalities, such as tandem or inverted repeats of T-DNA, readthroughs and chromosomal rearrangements, were observed in the genome of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. Prevalent occurrence of truncation and microhomology at LBs and frequent deletions of host genome sequences around insertion sites were also consistent with findings in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Forsbach <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). However, overall frequencies and extents of such genetic changes were lower in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> than in plants. For example, intactness of over 96% of the inserted RBs following integration was in great contrast to what was observed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice (19&#x02013;57% intactness) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Brunaud <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Forsbach <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Compared with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the majority of deletions of host DNA in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> occurred at much smaller scales (11&#x02013;100 bp versus 1&#x02013;35 bp), and the rate of exact joining between the T-DNA border and host DNA was five times higher (14% versus 2.7%). The well-conserved RBs and the highly asymmetric frequency of microhomology between borders in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> support the current hypothesis on the mechanism of T-DNA integration, in which the VirD2 protein protects the RB from degradation by binding to this end of T-DNA, and integration occurs through illegitimate (non-homologous) recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Mayerhofer <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Tinland, 1996</xref>). Our results suggest that <italic>M. oryzae</italic> is an excellent model for studying the molecular mechanisms underpinning T-DNA integration.</p><p>The generation of a tremendous number of sequences from T-DNA-tagged sites in plants necessitates the construction of databases to store resulting data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">An <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Pan <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Samson <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The anticipated increase in T-DNA-tagged sequences from fungi now demands a similar informatics platform. The TAP serves as a depository for the enormous number of sequences generated in this study. In addition, it carries out automatic analyses of deposited sequences to provide multiple contexts associated with T-DNA insertion sites, such as genome-wide distribution of TTLs with density views, base composition and bendability around insertion sites. The data analysis functions provided by the TAP make it unique compared with previous ATMT databases for plants. Furthermore, the TAP was designed to store and handle multiple datasets from any genome sequence; thus, it is capable of providing comparative insight into T-DNA integration for any organism.</p><p>Overall, our data suggest that non-random and promoter-favourable T-DNA integration can be significantly affected by AT-rich base composition and DNA bending properties. Simpler integration patterns and structures make this fungus a better model to understand the mechanisms of T-DNA integration. Our informatics platform can be extended to other fungal systems, allowing comprehensive insight into T-DNA integration mechanisms in fungi and plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Fungal transformants and media</title><p>T-DNA-tagged transformants generated via ATMT were obtained from the Center for Fungal Genetic Resources (Seoul National University, Korea; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genebank.snu.ac.kr">http://genebank.snu.ac.kr</ext-link>).

For high-throughput amplification, TAIL-PCR was performed for individual isolates in the 96-well plate, and AD primer pools, such as ADM1 (AD1 : AD2 : AD3 = 4:3:3) or ADM2 (AD1 : AD4 : AD6 = 3:4:4), were used to increase the efficiency of rescuing sequences flanking inserted T-DNAs.
