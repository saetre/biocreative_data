Bub2 and its binding partner Bfa1 act as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) to negatively regulate the MEN GTPase Tem1. The Bub2/Bfa1 checkpoint pathway is required to delay the cell cycle in response to mispositioned spindles. In addition to its role in mitotic exit, Tem1 is required for actomyosin ring contraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To test the hypothesis that the Bub2 pathway prevents premature actin ring assembly, we compared the timing of actin ring formation in wild type, <italic>bub2&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>mad2&#x00394;</italic>, and <italic>bub2&#x00394;mad2&#x00394; </italic>cells both with and without microtubules. There was no difference in the timing of actin ring formation between wild type and mutant cells in a synchronized cell cycle. In the presence of nocodazole, both <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>mad2&#x00394; </italic>cells formed rings after a delay of the same duration. Double mutant <italic>bub2&#x00394;mad2&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>bfa1&#x00394;mad2&#x00394; </italic>cells formed rings at the same time with and without nocodazole. To determine if Bub2 has an effect on actomyosin ring contraction through its regulation of Tem1, we used live cell imaging of Myo1-GFP in a <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>strain. We found a significant decrease in the total time of contraction and an increase in rate of contraction compared to wild type cells. We also examined myosin contraction using Myo1-GFP in cells overexpressing an epitope tagged Bub2. Surprisingly, overexpression of Bub2 also led to a significant increase in the rate of contraction, as well as morphological defects. The chained cell phenotype caused by Bub2 overexpression could be rescued by co-overexpression of Tem1, and was not rescued by deletion of <italic>BFA1</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data indicate that the Bub2 checkpoint pathway does not have a specific role in delaying actin ring formation. The observed increase in the rate of myosin contraction in the <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>strain provides evidence that the MEN regulates actomyosin ring contraction. Our data suggest that the overexpression of the Bub2 fusion protein acts as a dominant negative, leading to septation defects by a mechanism that is Tem1-dependent.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The coordination of multiple events during M phase is essential for accurate chromosome segregation. Mitotic checkpoints ensure that chromosomes and the spindle are correctly aligned, and mitotic kinase activity prevents cytokinesis from occurring before mitosis is completed. Budding yeast is an excellent model system to study the complex regulation that couples mitotic exit with the onset of actomyosin ring contraction to complete cell division.</p><p>The mitotic checkpoint in budding yeast has two separate pathways, one for sensing kinetochore attachment to microtubules, and another for sensing spindle position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The first pathway requires a number of known genes, including <italic>MAD2</italic>, and acts to prevent the metaphase to anaphase transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The second pathway relies on the Bub2/Bfa1 complex to inhibit mitotic exit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Both pathways must be intact for complete arrest of the cell cycle in mitosis in response to microtubule depolymerization, as deletion of genes in a single pathway results in a cell cycle delay after which cells exit mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The spindle orientation pathway inhibits exit from mitosis through negative regulation of the mitotic exit network (MEN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Tem1, a small GTPase at the top of the pathway, is activated by its GEF Lte1, and inactivated by the two part GAP Bub2/Bfa1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The MEN regulates both mitotic exit and the onset of cytokinesis and septation. MEN activation leads to mitotic cyclin degradation, and the inactivation of mitotic kinase activity is required for cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, some MEN proteins localize to the bud neck at the time of cytokinesis, and Tem1 has been shown to be required for myosin contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Examination of actin ring formation in <italic>apc2&#x02013;8 </italic>mutants with and without a <italic>BUB2 </italic>deletion led to the hypothesis that the Bub2 pathway acts to prevent premature actin ring formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This model predicts that <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>cells will form actin rings earlier than <italic>BUB2 </italic>cells under conditions where the Bub2 checkpoint pathway is normally activated. It has also been proposed that Bub2 acts every cell cycle to restrain Tem1 activity until the end of mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], in which case even unperturbed cells lacking Bub2 may show premature actin ring formation. Here, we test these hypotheses by examining actin ring formation in synchronized cells with and without nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules and cause checkpoint activation. We found no evidence that the Bub2 checkpoint pathway acts to prevent premature actin ring formation, but we did see an effect on myosin contraction in <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>cells, as well as a septation defect in cells overexpressing a dominant negative Bub2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The Bub2 checkpoint pathway does not regulate actin ring formation</title><p>Previous studies showed that deletion of <italic>BUB2 </italic>led to MEN dependent actin ring formation in an <italic>apc2&#x02013;8 </italic>mutant at the non-permissive temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This led to the hypothesis that the Bub2 branch of the spindle assembly checkpoint specifically prevents premature actin ring formation. To test this idea, we looked at the timing of actin ring assembly in synchronized cells. Wild-type, <italic>bub2&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>mad2&#x00394;</italic>, and <italic>bub2&#x00394;mad2&#x00394; </italic>cells were arrested in G1 using &#x003b1;-mating factor. After release from the arrest, cells were fixed at 10-minute intervals as they progressed through the cell cycle and stained for actin filaments. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, actin ring formation peaked 80 minutes after release from G1 arrest in all strains. Therefore, deletion of <italic>BUB2 </italic>did not noticeably affect the timing of actin ring formation in a normal cell cycle.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The Bub2 checkpoint pathway does not regulate actin ring formation</bold>.

Cells were stained for actin with Alexa 586 phalloidin and &#x02265; 300 cells were examined microscopically at each time point to calculate the percentage of cells with an actin ring. Reproducible results were obtained in three independent experiments, and representative results from a single experiment are shown. C. and D. Actin ring formation in nocodazole.

As before, wild-type, <italic>bub2&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>mad2&#x00394;</italic>, and <italic>bub2&#x00394;mad2&#x00394; </italic>cells were arrested in G1 using &#x003b1;-mating factor. Cells were released from the arrest into media containing 15 &#x003bc;g/ml nocodazole, fixed at 10-minute intervals, and stained for actin filaments. As expected, wild type cells did not form an actin ring due to cell cycle arrest (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Cells lacking either <italic>BUB2 </italic>or <italic>MAD2 </italic>formed actin rings with the same kinetics, with actin rings peaking at 140 minutes after release from G1 arrest (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The delay in actin ring formation in these strains relative to untreated cells is consistent with the cell cycle delay caused by loss of one of the two spindle damage checkpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Double mutant <italic>bub2&#x00394;mad2&#x00394; </italic>cells had peak actin ring formation at 80 minutes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), the same as unperturbed cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), consistent with the complete loss of mitotic spindle checkpoints in the double mutant.</p><p>Our data show that actin ring formation in the presence of nocodazole occurs at the same time in <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>cells as <italic>mad2&#x00394; </italic>cells. Additionally, <italic>bub2&#x00394;mad2&#x00394; </italic>cells form rings at the same time with or without microtubules. Therefore, Bub2 does not specifically restrain actin ring formation in response to spindle damage.</p></sec><sec><title>Bfa1 does not show a Bub2 independent effect on actin ring formation</title><p>It has been proposed that Bfa1 has Bub2 independent functions, as overexpression of Bfa1 causes mitotic arrest even in the absence of Bub2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, we analyzed actin ring formation in synchronized <italic>bub2&#x00394;bfa1&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>mad2&#x00394;bfa1&#x00394; </italic>cells with and without nocodazole to see if deletion of <italic>BFA1 </italic>had an additional effect. In unperturbed cells, actin ring formation peaked at 80 minutes in wild type controls as well as <italic>bub2&#x00394;bfa1&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>mad2&#x00394;bfa1&#x00394; </italic>cells, the same as in <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>mad2&#x00394; </italic>cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In nocodazole, <italic>bub2&#x00394;bfa1&#x00394; </italic>cells had a peak of actin ring formation at 140 minutes, the same as in <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Nocodazole treated <italic>mad2&#x00394;bfa1&#x00394; </italic>cells had a peak of actin ring formation at 80 minutes, similar to <italic>mad2&#x00394;bub2&#x00394; </italic>cells in nocodazole and untreated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Therefore, we found no evidence for Bfa1 having a Bub2 independent effect on actin ring formation.</p></sec><sec><title>The rate of myosin contraction is affected by Bub2</title><p>Previous studies have suggested that the MEN regulates actomyosin ring contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. To test this hypothesis, we examined myosin contraction using Myo1-GFP in <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>cells and compared myosin dynamics in <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>cells to wild type and <italic>mad2&#x00394;</italic>. Cells expressing Myo1-GFP were filmed at one-minute intervals on agarose pads and analyzed as described in Methods. Cells had a band of Myo1-GFP fluorescence across the bud neck that began to decrease in size at the onset of cytokinesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The total time of contraction was measured from the time when the Myo1-GFP band began to decrease in size until Myo1-GFP was no longer visible at the bud neck (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). For wild type cells, the time of contraction was an average of 8.1 min (+/- 0.9), consistent with previously published results (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Deletion of <italic>BUB2 </italic>resulted in a more rapid contraction, 5.9 min (+/- 1.3), (P &#x0003c; .005, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). In contrast, deletion of <italic>MAD2 </italic>resulted in a slightly slower average time of Myo1-GFP contraction, 10.1 min (+/- 3.5), although this difference was not significantly different from wild type (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). We also calculated the average rate of contraction by measuring the width of the bud neck and dividing by the time of contraction. Deletion of <italic>BUB2 </italic>resulted in a significantly increased rate, 0.23 &#x003bc;m/min, compared to 0.16 &#x003bc;m/min in wild type cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The rapid contraction of the Myo1-GFP ring in <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>cells prevented the observation of a clear "dot" of myosin signal normally seen at the bud neck at the end of cytokinesis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Analysis of fluorescence intensity profiles indicated that the Myo1-GFP signal ingressed equally from both sides without a loss of intensity. Overall, this data shows that the Bub2 checkpoint pathway has an effect on the timing of actomyosin ring contraction, while the Mad2 branch of the pathway does not.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Deletion and overexpression of Bub2 increase the rate of myosin contraction.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Strain</td><td align="center">Average size bud neck in &#x003bc;m +/- stdev</td><td align="center">Average time of contraction in min +/- stdev</td><td align="center">P value</td><td align="center">Average rate of contraction &#x003bc;m/min +/- stdev</td><td align="center">P value</td><td align="center">N</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">wild type KSY70</td><td align="center">1.3 +/- 0.2</td><td align="center">8.1 +/- 0.9</td><td></td><td align="center">0.16 +/- .04</td><td></td><td align="center">7</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">bub2&#x00394;<break/>KSY71</td><td align="center">1.3 +/- 0.2</td><td align="center">5.9 +/- 1.3</td><td align="center">0.004</td><td align="center">0.23 +/- .05</td><td align="center">0.01</td><td align="center">7</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">mad2&#x00394;<break/>KSY73</td><td align="center">1.3 +/- .06</td><td align="center">10.1 +/- 3.5</td><td align="center">0.3</td><td align="center">0.14 +/- .08</td><td align="center">0.5</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Bub2 OE<break/>KSY132</td><td align="center">1.3 +/- .09</td><td align="center">6.3 +/- 0.5</td><td align="center">0.001</td><td align="center">0.21 +/- .02</td><td align="center">0.03</td><td align="center">7</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Deletion of Bub2 decreases the time of myosin contraction</bold>.

In a wild type background, cells with the <italic>GAL1</italic>-T7-Bub2-6His construct grown on YPD had a very low incidence of the chain phenotype, defined as three or more cell bodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

In support of the idea that <italic>GAL1</italic>-T7-Bub2-6His acts in a dominant negative fashion, the effect of overexpression was similar in a bub2&#x00394; strain, with 55.5% of bub2&#x00394; cells exhibiting a chain phenotype before zymolase, and 43% after zymolase treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). If the epitope-tagged Bub2 were acting the same as endogenous Bub2, one would expect the phenotype to be relieved, rather than exacerbated, by deletion of <italic>BUB2</italic>. This data also shows that deletion of <italic>BUB2 </italic>does not cause a cytokinesis or septation defect, as wild type cells and <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>cells had similar numbers of chained cells on YPD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Unlike the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], we did not find that deletion of <italic>BFA1 </italic>rescued the chain phenotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The morphological defects were rescued by co-overexpression of Tem1, which reduced the percentage of chained cells in YPGR to similar levels as in YPD (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Together, our data shows that overexpression of a T7-Bub2-6His fusion protein acts as a dominant negative, causing a chained cell phenotype that can be rescued by Tem1 overexpression. The results of the zymolase assay suggest that overexpression of Bub2 caused both a cytokinesis and a septation defect.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Bub2 overexpression causes cytokinesis and septation defects that are rescued by co-overexpression of Tem1</bold>. Cells were grown overnight (15 hours) in YPD or YPGR, then fixed.

The plasma membrane was visualized using FM 4&#x02013;64, and the cell wall was stained using Calcofluor. Examination of chains with three of four cell bodies, formed after eight hours of Bub2 overexpression, showed that chains typically had plasma membrane across some bud necks, but not others (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In contrast, these chains showed a complete lack of cell wall formation at all bud necks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). This result was surprising, since the zymolase assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) suggested greater defects in cytokinesis than septation. Therefore, we repeated the analysis after fifteen hours in YPGR. Most bud necks showed plasma membrane formation between cell bodies, although in some cases the plasma membrane had abnormal bright dots or clumps at the bud neck (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Only the buds at the end of the chains did not have plasma membrane, consistent with being the most recently formed buds. Cell wall formation looked very different after the longer Bub2 induction, with most bud necks now showing septum formation, although in many cases the septa seemed thicker and brighter than normal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). These results suggest that overexpression of the dominant negative Bub2 causes primary septum formation to fail, but over time cells may be able to separate by forming an abnormal secondary septum (see Discussion).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Bub2 overexpression causes a defect in cell wall formation</bold>.

However, how the MEN controls cytokinesis is not understood. Experimental evidence that actin rings form in <italic>apc2&#x02013;8 bub2&#x00394; </italic>cells suggested that the Bub2 checkpoint pathway prevents premature actin ring formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with data showing that Tem1, the target of Bub2 regulation, is not required for actin ring formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Our examination of actin ring formation in <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>bfa1&#x00394; </italic>strains shows that actin ring formation occurs with normal kinetics in the absence of the Bub2 checkpoint. Although it is possible that Bub2 or Bfa1 has a subtle effect on actin ring formation that was missed by the 10 minute intervals used to examine the cells, this seems unlikely, as our data is consistent with previous results showing that <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>does not advance anaphase onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Bub2 and Mad2 are required for two separate branches of the mitotic spindle checkpoint in budding yeast. Our data show that cells lacking either one of these checkpoint pathways form actin rings with the same kinetics after nocodazole treatment. Therefore, the delay in actin ring formation in <italic>bud2&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>mad2&#x00394; </italic>cells is caused by a cell cycle delay. The actin rings seen in <italic>apc2&#x02013;8 bub2&#x00394; </italic>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] are likely due to loss of cell cycle arrest and subsequent downstream events such as actin ring formation. In fact, the authors noted that <italic>apc2&#x02013;8 </italic>cells remained arrested in mitosis, while <italic>apc2&#x02013;8 bub2&#x00394; </italic>cells exited mitosis after two hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, progression through late anaphase, when MEN mutants arrest, is required for actin ring formation, but there is no evidence that the MEN regulates actin ring formation directly.</p><p>Our data also do not support a Bub2 independent function of Bfa1 in actin ring formation. There was no apparent difference in the timing of actin ring formation in unperturbed or nocodazole treated cells in isogenic strains with and without a <italic>BFA1 </italic>deletion.</p></sec><sec><title>The MEN and actomyosin ring contraction</title><p>One way the MEN may act to regulate cytokinesis is to trigger the onset of myosin contraction. Our data show that deletion of <italic>BUB2 </italic>or overexpression of a dominant negative Bub2 decreases the total time for contraction of the myosin ring and increases the rate of contraction. This effect on myosin contraction could either be due to direct regulation of contraction by the MEN or an indirect effect caused by defects in primary septum formation. Previous studies have shown that preventing primary septum synthesis results in a cytokinesis failure due to premature breaking and disassembly of the actomyosin ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>We do not think our results are due to indirect effects of septation defects for two reasons. Firstly, we did not see any evidence of abnormal or asymmetrical contraction in <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>or <italic>GAL1</italic>-T7-Bub2-6His cells, which would be predicted by this model. Secondly, <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>cells showed no evidence of a defect in primary septum formation, yet still exhibited the myosin contraction phenotype. Our results suggest that MEN activation directly influences either the onset or the rate of myosin contraction, and that the Bub2 checkpoint pathway acts as a brake on actomyosin ring contraction. This model is also supported by previous results showing that Tem1 and Mob1 are required for actomyosin ring contraction when the requirement for MEN function in mitotic exit is bypassed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The MEN therefore has a role in promoting cytokinesis that is separate from its role in mitotic kinase inactivation. In contrast, the role of the MEN in promoting primary septum formation depends only on exit from mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The identification of MEN targets involved in the regulation of actomyosin ring contraction will be of great interest. Potential targets include Iqg1, which has been shown to interact with Tem1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and Hof1, which is phosphorylated in a MEN-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Dominant negative effects of Bub2 overexpression</title><p>The <italic>GAL1</italic>-T7-Bub2-6His construct used in this study has been previously described as partially inhibiting cell growth only in the presence of Bfa1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It was also reported to cause a chained cell phenotype, although this data was not shown. We have confirmed that this construct causes a mild growth defect as well as a chain phenotype on galactose-containing media in our strain background. However, we did not find that deletion of <italic>BFA1 </italic>rescued either the growth defect or the chain morphology caused by overexpression of the Bub2 fusion protein. We have further examined the chained cell phenotype, and found evidence for the presence of both cytokinesis and septation defects.</p><p>We obtained this construct in the hopes that overexpressing Bub2 would decrease the rate of myosin contraction, since deletion of Bub2 increased the rate. However, we found similar rates of Myo1-GFP contraction in cells expressing T7-Bub2-6His and <italic>bub2&#x00394; </italic>cells. This is most likely due to the T7-Bub2-6His acting as a dominant negative that interferes with normal Tem1 function. Supporting this conclusion, overexpression of an untagged Bub2 using the <italic>GAL1 </italic>promoter does not result in a growth defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Interestingly, overexpression of Bfa1 has a different phenotype than overexpression of either untagged or dominant negative Bub2. Bfa1 overexpression arrests cells in mitosis, and this arrest does not require Bub2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Causes of cytokinesis and septation defects</title><p>Interestingly, we did not observe a correlation between increased rates of myosin contraction and cytokinesis or septation defects. Deletion of <italic>BUB2 </italic>or overexpression of Bub2 had a similar effect on Myo1-GFP dynamics, but only Bub2 overexpression resulted in the chained cell phenotype. Therefore, the significantly increased rate of myosin contraction we observed does not have an effect on cell morphology under normal growth conditions.</p><p>How then does overexpression of a dominant negative Bub2 cause morphological defects? Our data suggest that the T7-Bub2-6His must be affecting Tem1 in a way that does not prevent exit from mitosis, but perturbs septum formation. A temperature sensitive mutant of the MEN kinase Cdc15, <italic>cdc15-2</italic>, has been shown to have a septation defect when grown at the semipermissive temperature (31&#x000b0;C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Since binding of Cdc15 to Tem1 is required for Cdc15 activation and prevented by Bub2/Bfa1, the interaction of Cdc15 with Tem1 could be partly inhibited by T7-Bub2-6His overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Zymolase treatment of cells after fifteen hours of Bub2 overexpression resulted in approximately 10% fewer chains than without zymolase, suggesting that some of the chains were due to septation failure, and most of the chains were due to cytokinesis failure. However, staining of plasma membrane and cell wall structures at earlier timepoints showed that lack of septum formation was the primary defect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Staining at later timepoints indicated that many of the bud necks in the chains had become separated by plasma membrane and chitin, some of which appeared abnormal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and may represent the deposition of thick secondary septa that eventually separate the cells, sometimes trapping pockets of membrane within. Electron microscopy has shown that yeast cells that fail cytokinesis due to lack of myosin and those that fail to form the primary septum due to a lack of chitin synthase have identical phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In both cases, the cells form a thick cell wall that lack the normal trilaminar structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It is unclear whether or not zymolase can efficiently digest this abnormally thick septum. Therefore, the zymolase assay may not be able to distinguish failure to contract an actomyosin ring from failure to build a primary septum, since in both cases the cells can eventually separate the plasma membrane by lateral thickening of the cell wall. Additionally, it has been shown that preventing primary septum formation causes instability of the actomyosin ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, the two processes of cytokinesis and septation may be so closely linked in budding yeast that defects in one process result in problems in the other.</p><p>We think it is likely that the formation of chains of cells after overexpression of a dominant negative Bub2 is caused by a failure to form the primary septum, and that these cells eventually form an abnormal septum as seen previously by EM. The contradictory results from the zymolase assay may be due to incomplete digestion of these thick septal structures, failing to separate the chained cell bodies even though they are separated by plasma membrane. Together, our data suggest that the Bub2 pathway, and therefore the MEN, regulates septation or the coordination of septation with actomyosin ring contraction.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Deletion of <italic>BUB2 </italic>did not affect the timing of actin ring assembly, but did increase the rate of myosin contraction.

Cells were washed 3&#x000d7; with sterile water to release from arrest before imaging. Cells were placed on the agarose pad and covered with cover slip sealed with valap (1:1:1 mixture of Vaseline, lanolin, and paraffin). Living cells were viewed using an Olympus IX51 inverted microscope at 1,000&#x000d7; total magnification using a UPLSAPO 100&#x000d7; NA 1.4 objective. FITC (EX 482/35 506DM EM 536/40) filter was used to visualize GFP (Brightline). Images were captured with a Hamamatsu ORCA285 CCD camera. Shutters, filters, and camera were controlled using Slide Book software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). Images were collected with exposure (100 ms to 200 ms) to fluorescent light at 1 minute intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of myosin contraction</title><p>To determine the onset of myosin contraction, the time-lapse series of Myo1-GFP expressing cells was viewed at 200% magnification. Time zero was defined as the timepoint after which the ring decreased in diameter. The ruler tool in Slidebook was used to measure the ring at T = 0 and the following frame to confirm that a change in diameter had occurred. A second blind analysis to determine time zero was performed in order to eliminate observer bias. Total time of contraction was the time elapsed between time zero and when the Myo1-GFP signal disappeared from the bud neck. To determine the rate of contraction, the width of the bud neck was measured using the ruler tool in Slidebook and divided by the total time of contraction. Fluorescence intensity profiles were used to examine symmetry of ring contraction. Excel was used to calculate standard deviation and P-values using the two-tailed T test.</p></sec><sec><title>Morphological Observations</title><p>Cultures of KSY129, 130, 169, and 171 were grown in YPR overnight, then diluted into YPD and YPGR and grown for fifteen hours at 30&#x000b0;C before addition of formaldehyde to 5% final. Fixed cells were treated both with and without zymolyase before observing cells under the microscope for phenotypic changes as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Morphology was observed and cells were counted under Olympus CH2, objective EA40 NA0.65.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot Analysis</title><p>Cultures of KSY129, 130, 169, and 171 were grown in YPR overnight, then diluted into either YPD or YPGR and grown for three hours at 30&#x000b0;C before total yeast extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis in SDS sample buffer. Extracts were run on 4&#x02013;20% Tris-Glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose. T7-Bub2-6His was detected using anti-T7 antibody diluted 1:1000 (Novagen), and myc-Tem1 was detected using anti-myc monoclonal antibody diluted 1:1000 (Covance). Donkey anti-mouse HRP conjugated secondary antibody was diluted 1:2500 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The Pierce chemiluminescence detection kit was used (Thermo Scientific). Comparable amounts of total protein were loaded in each lane as shown by Coomassie staining of the same extracts on a separate gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasma membrane and cell wall staining</title><p>To visualize the plasma membrane, FM4&#x02013;64 (Invitrogen) was added to cells in growth media on ice. For cell wall staining, Calcofluor was used as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Calcofluor (Fluorescent brightener 28, Sigma) was added to cells in growth medium to a final concentration of 100 &#x003bc;g/ml. Cells were incubated 5 minutes, washed twice with H<sub>2</sub>O, and observed with a DAPI filter set.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SYP made strains, produced a majority of the data, and wrote Methods section.
