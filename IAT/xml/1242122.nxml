A vaccine targeting HER2/<italic>neu </italic>could have considerable preventive and therapeutic application by controlling the growth and metastasis of highly aggressive HER2/<italic>neu</italic><sup>+ </sup>tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Gene vaccines, which are bacterial expression plasmids encoding the DNA sequence for tumor antigens, have induced strong antitumor immunity in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although gene vaccines have shown effectiveness in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], only a few trials have been completed in oncology patients, and the results have been mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, it was recently demonstrated that a gene vaccine for prostate-specific antigen broke immunologic tolerance and induced cellular immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Immunotherapy for cancer using gene vaccines is in its infancy, and the development of new approaches and techniques is anticipated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The fields of gene therapy and gene vaccines have recently converged, as shown by the use of identical delivery systems for both purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Alphaviruses such as the Sindbis, Semliki Forest, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses may be used for both gene therapy and gene vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] have shown that plasmids containing Sindbis virus genes induce excellent antitumor immunity in murine tumor models. Adenoviruses, the workhorse of gene replacement therapy, are quickly moving to the forefront as gene vaccine vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Unlike alphaviruses, which contain self-replicating RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], adenoviruses contain DNA as their genetic material. For both families of viruses, essential genes for replication or packaging are deleted or mutated to ensure the safety of the gene therapy or gene vaccine vector.</p><p>Although animal models of tumor growth are limited in their ability to represent clinical cancer, models can provide valuable information about drug candidates. We have used both preventive and therapeutic murine tumor models to evaluate the effectiveness of two gene vaccines. Our results demonstrated that each gene vaccine was effective in prevention models, but neither was effective when used in a therapeutic model. However, prime&#x02013;boost vaccination with SINCP-<italic>neu </italic>followed by Adeno-<italic>neu </italic>significantly prolonged the overall survival rate when used therapeutically in a murine model of breast cancer metastasis.

The A2L2 cell line has expressed high levels of HER2/<italic>neu </italic>for more than 5 years and consistently induces tumors in BALB/c mice when injected into a mammary fat pad or intravenously (i.v.). The line was maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, L-glutamine, and vitamins (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The monolayer cultures were subdivided at approximately 75% confluence by treatment for 1 to 3 min with 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>SINCP-<italic>neu </italic>and Adeno-<italic>neu </italic>gene vaccines</title><p>The SINCP plasmid, which contains Sindbis virus genes, was provided by Dr John Polo (Chiron, Emeryville, CA, USA). SINCP is nearly identical to the ELVIS plasmid we previously tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] except for an internal ribosome entry site on the 5' side of the insertion point for an antigen gene. The gene for rat <italic>neu </italic>was excised from pSV2-<italic>neu </italic>and inserted into SINCP by standard recombinant DNA techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

Fluorescein-isothiocyanate-labeled (FITC-labeled) goat antimouse IgG (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) diluted 1:1000 in PBS was added to the cells, and incubation continued for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C. The cells were washed three times in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry using an EPICS Profile Analyzer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL, USA). As a positive control, A2L2 cells were stained with a 1:1000 dilution of a polyclonal rabbit antibody against p185 (sc-284; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and an FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG.</p></sec><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Female BALB/c mice 6 to 8 weeks old were obtained from the National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research Facility (Frederick, MD, USA).

Intramuscular (i.m.) injections of 0.1 ml containing 100 &#x003bc;g of plasmid DNA formulated with 0.25% bupivacaine (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO, USA) were administered to the quadriceps using a 24-gauge needle. Adeno-<italic>neu </italic>and adenovirus lacking an inserted gene (Adeno-empty) were suspended in 100 &#x003bc;l of 0.85% saline and injected into the quadriceps using a 24-gauge needle.

A2L2 cells from cultures that had reached 75% confluence were harvested by treatment with 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA for 1 to 3 min at 37&#x000b0;C. The cells were washed once in serum-containing culture medium and once in PBS. Mice were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane using an apparatus developed by veterinarians at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The fur was shaved over the lateral thorax, and a 5-mm-long incision was made to reveal mammary fat pad number 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. A 0.1-ml sample containing 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>A2L2 cells in normal saline was injected into the fat pad. The incision was closed with a wound clip. After 7 days, wound clips that had not already fallen off were removed. The mice were then observed daily, and their tumors were measured in perpendicular directions using a caliper. Mice with tumors at least 10 mm in the greater dimension were killed according to our approved Institutional Animal Care and Use protocol. At the end of the experiment, all mice were killed by CO<sub>2 </sub>inhalation, and all tumors were excised and weighed. Examination of the surface of the lungs during necropsy did not reveal tumor nodules.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental metastasis prevention model</title><p>Although a solid tumor develops after injection of A2L2 cells into the mammary fat pad, it is not highly metastatic. The tumor induces moribundity in mice before an appreciable number of lung metastases develop. For this reason, we used an experimental lung metastasis model rather than a spontaneous lung metastasis model to assess the effect of vaccination on lung metastasis. A 0.1-ml sample containing 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>A2L2 cells in normal saline was injected into the tail vein of each immunized mouse.

Immune spleens were dissected from vaccinated mice and prepared exactly as previously described for tetramer analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Wells containing only immune spleen cells served as negative controls, and spleen cells from vaccinated mice cultured with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml concanavalin A (Con A) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) overnight served as a positive control. The finished plates were air-dried overnight at room temperature in the dark and sent to ZellNet Consulting (New York, NY, USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]), where the spots were counted automatically using an ImmunoSpot Series I analyzer (BD Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). If confluence (overlapping spots) was present in wells, the number of spots in a non-confluent area of that well was determined, and the following equation was used to estimate the total number of spots in each well with confluence: total spot number = spot count+2(spot count &#x000d7; % confluence/ [100% &#x02013; %confluence]).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Student's <italic>t </italic>test was performed using Prism 4.0 GraphPad software (San Diego, CA, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Inhibition of solid tumor growth by vaccination with SINCP-<italic>neu </italic>and Adeno-<italic>neu</italic></title><p>To determine the effectiveness of vaccination on solid tumor growth, two groups of 13 mice each were vaccinated once i.m. in the quadriceps with 100 &#x003bc;g of SINCP-<italic>neu </italic>or SINCP-&#x003b2;gal. Two weeks later, the mice were challenged with A2L2 cells injected into the mammary fat pad.

SINCP was always the prime and Adeno was always the boost, because numerous studies have reported that the most effective protocol is a plasmid followed by a virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].

In the experimental lung metastasis model, a single vaccination with Adeno-<italic>neu </italic>was effective, and the SINCP-<italic>neu </italic>vaccine was effective when delivered three times at 2-week intervals.</p><p>In our study, serum from mice vaccinated with SINCP-<italic>neu </italic>or Adeno-<italic>neu </italic>contained high levels of IgG that reacted with A2L2 cells, whereas serum from mice vaccinated with SINCP-&#x003b2;gal or Adeno-empty was at background levels. We previously showed that immune serum from gene-vaccinated mice does not react with the parental cell line (66.3) that was transfected with the <italic>neu </italic>gene to create A2L2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The level of immunoflourescence resulting from a single vaccination with Adeno-<italic>neu </italic>was one log greater than that resulting from three vaccinations with SINCP-<italic>neu</italic>. Taken together with the results described in the previous paragraph for the experimental metastasis model, this finding indicates that at these doses and this schedule, Adeno-<italic>neu </italic>is the more immunogenic vaccine. Of course, there is no way to accurately compare a plasmid vaccine with a viral vaccine except in relative terms.</p><p>Although both SINCP-<italic>neu </italic>and Adeno-<italic>neu </italic>produced robust protection in two tumor-prevention models, both gene vaccines were ineffective when used after A2L2 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad or i.v., even when vaccination was begun only 2 days after tumor cell injection and vaccination was repeated three times for SINCP-<italic>neu</italic>. Adeno-<italic>neu </italic>was injected only once in these therapeutic models. Because many publications have described the effectiveness of prime&#x02013;boost vaccination in which the prime is a plasmid gene vaccine and the boost is a viral gene vaccine, and have shown that priming with a plasmid and boosting with a virus is more effective than the opposite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], we tested this strategy in our two therapeutic tumor models.</p><p>In our experimental metastasis model, priming with SINCP-<italic>neu </italic>followed by boosting twice with Adeno-<italic>neu </italic>prolonged the lives of mice compared with prime&#x02013;boost vaccination with SINCP-&#x003b2;gal and Adeno-empty. This effect was seen only in the experimental metastasis model and not in the experimental mammary fat pad model, and no other prime&#x02013;boost combination worked. Although this combination of SINCP-<italic>neu </italic>and Adeno-<italic>neu </italic>was able to increase the survival rate, all mice eventually succumbed to tumor growth and were killed because of moribundity. We also found that prime&#x02013;boost vaccination results in antigen-specific induction of both cellular and humoral immunity. A question that cannot be answered by our findings is the relative role of cellular immunity versus humoral immunity in the <italic>in vitro </italic>antitumor effect.</p><p>With the mandate to move promising laboratory findings to the clinic, it is most important to evaluate the implications of these findings with regard to treatment of patients. A gene vaccine against HER2/<italic>neu </italic>could be effective for patients with a HER2/<italic>neu</italic>-expressing tumor but could not be rationally used to manage a HER2/<italic>neu</italic>-negative tumor. Many types of HER2/<italic>neu</italic>-expressing tumors are noteworthy for their aggressive growth and high metastatic potential [50]. Our data indicate that combined vaccination in a prime&#x02013;boost schedule may be the most likely to produce a clinical effect. However, these vaccines require phase I toxicity testing individually before they could be evaluated in a prime&#x02013;boost protocol. A phase I/II study may yield valuable information regarding increased survival rates and induction of cellular and humoral immunity as measured by <italic>in vitro </italic>assays. Testing of either SINCP-<italic>neu </italic>or Adeno-<italic>neu </italic>in patients will require the production of clinical-grade material, which could be less of a hurdle for a plasmid than for a virus. Nonetheless, our data identify two promising gene vaccines against HER2/<italic>neu</italic>, an antigen associated with aggressive tumor growth and metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrated that in mice, vaccination with a plasmid gene vaccine and an adenovirus gene vaccine, each containing the gene for HER2/<italic>neu</italic>, prevented growth of a HER2/<italic>neu</italic>-expressing breast cancer cell line injected into the mammary fat pad or i.v. The gene vaccines were not effective individually in therapeutic vaccine models in which vaccination took place after tumor cells were injected. However, sequential administration of the vaccines in a prime&#x02013;boost protocol was therapeutically effective when the tumor cells were injected i.v. The vaccines induced high levels of both cellular and humoral immunity as determined by <italic>in vitro </italic>assessment. Clinical evaluation of these vaccines, particularly when used sequentially, is justified.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>Adeno = adenovirus; Con A = concanavalin A; EDTA = ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; ELISPOT = enzyme-linked immunospot; FITC = fluorescein isothiocyanate; i.m. = intramuscular or intramuscularly; i.v. = intravenous or intravenously; IgG = immunoglobulin G; IFN&#x003b3; = interferon &#x003b3; ; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>The authors' contributions to this research are reflected in the order shown.
