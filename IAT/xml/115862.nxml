The expanding &#x003b1;-CA gene family includes 11 enzymatically active members with different structural and catalytic properties. The cellular distribution and physiological functions of the various CA isozymes have been extensively described in several recent reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The most recently characterized isozyme is CA XIV, the mRNA of which has been demonstrated in the brain, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle, heart, and lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. By immunohistochemistry, CA XIV showed a unique distribution in neurons of mammalian brain, and was expressed particularly strongly in neurons involved in motor function and coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These observations made CA XIV a likely candidate for the extracellular CA postulated to have an important role in modulating excitatory synaptic transmission in brain.</p><p>In a more recent study, CA XIV was demonstrated in renal tubule cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Immunofluorescence staining showed strong signal for CA XIV in the apical plasma membrane of the S1 and S2 segments of proximal tubules. The staining was weaker in the basolateral membrane of these tubules. In addition, strong staining was seen in the initial portion of the thin descending limb of Henle. The results suggested that CA XIV probably accounts for a substantial fraction of the bicarbonate reabsorption in the kidney.</p><p>The present study was designed to examine the cellular localization of CA XIV in the liver which has previously shown CA XIV mRNA expression in northern blots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. By histochemical staining, hepatocytes have exhibited plasma membrane-associated CA activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Moderate membrane-associated staining was reported in the hepatocytes surrounding the portal spaces, and the staining weakened towards the central vein. Prior to discovery of additional membrane-associated CAs, the CA activity in hepatocytes was assumed to be due to CA IV. However, recent immunohistochemical data failed to support this assignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The present results demonstrate the expression of CA XIV at the hepatocyte plasma membrane, suggesting a key role for this isozyme in the regulation of ion and pH homeostasis in parenchymal cells of the liver.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>The rabbit anti-mouse CA XIV antiserum to the secretory form of mouse CA XIV was raised in rabbits as described recently by Parkkila et al.

Protein standards for SDS-PAGE were from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Richmond, CA). The electrophoreses were performed in a Novex XCell SureLock electrophoresis unit (Invitrogen Corp/NOVEX, Carlsbad, CA) using a Novex NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris gels. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically from the gel to a nylon membrane (Millipore; Bedford, MA) in a Novex Blot Module. After the transblotting the membrane was first incubated with TBST buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) containing 10% cow colostral whey (BioTop, Oulu, Finland) for 25 min at 4&#x000b0;C, and then with anti-mouse CA XIV serum or anti-rat CA II serum diluted 1:2000 in TBST buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The sheets were washed four times for 5 min with TBST buffer and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad Laboratories) diluted 1:3000 in TBST buffer.

Epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa were obtained by using a scraping technique as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The mucosa from a fresh tissue sample was gently scraped using the short edge of a microscope slide. The scrapings were quickly transferred to a microtube and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total cellular RNA was extracted from the cell or tissue samples using TRIzol reagent (Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration and purity of RNA was determined by spectrophotometer at 260 and 280 nm. Reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification were performed using a single-step method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Two primers for amplifying CA XIV were chosen based on the published mouse CA XIV sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; forward 5'-AAGGTGACTTGGATCCTGGCTGCA-3' (nucleotides 290&#x02013;313) and reverse 5'-TTCTGAGCTGCCTCACTCAAGCTG-3' (nucleotides 700&#x02013;723), which generated a 434-bp amplification product. Primers for rat glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate (GAPDH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] were used to monitor the quality of the RNA samples.</p><p>Ten micrograms of total RNA was used as a template for subsequent RT and PCR reactions. Reverse transcription was performed at 42&#x000b0;C for 1 hour followed by denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes. The PCR cycling protocol consisted of 30 cycles of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 1 minute, annealing at 55&#x000b0;C for 1 minute, and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 1 minute, followed by final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes.

The results also demonstrate that the overall signal for CA XIV was quite faint in the liver, suggesting that the enzyme may be sensitive to proteolytic degradation in tissue samples. This would explain why preservation of CA XIV antigen for immunohistochemistry requires much faster tissue processing compared to any other CA isozyme. It is notable, however, that the western blotting reaction was stronger in the liver than in the colon, which was also in line with the immunostaining results.

Two of them are cytosolic, namely CAs II and III. The function of the high activity isozyme, CA II, has been linked to the intracellular hydration of carbon dioxide and alkalization of hepatic bile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Based on the studies with CA III-overexpressing cells and on the expression profile of CA III in alcoholic liver, it has been proposed to participate in free radical scavenging systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Mitochondrial CA VA plays a key role in gluconeogenesis and ureagenesis in the liver, where bicarbonate is required as a substrate to two enzymes, pyruvate carboxylase and carbamyl phosphate synthetase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>In a previous report, we have shown that CA IV, which is anchored to the plasma membrane by glycosyl phosphatidylinositol linkage, is located in the human biliary epithelial cells, but is absent in the human hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Here, we demonstrated that CA IV is expressed in the sinusoid lining cells of the mouse liver, while no staining was seen in the hepatocyte plasma membrane. Based on these observations, we conclude that CA XIV is the membrane-associated CA isozyme identified in the hepatocytes by histochemical studies. One discrepancy still remains in that the present results showed no zonal variation in the staining intensity, whereas Ridderstr&#x000e5;le et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] reported that the histochemical staining decreased towards the central vein. The exact reason for this difference is not known. It should be noted, however, that Ridderstr&#x000e5;le et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] used CA II-deficient mice in the analyses, and the gene defect could potentially change the expression and distribution pattern of other CAs.</p><p>The plasma membrane-associated CA activity in hepatocytes was originally demonstrated by Garcia-Mar&#x000ed;n et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] using a biochemical method and by Ono et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] using a histochemical cobalt precipitation technique. At the same time, information on different ion transport proteins in hepatocyte plasma membrane accumulated that linked the plasma membrane-bound CA activity to ion transport mechanisms. Blitzer and Boyer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] had earlier demonstrated the localization of Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase at the basolateral plasma membrane. Henderson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and Renner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] showed that Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>-exchanger regulates intracellular pH in isolated hepatocytes. Soon after these discoveries, Gleeson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and Benedetti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] demonstrated that a Na<sup>+</sup>-HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> cotransporter and Cl<sup>-</sup>-HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchanger are important regulators of intracellular pH, in addition to the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger. The Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger most probably participates in acid extrusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> cotransporter has been implicated in Na<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reabsorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The Cl<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> exchanger most probably plays a role in recovery from intracellular alkalization by removing HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> from the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. CA XIV, as a membrane-bound isozyme with its active site on the cell exterior, is a good candidate to participate in regulation of pH homeostasis and ion transport between the hepatocytes, bile canaliculi and hepatic sinusoids.</p><p>Although CA IV is not expressed on hepatic plasma membranes, where CA XIV is strongly expressed, CA IV is expressed in the sinusoid lining cells, where CA XIV is weakly expressed. Here both isozymes may participate in ion transport and pH homeostasis across the plasma face of the sinusoidal endothelial cells. CA IV is similarly expressed on the plasma face of pulmonary microcapillaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and cortical capillaries in brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], both areas where CO<sub>2</sub> flux is high.</p><p>It is likely that the membrane-associated CAs in liver appear with differentiation of the hepatocytes. Garcia-Marin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] observed that membrane-bound CA activity correlates with hepatic regeneration following partial hepatectomy. They measured CA activity in both soluble and plasma membrane-enriched fractions obtained from liver homogenate from rats undergoing hepatectomy. They found no changes in CA activity in the soluble fraction. However, the CA activity in plasma membrane was reduced by 55% soon after hepatectomy and returned to near control value at seven days. It would be of interest to determine the relevant contributions of CA XIV and CA IV to this increase in expression during the regenerative process, and whether the regeneration of the differentiated phenotype is dependent upon expression of the CAs. Testing hepatic regenerative capacity should be included in the physiological studies characterizing CA XIV and CA IV deficient mice when suitable knock-out animal models become available.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present paper demonstrates for the first time the expression of CA XIV at the hepatocyte plasma membrane. Its localization on both apical and basolateral membrane domains suggests an important role for this isozyme in the regulation of ion and pH homeostasis in the liver.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors participated in the design of the study.
