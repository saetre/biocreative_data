We show that YadB is a tRNA modifying enzyme that evidently glutamylates the queuosine residue, a modified nucleoside at the wobble position of the tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> QUC anticodon. This conclusion is supported by a variety of biochemical data and by the inability of the enzyme to glutamylate tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> isolated from an <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNA-guanosine transglycosylase minus strain deprived of the capacity to exchange guanosine 34 with queuosine. Structural mimicry between the tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> anticodon stem and the tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> amino acid acceptor stem in prokaryotes encoding YadB proteins indicates that the function of these tRNA modifying enzymes, which we rename glutamyl-Q tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> synthetases, is conserved among prokaryotes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) constitute a family of essential and ubiquitous enzymes which synthesize 20 families of aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) that are used by ribosomes for translation of mRNAs into proteins. These enzymes are modular proteins composed of functional units always containing a catalytic domain that activates amino acids before their transfer to tRNA and additional domains which include, in most cases, an anticodon-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c1">1</xref>). As a consequence of this structural organization, the anticodon-binding domain alone binds the tRNA anticodon whereas the catalytic domain exclusively accommodates the accepting arm of tRNA and ensures aminoacylation exclusively at its 3&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c2">2</xref>).</p><p>The accepted scheme of evolution of aaRSs proposes that the catalytic domains are derived from ancient enzymes that activated the amino acid and could transfer them to an acceptor RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c3">3</xref>). The ability of minihelices derived from modern tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c5">5</xref>), including tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c6">6</xref>), to be aminoacylated supports this scheme. Both molecules co-evolved by fusion of additional modules. A two-domain L-shaped tRNA emerged from the primitive tRNA by addition of the anticodon stem&#x02013;loop, while aaRSs evolved by acquiring additional modules, including the anticodon-binding domain, which enhanced specificity for binding of the cognate full-length tRNA and efficiency of its aminoacylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c7">7</xref>). Despite the strong functional interdependence existing between the catalytic core and the anticodon-binding domain, some aaRSs still display functional reminiscences of the ancestral enzyme, since they can aminoacylate acceptor minihelices. However, depriving a tRNA of its anticodon branch or an aaRS of its anticodon-binding domain has effects ranging from a change in specificity of the reaction to a severe drop in aminoacylation efficiency and, often, its abolition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c8">8</xref>). With regard of these findings, it came as a surprise to see that in sequences emerging from whole genome sequencing projects, a vast number of prokaryotes display open reading frames encoding pieces and even modules of aaRSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c9">9</xref>). Among these truncated aaRSs, six are composed of only the catalytic core of an aaRS. Unexpected functions have been assigned to those which have been studied so far, such as involvement in amino acid metabolism (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c10">10</xref>) or regulation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c11">11</xref>). However, they are all incapable of performing tRNA aminoacylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c12">12</xref>).</p><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> encodes a protein, YadB, sharing 34&#x00025; identity with the catalytic core of glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS) but deprived of the anticodon-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c13">13</xref>). Unexpectedly, this mini-GluRS is able to aminoacylate tRNA. In contrast to the other GluRSs, YadB activates Glu in the absence of tRNA and, more strikingly, does not transfer the activated Glu to tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> but to tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c14">14</xref>). We here provide a body of evidence indicating that this truncated GluRS attaches the activated Glu to the queuine (Q base) in the wobble position of this tRNA. A comparison of the sequences of tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> and tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> and modeling of the YadB&#x02013;tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> complex suggests that aminoacylation by YadB is mediated by a structural mimicry between the tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> anticodon stem and loop and the tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> acceptor helix.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>General</title><p>Thin layer chromatography (TLC) cellulose plates (20 &#x000d7; 20 cm<sup>2</sup>) and TSK HW-65 S were from Merck, hydroxyapatite CHT5 and UNO-Q1 columns from Bio-Rad and DEAE-cellulose DE52 from Whatman. <sc>l</sc>-&#x0005b;<sup>14</sup>C&#x0005d;Asp (207 mCi/mmol), <sc>l</sc>-&#x0005b;<sup>14</sup>C&#x0005d;Glu (238 mCi/mmol), <sc>l</sc>-&#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;Glu (43 Ci/mmol) and &#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham.

The loop 224&#x02013;238, missing in the electron density map of YadB, has been modeled from that of <italic>T.thermophilus</italic> GluRS (1N78). The adenylate analog (GoA) and position of loop 224&#x02013;238 were kept as provided by the rigid body superposition of YadB with GluRS complexed to a Glu-adenylate analog (1N78). The docking of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> into YadB was performed with the Turbo-Frodo program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c20">20</xref>) by manual rigid body rotation/translation; only two exposed sidechain conformations were modified.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>YadB does not aminoacylate the 3&#x02032; accepting end of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup></title><p>We have previously shown that YadB aminoacylates pure <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> as efficiently as AspRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c14">14</xref>). Similar aminoacylation plateaux are obtained when pure tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> is charged by each enzyme (80&#x00025; by AspRS and 75&#x00025; by YadB; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f1">1</xref>A). Surprisingly, aminoacylation with both enzymes results in a plateau of 155&#x00025; of charged tRNA, suggesting that both Asp and Glu acylate tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f1">1</xref>A). The extent of total aminoacylation is independent of whether tRNA is charged first by AspRS or YadB. We confirmed that the two amino acids are attached to tRNA by TLC analysis after extraction of the aa-tRNA followed by hydrolysis of the ester bonds (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f1">1</xref>B). Thus YadB can glutamylate an aspartylated tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> (Asp-tRNA<sup>Asp</sup>) and, conversely, AspRS can aspartylate a glutamylated tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> (Glu-tRNA<sup>Asp</sup>). An immediate interpretation could be that the two OH groups of the terminal adenosine are acylated with Asp and Glu, respectively, similarly to that reported for <italic>T.thermophilus</italic> PheRS able to catalyze the attachment of two Phe residues on the 3&#x02032;-end of tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c21">21</xref>). However, for structural considerations, we felt this interpretation unlikely and favored attachment of the Glu residue on another part of the molecule.</p><p>To verify the latter possibility, we treated unfractionated <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNA with snake venom phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes single-stranded RNAs starting from the 3&#x02032;-OH end and thus removes the CCA end and the discriminator base of the tRNA molecules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f2">2</xref>A and B). As expected, <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> lost its ability to be aspartylated by AspRS, but fully retained its capacity to be glutamylated by YadB. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f2">2</xref>A and B).</p><p>So far, all known aaRSs aminoacylate their cognate tRNA by forming an ester bond between the activated &#x003b1;-COOH group of the amino acid and the 2&#x02032;- or 3&#x02032;-OH group of the ribose <italic>cis</italic>-diol of the tRNA terminal adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c22">22</xref>). Periodate oxidation by opening the ribose ring deprives tRNA of its accepting capacity. However, aminoacylation protects the <italic>cis</italic>-diol of the terminal adenosine against oxidation and thus protects the tRNA against inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c23">23</xref>). Therefore, to test whether glutamylation of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> by YadB proceeds by esterification of a OH group, we oxidized unprotected and protected <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> with periodate and analyzed their remaining accepting capacities. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f2">2</xref>C shows that YadB, like AspRS, is unable to charge periodate oxidized tRNA<sup>Asp</sup>. However, tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> protected by glutamylation with YadB prior to periodate oxidation is still aminoacylated by YadB, but not by AspRS. Likewise, tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> aspartylated by AspRS prior to periodate oxidation retains its aspartylation ability, but is no longer glutamylatable by YadB (not shown).</p><p>Altogether, the obtained data demonstrates that aminoacylation by YadB does not occur at the terminal adenosine of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> and should take place at another place on the tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> molecule. This conclusion is supported by a previous result showing that the mischarged tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> cannot bind the elongation factor EF-Tu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c14">14</xref>), despite the capability of a canonical Glu-tRNA<sup>Asp</sup>, i.e. when charged on the 3&#x02032;-end aa-tRNA, to bind the factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c24">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>YadB aminoacylates the queuosine located in the first position of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> anticodon</title><p>Analysis of the chemical structure of the modified nucleosides present in <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c25">25</xref>) reveals that the queuosine (Q) in the first position of the anticodon (position 34 of tRNA) possesses a cyclopentenyldiol ring containing a <italic>cis</italic>-diol that could possibly mimic the 2&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-OH groups of the ribose of the terminal adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c28">28</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f3">3</xref>A). Introduction of queuosine into tRNA is achieved by a complex cascade of enzymatic reactions involving tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT), which results by its exchange with G34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c29">29</xref>).</p><p>To check whether glutamylation of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> by YadB is dependent on the presence of queuosine we first attempted to glutamylate the <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> transcript deprived of modified nucleotides. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh608tb1">1</xref> shows that pure <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> is fully charged by YadB, whereas the transcript, deprived of post-transcriptional modifications but instead containing G34, is not charged by YadB.

As expected, both tRNAs are completely aspartylated by <italic>E.coli</italic> AspRS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f3">3</xref>A). However, while YadB fully aminoacylated tRNA<sup>AspQ34</sup>, this enzyme was unable to glutamylate tRNA<sup>AspG34</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f3">3</xref>A). As confirmed by 2-dimensional TLC analysis of tRNA hydrolysates, the two tRNA variants differ only in the absence of Q in tRNA<sup>AspG34</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f3">3</xref>A, insets). A further confirmation that Q34 is the acceptor of the activated Glu was obtained by inhibition of glutamylation of wild-type tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> in the presence of tRNA<sup>AspG34</sup>. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f3">3</xref>B shows that tRNA<sup>AspG34</sup> competitively inhibits charging of tRNA<sup>AspQ34</sup> by YadB, which displays the same affinity for both tRNAs, as indicated by the kinetic constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for tRNA<sup>AspQ34</sup> and <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> for tRNA<sup>AspG34</sup> of 0.19 &#x000b5;M).

The first four base pairs of the tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> acceptor arm are identical to the first four base pairs of the tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> anticodon stem, while the discriminator G73 residue and C74 of tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> align with G39 from the tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> anticodon stem and C38, the last nucleotide of the anticodon loop, respectively.</p><p>Expanding the comparative analysis to all tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> and tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> species of bacteria encoding YadB genes, we observed partial conservation of the sequence mimicry (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f4">4</xref>A). Interestingly, the sequence conservation in the two tRNAs follows the phylogenetic classification of the YadB proteins in three structure-based subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c14">14</xref>). Thus complete mimicry between the two tRNAs is found in the two &#x003b3;-proteobacteria, <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enteritica</italic>, that are most closely related to <italic>E.coli</italic> with respect to their YadB proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f4">4</xref>A). Mimicry between tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> and tRNA<sup>Glu</sup>, as found in <italic>E.coli</italic>, becomes looser in bacteria, where the divergence between YadB proteins increases, but interestingly high mimicry exists between tRNAs of organisms with YadB proteins from the same subgroup.</p><p>Altogether, this comparative analysis indicates that four nucleotides from the 5&#x02032;-side of the anticodon stem&#x02013;loop of the tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> species are conserved (namely C38 from the anticodon loop as well as G39, G42 and G43 from the anticodon stem) and three are present in a 6 nt sequence stretch from the 3&#x02032;-terminus of the corresponding tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> species (namely single-stranded C74 from the CCA terminus and discriminator residues G73 and G69). This sequence mimicry with the anticodon branch of tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> is never found in tRNA<sup>Asn</sup>, tRNA<sup>His</sup> and tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> that possess Q in position 34 but in which G39 and C38 are always replaced by U39 and A38 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f4">4</xref>B). Likewise, no such mimicry is found between eukaryotic tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> and tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> species. In conclusion, this suggests that those residues from the consensus highlighted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f3">3</xref>, especially C38, G39, G42 and G43, are critical for recognition of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> by YadB and, conversely, their non-conservation in tRNA<sup>Asn</sup>, tRNA<sup>His</sup> and tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> contribute to the rejection of these Q-containing tRNAs by YadB proteins.</p><p>To gain a deeper insight into the structural elements that could promote tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> anticodon recognition and aminoacylation by YadB, the minimal GluRS, we constructed a docking model of <italic>E.coli</italic> YadB and <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f5">5</xref>). By aligning the two similar helical parts of the tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> anticodon stem (residues 24&#x02013;45) and tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> acceptor stem (without <sub>73</sub>GCCA<sub>76</sub>) we observed that in tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> Q34 protrudes in a loop, while in tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> the GCCA stem residues fold back in the opposite direction. As a consequence, the amino acid accepting OH groups of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> (Q34) and tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> (A76) are presented in different conformations. Therefore, simple docking of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> to YadB, without structural deformation of the anticodon loop, is not compatible with &#x02018;classical&#x02019; tRNA binding in the catalytic domain of a class I synthetase. However, the tRNA could be fitted with only the &#x0223c;30&#x02013;38 segment in the groove (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f5">5</xref>). This position is correct with regard to shape complementarity and to reactive group closeness (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f5">5</xref>, inset). Note that the interacting surface between YadB and tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> is quite large in the tentative docking model: 1100 &#x0212b;<sup>2</sup> of YadB (&#x0223c;10&#x00025; of the total surface) are shielded from solvent in the complex. In this model the interacting protein surface is slightly reduced as compared to the complexes involving class I GluRS in which 1600 &#x0212b;<sup>2</sup> are shielded from the solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c33">33</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional and evolutionary considerations</title><p>Data reported here break down the current paradigm underlying all the research on tRNA recognition and aminoacylation by aaRSs, namely that the catalytic domain of synthetases recognizes the amino acid branch of tRNAs and attaches the activated amino acid via an ester bond to their 3&#x02032;-CCA<sub>OH</sub> termini. All the literature on structural and functional biology in the field has been exclusively based on this paradigm. Therefore, it was a great surprise to discover that a protein closely mimicking the catalytic domain of <italic>E.coli</italic> GluRS, namely the YadB protein from <italic>E.coli</italic>, recognizes the anticodon branch of a tRNA and attaches an amino acid on a modified base from the tRNA anticodon. Interestingly, YadB has the ability to activate Glu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c14">14</xref>), although without the assistance of tRNA<sup>Glu</sup>, as is the case of canonical GluRSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c34">34</xref>), but also the unexpected ability to interact with the distal extremity of <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> and to acylate the cyclopentenyldiol ring of the Q base post-transcriptionnally inserted at position 34 of the anticodon. This ring, with two <italic>cis</italic>-diol residues, mimics the structure of the 3&#x02032;-terminal ribose of tRNA and thus Glu is attached to the Q base via an unstable ester bond (half-life 7.5 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c14">14</xref>). This explains why the presence of a glutamylated Q base (which can be abbreviated as Glu-Q) in <italic>E.coli</italic> has escaped identification up to now. Docking of the tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> anticodon branch on YadB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f5">5</xref>) suggests that this branch has physical contact with the protein, a conclusion in agreement with the competition of tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> deprived of Q for glutamylation of native tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> with Q34 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f3">3</xref>B). This <italic>a priori</italic> unpredicted biological function of YadB as a tRNA modifying enzyme recognizing the anticodon stem and loop of tRNA can be generalized to other YadB-containing microorganisms, as supported by sequence comparison of their tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> and tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh608f4">4</xref>). Therefore, YadB proteins can be renamed glutamyl-Q tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> synthetases (Glu-Q-RSs).</p><p>From another perspective, one can question the evolutionary origin of the YadB proteins. Whether an ancestral YadB protein was a precursor of modern prokaryotic GluRSs or whether the YadB family originates from an ancestral GluRS remains an open question. However, their contemporary biological function has likely a recent evolutionary origin, given the reaction that YadB enzymes catalyze. Because the presence of YadB proteins is restricted to prokaryotic organisms, glutamylation of the Q base in tRNA<sup>Asp</sup>, which only occurs in such organisms, is intriguing, since Q base is also found in eukaryotes. However, hypermodified Q residues have been detected in higher eukaryotes, with a mannosyl or galactosyl residue instead of a Glu fixed on the cyclopentenyldiol ring. Note also that the mannosyl and galactosyl moieties, like the ribose and the cyclopentenyldiol ring, possess two adjacent <italic>cis</italic>-diols that could also be potential amino acid acceptors via catalysis by aaRS-mimicking proteins. These observations raise interesting questions about the structure of the enzymes attaching mannose or galactose to Q bases and about the possible existence of proteins that may esterify these sugars. Like YadB, such proteins could be aaRS-mimicking proteins.</p><p>To conclude, let us comment on tRNA structure in the light of the new paradigm and of concepts underlying the origin of tRNA and the genetic code. Here it is shown that a mimic of an aaRS catalytic domain makes no fundamental difference in recognizing a tRNA anticodon branch instead of a tRNA amino acid accepting branch. This property of YadB is in line with the idea that contemporary tRNA originated by fusion of two primordial minihelix or stem&#x02013;loop structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c3">3</xref>). Likewise, primordial aaRSs were simplified structures restricted to their catalytic core, existing in nature as two versions (the class I and the class II versions), that became more complex in later evolution by the addition of extra domains, the most important being the anticodon-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh608c1">1</xref>). In the course of such structural tinkering it is likely that primitive aaRSs were able to recognize a variety of RNA architectures with tRNA features. This potential recognition was maintained in some modern proteins as a remnant of their early evolution. YadB (Glu-Q-RS) is such a protein. We anticipate that other aaRS mimics remain to be discovered and believe that such proteins will use their catalytic and RNA recognition potential in participating in metabolic pathways as yet undeciphered.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh608f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Analysis of the amino acid accepting capacity of <italic>E.coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Asp</sup> when aminoacylated by AspRS, YadB and by both.
