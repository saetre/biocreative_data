However, Prox1<sup>+ </sup>cells, which co-expressed biliary epithelial makers and showed ductular morphology, could be detected within fibrotic septa of cirrhotic livers, and in both HCC and CCC. Two Prox1 mRNA isoforms (2.9 kb and 7.9 kb) were identified with a prevalence of the longer isoform in several HCC samples and the shorter in most CCC samples. Evidence was provided that Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) might significantly contribute to the gene expression of Prox1 in HCC, while neo-expression of Prox1 in CCC remains to be resolved. A point mutation in the prospero domain of Prox1 was found in one HCC sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study shows dysregulation of Prox1 in liver cirrhosis, HCC and CCC, such as neo-expression in cells with biliary epithelial phenotype in liver cirrhosis, and in CCC. Altered Prox1 mRNA expression is partly regulated by MAZ, and mutation of the prospero domain in HCC indicates an involvement for Prox1 during tumor progression.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Homeobox genes encode transcription factors that control cell differentiation and play essential roles during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The homeobox genes Hlx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], Hex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and the prospero-related homeobox 1 (Prox1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] are involved in the development of the liver bud. Prox1 belongs to the earliest markers of mammalian foregut endoderm cells, where its expression is confined to a short segment that gives rise both to the liver and pancreas, remaining expressed during the adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In <italic>Prox1</italic>-deficient mice, the hepatoblasts fail to migrate into the neighboring mesenchyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Prox1-null mice die around embryonic day (ED) 14.5 and show a 70% reduction of liver size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Besides albumin and &#x003b1;-fetoprotein (AFP), Prox1 is an early marker of hepatoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In our previous study it was shown that Prox1 remains a stabile marker of hepatocytes in normal adult, injured and regenerating liver, whereas it is not detectable in biliary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Prox1 was found to regulate metabolic function in hepatocytes, and to be involved in the regulation of other transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>A previous study showed various levels of <italic>prox1 </italic>mRNA expression in HCC cell lines and tumor samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and found that, patients with higher expression had much more favorable prognosis than those with lower expression. On the other hand, there was no statistically significant difference in the disease-free survival rates between high and low expression of prox1.</p><p>A down-regulation of <italic>prox1</italic>-gene-expression was reported in HCC and CCC liver samples <italic>compared to normal liver </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It was supposed that downregulation of <italic>prox1</italic>-gene-expression was induced by the methylation of the Prox1-promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Additionally, so far, no mutations were found in the coding region of Prox1 in HCCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, comparing the gene expression pattern or <italic>prox1</italic>, a decreased expression could be found in the average of HCC and CCC liver samples, whereas, a stable high expression level persists in HCC cell lines, and in the MZ-Cha2 biliary adenocarcinoma cell line.</p><p>Aim of the current study was to investigate the regulatory changes of Prox1-gene-expression in liver cirrhosis, in hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinomas. While, as we recently reported, no Prox1-expression was found in biliary epithelial cells of the normal liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], it was newly expressed in ductular cells showing biliary epithelial cell makers within the fibrotic septa of cirrhotic livers, in HCC and CCC.

Previously we found that, Prox1 is expressed in hepatocytes of normal and injured rat livers, whereas it is absent in biliary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, we have studied the effects of Prox1 on the transcriptional profile of met-murine hepatocytes (MMH). These immortalized murine hepatoblasts express numerous hepatoblast markers, but not Prox1. A stable transfection with Prox1 cDNA and transcriptome analyses, revealed an up-regulation of 22 genes and down-regulation of 232 genes. Many of these genes are involved in hepatocyte functions, suggesting that Prox1 is a multifunctional regulator of liver morphogenesis and of hepatocyte function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Proliferation of MMH was not altered by stabile transfection with Prox1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Other researchers suggested a tumor suppressor function for Prox1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] in HCC and CCC, and recently also in other tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>In the current study we could detect a high variability of Prox1 mRNA expression among normal, cirrhotic human liver specimens, in HCC and in CCC. No significant relationship was found between Prox1 mRNA expression and differentiation grade.</p><p>The prox1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q32), where a loss of heterozygosity in malignant lymphoma was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This is an instable region of the genome. Accordingly, we found a point mutation in the prospero domain in one HCC sample with unexpected high Prox1 expression. This mutation might eliminate or alter the function of the <italic>prox1 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Similarly to previously described mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], this mutation also occurred at evolutionary conserved codons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Our findings indicated that, apart from hepatocytes, Prox1-expression was also detectable in ductular cells within the fibrotic septa of cirrhotic livers and in the nuclei of intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma cells. In order to identify Prox1<sup>+ </sup>cells in the investigated human liver samples, lineage-specific markers were used. HepPar1 was described as a hepatocyte marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and was also observed in liver cells with intermediate fate (hepatocyte/cholangiocyte) in a variety of acute and chronic human liver diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. CK7, CK19 and OV-6 biliary type cytokeratins have been described in "oval cells" as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. OV-6 is a monoclonal antibody rose against cells isolated from 2-acetylaminofluorene-treated rat liver, which recognize the epitope on cytokeratins (CK) 19 and 14, and is a widely used "oval cell" marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Cells of morphology and immunophenotype intermediate between hepatocytes and cholangiocytes ("intermediate cells") were not recognized in normal liver tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Surprisingly, ductular cells, which were positive for biliary epithelial cell markers (CK7, CK19, OV-6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and located within the fibrotic septa and at the margin of regenerating nodules of cirrhotic livers, showed a positive-staining for Prox1 as well. Morphologically, these cells were different from hepatocytes and had features shared with biliary epithelial cells (small oval to cuboidal cells with round to oval nuclei). These findings support that Prox1<sup>+ </sup>cells of CCC might descend from the biliary epithelial cell lineage, and Prox1 is newly expressed in those cells.</p><p>The current study provided data, which might take an insight into the regulation of Prox1 expression under pathological conditions. This study confirmed the existence of more mRNA isoforms, which was shown by Zinovieva <italic>et al</italic>., in 1996 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In this study two isoforms were revealed by hybridisation and sequencing. In the previous report of Zinovieva <italic>et al</italic>. (1996) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] an additional unclear hybridisation smear was observed between the long and the short transcript in the human embryonic lens samples. Similarly, on our Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> unclear hybridisation results were observed in more samples. These observations indicate the existence of more Prox1 transcripts, which were discovered more than 20 years ago. Identification of even more Prox1 mRNA transcript might be expected in the future. These isoforms might be regulated by different regulatory sequences, but the same sequences might influence more isoforms based on their position (OTTHUMG00000036946 in the VEGA database). The dominance of the 7907 bases form was found in more hepatocellular carcinoma samples, while the shorter isoform was more often dominant in CCC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>), and in the MZ-Cha2 biliary adenocarcinoma cell line. The induction of the shorter Prox1 mRNA isoform might be related with a neoexpression in a cell population with biliary phenotype in liver cirrhosis and in CCC.</p><p>The results of the current work suggest that in HCC the Myc-associated Zinc-finger protein (MAZ) might be involved in the expression Prox1. The expression of MAZ is significantly increased in HCC. It was demonstrated here that, the MAZ protein might directly bind to responsive elements included in the regulatory sequences of Prox1, and might contribute to the positive regulation of this gene (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). MAZ was originally found to bind specifically to the wild-type ME1a1 sequence, a 16-base-pair nuclear factor binding site residing between the <italic>c-myc </italic>P1 and P2 transcription initiation sites, the MElal site facilitate initiation from the downstream start site of c-myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Northern blot analysis revealed that MAZ is expressed in human heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It was shown that co-expression of c-myc and transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha as transgenes in mouse liver results in major enhancement of neoplastic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. C-myc contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis not only by regulating cell proliferation and death but more profoundly by modulating specific metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Based on the current study, MAZ might be involved also in the regulation of Prox1 in HCC. Prox1 might influence several genes involved in hepatic metabolic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The Prox1 isoforms not only differ by their 5'-flanking regions, but also by their end-sequence. In the 3'-non-translated area the unprocessed pre-mRNA contains a significant signal-motive, which functions as a signal for polyadenylation, recognised by <italic>Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity</italic>-<italic>Factor </italic>(CPSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] Although alternative sequences also exist, the AAUAAA is the most wide-spread polyA signal. AAUAAA is detectable after the TGA stop codon in the "Prox1-7907", but not in the "Prox1-2929". This difference might be related with a higher stability of the "Prox1-7907", which dominates over the short isoform in HCC. Accordingly, MAZ might be also involved in transcriptional stabilisation, not only in initialisation of the transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the current study provided further evidence for the existence of different Prox1 mRNA isoforms in human liver, and recognised the dominance of a 7907-bases isoform in HCC, and the 2929-bases isoform in CCC. In some HCC cases the Prox1 mRNA expression was higher compared to the average of the normal liver, which in one case was related with mutation. At protein level the expression of the 95 kD protein was lower in liver tumors, or degradation was detected in the cell nuclear extracts. Human HCC cell lines contained high Prox1 expression both at protein and mRNA levels. The expression of the "Prox1-7907"-mRNA-isoform, and the high expression of Prox 1 in HCC cell lines might be associated with the increased expression of MAZ transcription factor, which is able to bind to the promoter of "Prox1-7907". A direct linear relationship between MAZ and Prox1 expressions could not be stated. Our histological analysis detected the neoexpression of Prox1-protein in ductular biliary cells of liver cirrhosis and of CCC.</p><p>Although our understanding is continuously increasing, there are still several puzzles and contradictions related to this homeobox gene in hepatic carcinogenesis, which should be solved in the future.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AFP-&#x003b1;-Fetoprotein, ANOVA-Analysis of Variance, AP-4-Activator protein 4, CCC-Cholangiocellular Carcinoma, CK-Cytokeratin, CPSF-Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity-Factor, CREB-cAMP-responsive Element Binding Protein, ED-Embryonic Day, EMSA-Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay, HAVANA-Human And Vertebrate Analysis aNd Annotation, HCC-Hepatocellular Carcinoma, HNF-Hepatic Nuclar Factor, MAZ-Myc-associated Zinc-finger protein, MEM-Minimum Essential Medium, Prox1-Prospero-related Homeobox 1, TGF-Transforming Growth Factor</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JD carried out the molecular genetic studies, the sequence alignment, designed primers, analysed sequences, performed northern blots, western blots, EMSA, siRNA transfections and analysis, performed the statistical analysis, drafted and revised the manuscript.
