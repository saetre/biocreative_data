Two major classes of PcG repressor complexes (PRCs) have been recognized in animal systems: PRC2, containing EZ responsible for the histone H3 lysine 27 methylation, and PRC1, mediating the formation of transcription-resistant chromatin structure at target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Complexes containing the Trithorax histone H3 lysine 4-methyl transferase activity are COMPASS, in yeast, and TAC1, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). PcG and TrxG factors regulate plant genes as well but plants have developed epigenetic mechanisms that are related, although not identical, with those of animals or yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>). For example, the PRC2 complex is conserved both structurally and functionally between animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) but PRC1 homologs have not been identified. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> components of PcG/TrxG complexes play repressing and activating roles for a number of plant genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20 B21">13&#x02013;21</xref>) but whether PcG and TrxG act as antagonists at the same gene locus in plants is unknown. The <italic>Arabidopsis CLF</italic> gene encodes an EZ homolog, while the <italic>ATX1</italic> gene encodes a Trx-homolog, acting as a repressor and activator of the homeotic <italic>AGAMOUS, AG</italic>, gene, respectively. Disruption of either function causes recognizable phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Here, we report that nucleosomes at silent <italic>AG</italic> loci carry both the activating, H3K4me3, and the repressing, H3K27me3, marks. Recent findings have suggested that simultaneously present H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks establish bivalent chromatin states of silent genes poised for transcription later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Furthermore, simultaneous loss of both <italic>ATX1</italic> and <italic>CLF</italic> functions caused a remarkable shift towards the wild type. Analyzing the molecular mechanism behind this event we found that, contrary to expectations, loss of both functions resulted in partial restorations of the K4 and K27 marks on the <italic>AG</italic> nucleosomes in the double mutants. The results suggest that the antagonistic PcG- and TrxG-complexes form specific pairs to generate bivalent chromatin marks. The most unexpected result was the partial restoration of the methylation patterns and phenotypes in the double mutants. It suggested that in the absence of both ATX1 and CLF their roles could be undertaken by a different pair of antagonists. Restored patterns, however, were not identical with the initial patterns, an observation that could account for the variability and instability of phenotypes often seen in epigenetic mutants. Lastly, we demonstrate that ATX1 and CLF physically interact mechanistically linking the observed effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plant material</title><p>Homozygous <italic>atx1, clf-1, atx1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/<sup>&#x02212;</sup>clf<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> and control wild type <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Ws), plants were grown under long day light conditions (14 h light/10 h darkness) at 24&#x000b0;C and similarly handled. <italic>atx1</italic> plants were crossed with <italic>clf-1</italic> both as the female and the male parent with no change of phenotypes or methylation profiles.

PCR primers used for both RT-PCR and ChIP assays are shown in Supplementary Table 2. All PCR amplification reactions were carried out for 38 cycles (95&#x000b0; for 3 min, 95&#x000b0; for 30 min; 50&#x000b0; for 30 min; 72&#x000b0; for 10 min).</p><p>ChIP assays were performed following protocols as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).

Intensities were normalized versus the input sample, representing 15% of the DNA used as template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).

Growth of serially diluted transformed cells is shown in Supplementary Data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). For the BiFC approach, CLF (At2g23380) and ATX1 (At2g31650) genes were amplified from cDNA templates using specific primers (GATEWAY&#x000ae;, Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). The PCR products were subsequently recombined into BiFC vectors (pE-SPYNE, pE-SPYCE) and YFP vector (pENSG-YFP), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) by attL &#x000d7; attR (LR) recombination at the GATEWAY&#x02122; recombination sites. BiFC vectors were kindly provided by C.S. Mayer and W. Dr&#x000f6;ge-Laser, Georg August University of Goettingen, Germany). The pDONR entry vectors were recombined with the BiFC destination vectors (pE-SPYNE and pE-SPYCE) in an LR reaction which placed the genes in frame with and downstream of the coding sequence of the YFP halves. The resulting expression vector drives expression of the fusion protein under the control of the 35S promoter. The control vectors pE-SPYNE(-)and pE-SPYCE(-) contained the YFP halves with the gateway cassettes replaced by &#x02018;inert filler&#x02019; sequences. The generated ATX-YN/CLF-YC, ATX-YC/CLF-YN and control ATX-YN/(-)YC, CLF-YC/(-)NC constructs were delivered into onion epidermal cells and observed 24 h later. Coding sequences of two cytoplasmic proteins (EF1a and MYO1) were cloned in each of the vectors and used as negative controls for the complementation of ATX1. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Phenotypes and expression of the homeotic gene <italic>AG</italic> in wild type, in single, and in double mutant plants.

In earlier studies, while using ATX1 as bait, we had isolated an ATX1-interacting clone from yeast and have identified it as CLF (unpublished data). At the time, we did not pursue this observation further but the current results prompted us to revisit this finding. Cloned reciprocally as &#x02018;prey&#x02019; and &#x02018;bait&#x02019; and tested under two different stringency conditions, CLF and ATX1 did show interaction in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a; Supplementary Figure 1). To establish whether ATX1 and CLF would bind in plant cells as well, we used a novel approach developed for the visualization of interactions between proteins in living cells: non-fluorescent fragments of YFP could reconstitute the fluorophore only when brought together by interactions between proteins covalently linked to each fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). ATX1 and CLF were cloned as fusion proteins with halves of the YFP protein and transiently expressed in plant cells to be inspected by the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) approach. Accordingly, the fluorescence seen in the nuclei of transformed onion epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b and c) demonstrate that ATX1 and CLF physically interact. Vectors expressing the YFP halves alone did not produce any signal; nor did the EF1&#x003b1; protein, cloned and tested as a complementary half for the ATX1-linked fluorophore. These experiments underscored the specificity of the ATX1-CLF interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>d). Moreover, loss of H3K27me3 in the <italic>atx1</italic> background implicated ATX1 in recruiting CLF to <italic>AG</italic>-nucleosomes. Attempts to co-immunoprecipitate recombinantly produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATX1 and CLF were unsuccessful suggesting that protein modifications might be involved and required in their interaction. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Interaction of ATX1- and CLF-in yeast and in plant cells.

An interaction between ATX1 and CLF for the control of the <italic>AG</italic> silent state is supported by three types of evidence: first, restoration of <italic>AG</italic>-repression in the double mutants and rescued leaf phenotypes associated with <italic>AG</italic> misexpression in single <italic>atx1</italic> and <italic>clf</italic> mutants, provide compelling genetic evidence; second, bivalent chromatin marks established by the two methylases at the silent <italic>AG</italic> locus constitute epigenetic evidence. Lastly, the propensity of ATX1 and CLF to form specific complexes <italic>in vivo</italic> mechanistically links the observed effects. Restoration of <italic>AG</italic> repression upon loss of both ATX1 and CLF and loss of H3K27me3 in the <italic>atx1</italic> background support the idea that the two methylases interact. Partial restoration of the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 signals in the double <italic>atx1/clf</italic> mutants illustrated that <italic>AG</italic>-nucleosomes could be targeted by a different (surrogate) pair of methylases but only when both ATX1 and CLF were absent. Why methylations were restored on downstream nucleosomes but not at the 5&#x02032;-nucleosomes is unclear but one plausible possibility is that a specific transcription factor directing ATX1 and CLF to the promotor does not interact with the surrogate pair.</p><p>Presence of both K4me3 and K27me3 tags at silent embryonic stem cell loci was interpreted as a bivalent mark on genes poised for transcription later in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). It is quite remarkable, then, that a similar bivalent mark was found at the flower homeotic gene, silent in young seedlings but expressed during flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). ChIP assay, currently used for determining chromatin modification states, is not a feasible approach for analysis of the active <italic>AG</italic> profiles because flower chromatin is a mix of cells (whorls) expressing and non-expressing <italic>AG</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Alternative approaches need to be developed to assess <italic>AG</italic> modification patterns in flowers.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the nucleosomes of another homeotic regulator, <italic>AP1</italic>, also carry the bivalent K4me3 and K27me3 marks in silent chromatins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>a and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>d). However, an apparently different antagonistic pair establishes the bivalent marks of <italic>AP1</italic> nucleosomes because the K27me3 signal in <italic>clf</italic> chromatin is preserved as is the K4me3 signal in <italic>atx1</italic> chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>d and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>c). While CLF does not affect <italic>AP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), consistent with preservation of K27me3 in <italic>clf</italic> chromatin, ATX1 activates <italic>AP1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). ChIP analysis with antiATX1 antibodies did not reveal presence of ATX1 at <italic>AP1</italic>nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) consistent with a conclusion that ATX1 does not modify <italic>AP1</italic> nucleosomes. Thereby, activation of <italic>AP1</italic> transcription is, most likely, indirect.</p><p>De-repression of <italic>AG</italic> in <italic>clf</italic> mutants is associated with a strong curly leaf phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) but, interestingly, <italic>atx1</italic> plants also show a leaf phenotype despite the fact that <italic>AG</italic> is not expressed in <italic>atx1</italic> leaf chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a and c). Most likely, other ATX1-regulated genes contribute to leaf size and shape; in addition, both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3-tags might be needed to establish &#x02018;normal&#x02019; silencing of <italic>AG</italic>. We note also that the <italic>AG</italic> transcription pattern as well as histone H3-K4, K9 and K27 methylation profiles of <italic>AG</italic>-nucleosomes did not depend on the genetic background of the plants as they were indistinguishable in chromatins isolated from Col, Ws and Ler background plants. Furthermore, the bivalent-state silencing &#x02018;code&#x02019; may be gene-specific; for instance, Clarke Kent epialleles of <italic>SUP</italic> require simultaneously present H3K27me2 and H3K9me2 to maintain DNA methylation and to keep the gene silent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>There are three <italic>EZ</italic> and multiple <italic>ATX1</italic>-related and putative K4-trimethylase genes in the genome of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). At least three different PRC2-like complexes, containing different EZ homologs, have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Despite some partial redundancy, however, none of the CLF homologs (MEA or SWN) could complement <italic>clf</italic> mutants consistent with the idea that each one participates in a different complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Likewise, the inability of any of the ATX1-related proteins to substitute for ATX1 in the <italic>atx1</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>a and b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) suggest that K4 methyl transferases assemble, most likely, distinct complexes as well. Given that a functionally equivalent methylase cannot substitute a missing relative within a complex, our results take the specificity one step further, by suggesting that PcG- and TrxG-complexes form specific pairs establishing bivalent marks at targeted loci.</p><p>The idea of how two antagonistic epigenetic complexes might interact is illustrated in the proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). A central assumption is that each PRC2 and TrxG complex assembles a specific set of subunits around a particular EZ or TRX homolog. Only when both complexes are missing could their roles be undertaken by another pair. Such a model could explain partial rescue of single mutant <italic>atx1</italic> and <italic>clf</italic> phenotypes in the absence of both ATX1 and CLF. Furthermore, restored patterns were not identical with the wild type, i.e. they did not occur at 5&#x02032;-end nucleosomes, nor did they take place 100% of the times. Thereby, inability of surrogate complexes to fully rescue native patterns provides a basis for interpreting spontaneous reversals, variability and instability of phenotypes associated with epigenetic mutations. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>A model for the interaction of the ATX1-containing TrxG and CLF-containing PcG complexes at the <italic>AG</italic> locus. In wild type leaf chromatin, CLF and ATX1 counterbalance each other. At the molecular level, this is associated with non-transcribed <italic>AG</italic> and with presence of m<sup>3</sup>K4/H3 and m<sup>3</sup>K27/H3. Both ATX1 and CLF activities are required for the &#x02018;normal&#x02019; repression of <italic>AG</italic> generating, a bivalent chromatin state. ATX1 and CLF participate in antagonistic complexes functioning as a specific pair (nucleosome on the left). Loss of either CLF or ATX1 cannot be substituted by a homologous activity within the pair. ATX1 at the <italic>AG</italic>- 5&#x02032;-nucleosomes may recruit CLF but not vice versa. This may account for the m<sup>3</sup>K4 and m<sup>3</sup>K27 patterns in the single mutants (see text). Elimination of both ATX1 and CLF allows a different pair of antagonists to label <italic>AG</italic> (nucleosome on the right). However, they modify only downstream nucleosomes because the specific factor taking ATX1/CLF to the start site fails to recruit their homologs. Assembly of substitute complexes restoring the methylation tags might not be occurring 100% of the time accounting for the variability in rescued phenotypes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm464f6"/></fig></p><p>Partial normalization of axial&#x02013;skeletal transformations in mice, observed when both <italic>Mll</italic> (a human homolog of trithorax) and <italic>BMI</italic>-1 (a PcG component) were deleted, led to the suggestion that direct interaction between MLL and a PcG-subunit was the molecular mechanism of phenotype rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that the Trx and EZ homologs could, indeed, bind directly; interactions among other subunits of the complex pair are not excluded. It is interesting to consider our results in the context of two recent models of PcG-TrxG interactions in animal systems. At the <italic>UBX</italic>-PRC sites, the Trx protein is constitutively bound with PcG complexes compatible with a possibility that the two complexes might directly interact, although binding partners were not identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). It was suggested that Ash1 and Trx HMTases were not &#x02018;coactivators&#x02019; for the activation of <italic>HOX</italic> genes but function as antirepressors of PcG function to prevent inappropriate silencing of <italic>HOX</italic>. Methylated K4/H3 was suggested to prevent binding of PcG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Tri-methylated K4 were confined to the first 1 kb, and tri-methylated K27 were found throughout the coding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) similar to the H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 distribution at the <italic>AG</italic> locus. However, the molecular mechanism keeping the homeotic <italic>AG</italic> gene silent is apparently different: presence of K4-methylation did not prevent binding of a CLF-containing repressive complex; to the contrary, ATX1 was required for methylations at K27 to occur. Our results agree well with the model suggesting that simultaneous presence of TRX and PcG (and the activating K4 and repressing K27 marks, respectively) establish bivalent chromatin states in embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In a bivalent state, certain genes are silent but the chromatin structure is poised for activation later in development. It is tempting to suggest that the presence of K4- and K27-trimethyl marks at the non-expressing <italic>AG</italic> locus in young seedling chromatin reflects a bivalent chromatin state prepared for expression at a later developmental stage.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm464_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm464_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors are grateful to B.
