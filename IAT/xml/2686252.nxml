The transcription factor Pax6 is essential for neural stem cell proliferation, multipotency, and neurogenesis in many regions of the central nervous system, including the cerebral cortex. We used Pax6 as an entry point to define the cellular networks controlling neural stem cell self-renewal and neurogenesis in stem cells of the developing mouse cerebral cortex. We identified the genomic binding locations of Pax6 in neocortical stem cells during normal development and ascertained the functional significance of genes that we found to be regulated by Pax6, finding that Pax6 positively and directly regulates cohorts of genes that promote neural stem cell self-renewal, basal progenitor cell genesis, and neurogenesis. Notably, we defined a core network regulating neocortical stem cell decision-making in which Pax6 interacts with three other regulators of neurogenesis, Neurog2, Ascl1, and Hes1. Analyses of the biological function of Pax6 in neural stem cells through phenotypic analyses of Pax6 gain- and loss-of-function mutant cortices demonstrated that the Pax6-regulated networks operating in neural stem cells are highly dosage sensitive. Increasing Pax6 levels drives the system towards neurogenesis and basal progenitor cell genesis by increasing expression of a cohort of basal progenitor cell determinants, including the key transcription factor Eomes/Tbr2, and thus towards neurogenesis at the expense of self-renewal. Removing Pax6 reduces cortical stem cell self-renewal by decreasing expression of key cell cycle regulators, resulting in excess early neurogenesis. We find that the relative levels of Pax6, Hes1, and Neurog2 are key determinants of a dynamic network that controls whether neural stem cells self-renew, generate cortical neurons, or generate basal progenitor cells, a mechanism that has marked parallels with the transcriptional control of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Neural stem cells make all of the neurons in the brain. A key feature of these cells is the ability to regulate the balance between making more neural stem cells, the process of self-renewal, and making nerve cells, the process of neurogenesis. Too much self-renewal would result in a brain with too few neurons and abnormal circuitry; too much neurogenesis would deplete all of the neural stem cells too quickly, resulting in a small brain and neurological abnormalities. Little is currently known of the how neural stem cells control this fundamental choice. We used one transcription factor, Pax6, which is important for this decision, as an entry point to define the cellular networks controlling neural stem cell self-renewal and neurogenesis in the developing mouse brain. We found that the relative amount of Pax6 controls the balance between self-renewal and neurogenesis in neural stem cells. Increasing Pax6 levels drives the system towards neurogenesis, at the expense of self-renewal, by turning on a genetic programme for making neurons, whereas decreasing Pax6 turns off the genetic programme for neural stem cell self-renewal. In both cases, altering the levels of Pax6 ultimately leads to a small brain, but through very different mechanisms.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A fundamental feature of neural development is the production of defined types of neurons in a temporal order from multipotent, regionally-specified neural stem and progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Livesey1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

The four transcription factors regulate one another and many of the same target genes in an antagonistic manner, defining a core self-renewal/neurogenesis network that is dependent on a critical level of Pax6. In support of this, we found in phenotypic analyses of Pax6 gain and loss of function cortices that an increase in Pax6 levels drives the system towards neurogenesis and basal progenitor cell genesis at the expense of self-renewal, whereas removing Pax6 reduces cortical stem cell self-renewal.

Combining these data with published data on genes downstream of Neurog2, Ascl1 and Hes1 (see text for details) enables construction of a basic network regulating cortical stem cell neurogenesis. Under normal conditions, Pax6 positively regulates Neurog2 and negatively regulates Ascl1 (Mash1), while directly and indirectly repressing the transcription factors Isl1 and Lhx8 respectively, both required for inhibitory interneuron genesis. Overall, this promotes genesis of glutamatergic projection neurons. Pax6 also positively regulates basal progenitor cell genes, including Eomes/Tbr2. Thick lines indicate direct regulation, thin lines indicate evidence from expression studies. (B) Loss of Pax6 function (Sey/Sey) removes the positive regulation of Neurog2 and the negative regulation of Ascl1, Lhx8 and Isl1.

The development of this model provides a framework in which to explore questions arising from the mechanism reported here. For example, only a subset of Pax6&#x0002b;/Hes1&#x02212; stem cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle go on to generate neurons in the next round of cell division. Therefore, there are likely to be additional components of this network that promote self-renewal and suppress neurogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Neural stem cell self-renewal, neurogenesis and cell fate determination are three forces that control the generation of specific classes of neurons at the correct place and time during development. Much remains to be discovered of the cellular networks operating to control these processes. We report here that the transcription factor Pax6 directly regulates genes controlling the balance between neocortical stem cell maintenance, neurogenesis and the production of basal progenitor cells in a dosage-dependent fashion. While consistent with genetic loss-of-function studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Marquardt1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Quinn1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Tarabykin1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Kroll1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Pinson1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Gotz1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, the direct nature of the control of these processes by Pax6 and their dosage sensitivity are unexpected. We propose that this dosage sensitivity reflects the need for a critical level of Pax6 within neocortical stem and progenitor cells.</p><p>Using Pax6 ChIP, we have identified a set of the promoters bound by Pax6 in neocortical stem cells <italic>in vivo</italic> at E12.5. This set of Pax6-bound genes defines the components of potential networks regulated by Pax6 in this tissue, and is noteworthy for the enrichment for genes involved in controlling cell cycle progression, transcription factors expressed in the three main cell types found in the early cortex (ventricular zone stem cells, basal progenitor cells and differentiating neurons) and also transcription factors expressed specifically in non-cortical neurons, including the ventral forebrain, spinal cord and retina, as well as in pancreatic islet cells.</p><p>These binding data are compatible with a number of models for Pax6 action. For example, Pax6 could repress expression of genes that are not normally expressed in the neocortex, or alternatively could simply bind to target sites in the promoters of genes normally expressed in other cell types in a Pax6-dependent manner, without driving their expression in the cortex. Similarly, for those genes expressed in cortex, Pax6 could either positively or negatively regulate cell cycle progression, and positively or negatively regulate basal progenitor cell genesis. Evidence for gene regulation by Pax6 is essential to resolve these questions. Therefore, we combined the binding data with transcriptome data from Pax6 gain- and loss-of-function experiments in the early developing cortex in order to identify those genes whose expression is dependent on Pax6 and the nature of that dependency, finding that 22&#x00025; of Pax6-bound genes show evidence for regulation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Transcriptome analyses of Pax6 gain and loss of function cortices identified a subset of genes that show reciprocal regulation, but also clearly demonstrate that the gain and loss of function gene expression changes are not simply complementary, in agreement with the reported anatomical phenotypes of Pax6 null and Pax6 over-expressing cortices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Quinn1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Warren1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Manuel2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Berger1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there is a striking overlap and complementarity in the changes of expression in basal progenitor genes observed in each mutant. We found that Pax6 directly promotes expression of a large set of genes specifically expressed in basal progenitor cells, including the key determinant of that cell type, the transcription factor Eomes/Tbr2: mutations in Eomes/Tbr2 lead to a loss of the cortical intermediate progenitor cell population, accompanied by a reduction in neurons in all cortical layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Sessa1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Arnold1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Increasing Pax6 levels drives basal progenitor cell genesis from cortical stem cells, primarily by increasing Eomes/Tbr2 expression, along with the other basal progenitor cell genes such as Gadd45g, Neurod1, Sstr2 and Hes6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Kawaguchi1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Basal progenitor cells undergo a limited number of mitotic divisions to generate neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Pontious1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, thus the overall effect of shifting the stem cell population towards basal progenitor cells is to increase neurogenesis at the expense of neural stem cell maintenance in the early stages of cortical development, ultimately resulting in microcephaly, as observed here.</p><p>However, there are also changes in expression specific to either gain or loss of Pax6 function, with many more genes showing altered expression upon increased Pax6 levels. For example, from the combined Pax6 binding and regulation data we have found that Pax6 expression positively regulates stem cell self-renewal by promoting expression of the transcription factor Hmga2 and the G1 cyclin dependent kinase, Cdk4. Hmga2 promotes neural stem cell self-renewal by reducing expression of two negative regulators of the cell cycle, p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> and p19<sup>Arf</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Nishino1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Hmga2 reduces expression of p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> and p19<sup>Arf</sup> indirectly via repression of JunB, a positive regulator of their expression, and we also found Pax6 binding to the promoter of JunB in cortical stem cells. p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> slows cell cycle progression by inhibiting the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Sherr1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, and Cdk4 is bound and positively-regulated by Pax6 in cortical stem cells. In contrast, Pax6 also directly promotes expression of Pten and Fzr1/Cdh1, both of which reduce neural stem cell proliferation and self-renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-GarciaHiguera1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Groszer1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, under normal conditions <italic>in vivo</italic> Pax6 has the potential to both promote and limit stem cell self-renewal. However, when Pax6 levels are increased, as in the D6-Pax6 transgenic cortex, the neurogenic functions of Pax6 are dominant over its ability to promote self-renewal.</p><p>We have also placed Pax6 in the context of other transcriptional regulators of self-renewal and neurogenesis, Hes1, Neurog2 and Ascl1/Mash1, in order to extend our coverage of the cellular networks controlling these processes. The marked overlap between those genes directly and indirectly regulated by Pax6 with the genes regulated by all three of the other factors provides strong evidence for the operation and architecture of the network regulating cortical neurogenesis, and the central importance of the basal progenitor population as a major output of that network. Pax6 and Neurog2 cooperate to promote neurogenesis, both directly and via the basal progenitor population, and this is opposed by the oscillating expression of Hes1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Shimojo1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. At the same time, Pax6 also promotes stem cell self-renewal in a manner that counterbalances its neurogenesis-promoting activity. However, when over-expressed, the promotion of neurogenesis and basal progenitor cell genesis by Pax6 is dominant over the promotion of self-renewal.</p><p>Therefore, we propose that there is an optimal level of Pax6 that determines the balance between neocortical stem cell self-renewal and neurogenesis: increasing that level drives stem cells to a neuronal or basal progenitor fate, whereas reducing the level leads to early cell cycle exit, manifest as increased early neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Quinn1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In both cases, altering Pax6 levels leads to a depletion of the stem cell population by exiting to neurogenesis, but by different pathways and with different neuronal fates: cortical pyramidal cells when Pax6 is increased, inhibitory interneurons when Pax6 is absent. The sensitivity of cortical development to Pax6 levels underlines the importance of assessing subtle structural and functional anomalies in humans heterozygous for Pax6 mutations, as has been done for aniridia patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Mitchell1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Sisodiya1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Finally, the findings of Pax6 function in neocortical stem and progenitor cells presented here have similarities with the functions of the ES cell pluripotency regulator Oct4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Niwa1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Oct4 shows marked dosage effects in ES cells <italic>in vitro</italic> such that a reduction in Oct4 levels leads to trophectoderm differentiation and a two-fold increase in Oct4 levels leads to differentiation to primitive endoderm and mesoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Niwa1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Loss of Pax6 leads to a depletion of the cortical stem cell pool, via increased early neurogenesis secondary to a failure to self-renew, and also a switch in the fates of the neurons produced from glutamatergic cortical neurons to an inhibitory interneuron identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Kroll1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, increased Pax6 expression also leads to depletion of the stem cell pool, but in this case by driving stem cells to a basal progenitor fate, leading to an overproduction of early-born, deep-layer cortical neurons. Thus the level of Pax6 controls whether neural stem cells will self-renew, generate cortical neurons or produce basal progenitor cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation</title><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000511-Boyer1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, with minor modifications.
