In the mouse embryo, the gene was expressed in all tissues, whereas in adult mice expression was only detected in the thymus. Further analysis revealed that Trident expression strictly correlated with cell cycling, independent of cell type. Timing of [3H]thymidine incorporation showed that mRNA and protein expression were strongly upregulated upon entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, the protein was phosphorylated in M phase. PCR-mediated selection of optimal binding sites yielded a consensus motif resembling that of other family members. These results identify Trident as a transcription factor, which is likely involved in cell cycle-specific gene regulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
