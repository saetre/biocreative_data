The zinc-finger transcription factor, Churchill (ChCh) has been proposed to regulate cell fate by regulating cell movements during gastrulation in the chick. However, the mechanism of action of ChCh is not understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We demonstrate that ChCh acts to repress the response to Nodal-related signals in zebrafish. When ChCh function is abrogated the expression of mesodermal markers is enhanced while ectodermal markers are expressed at decreased levels. In cell transplant assays, we observed that ChCh-deficient cells are more motile than wild-type cells. When placed in wild-type hosts, ChCh-deficient cells often leave the epiblast, migrate to the germ ring and are later found in mesodermal structures. We demonstrate that both movement of ChCh-compromised cells to the germ ring and acquisition of mesodermal character depend on the ability of the donor cells to respond to Nodal signals. Blocking Nodal signaling in the donor cells at the levels of Oep, Alk receptors or Fast1 inhibited migration to the germ ring and mesodermal fate change in the donor cells. We also detect additional unusual movements of transplanted ChCh-deficient cells which suggests that movement and acquisition of mesodermal character can be uncoupled. Finally, we demonstrate that ChCh is required to limit the transcriptional response to Nodal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data establish a broad role for ChCh in regulating both cell movement and Nodal signaling during early zebrafish development. We show that <italic>chch </italic>is required to limit mesodermal gene expression, inhibit Nodal-dependant movement of presumptive ectodermal cells and repress the transcriptional response to Nodal signaling. These findings reveal a dynamic role for <italic>chch </italic>in regulating cell movement and fate during early development.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The establishment of the vertebrate body plan depends on a carefully orchestrated series of position-dependent cell interactions that determine the nature and proportion of cells that will populate each of the three germ layers. The movement of cells or their resistance to move, influences the inductive signals they will encounter. These signals initiate developmental programs that generate various differentiated cell types.</p><p>The series of dynamic cell movements during gastrulation positions cells to receive signals that will direct them to a given fate. In zebrafish, these movements include epiboly, internalization and convergence and extension movements. Epiboly is the process of spreading and thinning of the embryo during blastula and gastrula stages. Mesendodermal precursor cells are located at the margin in a thickened region termed the germ ring. These precursors are internalized resulting in the formation of an outer epiblast layer and inner hypoblast layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>As the germ layers are specified, there is an antagonistic relationship between mesoderm and neural induction. Expansion of the mesoderm comes at the expense of the ectoderm; conversely, repression of mesoderm results in an expansion of the ectoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. FGF signaling has critical roles in specification and patterning of the mesoderm and neural ectoderm in mice, frogs, fish and the chick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In many species, neural and mesoderm induction occur at similar times and in adjacent cell populations. How can FGF function in the seemingly contradictory roles as an inducer of mesoderm and neural tissue? One possibility is that different FGF effectors are present in the mesoderm and ectoderm to regulate its activity. One candidate FGF effector is the zinc finger transcription factor Churchill (<italic>chch</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p><italic>chch </italic>overexpression in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos results in suppression of the mesodermal marker <italic>brachyury </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Morpholino knockdown of <italic>chch </italic>in the chick epiblast results in inappropriate migration of epiblast cells through the primitive streak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. <italic>chch </italic>morpholino-injected cells emerged from the primitive streak and gave rise to paraxial mesoderm. This suggests that <italic>chch </italic>is required to limit ingression of the epiblast allowing those cells to become neural tissue. In addition, the chick experiments implicate Smad-interacting protein-1 (Sip1) as a direct target of <italic>chch </italic>and suggest that Sip1 is the major <italic>chch </italic>effector involved in blocking ingression of the epiblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Although the effect of <italic>chch </italic>in the assays in the frog and chick is the same (to limit mesoderm), the mechanisms of action in these two experiments likely differ. One difference is that cell movement is not thought to be required for mesoderm induction in the animal cap assay. The chick experiments do not address the question of whether the migration of <italic>chch</italic>-inhibited epiblast cells exposes them to mesoderm-inducing signals or whether they migrate because they have already acquired mesodermal properties. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of action of <italic>chch</italic>, we have undertaken a series of experiments to study the requirement for <italic>chch </italic>in the zebrafish and to address the roles of <italic>chch </italic>in cell migration and cell fate.</p><p>Here, we show that <italic>chch </italic>is required to limit mesodermal gene expression in zebrafish. During gastrulation, inhibition of <italic>chch </italic>results in an increase in transcript levels of mesodermal genes and a decrease in levels of ectodermal transcripts. In cell transplant experiments, cells with compromised <italic>chch </italic>activity are more motile than wild-type cells when transplanted to the epiblast of wild-type hosts. These cells leave the epiblast and migrate into the germ ring to acquire mesodermal cell fates. We found that both migration of <italic>chch</italic>-compromised donor cells and acquisition of mesodermal character depend on Nodal signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that <italic>chch </italic>is required to repress the transcriptional response to Nodal signaling. Together, these findings demonstrate that <italic>chch </italic>regulates cell fate by limiting the response to Nodal signals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>chch inhibition produces axial and somite defects</title><p>Zebrafish <italic>chch </italic>sequence was previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] but the zebrafish <italic>chch </italic>has not been further characterized. We have determined that like in the chick, zebrafish <italic>chch </italic>is regulated by FGF signaling, but unlike in the chick expression is widespread and not limited to the prospective neural plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To examine the function of <italic>chch </italic>in zebrafish, we inhibited <italic>chch </italic>activity with a morpholino directed against the translation start site and a dominant-negative mRNA. Microinjection of <italic>chch</italic>-ATGMO produces embryos with enlarged and misshapen somites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In addition, these embryos have a short body axis and poorly formed anterior neural structures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>chch </italic>inhibition results in axial and somite defects</bold>. The effect of inhibiting <italic>chch </italic>was examined using a morpholino and a dominant-negative construct. Microinjection of <italic>chch</italic>-ATGMO results in a broad, misshapen notochord (arrow) and misshapen somites and a shortened axis (B). Microinjection of <italic>chch</italic>-EnR, results in a similar phenotype as the morpholino, a broad, misshapen notochord, and enlarged and misshapen somites formed (C). <italic>chch </italic>mRNA overexpression produces embryos that are wild-type in appearance (D).

Microinjection of <italic>chch</italic>-EnR mRNA pronounced a similar phenotype to the morpholino; highly disorganized somites, a wide notochord and short axis were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that <italic>chch </italic>is essential for proper formation of the body axis and suggest that chch deficiency may result in convergence extension defects.</p></sec><sec><title>chch is not required for expression of dorsal mesodermal markers</title><p>To determine if the axial defects observed in <italic>chch </italic>compromised embryos stems from dorsal mesodermal defects, we examined dorsal mesodermal markers during early gastrulation by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and real-time PCR following microinjection of <italic>chch</italic>-EnR mRNA. At this stage, both chordin (<italic>chd</italic>) and floating head (<italic>flh</italic>) are expressed within the dorsal mesoderm. Following microinjection of <italic>chch</italic>-EnR mRNA, neither marker showed altered expression by RNA <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;D</xref>) or real-time PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O</xref>). Other organizer-specific markers such as noggin and goosecoid were also examined (data not shown) and did not show a change in expression. Similarly, microinjection of <italic>chch</italic>-ATGMO did not produce changes in <italic>chd </italic>or <italic>flh </italic>expression by either <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization or real-time PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O</xref> and data not shown). These data suggests that repressing <italic>chch </italic>function does not alter initial specification of dorsal mesoderm but acts on subsequent steps in axial patterning or morphogenesis.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>chch </italic>represses mesodermal markers</bold>. Mesodermal markers were examined by RNA <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and real-time PCR in embryos microinjected with <italic>chch</italic>-EnR mRNA. Inhibition of <italic>chch </italic>does not alter expression of dorsal mesodermal genes <italic>chd </italic>(A, B) or <italic>flh </italic>(C, D).

Overexpression of <italic>chch </italic>mRNA does not alter <italic>no-tail </italic>expression at shield stage (I-J). <italic>chch </italic>inhibition results in a decrease in Sip1 gene expression at bud stage (M-N), while <italic>chch </italic>activation results in Sip1 induction at shield stage (K-L).

The fold change in transcript levels (y-axis) is graphed relative to control embryos following overexpression of <italic>chch</italic>-EnR mRNA, <italic>chch</italic>-ATGMO and <italic>chch </italic>mRNA. This analysis reveals that the domains of mesodermal genes are expanded at shield stage while dorsal mesodermal genes are unaffected. Conversely, overexpression of <italic>chch </italic>mRNA does not result in alteration of early mesodermal gene expression.

All of these markers showed significant increases in transcript levels at shield stage following microinjection of <italic>chch</italic>-EnR mRNA. When assayed by quantitative real-time PCR the mesodermal markers showed increases corresponding to as much as a to a 2&#x02013;2.25-fold increase in transcript levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O</xref>). The spatial alterations in gene expression were more subtle, as mesodermal markers showed slightly more robust expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E&#x02013;H</xref> and data not shown). Surprisingly, overexpression of <italic>chch </italic>mRNA did not alter mesodermal marker expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I&#x02013;J, O</xref>). Similarly, <italic>chch </italic>inhibition with the morpholino did not alter the spatial expression of mesodermal markers (data not shown) but slight increases in <italic>ntl </italic>and <italic>spt </italic>gene expression were observed by real-time PCR (1.5 and 1.25-fold increases respectively, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O</xref>). Importantly, co-expression of <italic>chch</italic>-ATGMO along with <italic>chch </italic>mRNA that had been mutated to prevent morpholino binding rescued the increases in mesodermal gene expression seen following <italic>chch </italic>inhibition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2P</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that <italic>chch </italic>is required to limit mesodermal gene expression. However, unlike in <italic>Xenopus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], ectopic <italic>chch </italic>is insufficient to repress <italic>ntl</italic>/<italic>brachyury </italic>expression.</p><p>Smad-interacting protein 1 (Sip1) is a direct target of <italic>chch </italic>in the chick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and a direct repressor of <italic>Xenopus brachyury </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, we asked whether the inability of ectopic zebrafish <italic>chch </italic>to repress <italic>ntl </italic>stemmed from a failure to induce Sip1 expression. We examined Sip1 expression by real-time PCR with primers generated from the Sip1 genomic locus (Ensembl gene Id: ENSDARG00000059564) and by RNA <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization with a cDNA probe generated with primers designed from that locus. Overexpression of <italic>chch </italic>mRNA results in large increases in Sip1 transcript levels when examined by RNA <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2L</xref>) and real-time PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2Q</xref>). Conversely, inhibition of <italic>chch </italic>with either the dominant-negative construct (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2Q</xref>) or the morpholino(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2Q</xref>) results in a decrease in Sip1 expression in the same assays. Together, these results reveal that zebrafish Sip1 is regulated by <italic>chch</italic>. Therefore, despite robust induction of Sip1, overexpression of zebrafish <italic>chch </italic>is not sufficient to alter <italic>ntl </italic>expression.</p><p>We next assayed whether the increase in mesodermal gene expression following <italic>chch </italic>inhibition came at the expense of other germ layers. By late gastrulation, mesodermal markers in <italic>chch</italic>-inhibited embryos show a 50&#x02013;75% increase compared to control embryos when assayed by real-time PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Conversely, the endodermal markers, <italic>mixer </italic>and <italic>sox17</italic>, do not show altered mRNA levels at late gastrulation following inhibition of <italic>chch </italic>activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This contrasts ectodermal gene expression at late gastrulation. By RNA <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization, the expression domains of the neural gene <italic>otx2 </italic>were not obviously altered (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C&#x02013;D</xref>) by late-gastrulation. However, real-time PCR analysis revealed that mRNA levels of both neural and epidermal markers were consistently decreased in <italic>chch </italic>morphants and <italic>chch</italic>-EnR treated embryos. The anterior neural marker <italic>otx2</italic>, the posterior neural marker <italic>hoxb1b</italic>, the pan-neural marker <italic>sox3 </italic>and the epidermal markers <italic>krt8 </italic>and <italic>gata2 </italic>all showed decreased transcript levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).

In a few embryos, ctMO-donor cells were found in the superficial cell layers in 3/42 embryos (7.1%, table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) or in both neural tissue and superficial cell layers of the trunk 7/52 embryos (13.5%, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). <italic>chch </italic>morphant donor cells behaved differently (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). When transplanted to the animal pole of a wild-type host, 44/72 embryos (61.1%), <italic>chch </italic>morphant donor cells were observed in anterior neural structures. In the remaining embryos, the cells were spread over superficial layers of the trunk in 15/72 embryos (20.8%) or in both neural tissue and superficial cell layers of the trunk in 12/72 embryos (16.7%, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Importantly, the movement phenotype produced by the <italic>chch</italic>-ATGMO could be rescued by co-injection with <italic>chch </italic>mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4J&#x02013;M</xref>).

transplanted into the animal hemisphere of late-blastula embryos, donor cells remained within the ectoderm in 77/79 hosts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B&#x02013;D</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Cells with compromised <italic>chch </italic>function behaved dramatically different in this assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E&#x02013;G</xref>). In 44/110 (40.0%) transplants, <italic>chch</italic>-EnR donor cells migrated from the epiblast to the germ ring by shield stage (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). The effects of the <italic>chch</italic>-ATGMO were less pronounced but in 8/51 (15.7%) transplants, morphant cells migrated from the epiblast to the germ ring (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5K&#x02013;M</xref>). Cells from donor embryos that had been co-injected with <italic>chch</italic>-EnR mRNA and <italic>chch </italic>mRNA tended to remain in the animal hemisphere (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H&#x02013;J</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In these transplants in only 5/38 (13.2%) hosts, was migration of donor cells to the germ ring observed. This demonstrates that the migration of <italic>chch </italic>deficient donor cells can be rescued with <italic>chch </italic>mRNA and indicates that the defect stems from knockdown of <italic>chch </italic>function.</p><p>To determine whether movement of <italic>chch</italic>-compromised cells to the germ ring correlated with a fate change in these cells, we determined their locations at 24 hpf. Of the <italic>chch</italic>-EnR donor cells that migrated to the germ ring, 38/44 were found in mesodermal structures at 24 hpf. Likewise, 8/8 <italic>chch </italic>morphant donor cells that migrated to the germ ring were later found in mesodermal structures. This demonstrates that <italic>chch </italic>compromised cells transplanted distant from the margin at 30% epiboly generated mesoderm while LacZ donor cells did not. In 6/44 transplants, <italic>chch</italic>-EnR donor cells migrated to the germ ring but did not give rise to mesoderm. This suggests that movement of these cells may not entirely be linked to acquisition of mesodermal character.</p><p>The location of the <italic>chch </italic>compromised donor cells after 24 hpf was often not characteristic of their position at shield stage. The <italic>chch</italic>-EnR cells that migrated out of the ectoderm and into the germ ring also acquired unexpected fates and were found in surprising locations. Cells located in the ventral germ ring would be expected give rise to posterior somites. Instead, these cells were found in more anterior somites (first 15 somites, 10/14 embryos) or were observed in the ectoderm (2/14 embryos) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Cells located lateral to the shield would be expected to assume anterior somite fates. While a majority of these cells did give rise to anterior somites (12/20 embryos), cells were also located within the notochord (4/20 embryos) and neural tissue (2/20 embryos) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Together, these results suggest that inhibiting <italic>chch </italic>results in several kinds of inappropriate cell movements including movement of presumptive ectodermal cells into the germ ring.</p></sec><sec><title>Migration and fate change of chch compromised cells requires Nodal signaling</title><p>Our initial transplant experiments do not reveal whether the fate changes observed in <italic>chch</italic>-compromised donor cells result from a failure to limit cell movement or whether a fate change precedes the improper movement. Three models could account for the movement of <italic>chch</italic>-compromised donor cells to the germ ring and subsequent acquisition of mesodermal character that we observed: 1) <italic>chch</italic>-compromised donor cells may autonomously express mesodermal markers which drives both movement and acquisition of mesodermal character; 2) inappropriate movement of <italic>chch</italic>-compromised donor cells to the margin may result in exposure of donor cells to mesoderm inducing signals; or 3) <italic>chch</italic>-compromised donor cells may exhibit increased sensitivity to non-autonomous signals that drive migration and/or acquisition of mesodermal character. Since induction of trunk mesoderm requires Nodal signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], we reasoned that blocking Nodal signaling after transplantation of <italic>chch</italic>-compromised cells would allow these models to be distinguished. If the first model is correct, migration of <italic>chch </italic>compromised cells and fate change will occur regardless of the state of Nodal signaling. If inappropriate movement allows <italic>chch </italic>compromised donor cells to come under the influence of the high levels of Nodal ligands present in the germ ring (model 2), we would observe migration of donor cells, but these cells would be unable to respond to mesoderm inducing signals. If the third model is correct, both migration and acquisition of mesodermal character will be blocked in <italic>chch</italic>-compromised donor cells when Nodal signaling is abrogated.</p><p>To test these hypotheses, cell transplantation experiments were performed with <italic>chch</italic>-EnR donor cells placed into the animal hemisphere of wild-type hosts. We used <italic>chch</italic>-EnR donors instead of <italic>chch </italic>morphant donors because these cells had a greater tendency to migrate from the epiblast to the germ ring (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Both donors and hosts were maintained in SB431542 to block Nodal signaling prior to transplantation and returned to SB431542 containing media following transplantation. SB431542 inhibits Alk4, Alk5 and Alk7 kinase activity, and it has been shown to phenocopy Nodal pathway mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>As expected, LacZ expressing cells transplanted from the animal hemisphere of a sphere stage (4 hpf) embryo to the animal hemisphere of a wild-type host at a late blastula stage (4.7 hpf) remained in the animal hemisphere (22/22 embryos) and by 1 dpf were observed in anterior neural tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A&#x02013;A'</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). Treatment with SB431542 did not alter the behavior of these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B&#x02013;B'</xref>). Conversely, in the same transplant scheme, <italic>chch</italic>-inhibited cells often migrated to the germ ring and became incorporated into mesodermal structures at 1 dpf (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C&#x02013;C'</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). Surprisingly, when Nodal signaling was blocked, <italic>chch</italic>-EnR donor cells remained in the animal hemisphere (32/32 embryos) and were observed in anterior neural structures at 1 dpf (24/32 hosts, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D&#x02013;D'</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). In the remaining 8/32 cases, donor cells were scattered in superficial layers of the yolk (likely epidermis). The behavior of this subset of cells differs from LacZ donors and non-SB431542 treated <italic>chch</italic>-EnR donors and may stem from an incomplete block of Nodal signaling. These findings demonstrate that signaling via Alk receptors is required for both migration to the germ ring and acquisition of mesodermal character of the <italic>chch</italic>-EnR donor cells. Since SB431542 treatment blocked Alk signaling in both donor and host cells, we could not infer which cells required Alk-mediated signaling from these experiments.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Alk receptor signaling is required for both migration and acquisition of mesodermal character of <italic>chch</italic>-EnR transplanted cells.

This result suggests that xFast1-EnR prevents <italic>chch</italic>-EnR cells from adopting mesodermal fates. However, some <italic>chch</italic>-EnR/xFast1-EnR co-injected donor cells behave differently than the LacZ donors and are found spread across the yolk at 1 dpf. These donor cells likely retain some responses to Nodal since some Nodal signaling events are independent of xFast1 and are instead mediated by Mixer-related molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Since <italic>chch</italic>-compromised cells fail to migrate to the germ ring and to assume mesodermal fates if Alk, Oep or Fast1 function is abrogated, we conclude that both migration and fate change depends on Nodal signaling.

All of these markers show no change or modest changes in embryos injected with <italic>chch</italic>-EnR mRNA and a dose-dependent response to <italic>sqt </italic>mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A&#x02013;E</xref>). Synergistic increases were observed when both <italic>chch</italic>-EnR mRNA and <italic>sqt </italic>mRNA were co-injected. For example, microinjection of 2.5 pg of <italic>sqt </italic>mRNA resulted in a 3.5 fold increase in <italic>chd </italic>mRNA levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). When <italic>chch</italic>-EnR mRNA was coinjected with 2.5 pg of <italic>sqt</italic>, a greater than 7-fold increase in <italic>chd </italic>mRNA levels were measured.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold><italic>chch </italic>suppresses the transcriptional response to Nodal signaling</bold>.

Our data showed that <italic>chch </italic>is required to repress expression of markers of non-axial mesoderm, while both neural and presumptive epidermal markers are diminished in <italic>chch</italic>-compromised embryos. In transplant assays, cells with compromised <italic>chch </italic>function undergo atypical cell movements when placed in the animal hemisphere and acquire fates inappropriate for their position in the early gastrula. Unlike control cells, these donor cells often migrate to the margin and are later observed in mesodermal derivatives. The movement and corresponding fate change of the transplanted <italic>chch </italic>compromised cells can be suppressed by blocking Nodal signaling in the donor cells. Finally, we demonstrate that <italic>chch </italic>suppresses the transcriptional response to Nodal signaling.</p><sec><title>chch limits expression of mesodermal markers</title><p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, <italic>chch </italic>overexpression is sufficient to repress <italic>Xbra </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our data demonstrate that when <italic>chch </italic>function is repressed, mesodermal gene expression is expanded during gastrulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and the expansion corresponds to a decrease in the levels of ectodermal markers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The effects on ectoderm are relatively modest during gastrulation but at later stages anterior neural defects were observed.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>Xenopus</italic>, we did not detect repression of <italic>ntl </italic>(<italic>brachyur</italic>y) when <italic>chch </italic>is overexpressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I&#x02013;J</xref>). Since the concentration of <italic>chch </italic>mRNA used in the overexpression experiments was sufficient to rescue both the morpholino and dominant-negative phenotypes, these levels are likely physiologically relevant. Overexpression of higher doses of <italic>chch </italic>mRNA failed to alter early <italic>ntl </italic>expression (data not shown). However, we do observe repression of <italic>ntl </italic>following microinjection of <italic>chch</italic>-VP16 mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The different effects of <italic>chch </italic>overexpression on <italic>brachyury </italic>expression may reflect experimental differences or divergence in regulation of <italic>brachyury </italic>between fish and frogs. One possibility is that an essential <italic>chch </italic>or Sip1 cofactor is widely expressed in <italic>Xenopus </italic>but has restricted expression in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec><title>chch regulates cell movement</title><p>We show that cells with compromised <italic>chch </italic>function undergo inappropriate cell movements. When placed into a wild-type embryo at a late blastula stage, these cells often leave the epiblast, migrate to the germ ring and become mesoderm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This result is consistent with the <italic>chch </italic>study in the chick, where <italic>chch </italic>was shown to be required to repress ingression of epiblast cells into the primitive streak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These data suggest an evolutionarily conserved function for <italic>chch </italic>in the regulation of cell movement during gastrulation.</p><p>A key question is whether the <italic>chch </italic>compromised cells that leave the epiblast and enter the germ ring, become mesoderm because <italic>chch </italic>regulates migration and they are subsequently exposed to mesoderm-inducing signals in the germ ring or whether they migrate to the germ ring because they have already established mesodermal identity; is movement directing fate or is fate controlling movement?</p><p>The transplant experiments in which we manipulated the responsiveness of the donor cells to Nodal signaling revealed that <italic>chch</italic>-EnR cells do not autonomously become mesoderm but require activation of the Nodal pathway to migrate to the germ ring and adopt mesodermal fates. When Nodal signaling is blocked, <italic>chch</italic>-compromised cells fail to migrate to the germ ring and do not assume mesodermal fates (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Analysis of zebrafish Nodal mutants has shown that Nodal signaling is required for internalization of mesodermal precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our results suggest that Nodal may also play a role in cell movement toward the margin prior to internalization. The Nodal family member responsible for this activity has not been established, although Sqt is a strong candidate because it is expressed at these stages and has been shown to act as a long-range signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Alternatively, the movement of <italic>chch</italic>-compromised donor cells may be influenced by another Nodal family member, perhaps Vg1 which is also expressed early and requires Oep function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>It is important to note that not all cells that underwent unusual movements ended up in the mesoderm. This implies that movement can be uncoupled from acquisition of mesodermal character. Since not all of the donor cells showed the same movements, the differences may have resulted in variations in the initial positions of cells or subtle differences in <italic>chch </italic>activity in the donor cells. In addition to an enhanced responsiveness to Nodal signals, <italic>chch</italic>-compromised cells might also be sensitive to other TGF-&#x003b2; signals including BMPs, which could account for alterations in cell behavior. More detailed analysis of the behavior of <italic>chch</italic>-deficient cells will be necessary to determine additional roles for <italic>chch </italic>in regulating cell movements during gastrulation.</p></sec><sec><title>chch represses the transcriptional response to Nodal</title><p>We found that the transcriptional response to the Nodal ligand <italic>sqt </italic>is enhanced in embryos expressing <italic>chch</italic>-EnR mRNA. The mRNA levels of five Nodal target genes were synergistically increased when <italic>sqt </italic>and <italic>chch</italic>-EnR mRNA where co-injected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Three of these targets, <italic>chd</italic>, <italic>fh </italic>and <italic>gsc </italic>are expressed in the dorsal mesoderm. The fourth, <italic>mixer</italic>, is an endodermal marker. However, in contrast to pan-mesodermal markers like <italic>ntl </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) and <italic>spt </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), the transcript levels of these markers were largely unaltered by <italic>chch</italic>-EnR mRNA or <italic>chch</italic>-ATGMO microinjection. This suggests that endogenous <italic>chch </italic>does not play a role in suppressing the high levels of Nodal signaling that are required for specification of dorsal mesoderm and endoderm but represses the response to lower Nodal levels.</p><p>Our data suggests that the increased expression of mesodermal markers observed when <italic>chch </italic>is repressed results from an enhanced response to Nodal. Microinjection of morpholinos directed against the extracellular Nodal antagonist, Lefty, also result in expansion of mesodermal markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The <italic>chch </italic>target Sip1 likely mediates the effect of <italic>chch </italic>on Nodal signaling. Sip1 has not been previously characterized in zebrafish, although we established that zebrafish Sip1 is regulated by <italic>chch </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K&#x02013;N, Q</xref>). Sip1 represses TGF-&#x003b2; signaling by binding to activated forms of Smad1/5 and Smad2/3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and is a direct repressor of <italic>Xbra </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The decrease in Sip1 expression following <italic>chch </italic>inhibition could result in a failure to check Nodal signaling, which results in mesoderm expansion. However, Sip1 morpholinos do not alter Xbra expression in <italic>Xenopus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The increase in mesodermal gene expression we observe in <italic>chch</italic>-compromised embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) is consistent with an enhanced sensitivity to TGF-&#x003b2; signals. In addition to suppressing <italic>Xbra </italic>and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, Sip1 is also a direct repressor of <italic>E-Cadherin </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. While migration of <italic>chch</italic>-compromised cells to the germ ring depends on Nodal signaling, alterations in <italic>E-cadherin </italic>levels may also influence the unusual movements of these cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study of the zinc finger transcription regulator, <italic>chch</italic>, is the first analysis of the function of this gene in zebrafish. We have discovered roles for <italic>chch </italic>in regulating cell movements within the gastrula that are consistent with the initial data on <italic>chch </italic>in the chick and <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Significantly, we have identified several novel functions for <italic>chch</italic>. Our data suggests a broader role for <italic>chch </italic>then was previously demonstrated and provides key insight into the mechanism of action of <italic>chch</italic>. From this analysis we conclude: (1) that <italic>chch </italic>is required to limit mesodermal gene expression; (2) <italic>chch </italic>inhibits Nodal-dependant movement of presumptive ectodermal cells (3) <italic>chch </italic>represses the transcriptional response to Nodal signaling.
