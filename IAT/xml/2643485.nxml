This disorder is mainly characterized by the degeneration of dopamine-containing neurons in the substrantia nigra. This brain section is therefore deprived of adequate amounts of the neurotransmitter dopamine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Foley1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Because dopamine is unable to access the brain directly, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), its natural precursor, is used in clinical treatment of patients with PD. Until now, L-DOPA remains the most effective drug for the symptomatic control of PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Dunnett1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-LeWitt1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. However, accumulated evidence shows that the therapeutic efficacy of L-DOPA is gradually lost over time, and abnormal involuntary movements, dyskinesias, gradually emerge as a prominent side effect of the previously beneficial doses of the drug <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Carta1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Fabbrini1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The precise molecular mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity caused by L-DOPA are not yet completely known. Available data suggest that L-DOPA might have the ability to significantly affect iron distribution in the brain. The changes in brain iron distribution induced by L-DOPA might be one of the causes of the neurotoxicity of L-DOPA. A clinical study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Boll1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that L-DOPA could significantly affect brain ceruloplasmin (CP), a major factor in the regulation of regional brain iron, and that L-DOPA-treated PD patients had a significantly higher CP than those who were not given L-DOPA. A pathological study of postmortem brain tissue showed that the levels of iron storage protein ferritin were significantly lower in several brain regions of PD patients treated with L-DOPA than those in the age-matched control patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Dexter1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In a recent study, we demonstrated that L-DOPA induces a significant increase in the expression of divalent metal transporter 1 without iron-response element (DMT1&#x02212;IRE), but not divalent metal transporter 1 with iron-response element (DMT1&#x0002b;IRE), TfR1 or Fpn1, and a remarkable increase in ferrous uptake in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Chang1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Based on these findings, plus the potential role of DMT1&#x02212;IRE in neuronal iron uptake and the implication of iron as a major generator of reactive oxygen species, we speculated that the upregulation of DMT1&#x02212;IRE might play a critical role in the development of L-DOPA neurotoxicity. L-DOPA might have a role to increase DMT1&#x02212;IRE expression, which in turn leads to a remarkable increase in DMT1&#x02212;IRE-mediated ferrous iron uptake by neurons. Consequently, the increased ferrous iron in neurons generates highly reactive hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction or Haber-Weiss reaction. In turn, these free radicals can damage the biological molecules of neurons, leading to the development of L-DOPA neurotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) and siRNA DMT&#x02212;IRE on L-DOPA neurotoxicity by observing the changes in morphology and Hoechst 33342 staining, measuring neuronal viability, neuronal iron content, expression of DMT1&#x02212;IRE, DMT1&#x0002b;IRE, TfR1 and Fpn1 proteins and ferrous iron uptake in cortical neurons in the present study. Our results provide solid evidence that the upregulation of DMT1&#x02212;IRE plays a key role in the development of L-DOPA neurotoxicity in vitro. The findings imply that inhibition of DMT1&#x02212;IRE expression or neuronal iron uptake might be an effective approach to prevent or delay the development of L-DOPA neurotoxicity in PD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Materials</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, USA.

In the present study, efforts were made to test this hypothesis. Based on several lines of solid evidence obtained from this study, we concluded that the L-DOPA-induced neurotoxicity is mediated by the upregulation of DMT1&#x02212;IRE expression in cortical neurons.</p><p>The first evidence comes from the investigation of the effects of L-DOPA on cortical neurons. Our data clearly demonstrated that treating neurons with different concentrations of L-DOPA induces not only a significant change in morphology or Hoechst-33342 staining but also a dose-dependent decrease in neuronal viability, confirming that L-DOPA can induce neurotoxicity in our experimental conditions. Meanwhile, the treatment also resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in iron content, ferrous iron uptake and DMT1&#x02212;IRE protein expression in cortical neurons. Furthermore, correlation analysis showed that the expression of DMT1&#x02212;IRE protein is significantly correlated with 55Fe uptake (positively) and neuronal viability (negatively) in cortical neurons treated with different concentrations of L-DOPA; respectively. These findings support a role of L-DOPA in the increased DMT1&#x02212;IRE expression as well as in the connection of the increased DMT1&#x02212;IRE with the increased neuron iron content. In addition, both western blot and immunocytochemistry analysis showed that L-DOPA didn't induce any changes in the expression of DMT1&#x0002b;IRE or Fpn1. A significant decrease in TfR1 expression, rather than an increase, was found in the neurons treated with L-DOPA. These results showed that the increase in neuronal iron content induced by L-DOPA is due to neither the decrease in Fpn1-mediated iron efflux nor the increase in DMT1&#x0002b;IRE or TfR1-mediated iron uptake. On the other hand, these results also provided further support that L-DOPA has a role to increase DMT1&#x02212;IRE expression and that the increased iron content in neurons induced by L-DOPA results from the increased DMT1&#x02212;IRE-mediated iron uptake.</p><p>The second evidence is obtained from the study on the effects of ACM on L-DOPA-induced neurotoxicity. It has been reported that astrocytes have a role in the reduction of neuronal cell death following a variety of cellular stresses, such as excitotoxicity and oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Dhandapani1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, it has been demonstrated that glia conditioned medium (GCM) protects fetal rat midbrain neurons in culture from L-DOPA toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Mena1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. We speculated that the neuroprotective role of GCM or ACM might be mediated by their ability to inhibit DMT1&#x02212;IRE expression as well as iron accumulation in neurons. Therefore, we investigated the effects of ACM on morphology, Hoechst 33342 staining, viability, neuron iron content and DMT1&#x02212;IRE expression in the neurons treated with L-DOPA by incubating neurons in ACM with or without different concentrations of L-DOPA for 16 hours. The results obtained on the morphology, Hoechst 33342 staining and neuronal viability clearly demonstrated that ACM significantly diminishes L-DOPA-induced neurotoxicity. No significant differences were found in morphology, Hoechst-33342 staining and viability between the neurons incubated in ACM in the presence and those incubated in ACM in the absence of the same concentrations of L-DOPA. At the same time, western blot analysis and iron staining showed that ACM significantly reduces DMT1&#x02212;IRE expression as well as neuron iron content. The similar tendencies of the effects of ACM on L-DOPA-induced neurotoxicity, DMT1&#x02212;IRE expression and neuron iron content implied that ACM protects neurons from L-DOPA by its ability to inhibit DMT1&#x02212;IRE expression and ferrous iron uptake.</p><p>The final piece of evidence is provided by the data on the effects of siRNA DMT&#x02212;IRE on L-DOPA neurotoxicity. According to the findings on DMT1&#x02212;IRE, L-DOPA neurotoxicity and the role of ACM, we expected that a decrease in DMT1&#x02212;IRE expression should also be able to lead to a decrease in L-DOPA neurotoxicity. Therefore, we infected the cortical neurons with siRNA DMT&#x02212;IRE to decrease DMT1&#x02212;IRE expression to see whether L-DOPA neurotoxicity was hence changed in these neurons. As we expected, western blot analysis revealed a significant decrease in the expression of DMT1&#x02212;IRE protein as well as iron content in the neurons infected with siRNA DMT&#x02212;IRE. The MTT assay demonstrated that the viabilities in the neurons infected with siRNA DMT&#x02212;IRE were significantly higher than those in the control neurons at all concentration points of L-DOPA we examined. The findings showed that the decreased expression of DMT1&#x02212;IRE induced by siRNA DMT&#x02212;IRE can decrease neuronal iron accumulation and also L-DOPA neurotoxicity. These further confirmed that DMT1&#x02212;IRE upregulation and the increased DMT1&#x02212;IRE mediated iron influx play a key role in the development of L-DOPA neurotoxicity in primary neurons.</p><p>DMT1 (DCT1 or NRAMP2), a widely expressed membrane protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Fleming1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Gunshin1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, is responsible for the uptake of a broad range of divalent metal ions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Fleming1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Tandy1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

The functions of DMT1&#x0002b;IRE and DMT1&#x02212;IRE have not been completely understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Picard1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. However, available data support the notion that DMT1&#x02212;IRE, rather than DMT1&#x0002b;IRE, is the entity responsible for the transmembrane transport of iron released from transferrin to the early endosomal lumen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Chang1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Touret1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent studies also inferred that DMT1&#x02212;IRE is predominantly found in three compartments: the plasma membrane, early/recycling endosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004593-Touret1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, we found that treatment of neurons with different concentrations of L-DOPA also resulted in a significantly dose-dependent increase in iron content, ferrous iron uptake and the expression of DMT1&#x02212;IRE protein in cortical neurons. It was also found that there is a significant correlational relationship between the expression of DMT1&#x02212;IRE protein and 55Fe uptake (positively) in cortical neurons treated with different concentrations of L-DOPA. These findings provide further support to the notion that DMT1&#x02212;IRE, rather than DMT1&#x0002b;IRE, is the entity responsible for iron transmembrane transport as well as the role of DMT1&#x02212;IRE upregulation in L-DOPA neurotoxicity.</p><p>In summary, in the present study we provided solid evidence for the first time for the association of DMT1&#x02212;IRE with neurotoxicity induced by L-DOPA. We concluded that upregulation of DMT1&#x02212;IRE and then the increased DMT1&#x02212;IRE mediated iron influx play a critical role in L-DOPA neurotoxicity in primary cortical neurons. We also demonstrated for the first time that ACM's protection of cortical neurons from L-DOPA is at least partly due to its ability to inhibit DMT1&#x02212;IRE expression and ferrous iron uptake and its antioxidative activity which might be due to the antioxidants supplied by astrocytes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thanks Mr. Ge XH for his technical assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0004593-Jankovic1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jankovic</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Stacy</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><year>2007</year><article-title>Medical management of levodopa-associated motor complications in patients with Parkinson's disease.</article-title><source>CNS Drugs</source><volume>21(8)</volume><fpage>677</fpage><lpage>692</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17630819</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="pone.0004593-Foley1"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Foley</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><year>2000</year><article-title>The L-DOPA story revisited.
