Upon SAC activation, Mad1p is recruited onto kinetochores and rapidly cycles between NPCs and kinetochores. We examined the mechanism of Mad1p movement onto kinetochores and show that it is controlled by two components of the nuclear transport machinery, the exportin Xpo1p and Ran&#x02013;guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Mad1p contains a nuclear export signal (NES) that is recognized by Xpo1p. The NES, Xpo1p, and RanGTP are all required for Mad1p recruitment onto kinetochores in checkpoint-activated cells. Consistent with this function, Xpo1p also accumulates on kinetochores after SAC activation. We have also shown that Xpo1p and RanGTP are required for the dynamic cycling of Mad1p between NPCs and kinetochores in checkpoint-arrested cells. These results reveal an important function for Xpo1p in mediating intranuclear transport events and identify a signaling pathway between kinetochores and NPCs.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: ChIP, chromatin IP; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; IP, immunoprecipitation; kap, karyopherin; LMB, leptomycin B; NES, nuclear export signal; NPC, nuclear pore complex; PKI, protein kinase inhibitor; SAC, spindle assembly checkpoint; SM, synthetic media; Ts, temperature sensitive; WT, wild type.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) control macromolecular movement across the nuclear envelope. The gateways formed by NPCs selectively allow soluble nuclear transport factors (many referred to as karyopherins [kaps] or importins and exportins) and their cargoes to partition across the nuclear envelope (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hetzer et al., 2005</xref>). Importins bind to cargoes containing NLSs, whereas exportins bind to nuclear export signals (NESs). A characteristic structural feature of kaps is a domain capable of binding RanGTP. Ran (Gsp1p in yeast) is primarily found in the nucleus, where the chromatin-bound Ran&#x02013;guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF; Rcc1 in vertebrates and Prp20p in yeast) maintains it in a GTP-bound form. For importins, RanGTP binding induces conformational changes in the kaps that release cargoes in the nucleoplasm. Conversely, RanGTP binding to exportins increases their affinity for NES-containing cargoes. The resulting trimeric complex is stable until exported into the cytoplasm, where it encounters a second Ran effector, Ran&#x02013;GTPase-activating protein (GAP) (RanGAP1 in vertebrates and Rna1p in yeast), which binds RanGTP and stimulates its GTPase activity. Conversion to RanGDP destabilizes the export complex and allows cargo release.</p><p>In addition to their roles in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, various elements of the transport machinery have been implicated in mitotic events, with most of this work conducted in vertebrate model systems. For example, the vertebrate Nup107&#x02013;160 subcomplex is recruited to kinetochores during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loiodice et al., 2004</xref>), where it may function in kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zuccolo et al., 2007</xref>). These Nups may also function as a binding site at kinetochores for the exportin Crm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zuccolo et al., 2007</xref>). During mitosis, Crm1 associates with kinetochores and together with RanGTP targets RanGAP1 and Nup358/RanBP2 to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnaoutov et al., 2005</xref>). Disrupting these events results in both microtubule&#x02013;kinetochore attachment defects and errors in chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnaoutov et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The concentration of vertebrate RanGAP1 at mitotic kinetochores suggests that the conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP predominates at kinetochores. What role this plays in kinetochore function is unclear. Interestingly, adjacent to kinetochores, RanGEF is concentrated on condensed chromosomes, and RanGTP predominates near these structures. One function of this RanGTP cloud is to activate spindle assembly factors (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalab and Heald, 2008</xref>). These observations represent a growing number of results linking Ran and Ran-binding proteins, including kaps in spindle, centrosome, and kinetochore structure and function.</p><p>A less well-understood observation is the sequestration of two spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins, Mad1 and Mad2, at NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iouk et al., 2002</xref>). These proteins reside at NPC in interphase and are recruited to kinetochores before spindle attachment. Here, they function to transduce a metaphase arrest signal from unattached kinetochores by producing a soluble complex containing Mad2 that is capable of binding Cdc20 and inhibiting its activation of the anaphase-promoting complex until all kinetochores are engaged by spindle microtubules (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). Why Mad1 and Mad2 associate with NPC has remained an enigma. A study of yeast Mad1p and Mad2p has shown that in checkpoint-arrested cells, the majority of Mad1p (&#x0003e;60%) rapidly cycles between kinetochores and NPCs by a mechanism that is energy dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scott et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, we show that the exportin Xpo1p together with RanGTP functions in an intranuclear-targeting event that directs Mad1p and Xpo1p to unattached kinetochores upon SAC activation. Moreover, Xpo1p, RanGTP, and the conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP are required for the cycling of Mad1p between NPC-binding sites and kinetochores in SAC-activated cells. These results have revealed a role for exportins in intranuclear targeting events and their regulation by the SAC machinery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Monitoring Mad1p movement between NPCs and kinetochores</title><p>Yeast Mad1p is bound to NPCs throughout the cell cycle; however, after activation of SAC, a pool of Mad1p is visible at unattached kinetochores until termination of the checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iouk et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gillett et al., 2004</xref>). The association of Mad1p with the NPC is dependent on Nup60p and two proteins, Mlp1p and Mlp2p, that form fibers extending from the nucleoplasmic face of NPC. Removal of Nup60p (<italic>nup60&#x00394;</italic>) releases Mlp1p and Mlp2p from NPC, leading to their concentration in a single intranuclear focus that retains Mad1p binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feuerbach et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scott et al., 2005</xref>). This focus can be clearly distinguished from kinetochores, allowing visualization of Mad1p movement from its NPC-binding sites to kinetochores after nocodazole-induced disruption of microtubules and activation of the SAC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1 A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scott et al., 2005</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Mad1p contains a functional Xpo1p-dependent NES.</bold> (A) Mad1-GFP was visualized by fluorescence microscopy in WT (Y3028, i) or <italic>nup60&#x00394;</italic> cells (Y3040, ii and iii; Y3057, iv).

We also detected a potential NES within residues 563&#x02013;576 that aligned with the NESs of HIV Rev and protein kinase inhibitor (PKI). The Mad1p NES contains critical leucine residues and adjacent charged residues, suggesting that this region lies at the surface of Mad1p (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). To test the functionality of the putative NES, we used a competition assay in which NES and an NLS are fused to three tandemly repeated GFP molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stade et al., 1997</xref>). If both signals are functional, the fusion equilibrates between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. Inactivation of the cognate importin or exportin results in a redistribution of the reporter to the cytoplasm or nucleus as a result of the continued activity of the unaffected kap. To test whether Mad1<sup>563&#x02013;576</sup> functions as an NES, we constructed an SV40-NLS/Mad1<sup>563&#x02013;576</sup>-GFP<sub>3</sub> fusion and examined its localization in an <italic>xpo1-T539C</italic> mutant. The mutant protein functioned like wild-type (WT) Xpo1p but was sensitive to the fungal toxin leptomycin B (LMB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neville and Rosbash, 1999</xref>). A control reporter, SV40-NLS/PKI-NES-GFP<sub>3</sub>, and the SV40-NLS/Mad1<sup>563&#x02013;576</sup>-GFP<sub>3</sub> chimera were visible throughout the cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, top left). Upon addition of LMB to cells, both reporters accumulated in the nucleus, suggesting that Xpo1p recognizes Mad1<sup>563&#x02013;576</sup> as an NES (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Blocking Xpo1p function using an <italic>xpo1-1</italic> temperature-sensitive (Ts) mutant yielded similar results (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, 37&#x000b0;C). Of note, we also observed that the <italic>xpo1-1</italic> mutation caused a decrease in NPC-associated Mad1p (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804098/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804098/DC1</ext-link>). We conclude from these data that Mad1p contains an Xpo1p-specific NES that contributes to its NPC localization.</p></sec><sec><title>SAC-induced accumulation of Mad1p to kinetochores is dependent on Xpo1p</title><p>We further examined whether kaps play a role in the association of Mad1p with kinetochores during SAC arrest. Mutations in <italic>KAP95</italic> (<italic>kap95-14</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leslie et al., 2002</xref>), <italic>MSN5</italic> (<italic>msn5&#x00394;</italic>), or <italic>XPO1</italic> (<italic>xpo1-T539C</italic>) were introduced into a <italic>nup60&#x00394;</italic> strain, and the localization of Mad1-GFP was examined after nocodazole-induced activation of the SAC. Mad1-GFP targeting to kinetochores was unaffected by the <italic>msn5&#x00394;</italic> or <italic>kap95-14</italic> mutation and appeared similar to that seen in WT cells. In contrast, LMB inactivation of <italic>xpo1-T539C</italic> prevented Mad1-GFP accumulation at kinetochores (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). These results implicated Xpo1p in the targeting of Mad1p to kinetochores. However, LMB did not affect the localization of the kinetochore protein Mtw1p or the SAC protein Bub1p (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804098/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804098/DC1</ext-link>), suggesting that Xpo1p is not playing a general role in kinetochore structure.</p><p>Because the efficient association of Xpo1p with its cognate NES occurs when Xpo1p is bound to RanGTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fornerod et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maurer et al., 2001</xref>), we examined kinetochore targeting of Mad1p in the presence of reduced nuclear levels of RanGTP, a condition that can be induced by a Ts mutation in the RanGEF Prp20p (<italic>prp20-7</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amberg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dilworth et al., 2001</xref>). Although nocodazole-induced kinetochore binding of Mad1-GFP occurs normally at the permissive temperature in a <italic>prp20-7 nup60&#x00394;</italic> strain, a shift to 37&#x000b0;C before nocodazole treatment inhibited Mad1-GFP accumulation at kinetochores in large-budded cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the link between Xpo1p function and kinetochore targeting of Mad1p, we constructed a point mutation in the Mad1p NES predicted to inhibit its interaction with Xpo1p. This <italic>mad1-nes<sup>L569A</sup></italic> mutation, when incorporated into SV40-NLS/Mad1<sup>563&#x02013;576</sup>-GFP<sub>3</sub>, inhibited export of the reporter, leading to its accumulation in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Importantly, when introduced into GFP-tagged endogenous <italic>MAD1</italic>, the resulting mad1<sup>L569A</sup>-GFP protein failed to accumulate at kinetochores after SAC arrest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). This result was further confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP [ChIP]) analysis showing that levels of mad1<sup>L569A</sup>-GFP at centromeric DNA were greatly reduced in SAC-arrested cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). These effects could not be attributed to a decrease in cellular levels of the mad1<sup>L569A</sup> mutant protein (unpublished data). Cumulatively, these findings support the conclusion that a Mad1p&#x02013;Xpo1p&#x02013;RanGTP complex functions in the efficient targeting of Mad1p to kinetochores during SAC arrest.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Inactivation of the Mad1p NES dramatically reduces targeting of Mad1p to kinetochores.</bold> (A) The cellular distribution of <italic>SV40-NLS/MAD1<sup>563-576</sup>-GFP<sub>3</sub></italic> or <italic>SV40-NLS/mad1-nes<sup>L569A</sup>-GFP<sub>3</sub></italic> containing the Mad1p NES mutant in WT cells was examined by epifluorescence microscopy.

In addition to its diffuse nuclear localization, we also detected Xpo1-GFP at one or two foci per nucleus. In asynchronous cultures, Xpo1-GFP foci did not appear to coincide with the kinetochore marker protein Mtw1-RFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and G</xref>) but instead with the spindle pole body protein Spc42-RFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and G</xref>). However, after incubation with nocodazole and activation of the SAC, Xpo1-GFP localization changed. Xpo1-GFP was now concentrated at kinetochores together with Mtw1-RFP and was no longer detected at spindle pole bodies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C, D, and G</xref>). Consistent with these results, ChIP analysis detected Xpo1-GFP in association with centromeric DNA only in SAC-arrested cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 H</xref>).

This is the case in vertebrate cells in which the Xpo1p counterpart, Crm1p, facilitates the binding of Nup358 (RanBP2) and RanGAP1 to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnaoutov et al., 2005</xref>).

As Xpo1p is required for Mad1p targeting to kinetochores (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), we examined the role of kaps in the turnover of Mad1p at kinetochores. In these experiments, the SAC was activated in <italic>nup60&#x00394;</italic> strains containing specific kap mutations, allowing Mad1-GFP to target to kinetochores.

Neither a shift to 37&#x000b0;C for 40 min (<italic>kap95-14</italic>) nor treatment of cells with LMB (<italic>xpo1-T539C</italic>) altered the kinetochore association of Mad1-GFP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, 0<sup>&#x02212;</sup> s). This allowed us to monitor Mad1-GFP turnover at kinetochores by FRAP analysis. In the absence of kap mutations, Mad1-GFP signal at postphotobleached kinetochores recovered to &#x0223c;60% of the original signal with a <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of recovery of &#x0223c;33 s (WT; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref> and Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804098/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804098/DC1</ext-link>), which is consistent with previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scott et al., 2005</xref>).

We also examined whether RanGTP plays a role in maintaining Mad1p at kinetochores or assists in the turnover process once the checkpoint is activated. To test this, <italic>prp20-7 nup60&#x00394;</italic> cells were treated with nocodazole at the permissive temperature, allowing Mad1-GFP to target onto unattached kinetochores (unpublished data). Cells were shifted to 37&#x000b0;C to inactivate prp20-7p. Under these conditions, Mad1-GFP remained bound to the Mlp focus and kinetochores (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>, 0<sup>&#x02212;</sup> s). Thus, either RanGTP plays no role in the turnover of Mad1-GFP at kinetochores or it becomes immobilized there in the absence of RanGTP, similar to what was observed upon inactivation of Xpo1p. To distinguish between these possibilities, kinetochore-associated Mad1-GFP was photobleached, and fluorescent recovery was monitored after inactivation of prp20-7p. We observed that kinetochore-bound Mad1-GFP signal failed to recover under these conditions of reduced nuclear RanGTP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>).</p><p>Using a similar methodology, we also investigated whether GTP hydrolysis by Ran plays a role in Mad1p turnover at kinetochores. To test this, we used a dominant-negative mutant of yeast Ran (<italic>gsp1-G21V</italic>) that stabilizes Ran in the GTP-bound form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schlenstedt et al., 1995</xref>). A <italic>GAL1/10</italic>-<italic>gsp1-G21V</italic> gene cassette was introduced into a <italic>nup60&#x00394;</italic> strain, producing Mad1-GFP. After nocodazole-induced SAC arrest, expression of <italic>gsp1-G21V</italic> was induced with galactose. As we observed after depletion of RanGTP, blocking its conversion to RanGDP did not alter the Mad1-GFP signal at kinetochores but prevented its recovery after photobleaching (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref> and Fig. S1). This effect was specific for the <italic>gsp1-G21V</italic> allele, as overexpression of WT <italic>GSP1</italic> had no effect on Mad1-GFP turnover (unpublished data). Importantly, the effects of the <italic>gsp1-G21V</italic> allele are unlikely linked to an inhibition of nuclear transport or loss of nuclear Mad1-GFP, as a pool of Mad1-GFP remained bound to the intranuclear Mlp foci (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>), and this provides Mad1-GFP for kinetochore turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scott et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that although required for the initial binding of Mad1p to kinetochores after nocodazole&#x02013;induced SAC activation, Xpo1p and RanGTP are not essential for maintaining this interaction during periods of arrest. However, turnover of Mad1p at kinetochores requires active Xpo1p, RanGTP, and hydrolysis of GTP by Ran. On the basis of our results, we have developed a working model in which a trimeric Mad1p&#x02013;Xpo1p&#x02013;RanGTP complex facilitates the initial binding of Mad1p to kinetochores after SAC activation. In this model, conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP is predicted to release Xpo1p from Mad1p at kinetochores. During SAC arrest, we envisage that Mad1p would remain attached to kinetochores until displaced by a Mad1p&#x02013;Xpo1p&#x02013;RanGTP complex. Subsequent conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP and the release of Xpo1p from Mad1p would complete the turnover cycle.</p><p>A key feature of this model is the conversion of Xpo1p-bound RanGTP to RanGDP at kinetochores. At present, the only known yeast RanGAP is Rna1p. This protein is found in the cytoplasm, and it is assumed to be excluded from the nucleoplasm to avoid depleting nuclear RanGTP. However, several observations suggest that RanGAP can enter the nucleus and potentially be targeted to specific locations. Both <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Rna1p contain functional NLSs and NESs, suggesting that they shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishijima et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, <italic>S. pombe</italic> Rna1 binds histone H3, and it was proposed that it functions in heterochromatin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishijima et al., 2006</xref>). These results suggest that Rna1p may function in the nucleus but only within specific contexts and at certain locations. Kinetochores may represent one such location. As mentioned in the Introduction, in metazoan cells, RanGAP1 associates with kinetochores during M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joseph et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnaoutov and Dasso, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joseph et al., 2004</xref>), and its presence there has been linked to Crm1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnaoutov and Dasso, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnaoutov et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, RanBP1, which is known to stimulate RanGTP hydrolysis mediated by RanGAP, is also required for Mad2 binding to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2007</xref>) in HeLa cells. It remains to be determined whether these events are conserved in yeast. Our preliminary experiments have failed to detect Rna1-GFP at kinetochores (unpublished data). An alternative possibility is that another kinetochore-bound protein could activate the GTPase activity of Ran.</p><p>Our results reveal a previously undefined function for Xpo1p in enhancing the intranuclear targeting of Mad1p to kinetochores and facilitating the cycling of Mad1p between kinetochores and NPCs. This latter event may contribute to the depletion of Mad1p from attached kinetochores and its sequestration at the NPC after termination of the SAC. It also seems reasonable to assume that this interplay reflects a broader functional relationship between the nuclear transport machinery and kinetochores, which could include SAC-induced alterations in nuclear transport. This idea is particularly intriguing, as previous experiments have shown that specific nuclear import pathways are inhibited in nocodazole-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Makhnevych et al., 2003</xref>). Future studies will undoubtedly reveal unanticipated links between these various pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and media</title><p>Strains are listed in Table S1 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804098/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804098/DC1</ext-link>).
