However, the development of cancer during pregnancy is difficult to predict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Indeed, some studies have suggested that pregnancy does not favour the development of cancer and may protect the organism against tumour growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Fast tumour growth during pregnancy may result in damage to the foetus and lead to foetal resorption and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Since foetal and tumour growth requires increased protein synthesis, the importance of amino acids in foetal life has been emphasised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The foetal nutrient supply depends on the mother's reserves and food intake, as well as on the placental function. Placental growth increases during gestation, concomitant with or ahead of foetal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and a failure in placental function can adversely affect foetal growth or welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The physiological changes that occur during pregnancy can only be sustained if there is an appropriate nutrient supply to ensure placental and foetal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To guarantee the supply of nutrients essential to foetal survival, the placenta continuously undergoes changes in weight, structure, shape and function during gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The placenta-foetal metabolic relationships are complex, dynamic processes that control many aspects of foetal development. The exchange between maternal and foetal blood occurs across the labyrinth layers of the placental barrier. In rats, the placenta, which consists of three trophoblast layers in the labyrinth zone, is the rate-limiting permeability barrier to substrate exchange between the maternal and foetal compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Programmed cell death has been implicated in normal and pathological processes in several human tissues and diseases, including cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Placental apoptosis occurs during normal pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], especially in trophoblast cells, whereas excessive apoptosis of the syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast, including the extravillar population, has been observed in pre-eclampsia pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Recently, a number of studies have suggested that apoptosis plays a role in the normal development, remodelling, and ageing of the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], particularly in the second half of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>During apoptosis, the activation of caspases by nuclear, metabolic or external stimuli occurs in a cascade fashion, and results in nuclear engulfment and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Since apoptosis may affect a range of placental functions, and since an increase in this process may be associated with the retardation of foetal growth, we investigated the influence of Walker 256 carcinosarcoma growth on the organisation of the placenta in rats and on the presence of apoptotic signals, such as cleaved PARP, cytochrome-c, and caspase 3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Adult female Wistar rats (90 days old, n = 54) were obtained from the animal facilities of the State University of Campinas (CEMIB-UNICAMP) and were housed with adult males (four females per male) for 12 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Mating was confirmed by analysing vaginal smears, with a positive result being considered as the first day of pregnancy. The pregnant rats were allocated to one of three groups: control (C), tumour-bearing (W), or injected with ascitic fluid (A). All of the rats were housed in collective cages under standard conditions (22 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C, 12 h light-dark cycle) with free access to a semi-synthetic control diet (AIN-93 G) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Neoplastic implants and extraction of ascitic fluid</title><p>Walker 256 carcinosarcoma cells (2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>in approximately 0.5 mL of 0.9%, w/v, NaCl), originally obtained from the Arthur D'Little Hospital, USA, were injected subcutaneously on the second day of pregnancy. Control rats received 0.5 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution. Since we have previously shown that ascitic fluid from tumour-bearing rats produces foetal death and resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], we examined the effect of this fluid on tumour growth. Ascitic fluid was collected from the intraperitoneal cavity of Walker tumour-bearing rats and was centrifuged (500 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>, 4&#x000b0;C, 10 min) to remove all neoplastic cells. From the 9<sup>th </sup>day of pregnancy onwards, group A rats received daily injections of 2 ml of ascitic fluid. The rats were killed 16, 19 or 21 days after mating, which corresponded to the 14<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th </sup>and 19<sup>th </sup>day after tumour transplantation, or the 7<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th </sup>and 12<sup>th </sup>day after ascitic fluid injection, respectively.</p><p>The general UKCCR (United Kingdom Co-ordinating Committee on Cancer Research) guidelines for animal welfare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] were followed and the protocols were approved by the institutional Committee for Ethics in Animal Experimentation (CEEA/IB/UNICAMP, protocol #217-3].</p></sec><sec><title>Histochemical analyses</title><p>The whole placental tissue from all rats were processed for light microscopical immunohistochemistry after perfusing the uterus, via the heart, with 10 mL of heparinized saline followed by 20 mL of fixative solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. The fixed placentas were then removed, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (at least 5 &#x003bc;m thick) were obtained for the immunohistochemical detection of cleaved PARP, caspase 3 and cytosolic cytochrome-c.</p><p>Placental cells were detected immunohistochemically using anti-PARP [poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase] goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; diluted 1:100) followed by incubation with biotinylated rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody (1:500 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature and further incubation with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase solution (Vector Laboratories). The sections were reacted with diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in PBS and stained with fast green. Caspase-3 and cytochrome-c were detected using specific goat polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:250 and 1:100, respectively) and the biotinylated secondary antibody/streptavidin horseradish peroxidase detection system described above. After incubation with DAB and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in PBS, the sections were stained with Harris' haematoxylin and lithium carbonate. For negative controls, placental sections from each group were incubated in PBS without the first antibody and then incubated with the biotinylated anti-goat secondary antibody followed by reaction with DAB, as described above.</p><p>The cells positive for cleaved PARP, caspase-3 and cytosolic cytochrome-c were counted using Image Pro-Plus software (v.3.01, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA) after capturing the image on a Leica microscope (Leica DMLM, Weizlar, Germany) using a 100&#x000d7; magnification for cleaved PARP images and a 40&#x000d7; magnification for caspase-3 and cytochrome-c images. The number of positive cells was determined by counting 20 fields (300 &#x003bc;m<sup>2 </sup>each) in one slide from each of at least six dams per group.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical assays and Western blotting</title><p>The other portion of the uterus from all groups was used to provide placental tissue for biochemical assays and western blotting. Fragments of this tissue were stored at -70&#x000b0;C until analysis. Placental samples (100 mg) were homogenised in buffer (1:4, w/v, in 0.3 M Tris pH 8, 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.2 M sucrose and 0.01% SDS) and centrifuged at 10,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The total protein content of the supernatants was determined colorimetrically as described by Bradford [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The homogenates were used to determine the glutathione-S-transferase activity with the assay described by Habig et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Western blotting was used to assess changes in the expression of cleaved PARP, caspase 3 and cytochrome-c after SDS-PAGE of 20 &#x003bc;g of total protein in 12% polyacrylamide gels. For western blots of cytochrome-c, the placental homogenates were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles to obtain a cytosolic fraction without mitochondria prior to electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to 0.45 &#x003bc;m nitrocellulose Hybond membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and then incubated with polyclonal antibodies against cleaved PARP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:500) and caspase 3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:1000) or a monoclonal antibody against cytochrome-c (R&#x00026;D, diluted 1:1000), followed by detection with an anti-goat secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA, diluted 1:1500). Actin was used as an internal control for protein loading and was detected with an antibody to mouse actin. The nitrocellulose membranes were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL reagent, Amersham Biosciences) and densitometric analysis of the protein bands was done using Gel-Pro Analyser software (Media Cybernetics, 1993&#x02013;97, Silver Spring, MD, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The results were expressed as the mean &#x000b1; SEM.

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows the reduction in the foetal and placental ratio in groups W and A, with different correlations for each curve (P &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>The placental protein levels of the control groups were similar, regardless of the gestational stage (C16 = 2.23 &#x000b1; 0.11, C19 = 2.22 &#x000b1; 0.12 and C21 = 2.19 &#x000b1; 0.10 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L; n = 8 each). In the tumour groups, the protein content was significantly lower (P &#x0003c; 0.05) than in the corresponding control only for W21 (W16 = 2.12 &#x000b1; 0.16, W19 = 2.15 &#x000b1; 0.06 and W21 = 1.64 &#x000b1; 0.18 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L; n = 8 each). A significant decrease in the protein content (~27%; P &#x0003c; 0.05) was seen in all groups injected with ascitic fluid (A16 = 1.38 &#x000b1; 0.09, A19 = 1.59 &#x000b1; 0.09 and A21 = 1.58 &#x000b1; 0.08 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L; n = 8 each).</p><p>Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity is associated with the cell cycle and is responsible for the conjugation and detoxification of intermediates produced by oxidative stress in rat placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. There was a non-linear decrease in GST activity during pregnancy in the control groups (C16 = 23.94 &#x000b1; 1.83, C19 = 31.71 &#x000b1; 4.28*, and C21 = 14.89 &#x000b1; 1.31* nmol/&#x003bc;g protein, n = 8; *P &#x0003c; 0.05 compared to the C16 group), since the high GST activity seen on the 19<sup>th </sup>day may be related to the maximal placental function at this time interval, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Tumour-bearing rats showed a significant decrease in GST activity on days 19 and 21 when compared to the corresponding control groups (W16 = 21.23 &#x000b1; 2.15, W19 = 20.47 &#x000b1; 1.94 and W21 = 9.23 &#x000b1; 1.84 nmol/&#x003bc;g protein; n = 8; P &#x0003c; 0.05). These results indicated an attenuation of the cellular protective mechanisms during tumour growth that could possibly compromise placental function and affect foetal development, as previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Similar data were obtained in the ascitic fluid group, in which GST activity was reduced on the 19<sup>th </sup>and 21<sup>st </sup>days (A16 = 17.73 &#x000b1; 2.65, A19 = 13.94 &#x000b1; 1.50 and A21 = 11.15 &#x000b1; 1.17 nmol/&#x003bc;g protein, n = 8; P &#x0003c; 0.05) compared to the control group.

Immunohistochemical analysis for cleaved PARP revealed few stained nuclei in sections from the control groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;C</xref>). However, in the nuclei that were positive, the staining was strong, especially in cytotrophoblastic and trophoblastic giant cells. Compared to the corresponding controls, there was a significant increase in the number of nuclei positive for cleaved PARP in tumour-bearing rats (W16, W19 and W21), regardless of the gestational stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>, respectively). The ratio of positive cells (those with stained nuclei) in the W and C groups showed that the level of cleaved PARP increased by about three-fold, regardless of the gestational stage (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Similar results were obtained in all of the ascitic fluid groups, with strong nuclear staining, particularly in cytotrophoblastic and trophoblastic giant cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G,H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>, which correspond to A16, A19 and A21, respectively). The ratio of positive cells in the ascitic fluid and control groups indicated an ~1.5-fold increase in the former group compared to the controls, but this increase was not as high as in the W group, except on the 19<sup>th </sup>day of pregnancy (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>Cytochrome-c showed a similar distribution in the cytosol of placental cells during different stages of pregnancy in the control groups (the number of positive cells was similar in C16, C19 and C21; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, respectively, and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

The ratio of positive cells in groups W and A compared to the corresponding controls indicated a three-fold increase in caspase-3 expression at all gestational stages, except for group W19, for which the increase was approximately seven-fold (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The expression of cleaved PARP, cytochrome-c and caspase 3 in rat placenta</title><p>Western blotting showed that the expression of cleaved PARP (89 kDa band) in placental tissue was significantly enhanced on the 21<sup>st </sup>day in group W and on the 16<sup>th </sup>and 21<sup>st </sup>days in group A; the increase on the 21<sup>st </sup>day was around two- and three-fold higher in groups W and A, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). There is a positive correlation between gestational stage and the levels of the 89-kDa fragment and placental apoptosis during normal pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

The expression of cytochrome-c in the control groups was similar, regardless of the stage of pregnancy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). The principal death-signalling pathway involves mitochondria that, in response to various stimuli, can release cytochrome-c into the cytosol where this enzyme triggers apoptotic effectors such as caspase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] studied pregnant rats treated with benzo(a)pyrene and reported an increase in the anti-oxidative capacity, seen as enhanced GST activity in the placental tissue of these rats compared to non-treated animals. However, these authors concluded that the increase in GST activity was insufficient to protect the foetus and that benzo(a)pyrene significantly increased the number of resorptions and reduced the foetal weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>As shown here, there was a marked reduction in the GST activity of placental tissue in groups W and A. Assuming that tumour growth during pregnancy induces foetal resorption and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and jeopardises the placental tissue by causing placental oedema [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and a reduction in the level of placental glycogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the changes in placental GST activity seen here could have an antioxidant function and may occur in parallel with programmed cell death. In late gestation in humans, there is increased oxidative stress in pregnancies complicated by diabetes, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and preeclampsia, as well as increased trophoblast apoptosis and deportation, and altered placental vascular reactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Tumour growth clearly damaged the placental tissue by altering the foetal/placental ratio and the levels of apoptotic signalling molecules such as cleaved PARP, cytochrome-c and caspase 3. Tumours can damage foetuses (high foetal resorption, foetal death or a decrease in foetal growth) through competition for nutrients and by harming the foetus and placenta indirectly through substances synthesized by the tumour and/or host cells present in ascitic fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Apoptosis occurs during normal development in different organs and tissues and is a normal phenomenon in trophoblast turnover, with no inflammatory response in the mother. Apoptosis is important for an appropriate balance in cell turnover, with the early, reversible stages of the apoptotic cascade being involved in the differentiation and fusion of the cytotrophoblast in animal models of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Normal placental development depends upon the differentiation and invasion of the trophoblast, the main cellular component of the placenta. Apoptosis in the trophoblast increases in normal placentas as gestation proceeds, with a higher incidence in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia or IUGR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Apoptosis is triggered by different cell-type-specific signals that involve mitochondrial and receptor-mediated pathways and results in activation of the caspase cascade. At least two major mechanisms by which a caspase cascade may be initiated have been suggested: one involves death receptors that activate initiator caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and the other involves cytochrome-c release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. There is evidence for the occurrence of one of the apoptotic pathways induced by cytochrome-c in the placenta of tumour-bearing rats and in rats injected with ascitic fluid. Further studies need to address other apoptotic pathways involved during tumour growth in placenta. Hung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] reported that hypoxia-reoxygenation in vitro stimulated apoptosis in human placental tissue, and that there was a significant increase in cytochrome-c release from mitochondria associated with intense immunolabelling for active caspase 3 in the syncytiotrophoblast and foetal endothelial cells. There was also increased labelling of syncytiotrophoblastic nuclei for cleaved PARP, and higher cytosolic concentrations of cleaved PARP in placental tissue under hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>In agreement with these findings, we observed increased caspase 3 expression in groups W and A that may have been initiated by the release of cytochrome-c into the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Indeed, the injection of ascitic fluid increases caspase 3 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], which then cleaves PARP, one of many caspase substrates, thereby preventing this enzyme from repairing damaged DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]; this lack of repair can lead to apoptosis. Western blotting showed an increase in cleaved PARP and caspase 3 expression in groups W and A that was also associated with a progressive enhancement of the cytochrome-c levels in both groups. These results may indicate that placental layers, especially the trophoblast, may experience greater apoptosis mediated by cytochrome-c release and caspases, including caspase-3, which is activated by several death receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Such activation could be related to the decrease in GST activity seen in groups W and A. This would allow the formation of reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], which could in turn activate other apoptotic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Various studies have reported increased apoptosis following B19 infection of villous trophoblastic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], an elevation in caspase 3 activity and cytochrome-c release in chorionic villi after exposure to ultrasound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], and higher apoptotic rates in placentas from pregnancies complicated with intrauterine growth restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Since trophoblastic cells are responsible for maintaining a normal placental function, the association to tumour growth and/or substances produced by tumour cells, such as cytokines and factors present in ascitic fluid, could be involved in the uncontrolled death of trophoblastic cells that have a negative impact on foetal development. Further work are underway in our laboratory to improve our understanding of the events that occur at the maternal-foetal interface in the presence of tumours, especially with regard to the role of cytokines present in ascitic fluid. Such knowledge may help to improve the welfare of the foetus and placenta during tumour development.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Author 1 M.T.T. carried out the experiments, biochemical and immunohistochemical assays and performed the statistical analysis.</p><p>Author 2 G.V. carried out the biochemical assays and performed the statistical analysis.</p><p>Author 3 M.C.C.G.M. conceived of the study and participated in its design and coordination.</p><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-publication history</title><p>The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/6/168/prepub"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Maria Alice Rostom de Mello for helpful discussions, Dr. Juvenal Marcondes Neto for computational assistance, Mrs Martha Marques de Almeida for technical assistence and Dr. Stephen Hyslop for editing the English.
