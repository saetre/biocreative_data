Classical KH domains include a characteristic pattern of hydrophobic residues, a Gly-X-X-Gly (GXXG) segment, and a variable loop. KH domains typically occur in clusters, with some retaining their GXXG sequence (conserved), while others do not (diverged). As a first step towards addressing whether GXXG is essential for KH-domain function, we explored the roles of conserved and diverged KH domains in Scp160p, a multiple-KH-domain-containing protein in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We specifically wanted to know (1) whether diverged KH domains were essential for Scp160p function, and (2) whether diverged KH domains could functionally replace conserved KH domains. To address these questions, we deleted and/or interchanged conserved and diverged KH domains of Scp160p and expressed the mutated alleles in yeast. Our results demonstrated that the answer to each question was yes. Both conserved and diverged KH domains <italic>are</italic> essential for Scp160p function, and diverged KH domains <italic>can</italic> function in place of conserved KH domains. These findings challenge the prevailing notions about the requisite features of a KH domain and raise the possibility that there may be more functional KH domains in the proteome than previously appreciated.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Proper gene expression depends on precisely orchestrated interactions between nucleic acids and nucleic acid-binding proteins. In fact, virtually every step of gene expression involves the activities of both sequence-specific and general nucleic acid-binding proteins. For example, transcription of DNA to RNA employs helicases, transcription factors, RNA polymerase, 5&#x02032;-capping enzymes, poly (A) polymerase and numerous other proteins required to process the nascent mRNA transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). All of these factors must recognize nucleic acids in some manner. Then numerous mRNA-binding proteins are required to escort transcripts out of the nucleus and, ultimately, to coordinate protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Thus, gene expression relies heavily on nucleic acid-binding proteins, with major roles for proteins that bind to mRNA. In keeping with this workload, proteins have evolved a vast array of domains that mediate interactions with RNA, including but not limited to the hnRNP K homology (KH) domain, RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), arginine-rich motifs, and zinc-finger motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Many RNA-binding domains are abundant and highly conserved across species. In fact, Chen and Varani have estimated that about 1.5&#x02013;2% of the human genome is composed of proteins that contain RRM domains, the most abundant and well-characterized of the RNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). RNA-binding motifs are typically recognized and defined on the basis of their conserved primary amino acid sequence, but the degree of sequence conservation among different motifs varies widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Although some major residues are defined functionally, others have been identified strictly on the basis of sequence conservation or homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). A key question is whether these conserved residues are actually critical for protein function, and therefore whether sequence conservation alone can be used as a measure of functional significance.</p><p>One remarkably versatile and highly conserved RNA-binding motif is the KH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). KH domains, which were originally identified as a repeated sequence in the hnRNP K protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), are &#x0223c;70 amino acids in length, with a characteristic pattern of hydrophobic residues, a GXXG segment and a variable loop. KH domains are often found in multiple copies per protein. There is strong evidence that KH domains are critically important to the function of those proteins that contain them. For example, fragile X syndrome, a leading cause of inherited mental retardation, can arise from a missense mutation of Ile304Asn in the second KH domain of the FMRP protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Indeed, the Ile304Asn mutation is associated with a severe clinical phenotype (8). Thus, there is evidence that mutations in KH domains can cause human disease, which underscores the importance of defining what constitutes a functional KH domain.</p><p>Some proteins contain both conserved KH domains that include the GXXG motif, as well as what have been termed <italic>diverged</italic> KH domains, in which the GXXG motif is interrupted or altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Although the structures of a number of conserved KH domains have been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13 B14">10&#x02013;14</xref>), there has been little functional analysis of diverged KH domains. Recent evidence suggests possible synergistic binding to mRNA targets by the three KH domains of hnRNP K protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), thereby enhancing interaction with the nucleic acid substrate. Chmiel and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) drew a similar conclusion from their work with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PSI protein, which contains four KH domains. While these findings do shed light on the functional importance of KH domain <italic>clustering</italic> in proteins, they fail to address the functional significance of KH domain sequence conservation or divergence.</p><p>As a first step towards addressing whether GXXG is essential for KH domain function, we explored the roles of conserved and diverged KH domains in Scp160p, a multiple KH domain protein in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Scp160p includes 14 KH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), only seven of which contain a strictly conserved GXXG motif (KH 2, 8&#x02013;12 and 14). The other seven KH domains are diverged, with interruptions or alterations of the GXXG motif. Although the exact function of Scp160p and its orthologs, known as vigilins in higher eukaryotes, is not known, recent work suggests a role for this protein in modulating the metabolism of specific mRNA targets in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Consistent with this postulated function, much of Scp160p is found in large protein complexes associated with soluble or membrane-bound polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23 B24 B25">20&#x02013;25</xref>). The goal of the present study was to explore two questions. First, are diverged KH domains essential for Scp160p function? Second, can diverged KH domains functionally replace conserved KH domains? To address these questions, we deleted and/or interchanged conserved and diverged KH domains of Scp160p, then expressed these variant alleles in yeast. We applied a combination of previously defined genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and biochemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23 B24 B25">20&#x02013;25</xref>) assays to the strains expressing these mutated alleles to discern the functional capacity of each encoded Scp160p protein.</p><p>Our results demonstrated that the answer to each of our two questions was yes. Both conserved and diverged KH domains <italic>were</italic> essential for Scp160p function, and diverged KH domains <italic>were</italic> capable of functioning in place of conserved KH domains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and manipulations</title><p>All yeast manipulations were performed according to standard protocols.

To facilitate site-directed mutagenesis of <italic>SCP160</italic>, a 2.2 kb PstI/EcoRI fragment containing sequence from the beginning of <italic>SCP160</italic> KH8 through approximately 430 bp downstream of the stop codon was gel purified and ligated into pGEM3-zf(+) using T4 DNA Ligase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting plasmid (JF4566, pGEM3zf +. <italic>SCP160</italic>.Eco.Pst) was confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing and used as a template for the generation of all subsequent modified alleles, as detailed below.</p><p>To create <italic>scp160</italic> alleles individually deleted for KH13 and KH14, we used the QuikChange&#x02122; Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with one exception: we increased the number of PCR cycles from 18 to 28. Relevant primer sequences are listed in Supplemental Table 2. Each initial deletion was designed to remove the appropriate KH domain precisely, but also to leave in its place a short &#x0201c;scar sequence&#x0201d; that would facilitate subsequent replacement by an alternate KH sequence via gap repair homologous recombination. Primers scpdelKH14.stu.xho.f1 and scpdelKH14.stu.xho.r1 were used to replace KH14 with a StuI-linker-XhoI scar, resulting in the allele <italic>FLAG.scp160&#x00394;14.scar</italic>. Similarly, primers scpdelKH13.stu.xho.f2 and scpdelKH13.stu.xho.r2 were used to replace KH13 with a StuI-linker-XhoI scar, resulting in the allele <italic>FLAG.scp160&#x00394;13.scar</italic>. Finally, alleles intended to carry either a clean deletion or KH domain replacement of KH13 or KH14 were generated by gap repair of the corresponding scar construct with an appropriate fragment, as described below. The gapped backbone fragment for each recombination procedure was generated from the appropriate plasmid (pGEM3-zf(+).FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;14.scar or pGEM3-zf(+).FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;13.scar) by digestion with StuI and XhoI, followed by gel purification.</p><p>The inserts for scar replacement were generated as follows: (a) to remove the StuI-linker-XhoI scar from each deletion template, the indicated oligonucleotides in Supplemental Table 2 were annealed and extended in a single round of polymerization using the TripleMaster PCR System (Eppendorf) in a thermocycler, (b) to create <italic>FLAG.scp160&#x00394;14.11</italic>, a fragment encoding KH11 was amplified from a wild-type <italic>SCP160</italic> template using primers scpdelKH14.addback.KH11.f1 and scpdelKH14.addback.KH11.r1, (c) to create <italic>FLAG.scp160&#x00394;14.13</italic>, the replacement sequence was generated by PCR using the primers scpdelKH14.addback.13.f1 and scpdelKH14.addback.13.r1, (d) to create <italic>FLAG.scp160&#x00394;13.6</italic>, the replacement sequence was generated by PCR using the primers scpdelKH13.addback.KH6.f1 and scpdelKH13.addback.KH6.r1, and finally (e) to create <italic>FLAG.scp160&#x00394;13.14</italic>, the replacement sequence was generated by PCR using the primers SCP.KH14.addback.f1 and SCP.KH14.addback.r1. All DNA fragments were gel purified using the QIAquick&#x000ae; Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>To accomplish gap repair homologous recombination, the appropriate purified PCR fragments were individually cotransformed into competent <italic>E. coli</italic> with gel-purified, gapped plasmid backbone. Transformants were cultured and the plasmids isolated using the Qiaprep Spin&#x000ae; Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). All resultant alleles were verified by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing across the entire region that had been generated by PCR to ensure sequence integrity.</p><p>Once the desired sequence manipulations were completed and verified, we next moved the relevant <italic>SCP160</italic> sequences into yeast-integrating plasmids via gap repair homologous recombination for subsequent insertion into the <italic>SCP160</italic> locus of the yeast genome. Towards that end, all verified plasmids were digested with PstI and EcoRI. The &#x0223c;2.2 kb band from each construct was gel purified and individually cotransformed into competent <italic>E. coli</italic> with pJF2147 (YIplac211.FLAG.<italic>SCP160</italic>) that had been gapped by digestion with AflII and XbaI. Resultant constructs were confirmed by restriction digestion, linearized by digestion with PstI, and transformed into the yeast strain JFy4493. Appropriate integration was confirmed by genomic PCR, followed by direct sequence analysis of each <italic>SCP160</italic> locus from KH12 to 600 bp downstream of the stop codon.</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses of the ability of <italic>FLAG.SCP160</italic> and modified alleles to complement <italic>scp160&#x00394; eap1&#x00394;</italic> synthetic lethality</title><p>We assessed the ability of all modified alleles listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> to function <italic>in vivo</italic> by quantifying the ability of each to complement <italic>scp160&#x00394; eap1&#x00394;</italic> synthetic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Briefly, <italic>scp160&#x00394; eap1&#x00394;</italic> cells carrying both an <italic>SCP160 URA3</italic> &#x0201c;maintenance&#x0201d; plasmid and an <italic>scp160</italic> variant allele in a <italic>LEU</italic>2 &#x0201c;test&#x0201d; plasmid were inoculated into liquid medium lacking both uracil and leucine, to ensure selection for both plasmids. Once grown to saturation, 300,&#x02009;000 cells were inoculated into synthetic media lacking only leucine, to enable loss of the <italic>URA3</italic> maintenance plasmid. When this culture reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of &#x0223c;2.0, again 300,&#x02009;000 cells were inoculated into synthetic medium lacking leucine and grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.5&#x02013;2.0. Finally, cells were counted, and appropriate dilutions were plated to synthetic medium lacking leucine &#x000b1;5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). 5-FOA is toxic only to cells that contain a functional <italic>URA3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>); therefore, the number of colonies that grew on the 5-FOA medium relative to the number of colonies that grew on medium lacking 5-FOA was a measure of the proportion of cells in the culture that had lost the <italic>URA3</italic> maintenance plasmid. This proportion, in turn, was a measure of the ability of the variant <italic>scp160</italic> test plasmid to complement loss of the wild-type <italic>SCP160</italic> maintenance plasmid. Empty test plasmid backbone served as the negative control, and test plasmid encoding wild-type FLAG.Scp160p served as the positive control. For comparison between experiments, the proportion of cells that lost the <italic>URA</italic>3 plasmid in each strain was normalized to the corresponding proportion from the positive control strain. Therefore, the final values calculated indicated how effectively, relative to wild-type <italic>SCP160</italic>, each modified allele of <italic>scp160</italic> functioned <italic>in vivo</italic>. Since the <italic>URA3</italic> maintenance plasmid was the same in all strains and all experiments, any issues of plasmid replication efficiency or distribution, independent of <italic>SCP160</italic> sequence, should have cancelled out. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Predicted domain structures of wild-type and FLAG.Scp160p variants.

Briefly, mid-log-phase cultures were incubated with cyclohexamide at a final concentration of 100 &#x003bc;g/ml for 1 min at 30&#x000b0;C, and then for 15 min on ice with swirling. Cells were washed in cold water, then lysed in cold buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), each containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml cyclohexamide. All cell lysis procedures were accomplished using a multihead vortex mixer that was set to the highest speed at 4&#x000b0;C for 20 min. The supernatant from the lysis was centrifuged at 3000&#x02009;rpm at 4&#x000b0;C for 5 min in a tabletop microfuge. The supernatant from this step was transferred to a fresh tube and centrifuged at 12000&#x02009;rpm, 4&#x000b0;C, for 8&#x02009;min in a tabletop microfuge. The supernatant from this final spin was the soluble lysate. The protein concentration of this soluble lysate was quantified using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (cat #500-0006) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, 15 &#x003bc;g of soluble protein from untagged wild-type, FLAG-tagged wild-type, and FLAG-tagged Scp160p variants were each run on a gel for subsequent Western blot analysis. FLAG.Scp160p band intensity, for the wild-type protein and all variants, was quantified by scanning densitometry, and FLAG.Scp160p signal was normalized to the intensity of a previously reported endogenous protein also recognized by the anti-FLAG M2 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>For analyses of polysome association, 200 &#x003bc;l of soluble lysate were loaded onto a 15&#x02013;45% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 39,000&#x02009;rpm in an ultracentrifuge for 2.5 h at 4&#x000b0;C, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).

In brief, samples were mixed with 400 &#x003bc;l MeOH and 100 &#x003bc;l chloroform and agitated vigorously. Precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 13&#x02009;000&#x02009;rpm for 2 min in a tabletop microfuge; the top phase was discarded, and 400 &#x003bc;l MeOH was added to the pellet. Each sample was inverted to mix and then re-centrifuged at 13&#x02009;000&#x02009;rpm for another 5 min.

While previous studies from our lab and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) had tested the function of Scp160p missing KH14 or KH13 + 14, the <italic>FLAG.scp160&#x00394;13</italic> allele created here was novel. From the <italic>FLAG.scp160&#x00394;14</italic> and <italic>FLAG.scp160&#x00394;13</italic> templates, we then generated an additional four modified alleles: two in which the deleted KH domains were replaced by the same class of KH domain (i.e., conserved for conserved, or diverged for diverged), and two in which the deleted KH domains were replaced by the opposite class of KH domain. The encoded proteins were designated FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;14.11p, in which conserved KH11 replaced conserved KH14, FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;14.13p, in which diverged KH13 replaced conserved KH14, FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;13.6p, in which diverged KH6 replaced diverged KH13, and FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;13.14p, in which conserved KH14 replaced diverged KH13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). As a result of these manipulations, two of the modified proteins, FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;14p and FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;13p, each carried a total of 13 KH domains, and four of the modified proteins, FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;14.11p, FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;14.13p, FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;13.6p, and FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;13.14p, each carried a total of 14 KH domains.

Representative results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A. Due to the different lengths of the KH domains deleted or replaced, the protein sizes varied from about 70 amino acids larger than the wild-type protein (FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;14.13p), to about 140 amino acids smaller than the wild-type protein (FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;13p). Yeast expressing untagged Scp160p served as a negative control for specificity of the antibody, and a &#x0223c;100 kDa endogenous yeast protein that cross-reacts with the M2 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) served as a convenient internal control for loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, bottom-most band in each lane). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A (open circles), each modified protein was expressed and displayed the expected migration pattern relative to the wild-type FLAG-tagged protein.

As a control, we analyzed the <italic>SCP160</italic> variants that lacked either conserved KH14 or diverged KH13 in parallel with the other variants. Previous studies from our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) had demonstrated the functional significance of KH14, and previous studies from Seedorf and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) had demonstrated the functional importance of KH13 + 14 combined.

As explained in Materials and Methods, this assay measures the frequency with which a <italic>scp160&#x00394; eap1&#x00394;</italic> mutant strain loses a wild-type <italic>SCP160</italic> maintenance plasmid in the presence of a modified <italic>scp160</italic> test plasmid. Results are calculated as the relative percentage of maintenance plasmid loss, and the calculated value gives an indication of the functional capacity of the tested allele. For example, a poorly complementing sequence or empty test backbone will have a very low percentage maintenance plasmid loss, because few if any cells will survive loss of the <italic>SCP160 URA3</italic> maintenance plasmid. In contrast, strains that carry an <italic>SCP160</italic> test sequence that functions well <italic>in vivo</italic> will have a very high degree of maintenance plasmid loss, because most if not all cells will survive loss of the maintenance plasmid. As explained earlier, because the <italic>URA3</italic> maintenance plasmid was the same in all strains, any issues of plasmid replication efficiency or distribution, independent of <italic>SCP160</italic> sequence, should have cancelled out. Further, given that each of the wild-type and variant <italic>SCP160</italic> test sequences was expressed from the same wild-type <italic>SCP160</italic> promoter and plasmid backbone, and that all of these alleles were demonstrated to express comparable levels of Scp160p protein when genomic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), there should have been no disparities in Scp160p expression levels for this experiment.</p><p>Results of these analyses for the control strains confirmed that both KH domains 13 and 14 are essential for Scp160p function.

While the <italic>&#x00394;KH14</italic> allele provided an anticipated result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), this was the first demonstration that loss of KH13 alone also compromised Scp160p function.

For these analyses, soluble lysates prepared from mid-log-phase cultures of yeast expressing each Scp160p variant were size-fractionated over an S300 Sephacryl column, as described in the Materials and Methods section.

To examine this more specific aspect of Scp160p macromolecular interaction in the context of KH domain contribution, we assessed the migration through a sucrose gradient of each Scp160p variant from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Sucrose gradients enable the size separation of large complexes, such as ribosomal subunits, monosomes, and polyribosomes. Western blot analyses of the fractions collected from these gradients revealed the distribution profile for each Scp160p variant protein relative to the migration pattern of the FLAG.Scp160p wild-type control. Finally, to test whether co-migration with polyribosomes reflected association of each variant Scp160p with polyribosomes, as opposed to non-specific aggregation, we pretreated relevant samples with RNase or EDTA, as described below. To facilitate comparison between the different profiles, the FLAG-Scp160p signal intensity in each lane was quantified by scanning densitometry and plotted as the fraction of total signal migrating in samples 1&#x02013;4 (complexes smaller than monosomes) versus fractions 5&#x02013;11 (monosomes and polysomes).</p><p>As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), a majority (&#x0003e;80%) of the wild-type FLAG.Scp160p protein migrated with monosomes and polyribosomes near the bottom of the gradient, while more than half of the FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;14p variant protein migrated near the top of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), indicating a loss of association with polyribosomes. Loss of diverged KH13 produced an even more striking shift of Scp160p signal from the bottom to the top of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), reconfirming the functional significance of this domain. Of note, although neither wild-type Scp160p nor any of the &#x00394;KH13 variant proteins showed any signal in the top-most gradient fraction, representing free proteins and small complexes, all three &#x00394;KH14 proteins did show signal in this fraction. The simplest explanation for this disparity is that the wild-type and &#x00394;KH13 Scp160p proteins assembled entirely into complexes larger than those found in the first gradient fraction, while the three &#x00394;KH14 Scp160p proteins each maintained at least a subpopulation that did not. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Sucrose gradient fractionation of Scp160p-containing complexes.

A similar &#x02018;partial rescue&#x02019; was seen following add-back of diverged KH6 to the &#x00394;KH13 protein, such that more than half of the FLAG.Scp160&#x00394;13.6p protein migrated with the denser gradient fractions. Finally, add-back of conserved KH14 in place of the missing diverged KH13 completely normalized the sucrose gradient profile of the variant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A).</p><p>To confirm that the pattern of Scp160p migration evident in these experiments corresponded to association with ribosomes, samples were either treated with EDTA, which dissociates polyribosomes and monosomes into small and large ribosomal subunits, or RNase, which dissociates polyribosomes into monosomes. Both treatments caused the signals for all Scp160p variants tested to migrate predominantly at the top of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B andC), confirming that the pattern in the absence of pre-treatment was due largely to association with polyribosomes, and not simply to aggregation. For all three variant proteins, however, especially Scp160&#x00394;13.6p, a portion of the signal did remain in the denser fractions even after treatment with EDTA or RNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C), indicating that these proteins may have aggregated to some extent. By extension, these results suggest that while the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> reflect predominantly mRNP formation by the variant Scp160p proteins, some degree of aggregation may also have occurred.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The goal of this study was to explore whether diverged KH domains are as important for Scp160p function as conserved domains, and also whether diverged KH domains can functionally replace conserved KH domains in Scp160p. Our results yielded two important conclusions. First, diverged KH domains <italic>can</italic> be as critical for function as conserved KH domains. Specifically, we demonstrated, as others have hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), that at least one diverged KH domain in Scp160p, KH13, is essential for Scp160p function, despite its lack of the GXXG motif. Second, there <italic>can</italic> be considerable functional overlap between diverged and conserved KH domains. In particular, we observed that add-back of the diverged KH13 domain sequence to an Scp160p variant missing conserved KH14 partially restored both presumed mRNP formation and polyribosome association, and also restored close to 50% wild-type complementation. It is also important to note, however, that no &#x02018;add-back&#x02019; variant was able to restore fully wild-type levels of <italic>SCP160</italic> function when measured by our biochemical or quantitative complementation assays. Furthermore, the variants studied here showed differing levels of biochemical function with regard to presumed mRNP formation and polyribosome association. These results highlight the distinction between the shared and unique roles of individual KH domains in a multi-KH-domain protein; though they may be repeated, these units are not simply interchangeable.</p><sec><title>Size alone is not the answer</title><p>Another noteworthy conclusion from our results is that neither the sheer number of KH domains nor the total protein size defines Scp160p function. For example, each of the add-back alleles included a total of 14 KH domains, yet there was enormous disparity in their degrees of function. Furthermore, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, the variant Scp160p proteins were not all the same size, even after add-back, because KH domain 13 is almost twice the size of any of the other KH domains. This disparity means that the variants missing KH13 with either a KH6 add-back or a KH14 add-back were both approximately the same size as the variant protein that was simply missing KH14, with no add-back, and yet the function of these proteins differed dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3 F4 F5">Figures 3&#x02013;5</xref>). Clearly, size alone does not define Scp160p function.</p></sec><sec><title>Uncoupling aspects of Scp160p function</title><p>One of the interesting observations from the data we present here is that <italic>SCP160</italic> function is not binary; the variants we have created and tested clearly uncouple different aspects of Scp160p function. For example, all four of the add-back alleles we tested restored at least partial ability of Scp160p to form presumed mRNPs, but only three restored at least partial ability of the protein to associate with polyribosomes. Finally, of all the variant alleles tested, only one, <italic>SCP160&#x00394;14.13</italic>, restored significant function as measured using our genetic complementation assay. The simplest interpretation of these results would be that <italic>SCP160</italic> function, as measured by the complementation assay, is a complex variable. An ability to form presumed mRNPs appears to be a prerequisite for polyribosome association, and polyribosome association appears to be necessary but not sufficient for full function <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is also interesting to note that the allele demonstrating the strongest ability to complement <italic>scp160&#x003b4; eap1&#x003b4;</italic> synthetic lethality (<italic>SCP160&#x00394;14.13</italic>) was not the same allele that showed the greatest association with polyribosomes (<italic>SCP160&#x00394;13.14</italic>). Furthermore, the most genetically functional of all of the add-back alleles tested was <italic>SCP160&#x00394;14.13</italic>, in which a conserved KH domain was replaced by a diverged KH domain. These data clearly demonstrate that the GXXG motif cannot be essential for the function of every KH domain in Scp160p.</p></sec><sec><title>Scp160p and the vigilins</title><p>Here we have used Scp160p in yeast as a model to study conserved and diverged KH motifs within a multi-KH-domain protein. Scp160p is most closely related to a family of proteins in higher eukaryotes, known as vigilins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). First identified in chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), vigilin homologues have now been found in species ranging from <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30 B31 B32">30&#x02013;32</xref>)(GenPept 7493335; GenPept 7899383). Like Scp160p, these proteins contain both conserved and diverged KH domains, and as with Scp160p, the diverged KH domains of vigilin have an interrupted GXXG. Interestingly, the <italic>positions</italic> of the diverged KH domains in the human, mouse, and chicken vigilins, and to some extent also in the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster DDP</italic>1 sequence, have been conserved, but that conservation does not extend to <italic>SCP160</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Nonetheless, fly <italic>DDP1</italic> is apparently adequate to rescue the abnormal DNA-content phenotype in <italic>scp160&#x00394;</italic> yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). While anecdotal, this evidence further supports the conclusion that the presence versus absence of a GXXG motif does not define the functional capacity of every KH domain, at least within the context of a multi-KH-domain protein. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Domain structures of multi-KH-domain-containing proteins.
