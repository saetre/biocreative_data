GAT-1 was the first cloned member of a large family of homologous proteins, the Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-dependent neurotransmitter transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], which includes transporters for other neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin and glycine, as well as for a number of other substrates that share the common property of being amino acids or amino acid derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These membrane proteins are predicted to have 12 transmembrane-spanning domains (TMDs) linked by hydrophilic loops with the NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH terminals inside the cell, a topological model that has been confirmed for the serotonin transporter by means of site-directed chemical labeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. GAT-1 mediates the electrogenic reuptake of GABA in the presence of sodium and chloride ions by means of a mechanism that has been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Many attempts have been made to determine which of the transporter amino acid residues are involved in the interaction with GABA and with Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ions, and which participate in the conformational changes associated with translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As GABA is a zwitterionic molecule and its cosubstrates are charged species, the first studies focused on the charged and conserved residues predicted to be located in (or adjacent to) the transmembrane (TM) domains. This allowed the identification of two charged residues that are critical for GAT-1: arginine 69 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and glutamate 101 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A different approach investigated the possible role of aromatic residues through the interaction of their <italic>&#x003c0;</italic> electrons with positively charged substrates such as Na<sup>+</sup> or the amino group of the neurotransmitter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A number of tryptophan residues residing within the membrane domain of the GABA transporter have been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Tryptophan 68 was initially believed to interact with the amino group of the neurotransmitter, but a subsequent and more detailed analysis revealed its involvement in cation binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Cysteines introduced at positions 68 (TMD 1) and 143 (TMD 3) have recently been shown to be in close proximity within the transporter monomer, thus supporting the idea that the binding determinants for the substrate in GAT-1 are located in TMD 1 and 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Analysis of the tyrosine residues of GAT-1, predicted to be located in the membrane, and conserved throughout the family, has shown that tyrosine 140 is critical for neurotransmitter recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>We investigated the role in GAT-1 function of glutamine 291 which, according to secondary-structure prediction algorithms, is located at the extracellular membrane surface. Despite their rare presence in TM helices, polar residues are often highly conserved in multispanning TM proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which suggests that they provide functionally and/or structurally required molecular interactions, and that evolutionary pressure prevents their substitution in related proteins in different organisms. Q291 is strictly conserved in all members of the family including bacterial and archaeal proteins, indicating that it may play a fundamental role in the function of these transporters.</p><p>Our experiments confirmed the topological prediction of Q291 on the extracellular membrane surface and its crucial role in GAT-1 function. Q291 mutants, although inserted into the plasma membrane, are unable to transport measurable amounts of GABA or to elicit any of the currents shown by the wild-type (WT) transporter. A defect in the recognition of the organic substrate cannot explain all the experimental data and a defect in quaternary protein folding cannot be envisaged. Our hypothesis is that Q291 may play a fundamental role in the initial interaction of the transporter with sodium, which would obviously involve other critical residues at the protein membrane surface. Our data do not necessarily indicate a direct role for Q291 in cation binding, but Q291 may be fundamental to maintain the conformational integrity of an external region of the transporter that makes it accessible to the cation. Very recently, the first structure of a member of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family was solved. Yamashita et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reported the crystal structure of the leucine transporter LeuT<sub>Aa</sub> from the bacterium <italic>Aquifex aeolicus</italic>. This structure represents a conformation of the transporter in which the binding pocket is occluded and the external and internal gates are closed. The molecular interactions of LeuT<sub>Aa</sub> Q250, which corresponds to GAT Q291 (fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>), are clearly shown and compatible with our data concerning the role of Q291 in GAT function. <fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Sequence conservation of the region including TMD 6 within different Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-dependent neurotransmitter transporters, topological prediction of Q291 and representation of the GAT-1 TM helix 6.

The oocytes were incubated at 18 &#x000b0;C for 3&#x02013;4 days in Barth&#x02019;s solution supplemented with 50 &#x000b5;g/ml gentamicin and 2.5 mM sodium pyruvate before the experiments.</p><p><bold>Transport experiments</bold>. GABA uptake was measured 3 days after injection. Groups of 10&#x02013;12 oocytes were incubated in 100 &#x000b5;l uptake solution (100 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES/Tris, pH 7.5) with 100 &#x000b5;M [<sup>3</sup>H]GABA (1000 KBq/ml) for 60 min.

In electrophysiological experiments, the same oocytes were tested before sulfhydryl modification and then again after methanethiosulfonate (MTS) incubation (under the same conditions as used in the uptake studies). In this way, each oocyte was its own control.</p><p><bold>Electrophysiology.</bold> Classical two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed using GeneClamp (Axon Instruments), or Oocyte Clamp OC-725B (Warner Instruments) amplifiers. Reference electrodes were connected to the experimental oocyte chamber via agar bridges (3% agar in 3 M KCl) to minimize the effects of chloride on junction potential. Borosilicate electrodes with a tip resistance of 0.5&#x02013;2 M&#x003a9; were filled with 3 M KCl. The holding potential was kept at &#x02212;40 mV, and 400-ms voltage pulses were applied in the voltage range &#x02212;140 mV to 40 mV in 20-mV increments. Four pulses were averaged at each potential; signals were filtered at 1 KHz and sampled at 2 KHz. The experimental protocols, data acquisition and analysis were performed using pClamp software (Axon Instruments), and all of the figures were prepared using Origin 5.0 software (Microcal Software). The external solution consisted of (in mM): NaCl98, LiCl98, TMACl (tetramethylammonium chloride) or NMDG (N-methyl-D-glucamine) 98, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8, HEPES 5; pH was adjusted to a final value of 7.6 by adding NaOH, LiOH, TMAOH or HCl. In the experiments using reduced sodium concentrations, the cation was iso-osmotically replaced by TMA<sup>+</sup> or NMDG. To induce transport-associated currents, GABA was added at a final concentration of 100 &#x000b5;M, unless otherwise stated. The transport-associated currents were estimated by subtracting the traces in the absence of GABA from those in its presence under each experimental condition. The experiments investigating the sodium-induced inhibition of lithium currents were performed using 96 mM lithium in the presence of 2 mM sodium. To maintain osmolarity in the control solution, 2 mM NMDG were added to 96 mM lithium. To isolate the pre-steady-state currents, the specific rGAT-1 blocker, 1-(4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl)-3-piperidine carboxylic acid hydrochloride (SKF89976A) (Tocris), was used at a final concentration of 30 &#x000b5;M. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature.</p><p><bold>Cell surface biotinylation.</bold> The cell surface expression of GAT-1 and the mutants was tested using a membrane-impermeant reagent, EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce). Groups of five to ten oocytes were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS, pH 8, and then incubated twice on ice in 750 &#x000b5;l PBS containing EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (1.3 mg/ml) for 15 min. After labeling, the oocytes were rinsed with ice-cold PBS, incubated in 50 mM glycine in PBS for 15 min on ice in order to quench the unreacted biotinylation reagent, and then dissolved in lysis buffer (in mM: NaCl 150, Tris/HCl 20, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, EDTA 5) supplemented with 10 &#x000b5;l/ml of the protease inhibitors leupeptin and aprotinin by means of gentle shaking on ice for 40 min. The solubilized oocytes were centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 g, and the biotinylated proteins were recovered from the supernatant solution by adding 50 &#x000b5;l ImmunoPure Immobilised Streptavidin beads (Pierce), and incubating for 1.5 h with gentle agitation on ice. The beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer and once with 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5. The final pellets were resuspended in the appropriate SDS sample buffer and incubated for 2 min at 100 &#x000b0;C before being loaded onto an 8&#x02013;10% polyacrylamide gel for SDS/PAGE. Total samples were obtained by heating 1/10 of the lysates in SDS sample buffer at 100 &#x000b0;C for 2 min, followed by SDS-PAGE. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and GAT-1 was detected by means of ECL (Amersham) using an affinitypurified antibody to the COOH-terminal tail of GAT-1 at a 1:1500 dilution and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution. All of the antibody, blocking and washing solutions contained 5% milk to minimize the appearance of non-specific bands. The cell surface expression of GAT Q291 mutants was quantified by means of densitometric analysis using Scion Image software.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><bold>Analysis of Q291 mutants.</bold> A sequence-alignment analysis of about 250 proteins belonging to the family of Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-dependent neurotransmitter transporters (ranging from prokaryotes to human proteins) identified the most conserved residues of the family (see fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for an extract of this analysis). One of the three most conserved residues was Q291 (GAT-1 numbering), as 97.5% of the sequences have a glutamine residue in the corresponding position. According to secondary-structure prediction algorithms, GAT-1 Q291 is located on the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal side of the sixth TM domain or on the COOH-terminal portion of the third extracellular loop (fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the role of glutamine 291 in GAT-1 function, we used site-directed mutagenesis to delete the residue or replace it with different amino acids. The mutant proteins were expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes and compared with the WT transporter. The deletion of Q291 or its substitution by the amino acids leucine, asparagine or glutamate caused a complete loss of function. None of the mutants was capable of transporting GABA (fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>), and electrophysiological measurements showed that they were unable to generate transport-coupled currents (fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>), pre-steady-state currents (fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>) or lithium leak currents (data not shown). <fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Transport activity and cell surface expression of WT GAT- 1 and Q291 mutants.

As previously reported, WT GAT-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and the mutants were represented by a &#x02248;60-kDa band and an upper band compatible with a dimeric aggregate of the transporter. The specificity of the antibody is shown by the lack of labeling in the control lanes, which represent samples prepared from uninjected oocytes. All of the mutant proteins reached the plasma membrane, which indicates that the deletion or substitution of Q291 did not impair GAT-1 cell surface targeting and thus ruled out the hypothesis of defective targeting as the cause of their lack of activity.</p><p><bold>Coexpression experiments.</bold> Transport proteins are frequently oligomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], but the significance of the protein quaternary structure in transport activity has been elucidated in only a few cases. With the exception of glycine transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], most neurotransmitter transporters form constitutive oligomers. GAT-1 oligomers have been visualized in living cells by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and some interaction motifs have been shown to support the association of TM domains in GAT-1 and related transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The characteristics of the Q291 mutants made them good candidates for coexpression experiments designed to investigate the role of GAT-1 oligomerization, because they are non-functional but expressed at the cell surface and also capable of quaternary assembly (fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). The involvement of Q291 in oligomerization can also be excluded by evidence that the export of GAT-1 and other members of the family to the plasma membrane is dependent on oligomerization (see Discussion).</p><p>If the transporter functions only as an oligomer, the coexpression of WT and a correctly inserted non-functional mutant should impair the transport activity of the WT. The coinjection of equal, non-saturating amounts of WT and mutant GAT-1 cRNAs did not have any appreciable effect on WT-mediated GABA transport (fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), even after the coinjection of the WT and mutant in a 1:2 ratio which could possibly favor the effect of the mutant on the WT (data not shown). This was observed after the coexpression of WT GAT-1 with the mutants Q291L, <italic>&#x00394;</italic>291, Q291N and Q291E, as well as with the mutant Y140F which is known to be expressed at the cell surface but is non-functional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. As these mutants are not retained intracellularly and are capable of quaternary assembly, their coexpression with the WT should produce a mixture of oligomers consisting of pure WT, pure mutated, and heteromeric oligomers. The absence of any effect of mutant coexpression on WT transport activity indicates that a pure WT oligomer is not required for sodium-coupled GABA transport; in other words, although it requires oligomeric assembly for efficient surface targeting, GAT- 1 seems to be a functional monomer. <fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Coexpression of WT GAT-1 and mutants Q291L, <italic>&#x00394;</italic>291, Q291N, Q291E and Y140F.

Furthermore, the accessibility of the cysteine introduced into the C74A/Q291C mutant could not be determined using the cysteine-specific biotinylation reagent MTSEA-biotin (N-biotinylaminoethylmethanethiosulfonate) as WT GAT-1 and also the C74A/C399A mutant, lacking the main targets of both permeant and impermeant MTS reagents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], are labeled by MTSEA-biotin.

A detailed analysis of these currents in a control solution containing 98 mM sodium confirmed WT-like behavior: fitting the sigmoid Q/V curve (empty squares in fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>) with a Boltzmann function gave a V<sub>1/2</sub> value of &#x02212;27 &#x000b1; 2 mV (n=8), similar to the WT value in the same batch (&#x02212;26 &#x000b1; 1 mV, n=3, not shown). The analysis of the charge equilibration rate (empty squares in fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8F</xref>) also confirmed that the mutation did not alter the biophysical parameters of the transporter. MTSET treatment greatly impaired C74A/T290C transient currents, which could only be seen at depolarized potentials (fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8D</xref>). The results of the integration of these transients (plotted as filled squares in fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>) have been arbitrarily shifted along the ordinate axis to match the charge value before MTSET treatment at negative potential. Although this Q/V curve is clearly far from reaching saturation at positive potential, there was a significant rightward shift of the sigmoid, with an estimated V1/2 value of <sup>+</sup>27 &#x000b1; 8 mV (filled squares in fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>), and the alteration can also be seen in the rate of decay (filled squares in fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8F</xref>). This effect may be related to the increased Na<sup>+</sup> leak current shown in figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. Furthermore, a shift of the Q/V curve toward more positive potentials may be interpreted as an increase in sodium affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. To examine further whether MTSET incubation alters the interaction of the transporter with cations, we considered the lithium leak current. Like many other cotransporters of this family, GAT-1 also has uncoupled or leakage currents (i.e. transmembrane currents in the absence of organic substrate) that are best seen in the presence of lithium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>When lithium was perfused at a concentration of 98 mM, the mutated C74A/T290C transporter showed the same uncoupled current as the WT (not shown), thus confirming that the double mutations did not affect the function of the transporter. After incubation with MTSET, there was an increase in the lithium current at all tested potentials (circles in fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9B</xref>); the fact that this was not seen in the C74A mutant (fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9A</xref>) suggests that it is due to the MTSET-induced modification of the cysteine introduced in position 290. As shown in figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9C</xref>, the increase in lithium current measured at &#x02212;40 mV membrane potential was significantly different. The uncoupled lithium current exhibited by WT GAT-1 has been shown to be noncompetitively inhibited by the presence of even small amounts of sodium ions, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of about 1.5 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. As we have shown that cysteine-modifying reagents alter the interaction of cations with the double-mutated transporter by increasing both sodium and lithium leakage currents, we further tested if sodium inhibition was altered by MTSET. The lithium currents were recorded from C74A/T290C-expressing oocytes before and after 15 min treatment with 2 mM MTSET, in both the absence and presence of 2 mM sodium. The sodium concentration was chosen because, as it is above the reported IC<sub>50</sub>, it reduces the lithium current to about 30% of the control condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The analysis was made after subtracting the recording obtained in the presence of SKF89976A in 96 mM Na<sup>+</sup>. For each experimental condition, the current values (in both the absence and presence of sodium) were normalized with respect to the value in control condition (96 mM Li<sup>+</sup> and absence of Na<sup>+</sup>) at &#x02212;140 mV. Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9C</xref> shows that, under control conditions, the presence of 2 mM Na<sup>+</sup> blocks the lithium leakage current to the same extent as in the WT. After MTSET treatment, this inhibition was not abolished or affected in any way, and the residual currents under the two conditions were not significantly different. Furthermore, the blockade was not significantly different when compared with the WT (data not shown). The introduction of bulk and charge by the MTSET-induced modification of position 290 therefore significantly increases the apparent affinity of the transporter for cations, but does not modify the non-competitive inhibition of lithium currents by sodium ions. <fig id="Fig9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Lithium currents in the C74A and C74A/T290C mutants.

All of our conservative and non-conservative mutations of Q291 abolished the function of GAT-1, as they showed no GABA transport (fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) or any kind of current (fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) even though they were sorted to the plasma membrane (fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). As the substitution or deletion of Q291 did not impair the cell surface targeting of GAT-1 in oocytes (fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>) and cells (immunofluorescence experiments, data not shown), we can rule out defective targeting as the reason for the inactivity of the Q291 mutants. Furthermore, the involvement of Q291 in oligomerization can be excluded, because GAT-1 requires correct quaternary assembly for its efficient exit from endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent delivery to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The fact that the Q291 mutants were expressed on the cell surface indicates that they form oligomers, and all of them showed the dimeric form of the protein even under experimental denaturing conditions (fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Worth noting is that Hastrup et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] replaced cysteines in TMD 6 at positions 317&#x02013;321 (corresponding to GAT 291&#x02013;295) in a cysteine-depleted dopamine transporter (DAT) construct, and found that the replacement of DAT Q317, F320 and S321 with cysteine was not tolerated because these constructs were not expressed at the cell surface (at least in the cysteine-depleted DAT background).</p><p>Although Q291 does not seem to be involved in oligomerization, our results do not rule out the possibility that it may promote the association of TM helices within the same monomer. As it is a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, glutamine may interact with the polar residues of other TM helices and/or with substrates that could intervene as alternative hydrogen-bonding partners in place of other hydrophilic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>With the exception of the glycine transporter (GLYT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], neurotransmitter transporters (such as GAT, the serotonin transporter SERT and DAT) exist in the membrane as dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], or dimers of dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Moreover, there is good evidence that the export of GAT-1 and other members of the family to the plasma membrane depends on oligomerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Mutant transporters in the membrane that lack transport activity can be used to investigate the functional role of the quaternary assembly of the protein by means of a functional approach based on coexpression experiments. Assuming that the assembly of monomeric proteins is a random process, and that only dimers of two WT monomers or tetramers of four WT monomers are functional, the coexpression of WT and correctly sorted non-functional mutants should affect WT transport activity. However, the data in figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> show that the coexpression of WT and correctly sorted non-functional GAT-1 mutants did not have any effect on GABA transport, thus suggesting that GAT-1 is fully functional as a monomer. Similar results were obtained when mutant expression was increased from 1:1 to 1:2. Sodium-coupled GABA transport therefore does not seem to require oligomerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], which is known to be important for protein stability and some aspects of membrane physiology, such as transporter trafficking and modulation. The atomic structure of LeuT<sub>Aa</sub> is also consistent with the idea that the monomer is the functional unit of the transporter because, although it forms a dimer in the crystal, each monomer has independent binding sites defined by transmembrane helices provided by the single monomer. In contrast, dominance effects have been observed in DAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and SERT coexpression experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], thus suggesting that oligomerization plays a functional role in such transporters. Furthermore, Seidel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] have demonstrated that the efflux and influx of organic substrates occur through distinct moieties within an oligomeric neurotransmitter transporter.</p><p>Mutants of the Q291 residue lack all transport activity, including the so-called pre-steady-state current that represents a partial and initial step in the transport cycle (figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This current is quantitatively related to the current coupled to the GABA transport and is believed to be strictly linked to the interaction of sodium with the transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. As most of the proposed mechanistic models explaining the operational mode of GAT-1 assume that the first event is sodium binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], probably followed by conformational transitions that allow GABA recognition and transport, we speculated that the Q291 mutants may be unable to start the transport cycle because of their inability to recognize or bind sodium. It is worth noting that, defective GABA recognition cannot explain some of the experimental data, such as the lack of transient and leak currents in the Q291 mutants.</p><p>Given that none of the mutants were functional (including C74A/Q291C), we attempted to clarify the role of Q291 further by investigating the accessibility of some adjacent residues from the external milieu. The strong inhibition exerted by the impermeant MTS reagents on C74A/T290C and C74A/S295C (figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) suggests that the cysteine residues introduced into these mutants (respectively before and one helix turn below Q291) face the external aqueous environment or a water-filled cavity communicating with the external milieu.</p><p>These data are in agreement with the structure of the bacterial homologue solved by Yamashita et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The residues corresponding to GAT Q291 and the other amino acids replaced by cysteine in the present study (figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A, C</xref>) are located in the LeuT<sub>Aa</sub> in the external half of TMD 6 (called TM6a by Yamashita et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]) or in the central, non-helical portion of TMD 6: in particular, the GAT positions that partially tolerate cysteine substitution (GAT-1 residues T290 and S295; fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), correspond to G249 and T254 of LeuT<sub>Aa</sub>. In the conformation of LeuT<sub>Aa</sub> reported by Yamashita et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], G249 is located one helix turn above the leucine- and Na1 binding sites, and is likely to face the hydrophilic pathway leading to the binding sites, which would be in line with the external accessibility of the corresponding GAT T290 (fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). LeuT<sub>Aa</sub> T254 is involved in the binding of both leucine and sodium, which is consistent with the fact that the corresponding GAT S295 is accessible from the external milieu (fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). LeuT<sub>Aa</sub> F253 (corresponding to GAT F294, which does not tolerate cysteine replacement; fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), is involved in the binding of leucine and is ultimately connected to Na<sup>+</sup> via a hydrogen bond network.</p><p>As shown in figures <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, the sulfhydryl modification of GAT C74A/T290C, with its bulk and its charge, affected both transport-associated and pre-steady-state currents, and greatly impaired the transport of [<sup>3</sup>H]GABA. It has to be noted that, apart from its reduced activity, the untreated double-mutated transporter behaved like the WT (fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) but, after incubation with MTSET, its affinity for sodium was increased and the GABA-induced currents could no longer be seen. The positive shift observed in the Q/V curve (fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>) after MTSET treatment is an indication of the greater apparent affinity of the transporter for sodium ions. The transporter seems to be locked in a particular step of the transport cycle (probably in the outward-facing conformation), an effect that is reminiscent of the W68L GAT-1 mutant studied by Mager et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Obviously, in our case, the transporter cannot complete the cycle, and so we were unable to see transport-associated currents even in the presence of 3 mM GABA (figs. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>, <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8A</xref>), possibly because the steric hindrance and charge introduced by the MTSET modification does not allow the completion of the transport cycle, for example by preventing GABA binding or translocation. This hypothesis is supported by the structure reported by Yamashita et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which shows residue G249 (T290 in GAT) close to the leucine-binding site, and so the sulfhydryl modification of a cysteine introduced in this position may hamper the leucine binding.</p><p>The change in the behavior of C74A/T290C is consistent with the involvement of this residue in cation recognition or binding, as is also suggested by the increase in the uncoupled or leakage current after incubation with MTSET at a wide range of voltages (fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>).</p><p>The data presented in this work are compatible with the involvement of GAT Q291 in direct interaction with the cations and/or in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of an external region of the protein that makes it accessible to cations. The size of this water-filled cavity, which should be at least 6 &#x000c5; wide, makes it too large to be a cation-binding site, regardless of whether the cation is hydrated or not, because the calculated molecular dimensions of MTSET and MTSES are respectively 11.5&#x000d7;6.0 &#x000c5; and 12.0&#x000d7;6.0 &#x000c5; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. However, as in LeuT<sub>Aa</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], GAT 290 and 295 could face a larger than expected water-accessible cavity that harbors the driving ion together with the driven GABA molecule.</p><p>Alternatively, as the correct positioning of the coordinating atoms is fundamental, Q291 may contribute to a hydrogen bond network that stabilizes various residues on the external surface of the transporter. This kind of structure could keep the transporter in an open conformation capable of interacting with substrates. Possibly, the mutation of Q291 could make the transporter inaccessible to cations. However, whether the role of Q291 is to bind or direct the cations to inner domains of the protein, it is clear that it also involves other residues. We tested the possibility of a polar interaction between the highly conserved R69 of the extracellular half of TMD 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Q291 but, unfortunately, the mutants R69Q/Q291R and R69L/Q291L did not show any recovery of activity in terms of GABA uptake or currents (data not shown).</p><p>The crystal structure of LeuT<sub>Aa</sub> solved by Gouaux&#x02019;s group represents a particular conformation during the transport cycle, when the binding pocket is occluded and the external and internal gates are closed. In this structure, Q250 (which corresponds to GAT Q291) is a key interacting residue at the extracellular gate of the transporter, and effectively part of a hydrogen bond network that ultimately connects Q250 to the sodium ion. Moreover, R30 (which corresponds to GAT R69) takes part in this same hydrogen bond network and interacts with Q250. Both the R30 and Q250 residues interact with other key residues on top of the binding pocket. In particular, R30 forms a water-mediated salt link with D404 of TMD 10. This explains why the GAT mutants R69Q/Q291R and R69L/Q291L do not recover any activity although the residues R69 and Q291 are probably spatially close and directly interact as in LeuT<sub>Aa</sub>.</p><p>This crystal structure confirms that GAT Q291 is fundamental to maintaining the conformational integrity of an external region of the transporter that makes it accessible to the substrates, and we can speculate that it may even directly interact with the cations as the substrates move to the binding pocket. Other structures representing different transporter conformations will probably clear up this question. However, as Q291 is strictly conserved throughout the Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family, it is likely to play similar or related roles in all of these proteins.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Dr. S.
