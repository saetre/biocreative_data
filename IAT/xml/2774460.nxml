VKC is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the conjunctiva and is characterized by marked tissue remodeling.

The disease is characterized by an allergic phenotype with infiltration of lymphocytes (mostly Th2), eosinophils, and mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. In VKC, Th2 inflammation is associated with marked tissue remodeling as shown by fibroblast (FBs) activation, epithelial growth, subepithelial fibrosis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, resulting in giant papillae formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. ECM analysis has shown a substantial increase in total collagen (procollagen and types I, III, and IV collagen), with an altered collagen ratio, both in tears and conjunctiva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>].Increased ECM is referred to increased expression of cytokines and growth factors, from either Th2-type and other inflammatory cells, which are known to stimulate resident/activated FBs to overproduce ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Overt production and deposition of ECM eventually results from an unbalance between collagen production and Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP1, MMP2 and MMP9) activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>].</p><p>A variety of inflammatory- and stromal-derived cytokines, such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, IL-4, IL-13, and IL-6, and growth factors, such as transforming growth factor &#x003b2;1 (TGF&#x003b2;1) have been reported to cause chronic inflammation, structural changes, tissue remodeling, as well as fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. All these factors are increased in the peripheral blood, tears, and conjunctiva of patients with VKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>].</p><p>To date, TGF&#x003b2;1 represents the main profibrogenic factor responsible for the imbalance in ECM metabolism as well as for the chemoattraction and survival of FBs and myoFBs. Interestingly, nerve growth factor (NGF) has been recently prospected as another factor playing a role in stromal-epithelial interaction during wound-healing and tissue repair processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Certainly, NGF is significantly increased in both serum and conjunctiva of patients with VKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>].</p><p>We previously reported a profibrogenic NGF effect on in vitro primary cultures of healthy conjunctival FBs (healthy-FBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Since nothing is known about the possible role of NGF (increased in VKC-affected conjunctiva) on primary cultures of VKC conjunctival FBs (VKC-FBs), we exposed these cells to increasing NGF concentrations. In addition, some in vitro parameters of tissue remodeling were evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, sterile tissue culture plastic-ware and analytical grade reagents were from NUNC (Roskilde, Denmark), SERVA (Weidelberg, Germany), ICN (Costa Mesa, CA), Euroclone (Milan, Italy), and Invitrogen-Gibco (Paisley, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and experimental procedure</title><p>FBs were isolated from the upper tarsal VKC (n=3; 3M, range 11-15, mean age 12.67&#x000b1;2.08) and sex/age matched healthy (n=3) conjunctiva. Informed consent was given by the parents of each patient and the approval of the Intramural Ethic Committee was granted, in conformity to the Declaration of Helsinki. The diagnosis of active VKC was based on history, clinical examination and the presence of eosinophils in conjunctival biopsy. Clinical scores (0-3: 0, absent; 1, weak; 2, mild; 3, severe) for each ocular symptom (itching, tearing, photophobia and foreign body sensation) and each sign (conjunctival hyperemia, mucous discharge, papillae and corneal epithelial erosion) were assigned at the time of examination. Total symptom (range 0-3) and sign scores (0-12) were calculated showing: total symptom score of 7.33&#x000b1;4.51 and total sign score of 8.67&#x000b1;3.05. The three patients showing lid-ptosis were submitted to surgical removal of the papillae that were processed in this study.</p><p>Biopsies were put as explants in 24-well plates and left to attach for 10 min, before adding medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin. Cells outgrowing from biopsies (37 &#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air, by 1 week), were quickly trypsinized (0.2% trypsin/0.025% EDTA), assessed for the absence of epithelial cell contaminants (cytokeratin 19, 1:100; Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) and screened as mycoplasm free cultures (otherwise treated for 1 generation with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml Mycoplasm Removal Agent; ICN).

Moreover, VKC-FBs are mainly represented by myoFBs, since a consistent proportion of VKC-FBs were &#x003b1;SMA positive.</p><p>Various Th2-derived cytokines and growth factors are increased in blood, tears, and conjunctiva from VKC patients. These profibrotic factors were found able to drive the cross-talk between structural (epithelium and FBs) and inflammatory (lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells) cells. This cell-factor interaction contributes to the chronic inflammatory process, giant papillae formation and tissue remodeling, as observed in VKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>].

Older and more recent data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>] indicate that NGF is a pleiotrophic factor participating to the control of inflammatory responses, tissue repair, fibrosis, and remodeling in different tissues. Primary cultures of healthy-FBs have been found to be modulated by NGF with relation to cell migration, differentiation, and contraction of a cell matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>Since stromal FBs represent the major target/effector cells involved in tissue remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>] and since NGF activates in vitro healthy-FBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>], we sough to evaluate the possible modulation of FBs isolated from conjunctiva of patients with VKC by NGF, hence no data are available in literature.</p><p>In the present study, increased expression of NGF, associated with increased expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> and &#x003b1;SMA, was detected in VKC-FBs as compared with conjunctival healthy-FBs. In addition, &#x003b1;SMA was found expressed in FBs showing light upregulation of trkA<sup>NGFR</sup> and considerable upregulation of p75<sup>NTR</sup>, suggesting a specific role for NGF in VKC-FBs. In line with the effect of NGF in driving the differentiation of healthy FBs into myoFBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>], we wondered whether NGF supplementation to VKC-FBs cultures would result in a further VKC-FB differentiation, evaluated as &#x003b1;SMA expression. Interestingly, NGF failed to further increase &#x003b1;SMA expression in VKC-FBs, unless p75<sup>NTR</sup> was blocked (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>; light bars). This data is of great interest, since it suggests two possible hypothesis: (1) NGF plays a differentiating effect through the specific and unique binding to trkA<sup>NGFR</sup> (NGF is a specific receptor), but not p75<sup>NTR</sup> (the pan-neurotrophin receptor); and (2) the specific expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup>, by myoFB phenotype (otherwise absent in FBs), seems to play a switch-off effect in the further differentiating action of NGF, suggesting that NGF plays a modulatory rather than a exclusive stimulatory effect on the fibrotic process. The answer might lie in trkA<sup>NGFR</sup>/p75<sup>NTR</sup> multifaceted functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>].</p><p>On the other side in VKC tissue remodeling process, NGF might modulate collagen production and might influence MMP2/MMP9 production/activity, as previously demonstrated for other growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. ECM metabolism is heavily impaired in VKC, due to a substantial increase in total collagen deposition in the conjunctiva (mainly types I, III, and IV), and an increased release of MMP2/MMP9 in the tears [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. In this study, the expression of type-I collagen decreased significantly after NGF exposure, rather quite specific given that this effect was not observed for type-IV collagen or with the addition of TGF&#x003b2;1 (data not shown). In addition, NGF was able to induce specifically MMP9 expression/activity by VKC-FBs at both molecular, biochemical and functional levels. This effect was not observed in healthy-FBs, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest a many-sided role of NGF in VKC tissue remodeling. NGF is increased in VKC blood and tarsal conjunctiva and likewise in tears [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. In in vitro studies, NGF induces the differentiation of healthy conjunctival FBs into myoFBs, the main effector and target cells of fibrotic process. This differentiating effect was not observed in VKC-derived conjunctival FBs in the present study. Additionally, NGF induced a decrease in type I collagen and an increase in MMP9 expression by VKC-FBs with no specific effect on both MMP1 and MMP2 mRNA expression. It has been previously reported that both MMP2 and MMP9 degrade types IV and V collagen; MMP9 can also degrade types I and type III collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. One possible explanation for these data might be related to the well-known singular action of NGF due to changes in the balance between trkA<sup>NGFR</sup>/p75<sup>NTR</sup> expression. In this study we demonstrated a role of trkA<sup>NGFR</sup> in the differentiating effect of NGF on FBs; however, the role of p75<sup>NTR</sup> on VKC-FB function seems complex and remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In VKC, various growth factors and Th2-cytokines are produced by inflammatory/stromal cells. In line with other studies, these factors have been proposed to modulate tissue remodeling in VKC. To summarize, our in vitro findings showing the NGF modulation of both type I collagen and MMP9, might propose NGF as an active contributor in VKC remodeling.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was presented in part at the 2005 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
