The recent identification of causative genetic alterations has revealed mutations in signaling pathways that offer targets for therapy. Identifying morphologic surrogates that can identify patients whose tumors express such alterations (or functionally equivalent alterations) would be clinically useful for therapy stratification and for retrospective analysis of clinical trial data.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We defined and assessed a panel of histomorphologic measures and correlated them with the mutation status of the oncogenes <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>NRAS</italic> in a cohort of 302 archival tissues of primary cutaneous melanomas from an academic comprehensive cancer center. Melanomas with <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations showed distinct morphological features such as increased upward migration and nest formation of intraepidermal melanocytes, thickening of the involved epidermis, and sharper demarcation to the surrounding skin; and they had larger, rounder, and more pigmented tumor cells (all <italic>p</italic>-values below 0.0001). By contrast, melanomas with <italic>NRAS</italic> mutations could not be distinguished based on these morphological features. Using simple combinations of features, <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation status could be predicted with up to 90.8&#x00025; accuracy in the entire cohort as well as within the categories of the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Among the variables routinely recorded in cancer registries, we identified age &#x0003c; 55 y as the single most predictive factor of <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation in our cohort. Using age &#x0003c; 55 y as a surrogate for <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation in an independent cohort of 4,785 patients of the Southern German Tumor Registry, we found a significant survival benefit (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) for patients who, based on their age, were predicted to have <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant melanomas in 69&#x00025; of the cases.

UV radiation damages the DNA in skin cells and can introduce permanent genetic changes (mutations) into the skin cells that allow them to divide uncontrollably to form a tumor, a disorganized mass of cells. Because there are many different cell types in the skin, there are many types of skin cancer. The most dangerous type&#x02014;melanoma&#x02014;develops when genetic changes occur in melanocytes, the cells that produce the skin pigment melanin. Although only 4&#x00025; of skin cancers are melanomas, 80&#x00025; of skin cancer deaths are caused by melanomas. The first signs of a melanoma are often a change in the appearance or size of a mole (a pigmented skin blemish that is also called a nevus) or a newly arising pigmented lesion that looks different from the other moles (an &#x0201c;ugly duckling&#x0201d;). If this early sign is noticed and the melanoma is diagnosed before it has spread from the skin into other parts of the body, surgery can sometimes provide a cure. But, for more advanced melanomas, the outlook is generally poor. Although radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy (drugs that stimulate the immune system to kill the cancer cells) can prolong the life expectancy of some patients, these treatments often fail to remove all of the cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Now, however, scientists have identified some of the genetic alterations that cause melanoma. For example, they know that many melanomas carry mutations in either the <italic>BRAF</italic> gene or the <italic>NRAS</italic> gene, and that the proteins made from these mutated genes (&#x0201c;oncogenes&#x0201d;) help cancer cells to grow uncontrollably. The hope is that targeted drugs designed to block the activity of oncogenic <italic>BRAF</italic> or <italic>NRAS</italic> might stop the growth of those melanomas that make these altered proteins. But how can the patients with these specific tumors be identified in the clinic? The expression of altered proteins is likely to affect the microscopic growth patterns (&#x0201c;histomorphology&#x0201d;) of melanomas. However, the current histomorphology-based classification system for melanomas, which distinguishes four main types of melanoma, does not help clinicians choose the best treatment for their patients. In this study, the researchers have tried to improve melanoma classification by looking for correlations between histomorphological features and genetic alterations in a large collection of melanomas.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers examined several histomorphological features in more than 300 melanoma samples and used statistical methods to correlate these features with the mutation status of <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>NRAS</italic> in the tumors. They found that some individual histomorphological features were strongly associated with the <italic>BRAF</italic> (but not the <italic>NRAS</italic>) mutation status of the tumors. For example, melanomas with <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations had more melanocytes in the upper layers of the epidermis (the outermost layer of the skin) than did those without <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations (melanocytes usually live at the bottom of the epidermis). Then, by combining several individual histomorphological features, the researchers built a model that correctly predicted the <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation status of more than 90&#x00025; of the melanomas. They also found that, among the variables routinely recorded in cancer registries, being younger than 55 years old was the single most predictive factor for <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations. Finally, in another large group of patients with melanoma, the researchers found that those patients predicted to have a <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation on the basis of their age survived longer than those patients predicted not to have a <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation using the same criterion.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings suggest that an improved classification of melanomas that combines an analysis of known genetic factors with histomorphological features might divide melanomas into subgroups that are likely to differ in terms of their clinical outcome and responses to targeted therapies when they become available. Additional studies are needed to investigate whether the histomorphological features identified here can be readily assessed in clinical settings and whether different observers will agree on the scoring of these features. The classification model defined by the researchers also needs to be validated and refined in independent groups of patients. Nevertheless, these findings represent an important first step toward helping clinicians improve outcomes for patients with melanoma.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050120">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050120</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A related <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&#x00026;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050122"><italic>PLoS Medicine</italic> Research in Translation</ext-link> article is available</p></list-item><list-item><p>The MedlinePlus encyclopedia provides information for patients about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000850.htm">melanoma</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The US National Cancer Institute provides information for patients and health professionals about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/melanoma">melanoma</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cancer Research UK also provides detailed information about the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/menuforthistopic.asp?page=2788">melanoma</ext-link></p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Viros A, Fridlyand J, Bauer J, Lasithiotakis K, Garbe C, et al.

The current World Health Organization (WHO) classification of skin tumors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;, which is an extension of the revised Sydney classification from 1986 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b002">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, distinguishes four main types of melanoma; superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM), nodular melanoma (NM), and acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM). These distinctions are based on the observation that certain combinations of morphological features of the microscopic growth pattern of melanoma during its early progression phase are associated with clinical features such as anatomic site of the primary tumor, pace of tumor evolution, and patient age. Although these proposed categories undoubtedly represent prototypical instances or archetypes of the clinical and histopathological presentations that are valuable for teaching purposes, their impact on clinical management has been limited. A major reason is that no significant difference in overall survival or treatment responses could be demonstrated between the categories when tumors of equivalent tumor thickness were compared or after metastasis had occurred &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, these subtypes are defined by multiple criteria, each assessing complex morphological patterns, resulting in a wide range of possible presentations. Thus a considerable portion of melanomas are differentially classified by multiple observers, or are classified as &#x0201c;ambiguous&#x0201d; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Some have questioned the existence of biologically distinct melanoma types altogether, proposing that the morphological differences are entirely secondary to the anatomic site in which the tumor arises &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;, or, in the case of NM, are a consequence of differences in the pace of tumor evolution &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In order to establish whether a disease is composed of distinct subtypes it is necessary to integrate clinicopathological features with the underlying biologic factors and identify disease groups that are homogeneous in their etiology, clinical behavior, and management requirements. These subtypes, if found, would then form the basis of a clinically useful classification system. In cancer, genetic alterations can serve as biomarkers for classification purposes, in particular if they are causally linked to the disease process. With the advent of therapeutics targeted to genes and signaling pathways, these oncogenic mutations are gaining direct importance for clinical management. But knowledge of the critical constitutional and somatic genetic factors is currently incomplete. Since the clinical characteristics of a tumor must be, at least in part, genetically determined, elucidation of the phenotypic consequences of currently known genetic factors will reveal aspects of their function and highlight gaps in knowledge, which may guide future discovery. More immediately, clinicopathological features that are associated with specific genetic factors provide an attractive basis on which to build a refined classification system that is practical to implement and useful for patient management.</p><p>Recently, we described distinct patterns of chromosomal aberrations and mutations in oncogenes such as <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>KIT</italic> that correlated more with the site of the primary tumor and the degree of chronic sun-induced damage of the surrounding skin than with the traditional melanoma types &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

Together, these findings strongly support the existence of distinct melanoma subtypes, but also indicate that these are insufficiently captured by the existing classification system. Using previously recognized morphological features of primary melanoma, we performed a detailed phenotypic characterization of a large cohort of primary melanomas and correlated those features with the mutation status of <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>NRAS</italic>, the most commonly mutated oncogenes known in melanoma. Specifically, we defined simple histomorphologic features that can be reproducibly scored in routinely stained sections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Tumor Specimens and Mutation Analysis</title><p>A total of 302 cases of primary cutaneous melanoma that have been part of previous genetic analyses were included in this study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation data of exon 15, which includes codon 600, were available from all samples. <italic>NRAS</italic> mutation data of exons 1 and 2 for samples were available from a previously published subset of the samples &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, and were obtained for the remainder of the cases using our standard protocols &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

The phenotypic characteristics that we focused on in our measurements comprised &#x0201c;elementary&#x0201d; features that mostly are combined in various ways in the WHO classification. For example, in the WHO classification the features &#x0201c;lentiginous&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;pagetoid&#x0201d; growth are prominently used as opposing ends of a spectrum of intraepidermal growth. However, both lentiginous and pagetoid are &#x0201c;complex&#x0201d; patterns composed of several separable features including (a) whether the neoplastic melanocytes are scattered throughout all layers of the epidermis (in pagetoid) or are situated in the basal layer (in lentiginous); (b) whether the cells are arranged partially in nests (in pagetoid) or predominantly as single units (in lentiginous); and (c) whether the melanocytes are enlarged and round (in pagetoid) or small with scalloped contours or spindled (in lentiginous). Therefore to describe intraepidermal growth we defined and assessed features termed: scatter, nest formation, size and shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050120-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Similar to the WHO classification, we focused our evaluation of the features primarily on the early progression phases, e.g., the RGP of the tumor in the expectation that this would be the most informative regarding its &#x0201c;histogenetic&#x0201d; origin.</p><table-wrap id="pmed-0050120-t001" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical Characteristics of Patients and Melanomas by Mutation Status of <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>NRAS</italic> Included in Our Analysis</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pmed.0050120.t001"/></table-wrap><p>All features were visually scored in the 302 tumors by one of us (AV).

Several are highly significant. Since most of the features are assessed as ordinal variables, the ORs reflect the increase (or decrease) of the odds per unit increment. For example in the comparison of nesting between melanomas with and without <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations (first column), the OR of 3.11 indicates the increase in odds for one increment of the ordinal scale for scatter (e.g., nesting 1 to nesting 2). To calculate the odds for an increment of two the indicated OR should be squared. Compared to melanomas without <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations, melanomas with <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations showed statistically significantly higher degrees of intraepidermal scatter of melanocytes, and a higher proportion of melanocytes arranged in nests. In addition, the epidermis of the RGP of melanomas with <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations was more commonly thickened compared to the surrounding skin, i.e., the score for the &#x0201c;epidermal contour&#x0201d; had a higher average value, and the transition from the tumor into the surrounding skin tended to be more abrupt than in melanomas without <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations, i.e., &#x0201c;lateral circumscription&#x0201d; had a higher average score. Furthermore, the tumor cells of <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutated melanomas were larger, had a rounder shape, and showed a higher degree of pigmentation than cells in tumors without <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations. As we reported previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, melanomas with <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations also had a lower degree of solar elastosis in the surrounding skin than melanomas without <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations.</p><table-wrap id="pmed-0050120-t003" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of Morphological Variables Depending on the Mutation Status of <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>NRAS</italic></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pmed.0050120.t003"/></table-wrap><p>Given the significant univariate correlations, we employed several multivariate statistical approaches to define the most powerful combinations of variables for prediction of mutation status. These analyses produced a consistent set of variables that included the morphological features pigmentation, upward scatter, nesting of intraepidermal melanocytes, and cell shape. In addition, a younger age at diagnosis was independently associated with <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050120-st006">Table S6</xref>). The results of the multivariate analyses are most intuitively displayed using a binary classification tree since it defines a decision structure using specific thresholds for individual characteristics at each node. Classification trees developed using all clinical and morphologic variables correctly predicted <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation status with up to 82&#x00025; accuracy if one required a prediction for all tumors. Classification trees with high prediction accuracy also formed when only morphologic features were included in the model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050120-g003">Figure 3</xref>A shows one such tree, which has 76&#x00025; accuracy for predictions for all samples.

Resampling-based algorithms are well-known solutions for improving the accuracy of single classification trees. We used the Random Forest classifier, a method that grows many classification trees, each based on a different subset containing on average 66&#x00025; of the samples. The resulting collection of individual trees is referred to as &#x0201c;random forest.&#x0201d; The final prediction for each sample is the outcome of the majority vote of those trees in the forest that did not include that sample in their development.

As expected, random forests significantly improved the classification performance, correctly predicting <italic>BRAF</italic> status with 91.8&#x00025; accuracy using all variables, and 87&#x00025; using morphological variables only. In comparison, the probability for predicting <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation in this dataset by chance is about 50&#x00025;. Thus the conventional morphological parameters of a tumor are substantially affected by <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations. The performances of the different classification approaches we applied are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050120-st006">Table S6</xref>.</p><p>While the elementary morphological characteristics that contribute to the WHO classification system have a very strong relationship to <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation status, the WHO categories were not independently associated with <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation status since mutations are found in considerable proportions of all WHO categories, with the exception of ALM, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0050120-t001">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050120-g002">Figure 2</xref>. The strong relationship of the elementary characteristics to mutation status is emphasized by the fact that the same associations remained significant when the analyses were restricted to individual WHO categories, where the proportion of mutations ranged from 13&#x00025; in the Acral category to 52&#x00025; in the SSM category (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050120-st007">Table S7</xref>). These findings suggest that the elementary features can be combined to a refined classification algorithm yielding melanoma groups that are more homogeneous with regard to their underlying genetic alterations.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>BRAF</italic>, a different, much smaller, set of significant criteria was found in univariate comparisons between melanomas with <italic>NRAS</italic> mutations and melanomas with mutations in neither <italic>BRAF</italic> nor <italic>NRAS</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0050120-t003">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050120-st002">S2</xref>). However, the single tree classifier did not produce any significant splits indicating that the power of these variables to predict <italic>NRAS</italic> mutation status was limited.</p><p>We did not have sufficient outcome information of the patients in our cohort to test for differences between the melanoma groups formed by the classification tree of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050120-g003">Figure 3</xref>A. Since none of the morphological features assessed in our study is currently recorded in any tumor registry we also could not readily apply this approach to existing clinical cohorts. However, gender, patient age, WHO subtype, site of primary tumor, tumor thickness, and presence or absence of ulceration are routinely recorded in registries. Using these variables only on our data, a classification tree consisting of a stump (a tree with only two terminal nodes) was formed with age as the sole criterion for predicting <italic>BRAF</italic> status. Using this tree 69&#x00025; of the melanomas in patients under the age of 55 y had <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant tumors, while only 35.3 &#x00025; were <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant in older patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0050120-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).

In multivariate analysis, this age cutoff was associated with outcome independent of tumor thickness, anatomic site, and presence or absence of ulceration. In addition to a better prognosis, the group that, on the basis of their age, was more likely to have a <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant melanoma more frequently presented with metastases to regional nodes; whereas patients that, on the basis of their age, were less likely to have a <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant melanoma tended to have either localized or systemic metastases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0050120-st008">Table S8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we demonstrate that histopathological features of the primary tumor, many of which have been part of the WHO classification, provide substantial information on the mutation status of an important melanoma gene, <italic>BRAF</italic>. We found that phenotypic features such as increased upward scatter and nest formation of intraepidermal melanocytes; thickening of the involved epidermis; sharp demarcation from the surrounding skin; as well as the presence of a larger, rounder, and more pigmented tumor cells were distinguishing features of melanomas with <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation. This finding suggests that further research will reveal additional phenotypic associations with other genetic factors, including both germ line constitution of the patient and the somatic alterations in the tumor. In general it is not to be expected that single morphological parameters will be associated with individual genetic factors since it is likely that there will be interactions, or partial or functional redundancy, among them.</p><p>Results of genotype-phenotype studies can be applied in two directions. Starting with the genetics, the resulting phenotypes may allow generation of hypotheses concerning the function of a genetic factor. For example, our observation of increased melanin pigment in the tumor cells in melanomas with <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations is in line with recent reports of cooperation between <italic>BRAF</italic> and MITF in melanoma development. MITF is an important transcriptional regulator of pigmentation that is amplified in a subset of melanomas and cooperates with <italic>BRAF</italic> in transforming immortalized human melanocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. A link between <italic>BRAF</italic> and pigmentation is further supported by a recent independent observation that <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutant melanomas are also more pigmented macroscopically &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Our study also identified strong associations between upward scatter of intraepidermal melanocytes and formation of nests and <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation. Upward scatter is unlikely to be entirely attributable to <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations, as scatter is typically absent in nevi, many of which have <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that other genes cooperating with <italic>BRAF</italic> may be involved. By contrast, many nevi also show melanocytes arranged in nests and are sharply circumscribed, features that are also more frequent in <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutant melanomas. Studies to determine which of the features found here to be associated with <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant melanomas show similar genotype-phenotype associations in nevi are currently underway.</p><p>In the other direction, phenotypic characteristics that are conventionally assessed in the clinic can be used to develop a practical classification system in which the classes are genetically homogeneous, and thus more likely to provide information relevant to patient management. Such a system may provide valuable, outcome-related information from its classes even before the genetic factors of each class are completely understood. Such a classification system is likely to have an important clinical impact. To achieve this goal the practicability and interobserver reproducibility of the criteria that we defined need to be assessed in a clinical setting and the classification algorithms validated on independent cohorts of cases. Such efforts have been initiated and shown good to excellent interobserver agreements in scoring the features used in this study among expert pathologists (to be published separately).</p><p>Among the few variables in our study that overlapped with data recorded in large patient registries, age was the variable that best predicted <italic>BRAF</italic> status. A strong association between patient age at diagnosis and <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation status has been reported previously by us and others &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Using the age cutoff of 55 y determined in our experimental cohort, we found a significant difference in disease-specific and relapse-free (unpublished data) survival in an independent clinical cohort of 4,785 patients. Several previous studies including our own &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b032">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d; have not found significant survival differences between melanomas with and without <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation. However, the numbers of patients in these studies are comparably small, and this simple cutoff may be reflecting currently unknown genetic effects that interact with or substitute for <italic>BRAF</italic> mutations, and thus reveal significantly different clinical behavior. Future studies will be required to better understand the factors involved in this survival difference, hopefully resulting in improved ability to predict the future course of a particular tumor.</p><p>The presence of <italic>NRAS</italic> mutations was not strongly associated with the phenotypic measurements we performed. In the univariate analysis the majority of the OR point estimates for association with <italic>NRAS</italic> mutation are close to one, and so if true associations are present we would expect them to be much weaker than for <italic>BRAF</italic>. Multivariate analyses did not significantly enhance the prediction power. This dissimilarity could reflect differences in signaling between <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>NRAS</italic>, with <italic>NRAS</italic> having more pleiotropic effects. Larger numbers of cases and additional knowledge of equivalent genetic alterations in melanomas without <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>NRAS</italic> mutations are required to evaluate whether some of the features used here and/or others can further increase the discrimination between genetically defined subtypes. We have recently described activation of KIT by mutation and/or copy number increases in mucosal, acral, and CSD melanomas &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Too little tissue or DNA was left from the current cohort of cases to test for associations between KIT aberrations and any of our features.</p><p>Disease classification evolves from descriptions of a combination of symptoms (syndromes), to more refined definitions that integrate underlying causes. The increase in knowledge of underlying causative genetic alterations in melanoma offers an opportunity to reassess the syndromic classification scheme that emerged from the Sydney classification &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d; and its revision &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050120-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d; into the current WHO classification. The genotype-phenotype correlations discovered in our study testify to the intuition of the originators of the morphological classification scheme. The observation that simple combinations of features could predict <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation status independent of, and even within WHO subtypes, indicates that the morphological criteria we used can be employed to refine the existing classification, providing an opportunity to identify disease subsets that are genetically more homogenous. Our result represents but one step towards improved classification, and we expect it to be modified in light of future discoveries.</p><p>In the distant future when genetic knowledge is complete and targeted therapeutic options are numerous, the appropriate clinical work up of a patient is likely to be quite different from current practice. While initial diagnosis and aspects of staging will require histopathology, more subtle distinctions will employ molecular analysis. Reaching this goal requires following a complex, uncertain path of incremental advances built on new discoveries and continuous refinement of perceived relationships among disparate types of knowledge. Here we have investigated the relationship of elementary histopathological characteristics of melanomas to the mutation status of two genes, <italic>BRAF</italic> and <italic>NRAS</italic>. A strong relationship was found for the first but not for the second. As more studies are performed, additional strong genotype-phenotype relationships may be found, more subtle effects of genetic interactions and complementation may be revealed, and consequences of these factors for clinical behavior of individual tumors may be elucidated. As this process unfolds, phenotypic characteristics will become progressively more useful as surrogates for missing genetic knowledge. Thus development of a melanoma classification system that combines analysis of known genetic factors with histopathology may produce a clinically powerful method for managing individual patients and guiding research in the immediate future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0050120-sd001"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S1</label><caption><title>Translation of the Abstract into Spanish by A.
