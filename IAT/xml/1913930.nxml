We have been investigating a regulatory cascade predicted to control the activity of glutamine synthetase (GS). We previously demonstrated that the GS-modifying protein, GlnE (an adenylyl transferase), is essential for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth. GlnD, a uridylyl transferase, is involved in the control of GlnE activity in other bacteria. In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>glnD</italic> is arranged in an apparent operon with <italic>amt</italic> and <italic>glnB</italic>; all three genes are up-regulated in a low-ammonia medium. We constructed an in-frame deletion of <italic>glnD</italic> by homologous recombination. The mutant had no growth defect in media containing different nitrogen sources. Total GS activity in culture filtrates was markedly reduced in the mutant, although activity in cell-free extracts remained normal. Virulence was unaffected in both in vitro and in vivo model systems of infection, indicating that the presence of extra-cellular GS is not critical for virulence and that the residual intra-cellular GS activity is sufficient. Thus although GlnD does play a role in the control of ammonia assimilation, it is not required for virulence.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Nitrogen metabolism</kwd><kwd>Glutamine synthetase</kwd><kwd>Gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is responsible for the largest number of human deaths from a single bacterial agent.

Since this reaction requires ATP, it needs to be strictly regulated in the presence of excess ammonia to conserve both energy and glutamate pools in the cell. GS activity can be controlled by several mechanisms, including feedback inhibition, transcriptional control of gene expression and by post-translational modification. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> a regulatory cascade of three proteins, GlnD, PII and GlnE, is involved in the latter mechanism (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). GlnD is a uridylyl transferase which modifies the PII protein. PII in turn controls the activity of GlnE. GlnE is an adenylyl transferase which controls the interconversion of GS and GS-AMP. Transfer of the AMP moiety to the GS enzyme reduces its glutamine synthetic activity. GlnE is also able to deadenylylate GS with the predominant reaction being determined by interaction with the PII protein; PII promotes the adenylylation reaction, whereas PII-UMP promotes the deadenylylation reaction. In this way the cells can rapidly control GS biosynthetic activity in response to ammonia availability. An <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> GlnA1 mutant is auxotrophic for glutamine, and attenuated in macrophages and guinea pigs,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> suggesting that the assimilation of ammonia via this pathway is required in vivo.</p><p>We have previously shown that, in contrast to other bacteria including closely related organisms such as <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>, GlnE is an essential gene in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Thus the control of GS activity seems critical to normal growth.

We wanted to determine if the genes in this region are controlled by ammonia availability. We used RT-quantitative PCR to look at the expression levels of the three genes relative to <italic>sigA</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). <italic>Amt</italic> and <italic>glnB</italic> were up-regulated three-fold and <italic>glnD</italic> was up-regulated two-fold in low-ammonia medium as compared to high-ammonia medium. The lesser induction of <italic>glnD</italic> is not unexpected as it is often seen with genes that are at the 3&#x02032; end of the operon. Alternatively, <italic>glnD</italic> could be independently expressed from a promoter located in the intergenic region.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of <italic>glnD</italic> mutant</title><p>In order to characterise the role of GlnD in the regulatory cascade which controls GS activity, we constructed a deletion mutant. An in-frame deletion of the gene was made in the vector p1NIL and the gene cassette from pGOAL19 containing the <italic>hyg</italic>, <italic>lacZ</italic>, <italic>sacB</italic> genes was inserted. A two-step homologous recombination process was used to generate the mutant.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The in-frame deletion and expected genotype was confirmed by Southern blotting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Out of 32 double cross-overs screened, 12 were mutants.

We measured growth of the deletion mutant Tame 69 with various nitrogen sources. The mutant was able to use all the nitrogen sources and there was no difference in the growth rates from the wild-type strain (data not shown).<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Thus the mutant is not compromised in its ability to utilise any of these substrates.</p></sec><sec><title>Control of total GS activity</title><p>In other bacteria, GlnD is involved in the post-translational modification cascade which ultimately controls GS activity by modulating its adenylylation state. It has also been shown to play a role in regulation of nitrogen-controlled genes in Corynebacteria.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Therefore, we investigated total GS activity of the mutant grown with ammonia or glutamate as nitrogen sources (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) to determine if deletion of <italic>glnD</italic> affected the activity of GS. The majority of GS is found in the culture filtrate in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and our data confirmed that we had higher activity in this fraction than in the cell-free extracts for the wild-type strain. Interestingly, we found that total GS activity was higher in ammonia-rich conditions (30&#x000a0;mM ammonium sulphate) as compared to either low ammonia (0.1&#x000a0;mM) or 7H9 (glutamate) in the wild-type strain. This was in agreement with RT-qPCR data for <italic>glnA1</italic> which showed increased expression in high-ammonia medium (Pashley and Parish, unpublished data), although <italic>glnA2</italic> expression was unchanged.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> There was no significant difference in the total GS activity between the mutant and wild-type in the cell-free extracts. However, in culture filtrates the situation was very different. We found a large reduction in total GS activity in the mutant strain grown in all media except low ammonia (where the level of activity was at its lowest). This was particularly pronounced in ammonia-rich conditions, where the wild-type activity was at its highest.</p></sec><sec><title>Virulence in macrophages and SCID mice</title><p><italic>M. tuberculosis glnA1</italic> mutants are glutamine auxotrophs and showed a reduced ability to multiply in macrophages and guinea pigs.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Since extra-cellular GS activity was reduced in the <italic>glnD</italic> mutant, we determined whether GlnD played any role in intra-cellular survival. We used two measures of this: (1) the ability of the mutant to grow in macrophages and (2) its ability to cause disease in mice. For the macrophage infection assay we used the human macrophage-like THP-1 cell line. Infections were carried out at two different MOI (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The results showed that there was no difference between the wild-type and mutant strain, indicating that disruption of GlnD function had no effect on intra-cellular survival. We also tested virulence in the SCID mouse model to detect any strong attenuation profile (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Again, the mutant strain behaved just as the wild-type and was not attenuated.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that expression of <italic>glnB</italic> and <italic>amt</italic> is controlled in response to ammonia levels. The up-regulation of these genes in low-ammonia conditions is in agreement with previous findings in other related bacteria. For example, in <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic>, these genes are transcribed as an operon under the control of nitrogen availability; the operon is switched off in nitrogen-rich media and is turned on during nitrogen starvation.<xref rid="bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17,18</sup></xref></p><p>Our previous results indicate that at least one member of the GS regulatory cascade is essential, as we have been unable to construct GlnE mutants in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.<xref rid="bib8 bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8,15</sup></xref> Our current hypothesis is that GlnE is required to inactivate GlnA1 because the latter is expressed at such a high level. If it were all enzymatically active, the intra-cellular levels of glutamate and/or ATP would quickly be depleted. In agreement with this we have shown that the adenylylation function is essential, but the deadenylylation function is not (Pashley et al., unpublished). Deletion of GlnD would result in a lack of uridylyation of the PII protein. Since unmodified PII promotes the adenylylation activity of GlnE, inactivation of GS should still occur in the mutant and therefore deletion of GlnD is possible. However, our hypothesis predicts that PII is likely to be essential since it directly modulates GlnE activity. This concurs with our preliminary evidence that we are unable to make a <italic>glnB</italic> deletion mutant, in contrast to the relative ease of constructing a <italic>glnD</italic> mutant (Pashley and Parish, unpublished data).</p><p>Although the <italic>glnD</italic> mutant was viable, there were substantial changes in the level of GS activity. Normally, a large amount of GS is exported from the cell during growth.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Export of GS has been linked to high levels of expression, rather than any specific export mechanism.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> If <italic>glnD</italic> deletion leads to reduced expression of <italic>glnA1</italic>, this would explain why only extra-cellular levels are depleted. The observation that total GS activity in the culture filtrates was markedly reduced in the <italic>glnD</italic> mutant is an intriguing one. It is possible that overall expression of GlnA1 is markedly reduced and therefore little of it will be exported to the outside. Alternatively, GlnA1 production could be completely abolished. The enzyme assay we used does not distinguish between the four <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> GS enzymes, so GS activity measured could arise from GlnA2-4. However, this seems unlikely, since it has already been demonstrated that deletion of the <italic>glnA1</italic> gene leads to glutamine auxotrophy, implying that all the biosynthetic activity in the cell is GlnA1.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>It is likely that the GlnD regulatory cascade only controls activity of GlnA1, although we cannot rule out the possibility that GlnA3 activity would also be modulated. However, GlnA2 and GlnA4 will not be controlled by this cascade (since they cannot be modified by GlnE). Thus GS activity arising from enzymes other than GlnA1 cannot be rule out. Further work to determine the levels of expression of each GS would help to further elucidate the mechanism of control of GS activity in the whole cell. However, the fact that GlnA1 is the major GS in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> confirms the importance of this post-transcriptional regulatory control system.</p><p>Although extra-cellular GS was markedly reduced in the <italic>glnD</italic> mutant, the strain was still fully virulent in macrophages and SCID mice. This was a surprising observation, since it has already been demonstrated that GlnA1 is required for virulence.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Our data indicate that GS is not required at high levels for virulence in the SCID mouse and that the presence of the lower level of intra-cellular GS is sufficient for bacterial survival. It is possible that a defect may be seen in the <italic>glnD</italic> mutant under conditions in which intra-cellular multiplication is seen or in activated, rather than resting macrophages. However, since we have not measured extra-cellular GS directly during infection, we cannot exclude the possibility that extra-cellular GlnA1 is found in the <italic>glnD</italic> mutant <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, the attenuation of GlnA1 mutants most likely results from their auxotrophic nature and the lack of availability of glutamine in the host environment.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that <italic>glnD</italic> is not an essential gene, but that it is required for the normal expression and activity of GS in culture filtrates of <italic>M. tuberculosis.</italic> Future work to address the question of how deletion of <italic>glnD</italic> results in altered expression of GS by determining the mechanism of regulation for ammonia-regulated genes is underway.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by Wellcome Trust Grant no. 063894.
