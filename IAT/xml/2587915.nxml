Since most animal models fail to faithfully recapitulate the clinical course of SARS-CoV in humans, the virus and host factors that mediate disease pathogenesis remain unclear. Recently, our laboratory and others developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice. In contrast, intranasal infection of young 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice with rMA15 results in a nonlethal infection characterized by high titer replication within the lungs, lung inflammation, destruction of lung tissue, and loss of body weight, thus providing a useful model to identify host mediators of protection. Here, we report that mice deficient in MyD88 (MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>), an adapter protein that mediates Toll-like receptor (TLR), IL-1R, and IL-18R signaling, are far more susceptible to rMA15 infection. The genetic absence of MyD88 resulted in enhanced pulmonary pathology and greater than 90&#x00025; mortality by day 6 post-infection. MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had significantly higher viral loads in lung tissue throughout the course of infection. Despite increased viral loads, the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines within lung tissue and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung was severely impaired in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that contribute to monocyte recruitment to the lung were more susceptible to rMA15-induced disease and exhibited severe lung pathology similar to that seen in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>mice. These data suggest that MyD88-mediated innate immune signaling and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung are required for protection from lethal rMA15 infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In 2002, a new human coronavirus (CoV), termed SARS-CoV, emerged in southern China from coronaviruses circulating within live animals sold for food. Due to the ease and speed of human global travel, this new respiratory virus rapidly spread worldwide, illustrating the need to better understand how these viruses cause disease and how the immune system responds to infection. SARS-CoV infection of the human lower respiratory tract caused an atypical pneumonia characterized by viral replication in lung tissue and lung inflammation visible by chest X-ray. To identify how the immune system responds to and provides protection from SARS-CoV infection, we have developed a mouse model that mimics many aspects of SARS-CoV disease in humans. Utilizing this mouse model, we discovered that a host gene, termed MyD88, is required to control SARS-CoV replication and spread in lung tissue and for protection from death. In addition, MyD88-dependent functions were required for early immune and inflammatory responses in the lung following SARS-CoV infection, and the absence of these early responses correlated with severe SARS-CoV-induced disease and death. Our studies identify host immune responses that provide protection from SARS-CoV infection and provide valuable insight toward the development of successful antiviral therapies.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2003, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV, emerged from zoonotic pools of virus in China to cause a global outbreak of Severe and Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) affecting 29 countries, causing over 8000 human cases and greater than 700 deaths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Rota1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Christian1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

C57BL/6 mice infected with the epidemic strain, SARS Urbani, do not show any overt signs of disease but there is virus replication in the lung (10<sup>7</sup>TCID<sub>50</sub>/g 3dpi), induction of a number of proinflammatory chemokines, and viral clearance even in the absence of T, B, and NK cells, suggesting that innate immunity alone is required for the clearance of SARS Urbani within this acute model of SARS-CoV replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Glass1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The newly developed mouse adapted SARS-CoV, MA15, differs from Urbani in 6 amino acids and infection of young or senescent BALB/c mice with either MA15 or recombinant MA15 (rMA15) results in high virus titers in the lung, pulmonary pathology, and 100&#x00025; mortality resembling the pathogenesis of the most severe human cases of SARS-CoV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Peiris1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Nicholls1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Roberts1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Unfortunately, a SARS-CoV mouse model does not yet exist that recapitulates the less severe pathogenesis and recovery seen in a majority of the human cases. Moreover, a model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis with both disease and convalescence would allow for the elucidation of pathways involved in the innate or adaptive protective response to infection.</p><p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are cellular receptors that recognize molecular signatures of pathogens and initiate an inflammatory signaling cascade that is critical to the innate immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-ONeill1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

The role of MyD88 in the host response to viral infection has been investigated for a number of viral pathogens.

WT mice display signs of disease that include 12&#x02013;15&#x00025; loss of body weight by 3 dpi and lung pathology, however, these mice recover from infection by 6 dpi. Furthermore, we demonstrate a protective role for MyD88-dependent regulation of innate and inflammatory immune responses in this model of rMA15 pathogenesis. MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice infected with rMA15 have significantly higher and prolonged virus titers in the lung, exhibit a severe delay in host immune and inflammatory responses, including monocyte/macrophage recruitment to the lung, and ultimately succumb to infection. In addition, mice deficient in chemokine receptors that regulate the recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes to the lung were also more susceptible to rMA15 infection. These data suggest that a failure or delay in MyD88 inflammatory signaling and a concurrent delay in inflammatory monocyte/macrophage recruitment to the lung during acute infection results in exacerbated SARS-CoV disease. This novel mouse model of acute SARS-CoV pathogenesis could be extended to the investigation of many other components of the innate immune response in order to form a more comprehensive view of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, which may guide the rational design of antiviral therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are highly susceptible to rMA15 infection</title><p>Since previous studies suggested MyD88-dependent inflammatory signaling was important for protection from severe disease caused by VSV, LCMV, and RSV, we evaluated the importance of MyD88 signaling in SARS-CoV pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Rudd1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Lang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Zhou1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Zhou2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Infection of WT, RAG-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, or MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice resulted in weight loss beginning at day 2 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000240-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Infected WT and RAG-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice lost 14&#x000b1;4&#x00025; and 9&#x000b1;4&#x00025; of starting body weight by 3 dpi, respectively, and returned to starting body weights by 5&#x02013;6 dpi, indicating that the mice had recovered from rMA15 induced disease. In contrast to WT and RAG-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which began to recover weight after 3 dpi, infected MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice continued to lose weight after 3 dpi creating a significant weight disparity between WT and MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (WT vs. MyD88 percent weight p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x0003c;0.05 at 4, 5, and 6 dpi). While 100&#x00025; of WT and 86&#x00025; of RAG-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice survived the infection, &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;16) succumbed to infection by 6 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000240-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). MyD88 plays a critical role in proinflammatory signaling following stimulation of all known TLR's, except TLR3, as well as IL1R and IL18R. Interestingly, 100&#x00025; of IL-1R1- or IL-18R1-deficient mice survived infection by rMA15 (data not shown) indicating that the genetic absence of either receptor did not recapitulate the lethal phenotype observed following infection of MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. These findings indicate that i) adaptive immunity does not play a major role in protection from lethal SARS-CoV infection in mice, ii) the genetic absence of MyD88 significantly enhances SARS-CoV-induced morbidity and mortality , and iii) MyD88-dependent signaling through a receptor(s) other than IL-1R1 or IL-18R1 is responsible for protection from rMA15.</p><fig id="ppat-1000240-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000240.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are highly susceptible to rMA15 infection and experience higher levels of virus replication within the lung as compared to WT mice.</title><p>10 week-old C57BL/6 WT (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;14), RAG-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;21), or MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;16) mice were infected intranasally with 10<sup>5</sup> pfu rMA15.

Though we were able to deplete alveolar macrophages by IN administration of clodronate liposomes, both IP and IN administration of clodronate liposomes failed to alter morbidity and mortality and failed to prevent the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the infected lung at 2 dpi (data not shown). Additionally, the intranasal administration of clodronate liposomes 2 days post rMA15 infection of C57BL/6 mice failed to induce more severe disease or mortality.

Taken together, the morbidity and mortality data for rMA15 infected WT, RAG-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice suggest that early MyD88 dependent innate signals are required for protection from rMA15 induced mortality.</p><p>Serological and pathological data from the SARS-CoV epidemic suggests that the innate immune response plays a crucial role in the control of SARS-CoV infection but the molecular mechanisms of innate immune activation, protection from severe disease, and the contribution of the innate response to immune pathology remain unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Peiris1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Cameron1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Nicholls1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Peiris2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the C57BL/6 mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis reported here, we demonstrate MyD88-mediated protection from SARS-CoV infection in the absence of detectable induction of type I interferon. Furthermore, infection of IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptor deficient mice with rMA15 results in moderate weight loss and complete recovery with kinetics that is indistinguishable from those of WT mice (personal communication, Frieman and Baric, manuscript in preparation). Unlike RSV and VSV, we found that WT C57BL/6 mice are protected from lethal SARS-CoV infection by a MyD88-dependent mechanism that does not involve adaptive immunity, the induction of type I/III interferon, or IL1-R/IL-18R signaling (data not shown) suggesting that SARS-CoV is interfacing with the innate immune system in a potentially novel manner.</p><p>Human cases of SARS-CoV, mouse models, and in vitro data suggest inflammatory chemokines and cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory cells are important in SARS-CoV pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Peiris1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Nicholls1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Our studies indicate that protection from SARS-CoV infection correlates with MyD88-dependent induction of IL1-&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1&#x003b1;, and RANTES at early times post infection and many of these cytokines/chemokines were upregulated in human SARS-CoV cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Cameron1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Zhang1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. At early times post rMA15 infection, the MyD88-dependent chemokine/cytokine response occurs with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages to the lung at 2 dpi and is coincident with the control of virus replication in WT animals. Days 2, 3, 4 and 6 post infection, virus titers are significantly lower in WT mice as compared to MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals and these data are supported by the dramatic loss of in situ hybridization signal in WT mice by 3 dpi. Furthermore, the lung pathology and flow cytometry results suggest that the absence of inflammation in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice at early times post infection (2 dpi) correlates with much more severe lung damage and by the time the host mounts an adequate inflammatory response (4 dpi), lung damage is too severe and mortality ensues. The importance of macrophages in SARS-CoV pathogenesis has been noted in the past where SARS antigen was frequently detected in macrophages in the pathological evaluation of post mortem lung tissues from human SARS-CoV cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Gu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, in vitro data suggests that macrophages are not productively infected by SARS-CoV, however, these cells secrete inflammatory cytokines like IP-10 and MCP-1 in response to the virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Cheung1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. We have yet to determine the cell type responsible for the induction of the MyD88-dependent protective inflammatory response though we have demonstrated the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages occurs even if alveolar macrophages are depleted in WT mice (data not shown). In the future, bone marrow chimeras between WT and MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may help deduce if myeloid derived cells are responsible for the initial induction of the protective inflammatory response.</p><p>Chemokine receptors play a crucial role in directing inflammatory leukocytes to the sites of infection in order to mount an effective immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Serbina1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Charo1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

Previous reports have implicated that that chemokine receptors, CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 can both promote protection (CCR1,CCR2) and progression (CCR5) of disease caused by a neurovirulent coronavirus and the chemokine receptor dependent alteration of disease correlated with the recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes to the sites of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Glass2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Held1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Our studies demonstrate the importance of chemokine receptors in protection from rMA15 disease where CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 deficient mice experienced a significantly more severe disease and associated mortality as compared to WT mice. Furthermore, infected CCR deficient mice suffered from severe lung pathology (denuding bronchiolitis, epithelial apoptosis, etc.) and defects in inflammatory cell recruitment to the airway that were very similar to those seen in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. CCR1 (MCP-1), CCR2 (MIP-1&#x003b1;) and CCR5 (MIP-1&#x003b1; and RANTES) bind chemokines upregulated in the lungs of rMA15 infected WT mice whose expression are coincident with the recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes to the lung and protection from mortality. Recent data from Glass et al. suggest that CCR5 dependent recruitment of monocytes, T cells and NK cells to the brains of West Nile virus infected WT mice are required for the control of virus replication in the CNS and protection from mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Glass3">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. CCRs can also guide immunopathogenesis during virus infection where CCR2 deficient mice are protected from a lethal influenza virus infection due to the failure to recruit inflammatory monocytes to the infected lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000240-Lin1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, the above data suggests an important role for MyD88-dependent inflammation, the innate immune response, and chemokine recruitment of inflammatory cells in both the prevention and progression of severe SARS-CoV disease.</p><p>Viral pathogenesis is a complex process where interactions between the virus and the host determine the outcome of virus-induced disease. Many of the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV disease remain unknown and the existence of a robust mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis will allow for the detailed analysis of virus-host interactions. We have developed a novel model of acute SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Using this model, we discovered a critical role for MyD88-dependent inflammation in the protection from SARS-CoV induced mortality suggesting that the innate immune response plays a key role in the early control of SARS-CoV in the lung. Our future studies are aimed at understanding the mode of MyD88 dependent innate immune activation and the molecular mechanisms of inflammatory monocyte clearance of SARS-CoV from the lung. In the future, our studies may guide epidemiological studies in human populations in order to deduce if MyD88 related inflammatory genes or CCRs contributed to protection or prevention of severe SARS-CoV disease. Importantly, our SARS-CoV disease model can be employed to study the contributions of various innate immune genes in the protection from severe SARS-CoV disease which eventually may help clarify the current view of SARS-CoV pathogenesis and guide the development of intelligently designed antiviral therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Viruses and Cells</title><p>Vero E6 cells were grown in MEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10&#x00025; FCII (Hyclone, South Logan, UT) and gentamycin/kanamycin (UNC Tissue Culture Facility).
