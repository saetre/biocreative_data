One way to study gene function is to investigate the alterations in the responses of deletion mutants to different stimuli. Here we investigate the genetic profile of yeast non-essential gene deletion array (yGDA, ~4700 strains) for increased sensitivity to paromomycin, which targets the process of protein synthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>As expected, our analysis indicated that the majority of deletion strains (134) with increased sensitivity to paromomycin, are involved in protein biosynthesis. The remaining strains can be divided into smaller functional categories: metabolism (45), cellular component biogenesis and organization (28), DNA maintenance (21), transport (20), others (38) and unknown (39). These may represent minor cellular target sites (side-effects) for paromomycin. They may also represent novel links to protein synthesis. One of these strains carries a deletion for a previously uncharacterized ORF, <italic>YBR261C</italic>, that we term <italic>TAE1 </italic>for Translation Associated Element 1. Our focused follow-up experiments indicated that deletion of <italic>TAE1 </italic>alters the ribosomal profile of the mutant cells. Also, gene deletion strain for <italic>TAE1 </italic>has defects in both translation efficiency and fidelity. Miniaturized synthetic genetic array analysis further indicates that <italic>TAE1 </italic>genetically interacts with 16 ribosomal protein genes. Phenotypic suppression analysis using <italic>TAE1 </italic>overexpression also links <italic>TAE1 </italic>to protein synthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We show that a previously uncharacterized ORF, <italic>YBR261C</italic>, affects the process of protein synthesis and reaffirm that large-scale genetic profile analysis can be a useful tool to study novel gene function(s).</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The number of available sequenced genomes has provided the biologists with a wealth of sequence information containing thousands of genes. Many of these genes code for proteins with multiple functions, some of which are not known. Others code for proteins of completely unknown function(s). To tackle this challenge, several large-scale methodologies, under the term functional genomics, have been developed which aim at revealing putative gene functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Due to its simple genetics, ease of manipulation, and conserved pathways, the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, emerged as a model organism of choice for functional genomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. While significant knowledge has been gained from various large-scale investigations, more experiments are needed to uncover the details of the functions of genes involved in different cellular processes. Exploring the function of individual proteins can greatly advance our understanding of the biology of a cell as a system.</p><p>Genes, which are involved in similar pathways often genetically, interact with each other. Therefore, one way to study gene functions is to investigate the interactions they make with each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This is based on the assumption that many eukaryotic pathways are functionally redundant. Thus, deletion of a gene may be tolerated with no phenotypic consequences. Inactivation of a second functionally related gene however, can cause sickness or even lethality. Therefore sickness of double mutants or "synthetic lethality" has been used to reveal novel gene functions. In simple terms, synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis refers to large-scale investigation aimed at examining gene functions using double gene knockouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In addition to its role in functional genomics, availability of the yeast non-essential gene deletion array (yGDA, approximately 4700 strains) also provided the opportunity to investigate the cellular target sites of inhibitory compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In this way, compounds with unknown cellular target sites are examined for their inhibitory effects on yGDA. The hypersensitive strains for genes with known functions are used to form a genetic profile for the activity of the target compound. This provides a fast and effective way to investigate cellular target sites of inhibitory compounds.</p><p>Similarly, inhibitory compounds with known modes of activity could be used to detect novel gene functions. This is not a novel concept and in various small-scale studies, numerous gene functions have been examined based on the increased sensitivity of their gene deletion strains to different compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>As a final step in the gene expression pathway, the regulation of protein synthesis (translation) is used to control the expression of a variety of genes under different physiological conditions. For example, during cell division in the early steps of embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], or during cellular transformation and cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and as well, in stress conditions and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Even though the underlying principles of translation machinery have been the subject of vigorous investigations over the last few decades, details of all translation related proteins, protein complexes and pathways, as well as their communications and cross-talks with other cellular processes, have not been fully elucidated. Recently, several large-scale genomic investigations have uncovered numerous novel proteins thought to be functionally related to protein synthesis in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], suggesting that there remain other undiscovered translation proteins.</p><p>Here, we applied a large-scale chemical-genetic profile analysis to identify yeast deletion strains that show increased sensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin. This compound exerts its activity by targeting the process of protein synthesis. Focused follow-up experiments provided evidence that <italic>YBR261C</italic>, a previously uncharacterized open reading frame (ORF) which is identified by this screen, affects the process of protein synthesis in yeast.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The Initial screening and identification of TAE1</title><p>In order to identify genes that affect protein synthesis, we screened the entire set of yGDA (~4700) for increased sensitivity to the aminoglycoside paromomycin. Paromomycin binds to the small ribosomal subunit of eukaryotic cells and compromises the translation fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Previously, it was shown that deletion of certain translation related genes caused increased sensitivity to paromomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, we employed hypersensitivity to this drug as a way to detect novel gene candidates involved in translation. It should be noted that the deletion of certain translation related genes would cause increased resistance to paromomycin. This however, has not been investigated in our analysis.</p><p>We used yeast colony size reduction (CSR) as a tool to detect sensitivity to drug treatments. We have previously shown, that based on the parameters used by us (see Materials and Methods), CSR analysis can detect approximately 63% of the sensitive strains that are detected by a large-scale spot test (ST) analysis with no repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Hence, there are a number of sensitive strains that would be missed by our analysis, that might otherwise be detected by ST. Similarly, the same large-scale ST analysis failed to detect 59% of the strains detected by CSR, which may represent novel/false-positives associated with CSR.</p><p>Here, we use sensitivity to paromomycin as a tool to detect protein synthesis related genes. A draw back for this, as well as other similar drug-based screening tests, is the detection of sensitive strains for those genes with no direct relation to the activity of the target drugs. A major source of such false-positives in our experiments may stem from those genes that play a role in general stress conditions. Multi-drug resistant genes represent some of these examples. For instance, it has been shown that the deletion of <italic>QDR1</italic>, a transporter gene and a member of efflux pumps, confers sensitivity to several unrelated drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. To increase the specificity of our selection procedure, we coupled our initial screen with a secondary search (based on the same parameters) for increased sensitivity to a second drug, which has no reported activity on the process of translation. For this purpose, we selected calcofluor white (CW), which is known to inhibit cell wall function by binding with chitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In this way, only those gene deletions that conferred sensitivity to paromomycin alone may represent meaningful positives.</p><p>As expected, our large-scale approach identified numerous translation genes such as <italic>TEF4 </italic>(translation elongation factor EF-1 gamma), <italic>HCR1 </italic>(a component of translation initiation factor 3), <italic>RPS18B </italic>(a ribosomal protein of small subunit), etc, which are sensitive to paromomycin and not to CW. The complete list of these genes is found in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. The list of the genes that were sensitive to both paromomycin and CW is found in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>. Of the 325 gene deletions sensitive to paromomycin alone, we found 42 genes that often appeared in our similar drug screenings using different bioactive compounds. These may represent false-positives and should be treated with caution. From the 325 total reported genes, 134 have been previously linked to the overall process of protein biosynthesis. 191 of them however, have never been connected in any way to this process, and therefore, may also represent novel/false-positive genes. These genes can be further classified into 5 smaller categories based on the cellular processes in which they participate, plus those which are unknown. As indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, the minor categories are: metabolism with 45 genes, cellular component biogenesis and organization with 28, DNA maintenance with 21, transport with 20 and others with 38 genes. There were also 39 genes, which are unknown. An explanation for these smaller categories is that they may represent minor cellular target sites (side-effects) for paromomycin. Alternatively, they may simply represent false-positives (see above). It is also possible that some of these genes might have novel roles during translation. In this case, they may represent communication bridges between different cellular processes and protein synthesis.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Categories of gene deletion strains with increased sensitivity to paromomycin</bold>. Distribution of paromomycin hypersensitive yeast deletion strains in percentages according to their cellular functions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-9-583-1"/></fig><p>One of the previously uncharacterized ORF identified in this screen is <italic>YBR261C</italic>. There is no reported information about this ORF, except that it is computationally predicted to have a methyltransferases domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that this might be a novel translation related gene. We termed this ORF, <italic>TAE1</italic>, for Translation Associated Element 1, and subjected it to further analysis for its potential involvement in protein synthesis. ST analysis was used to confirm our large-scale observations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). When the growth media was supplemented with a sub-inhibitory concentration of paromomycin (13 mg/ml), a deletion strain for <italic>TAE1 </italic>(<italic>tae1</italic>&#x00394;) showed a reduction in its growth pattern (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Increased sensitivity of <italic>tae1</italic>&#x00394; to different translation inhibitory drugs</bold>. Deletion of <italic>TAE1 </italic>confers increased sensitivity to different drugs that target translation. Decreasing numbers of wild type and mutant (<italic>tae1</italic>&#x00394;) yeast cells were spotted on solid media. The media was supplemented with sub-inhibitory concentrations of paromomycin (13 mg/ml), 3-AT (22 mg/ml), cycloheximide (45 ng/ml), or none (used as a control and shown in the top panel). Standard organic (YEPD) media was used for cycloheximide and synthetic complete (SC) media was used for paromomycin and 3-AT plates, and for the control plate shown here. Yeast cells were grown to mid-log phase and diluted 10-3 to 10-6 folds. Twenty microliters of each dilution (gradually decreasing) was spotted onto the media and grown at 30&#x000b0;C for 1&#x02013;2 days. Deletion of <italic>TAE1 </italic>conferred increased sensitivity to paromomycin and 3-AT. Occasional sensitivity to cycloheximide was assumed to be an artifact.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-9-583-2"/></fig><p>We then examined <italic>tae1</italic>&#x00394; strain for its increased sensitivity to 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) and cycloheximide. 3-AT can affect translation by altering the pool of amino acids in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Cycloheximide binds to large ribosomal subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and inhibits translation elongation by interfering with tRNA translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It has previously been reported that deletion of certain genes that affect translation may confer sensitivity to multiple drugs that target translation. For example, deletion of Sfp1, which regulates ribosome biogenesis, confers increased sensitivity to both cycloheximide and paromomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, our spot test analysis indicated that in addition to paromomycin, <italic>tae1</italic>&#x00394; also showed increased sensitivity to 3-AT. Also some sensitivity for <italic>tae1</italic>&#x00394; to cycloheximide was occasionally observed. However, due to irreproducibility of these observations, this sensitivity was presumed to be an artifact.</p><p>During the preparation of this manuscript, a new study was reported in which sensitivity of yeast gene deletion mutants to paromomycin were investigated using a heterozygous diploid yeast gene deletion mutant array [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This system is different from ours (haploid based), as its diploid mutant strains always carry a copy of the wild type genes and consequently show less obvious growth defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Of the 51 mutant strains that were identified by the authors as sensitive to paromomycin, 39 are shared between the two systems. Of these, 16 mutants were also identified by our haploid system. It is worth mentioning that <italic>tae1</italic>&#x00394; was not detected to have increased sensitivity to paromomycin in the heterozygous system, further highlighting the difference between the two systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The effect of <italic>TAE1 </italic>gene deletion on protein synthesis</title><p>Translation genes can be involved in different aspects of translation. To examine the involvement of novel genes in protein synthesis, we divided translation into three general categories. Group one includes those genes that are associated with ribosome biogenesis, group two contains genes that alter translation efficiency, and group three is composed of the genes that affect translation fidelity. Depending on their molecular function(s), some translation genes may fall into none [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] of these three categories. If <italic>TAE1 </italic>is involved in the process of translation, it might fall into one or more of these categories.</p></sec><sec><title>a) Involvement of TAE1 in ribosome biogenesis</title><p>Ribosome biogenesis and assembly is one of the most important processes in the protein synthesis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This process might be explained as the overall step that leads to the formation and assembly of functional ribosomes and includes regulation of pre-rRNA transcription, and its corresponding mechanisms, pre-rRNA processing, rRNA transport, rRNA maturation, ribosome assembly, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We therefore reasoned that depending on the molecular function(s) of <italic>TAE1</italic>, if this gene is involved in ribosome biogenesis or assembly, its deletion might result in the alteration of the profile of ribosomal subunits. To examine this possibility, ribosome profile analysis was performed. As expected, distinct 40S and 60S subunit peaks, as well as 80S monosomes and polysome peaks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) were detected in both the wild type and <italic>tae1&#x00394; </italic>strains. In addition, <italic>tae1&#x00394; </italic>strain showed a reduction in polysomes and corresponding increases in 80S monosomes and 60S subunits (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These alterations in ribosomal profile further indicate the involvement of <italic>TAE1 </italic>in protein synthesis.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Ribosome profile analysis of yeast strains</bold>. Deletion of <italic>TAE1 </italic>results in an overall decrease in polysomes, and a corresponding increase in 80S monosome formations. There is also an increase in 60S subunit in <italic>tae1</italic>&#x00394; cells. The large polysomes were collected at the lower half of the gradients (x-axis). The values under the peaks represent the areas under the curve for each peak, in percentages. Each experiment was repeated three times with similar outcomes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-9-583-3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>b) Involvement of TAE1 in translation efficiency</title><p>If <italic>TAE1 </italic>is involved in protein synthesis, then based on its molecular function(s), its deletion may alter the cell's efficiency s to synthesize proteins. To investigate this possibility, we used [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine incorporations to measure the rate of total protein synthesis in different strains. As indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, it was observed that on average, <italic>tae1&#x00394; </italic>had a reduced level of [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine incorporation (approximately 22%) compared to the control strain. To confirm this observation, we used an inducible &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). It was observed that the deletion of <italic>TAE1 </italic>reduced the level of &#x003b2;-galactosidase synthesis from an inducible expression plasmid by approximately ten-folds (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These observations suggest that deletion of <italic>TAE1 </italic>may reduce the efficiency of protein synthesis in a cell, and provide further support that <italic>TAE1 </italic>affects protein synthesis.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Protein synthesis profile in the presence and absence of Tae1</bold>. In (A) total protein synthesis is measured using [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine incorporation. The average count for [<sup>35</sup>S] methionine incorporation for wild type is 11,356,073 (&#x000b1; 1,300,000) counts, which is set to 100%. In the absence of Tae1 protein, total protein production is reduced by approximately 22%. t-test analysis indicates that the observed difference is statistically significant with the p-value of 0.05. In (B) the efficiency of protein synthesis is measured using an inducible &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter gene. The average &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity for wild type is 7.51 (&#x000b1; 0.6) units, which is set to 100%. In the absence of Tae1 protein, an approximately ten-fold reduction in &#x003b2;-galactosidase production is observed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-9-583-4"/></fig></sec><sec><title>c) TAE1 and Translation fidelity</title><p>To make a functional protein, the fidelity of protein synthesis is maintained at almost all stages of translation. This fidelity is controlled during the start site selection and elongation when the mis-incorporation of the wrong amino acid may alter the integrity of the final product, as well as during termination, when a stop codon might be read through. If <italic>TAE1 </italic>is involved in translation, then it might be expected that based on its molecular function(s), the deletion of this gene may alter the fidelity of translation. Translation fidelity can be studied using specialized expression systems such as those that contain &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression cassettes, with premature stop codons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In this investigation, we used plasmids pUKC817 and pUKC818 that contain <italic>lacZ </italic>genes carrying the nonsense codons UAA and UAG, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It was observed that the deletion of <italic>TAE1 </italic>resulted in an increased level of read through for the nonsense codons investigated, suggesting that in this deletion strain, the translation fidelity seem to be compromised (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). For unknown reasons, the average values for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities in the wild type strain, were systematically higher than expected.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of <italic>TAE1 </italic>deletion on translation fidelity</bold>. (A) Deletion of <italic>TAE1 </italic>resulted in increased levels of &#x003b2;-gal activity from the <italic>lacZ </italic>reporters, pUKC817 and pUKC818, containing premature stop codons, UAA and UAG, respectively. The relative &#x003b2;-gal activity is determined by normalizing the activity of the mutant constructs (pUKC817 and pUKC818) to the control construct (pUKC815), and related to that obtained by the wild type strain (for example, the value for pUKC817/pUKC815 in <italic>tae1</italic>&#x00394; cells is related to that of pUKC817/pUKC815 in the wild type cells). The average &#x003b2;-gal activity for the wild type strain transformed with pUKC815 is 19.05 (&#x000b1; 1.1) units. (B) Q-RT-PCR analysis indicates that alterations for the relative contents of LacZ mRNAs do not explain the difference in &#x003b2;-gal activities observed in (A). The C<sub>t </sub>for the control and experimental samples were calculated from the threshold cycles. pUKC815 is the background construct without a premature stop codon and used as a control.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2164-9-583-5"/></fig><p>Since differential levels of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in above experiments may also stem from altered levels of mRNAs, the content of &#x003b2;-galactosidase mRNAs of WT and <italic>tae1</italic>&#x00394; were investigated using Q-RT-PCR. We observed no significant variation in the amounts of these mRNAs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), which could explain the observed difference for the &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities. It was therefore concluded that the observed differences likely stem from translation read through. Altogether, the results indicate that the deletion of <italic>TAE1 </italic>seems to compromise translation fidelity, providing further evidence that <italic>TAE1 </italic>affects translation.</p></sec><sec><title>TAE1 genetically interacts with translation related genes</title><p>The genes that are functionally related and are involved in similar pathways, often genetically interact with each other.

If <italic>TAE1 </italic>is a true translation gene, then it might be expected that <italic>TAE1 </italic>would genetically interact with certain known translation associated genes. To investigate this possibility, we examined the genetic interactions of <italic>TAE1 </italic>with a set of 384 genes, which are known or thought to be involved in translation. As indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, it was observed that <italic>TAE1 </italic>genetically interacted with numerous translation related genes to produce sick phenotypes, which are classified as i) very sick, ii) sick, and iii) moderate. Lethal interactions were not considered. The interactions between <italic>TAE1 </italic>and translation related genes were further divided into three categories with ribosomal proteins forming the largest cluster (16 genes), followed by those involved in amino acids and protein production (7 genes), and those involved in rRNA synthesis (2 genes). Descriptions of these genes are listed in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>. The fact that <italic>TAE1 </italic>genetically interacts with different translation associated genes provides further evidence for the involvement of <italic>TAE1 </italic>in the process of translation.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Genetic interaction of <italic>TAE1 </italic>with translation genes</bold>. <italic>TAE1 </italic>genetically interacts with numerous translations related genes to produce sick phenotypes.

Deletion of genes, which are involved in a specific pathway, may cause increased sensitivity to treatments that target the same process. Such hypersensitivities can be compensated by the overexpression of other genes with similar cellular functions. For example, it has previously been reported that the absence of Yku80, involved in telomere maintenance, causes increased sensitivity to elevated temperature. Overexpression of either Est2, a catalytic subunit of telomerase, or Tlc1, the RNA template component of telomerase, compensated for the absence of Yku80 and reversed the heat hypersensitivity of <italic>yku80&#x00394; </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Here, we investigated the activity of Tae1 protein by examining the effect of its overexpression in suppressing hypersensitivities to antibiotics neomycin and streptomycin for the above 384 translation related gene deletion yeast strains. Like paromomycin, the antibiotics neomycin and streptomycin, belong to the aminoglycoside family, which binds to ribosomes and disrupts translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We observed that overexpression of Tae1 protein, suppressed the drug sensitivity phenotypes for 28 deletion mutants of known translation genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). These 28 mutants showed sensitivity to treatment with neomycin and/or streptomycin. Tae1 overexpression however, reversed the observed drug sensitivities. These 28 gene deletion mutants can be categorized into two main groups of gene deletions for ribosomal proteins (17 genes), and those for translation control proteins (8 genes). Descriptions of the deleted genes are listed in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>. The fact that overexpression of Tae1 suppresses the phenotypes of deletion mutants for translation genes, further confirms an involvement for <italic>TAE1 </italic>in protein synthesis.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of <italic>TAE1 </italic>phenotypically suppresses the hypersensitivity of numerous translation genes against drug treatments</bold>.

Identifying "which gene does what" is one of the fundamental tasks of systems biology, and sets the basis for understanding the biology of a cell. There are currently numerous uncharacterized genes with no known functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Moreover, there are numerous genes with multiple functions, some of which are not yet elucidated.</p><p>One approach to study gene function is to make gene knockouts, and observe the mutant cells' behavior to internal and/or external stimuli. Here, we screened the set of yGDA for sensitivity to paromomycin, which is known to target protein synthesis machinery. Due to an increased sensitivity, we hypothesized that a yeast gene deletion strain for <italic>TAE1 </italic>might affect the process of protein synthesis. We observed that the deletion of <italic>TAE1 </italic>reduced translation fidelity. This observation might be expected, since paromomycin is known to decrease the fidelity of translation. We also observed that deletion of <italic>TAE1 </italic>reduced the efficiency of translation, which is not necessarily coupled with translation fidelity, suggesting a wide-range effect for <italic>TAE1 </italic>on translation.</p><p>Tae1 protein is found in the cytoplasm and is bioinformatically predicted to contain an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase activity. Certain members of this family of proteins have been shown to methylate different components of the translation machinery. For example, DIM1 and SPB1, which are nucleolar proteins involved in rRNA methylation; TRM proteins (such as TRM1 and TRM2), which are tRNA methyltransferases found in both cytoplasm and nucleus; and Mtq2, which methylates translation release factor SUP45 and is found in both cytoplasm and nucleus. Presuming that Tae1 has a methyltransferase activity, we can assume that Tae1 affects translation by methylating a component of translation machinery.</p><p>In agreement with the observed reduction in translation efficiency for <italic>tae1&#x00394;</italic>, our ribosomal profile analysis indicated an overall decrease in polysomes when <italic>TAE1 </italic>was deleted. In contrast, the 60S free subunits were specifically accumulated in <italic>tae1&#x00394; </italic>cells. Since 40S and 60S subunits are in equilibrium with 80S monosomes, the increase in 60S subunit may indicate a defect in 40S biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Assuming that <italic>TAE1 </italic>is a methyltransferase, a possible explanation is that <italic>TAE1 </italic>may effect 40S biogenesis by either methylating 18S rRNA directly, or by methylating a factor which affects 40S biogenesis. In agreement with a role for <italic>TAE1 </italic>in ribosome biogenesis, <italic>TAE1 </italic>is found to be co-regulated with a number of ribosome processing factors in at least five different microarray analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>There is also an accumulation of 80S monosomes in <italic>tae1&#x00394; </italic>cells, which may indicate a defect in translation initiation. Formation of defective ribosomes in the absence of <italic>TAE1 </italic>that cannot readily start elongation, may explain this accumulation of 80S monosomes. Alternatively, it is possible that <italic>TAE1 </italic>might affect translation initiation by modifying a translation initiation protein. The latter explanation however, cannot explain the accumulation of 60S subunits. Regardless, further experiments are required to investigate details of the molecular activity of <italic>TAE1</italic>, and to identify its potential substrate(s).</p><p>Our genetic analysis revealed that <italic>TAE1 </italic>genetically interacts with a number of translation genes. In accord with the above-suggested function for <italic>TAE1 </italic>in ribosome subunit biogenesis, the majority of the observed interactions were found to be with ribosomal protein genes. Similarly, our phenotypic suppression analysis indicated a functional compensation by <italic>TAE1 </italic>overexpression, for the absence of 17 different ribosomal proteins against drug treatments. It should be noted that our genetic and phenotypic suppression analysis resulted in two different sets of proteins. This is expected, as genetic interaction analyses generally target the genes involved in different pathways within a process (redundant pathways), whereas phenotypic suppression analyses generally target genes within the same pathway. This data can be further used to study the detailed mechanism of <italic>TAE1 </italic>activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we investigated the sensitivity of yGDA to paromomycin, a drug that targets the process of translation. One of the mutant strains identified by our screen was a deletion strain for a previously uncharacterized ORF, <italic>YBR261C</italic>, that here we termed <italic>TAE1</italic>, for Translation Associated Element 1. Our follow-up experiments indicated that the deletion of <italic>TAE1 </italic>caused reduction in translation efficiency and fidelity. Deletion mutant strain for <italic>TAE1 </italic>also had an altered ribosome profile. Our genetic analyses further confirmed the involvement of this gene in translation. Identification of a new gene in the process of translation suggests that there may exist other novel translation genes, which are yet to be discovered.</p><p>In addition, the large-scale phenotypic suppression analysis used here can set the path for similar approaches to investigate other gene functions. Furthermore, our data also reaffirms that large-scale chemical-genetic profile analysis can be successfully used in functional genomics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Drug resistance screening for yeast gene deletion array</title><p>Sub-inhibitory concentrations of drugs were estimated from minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements based on a 96 varied concentration format as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Approximately 4700 <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a </bold>haploid yeast, <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>strains (BY4741, <italic>MATa ura3&#x00394;0 leu2&#x00394;0 his3&#x00394;1 met15&#x00394;0</italic>) from the non-essential Gene Deletion Array (yGDA) described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] was manually arrayed onto agar plates as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] in a 384 array format, with sub-inhibitory concentrations of paromomycin (13 mg/ml), CW (40 &#x003bc;g/ml) or without a drug (control).
