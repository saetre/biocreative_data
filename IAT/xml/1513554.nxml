It transiently fuses with the plasma membrane to expel water and ions and thereby serves as an efficient osmoregulatory organelle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The CV-system is also assumed to be involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport since it contains a PMCA-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (PAT1), calmodulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and a vacuolar proton pump that establishes a proton gradient for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. PAT1 is localized to the CV and the plasma membrane and is upregulated under conditions of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Downregulation of PAT1 by antisense RNA reduced vesicular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake.</p><p>We are interested in the characterization of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stores that are involved in cAMP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx. Previously, it has been shown that acidic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stores and an IP<sub>3</sub>-sensitive store participate in this regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Acidic means that the stores are equipped with a V-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Acidic vesicular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stores in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>comprise the CV-system, endosomes and acidocalcisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the present study we focus on the contribution of the CV-system to intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>regulation.</p><p>It has been shown previously that GFP-tagged dajumin labels the entire CV whereas the endosomal compartments are devoid of the label [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. By contrast, drainin, a peripheral membrane protein involved in discharge of the bladder, is found only on the bladder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We used dajumin-GFP expressing cells to obtain a fraction enriched in CV membranes and used this fraction to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport activity increased with enhanced purity of the CV. We also employed a LvsA minus strain which lacks the gene for the protein large volume sphereA (<italic>lvsA</italic>). Besides its involvement in cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] it is known that the LvsA-protein is localized to the CV. This association with the CV occurs only during the discharge phase of the vacuole. In the lvsA mutant calmodulin was lost from the CV-membranes and the CV became disorganized, unable to discharge its contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We found that vesicular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport in the lvsA-mutant was diminished and that cAMP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx was drastically reduced, indicating that functional CV are absolutely required for the cAMP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Distribution of CV in vesicular fractions</title><p>We used differentiated cells 4 to 5 hrs after starvation for preparation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transporting vesicles because cAMP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx is present at that time and endosomal content is low (see below). Cells labeled with dajumin-GFP as a marker for the CV-system or with calnexin-GFP cells as a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Dajumin-GFP allows to visualize the dynamics of the bladder by formation of irregular ventricles and ducts (A). The ER is prominently labeled in the perinuclear region and close to the plasma membrane (B). The cells were lysed by passage through nuclepore filters. Vesicular fractions were separated by differential centrifugation and assayed for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transporting activity. The dajumin-GFP label was detected in vesicular fractions with the majority being present in the fast sedimenting fraction P<sub>0 </sub>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). By contrast, most of the ER occurred in P<sub>1</sub>, whereas the lightest fraction P<sub>2 </sub>contained only a quarter of both organelles (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Plasma membranes, as shown previously, sedimented in P<sub>1 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport activity was strikingly concentrated in P<sub>0</sub>. The presence of endosomes was measured with RITC-dextran. In two independent experiments 38 &#x000b1; 6% of the label was associated with P<sub>0</sub>, 62 &#x000b1; 6% with P<sub>1 </sub>and none was present in P<sub>2</sub>. However, the amount of endosomes of 4 hour starved cells was low and barely detectable. This result is expected since the cells develop in the absence of nutrients. If endosomes accumulate Ca<sup>2+ </sup>their contribution to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport was therefore considered to be insignificant under the present experimental conditions.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characterization of crude vesicular fractions.

Although it was previously shown that NBD-Cl and CMA inhibited the cAMP mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] these results only proved that acidic stores as a whole were involved. We made use of the LvsA<sup>-</sup>-mutant whose CV-function is abolished with respect to fusion of CV with the plasma membrane and is disturbed by a loss of calmodulin.

A localized loss of calmodulin confined to the CV would have the same consequences. Therefore, it was interesting to know whether or not Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx was also disturbed in the mutant.

In the LvsA minus mutant AA did not evoke Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx in contrast to the parent strain (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). Instead Ca<sup>2+</sup>-efflux occurred.

Previously, it was only known that acidic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stores were involved. The use of dajumin-GFP-labeled CV allowed a 7-fold enrichment of CV by a specific method utilizing antibodies directed against the GFP-tag. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport was enhanced 5- to 6-fold. This result is due to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport activity of another Ca<sup>2+</sup>-store that was retained in the flow through (P<sub>0</sub>F). Enriched CV displayed a potent and efficient Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport that resulted in a low basal extravesicular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentration. Moreover, the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>taken up could be released by the calmodulin antagonist W-7 and by AA. Both compounds have been shown to be potent regulators of the acidic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake was sensitive to CMA, an inhibitor of V-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases. Moreover, the V-type proton pump was concentrated in P<sub>0</sub>E. A similar enrichment was also obtained for the ER using calnexin-GFP-labeled cells. These Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stores differed from those of the CV by a greater sensitivity to BHQ, a lower responsiveness to AA and a higher basal extravesicular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-concentration following Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake.</p><p>In order to examine whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport occurring in CV is also involved in cAMP-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx we made use of a mutant, LvsA minus. In this mutant the CV becomes disorganized during the discharge phase of the vacuole and calmodulin dissociates from the CV-membranes. The CV can swell but seems unable to discharge. The LvsA-protein that belongs to the family of BEACH-proteins transiently binds to the CV. We found that the mutant was strongly impaired in receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx when physiological cAMP-concentrations of 0.1&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;M and even higher concentrations of 10 &#x003bc;M cAMP were applied. A significant Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx was apparent only at elevated cAMP concentrations of 20 to 50 &#x003bc;M. Even so, influx was inhibited by about 75% as compared to the parent strain. Other compounds that induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>are long chain fatty acids like AA. They act independently of the cAMP-receptor and of cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Similarly to cAMP, AA did not cause Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx in the LvsA-minus-strain, instead Ca<sup>2+</sup>-efflux occurred. These results demonstrate that in order to activate capacitative Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx an intact CV-system is absolutely necessary.</p><sec><title>What is the role of the LvsA-protein in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx?</title><p>The function of the LvsA-protein in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>is not yet known. BEACH-proteins belong to several classes and only a few proteins have been characterized. The FAN-protein mediates TNF-activation via the MAP-kinase pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Neurobeachin conveys anchoring of the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In both cases, the BEACH-protein participates in signal transduction that could lead to altered Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulation in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. Elevated cAMP-levels in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>were shown to affect both, basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>and stimulus-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-transients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Apart from this, it was shown that the loss of the LvsA-protein was accompanied by a loss of calmodulin from the CV-membranes. Since we have shown that the calmodulin antagonist W7 inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport of acidic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] we conclude that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-uptake by the CV is inhibited in the absence of calmodulin. This could be an explanation of the severe reduction of cAMP-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx measured in the LvsA<sup>-</sup>-mutant strain.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Among the acidic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stores the contractile vacuole represents an efficient Ca<sup>2+ </sup>transport organelle that sequesters Ca<sup>2+ </sup>to low extravesicular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>concentrations and releases Ca<sup>2+ </sup>in response to arachidonic acid. Furthermore, it is essential for the occurrence of receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx to physiological concentrations of cAMP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>N-(6-aminohexyl)5-chloro-1-naphthalene sulfonamide (W-7) 2,5-di(tert-butyl)-1,4-hydroquinone (BHQ) and concanamycin A (CMA) were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland).
