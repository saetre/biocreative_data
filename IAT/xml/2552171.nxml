In the initial phase of NMJ formation, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) cluster with other postsynaptic proteins in the central regions of the myofibers after myogenesis independently of innervations by motor neurons; this process is called &#x0201c;prepatterning&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-FlanaganSteet1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Yang2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

The axons of motor neurons are guided by chemoattractants and chemorepellents to elongate toward target muscles so that the axon terminals can contact the prepatterned postsynaptic regions. The pre- and postsynaptic regions then differentiate and are stabilized and modified by the elimination of redundant synapses to form structurally and functionally mature NMJs. However, precisely how these processes occur remains an important unanswered question.</p><p>The ADAM (<underline>a d</underline>isintegrin <underline>a</underline>nd <underline>m</underline>etalloprotease) family proteins play critical roles in morphogenesis, fertilization, and diseases. Some ADAM proteins contain an active metalloprotease domain, and ADAM proteases modulate the ectodomain shedding of various membrane proteins, such as membrane-anchored growth factors, receptors, and adhesion molecules. For example, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17) is essential for the phorbol ester&#x02013;stimulated shedding of the ectodomains of various membrane-anchored proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Black1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and Kuzbanian/ADAM10 is involved in the ectodomain shedding of multiple substrates, including ephrin, Notch ligands, and cadherins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Hattori1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Reiss1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Meltrin &#x003b2;, an ADAM protein that contains an active metalloprotease domain, is strongly expressed in the heart and peripheral nervous system during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Inoue1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Kurisaki1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Neonatal death is often caused by respiratory failure, including defective regulation of the contractions of respiratory muscles, such as the diaphragm and intercostal muscles.

Meltrin &#x003b2; interacted with EphA4 in motor neurons during development, and the expression of Meltrin &#x003b2; in EphA4-expressing cells blocked the vesicular internalization of ephrin-A5 bound to EphA4, independently of the Meltrin &#x003b2; metalloprotease function. Previous studies indicated the requirement of endocytosis in efficient contact-dependent repulsion induced by ephrin-Eph signaling. From these results and previous findings, we propose that Meltrin &#x003b2; negatively regulates ephrin-A5-EphA vesicular internalization, which could be one of mechanisms to stabilize the developing NMJ.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Meltrin &#x003b2; is expressed at the NMJ and involved in its formation</title><p>To examine the role of Meltrin &#x003b2; in the development of the NMJ, we first investigated the expression of Meltrin &#x003b2; at the NMJ in muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003322-g001">Fig. 1A&#x02013;C</xref>).

Among 110 genes that fulfilled all the criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003322.s003">Table S1</xref>), secreted or membrane-bound proteins were selected. In addition, we sought to identify candidates that could act as a retrograde signal from the muscles to motor terminals. All of the criteria mentioned above were on the premise that the hybridization conditions for the array data from the 4 probes prepared from S (transcripts localized in the synaptic region) and E (transcripts localized in the extra-synaptic region) from wild type and <italic>meltrin &#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> muscles, respectively, were absolutely the same. However, we could not expect such ideally equal conditions of the hybridization although each array data was evaluated with several internal controls. Therefore, we next assessed several candidate genes with RT-PCR.

Although Meltrin &#x003b2; was not found at the cell surface without coexpressing with EphA4, some Meltrin &#x003b2; molecules were translocated to the cell surface when Meltrin &#x003b2; was co-expressed with EphA4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003322.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Because Meltrin &#x003b2; is not usually found at the cell surface, we interpret the result as indicating that the molecular interaction with EphA4 likely promoted the translocation of Meltrin &#x003b2; to the cell surface.</p><p>The most important question was whether Meltrin &#x003b2; regulates the ephrin-A5&#x02013;EphA4 interaction. An ephrin&#x02013;Eph interaction delivers a contact-triggered repulsive signal to the ephrin- and Eph-expressing cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Hattori1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Egea1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Mechanisms to convert the signal from contact to repulsion include cleavage of the ephrin. Ephrin-A2 is cleaved by ADAM10 <italic>in cis</italic> upon binding to EphA receptor, and a cleavage-inhibiting mutation in ephrin-A2 delays axon withdrawal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Hattori1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Either result of these experiments with cultured cells can explain contact-triggered repulsion between ephrin- and Eph-expressing cells. Another mechanism is endocytosis. Ephrins or Ephs on opposing cells are endocytosed into the cells expressing Ephs or ephrin, respectively, without ectodomain shedding, a process called trans-endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Cowan1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Marston1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Irie1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. With some evidences, it is also suggested that endocytosis is a critical step for turning the interaction of ephrins and Ephs from contact into repulsion efficiently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Cowan1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to ADAM10, Meltrin &#x003b2; did not cleave ephrin-A5 even when ephrin-A5&#x02013;expressing cells were mixed with EphA4-expressing cells (data not shown). Instead, the expression of Meltrin &#x003b2; in EphA4-expressing cells interfered with the endocytosis of ephrin-A5&#x02013;EphA4 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003322-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). This interference might diminish the ability of ephrin- and Eph-expressing cells to repel with each other. Alternatively, cell-cell adhesion would overcome the repulsion when EphA4 interactes with Meltrin &#x003b2;.</p><p>How does Meltrin &#x003b2; regulate the endocytosis of ephrin-A5&#x02013;EphA4 complexes? Endocytosis is triggered by Vav family GEFs, which bind to phosphorylated Ephs and are themselves phosphorylated by other kinases, possibly of the Src family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Marignani1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Schuebel1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the current study, when EphA4 interacted with Meltrin &#x003b2;, EphA4 became less accessible to an antibody against its SAM domain significantly. We speculate that the association of EphA4 with Meltrin &#x003b2; may alter the accessibility of endocytosis regulators to EphA4 or change their association and may prevent Vav family GEFs from activating ephrin-triggered endocytosis.</p><p>On the basis of our findings and previous reports, we present a working hypothesis of how Meltrin &#x003b2; and ephrin-A5&#x02013;EphA signaling cooperate to stabilize the association of the pre- and postsynaptic apparatuses of the NMJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003322-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). In short, Meltrin &#x003b2; associated with EphA4 would convert a state of an axon terminal from a mobile to a static one through modulating the ephrinA5-EphA4 signaling at the NMJ by interfering with the internalization of the ephrin-Eph complexes there. This conversion might contribute to formation of the stabilized NMJ. The sustained expression of EphA4-Meltrin &#x003b2; at the presynapses would cause localized expression of ephrin-A5 at the postsynapses, which would increase the stability of the ephrin-A5-EphA4 interaction.</p><fig id="pone-0003322-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003322.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Hypothetic model of how Meltrin &#x003b2; and ephrin-A5&#x02013;EphA4 signaling stabilize the NMJ.</title><p>When axon terminals touch the ephrin-A5-expressing postsynaptic region, EphA4 associated with Meltrin &#x003b2; is localized preferentially at the axon terminal opposite the postsynaptic cluster on the muscle fiber; Meltrin &#x003b2; interferes with the internalization of the ephrin-A5&#x02013;EphA4 complexes so that the axon terminal and muscle could avoid receiving a repulsive signal at the NMJ, and many molecules, such as agrin, MuSK and adhesion proteins, cooperate in stabilization of the NMJ. In the absence of Meltrin &#x003b2;, axon terminals of motor neurons cannot be stabilized because impaired suppression of endocytosis would result in a failure to block the ephrin-A5&#x02013;EphA4 repulsive signal. As a result, the motor terminals remain mobile at the NMJ, and the reverse signal from EphA4 to ephrin-A5 is unstable, leading to the diffuse distribution of ephrin-A5 and AChR transcripts in muscles.

Although we discussed a non-proteolytic role of Meltrin &#x003b2; in the regulation of ephrin-A5-EphA4 signaling here, functional significance of Meltrin &#x003b2; as a protease is not excluded in the NMJ formation. Further studies are necessary to determine whether Meltrin &#x003b2; presented together with EphA4 on the cell surface also functions as a protease to cleave substrates, which contribute to the formation of the NMJ including the confinement of AChR mRNA in the central endplate zone.</p><p>In addition to the question on the proteolytic function of Meltrin &#x003b2;, many questions remain to be solved: the molecular mechanisms by which Meltrin &#x003b2; blocks the ephrin-dependent endocytosis and the mechanisms that localize the Meltrin &#x003b2;&#x02013;EphA4 complex in axon terminals apposed to the NMJ. Meltrin &#x003b2; and EphA4 are not only expressed in neurons but also in developing muscles (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003322-Lai1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>), and ephrin-A5 could be also expressed in terminal Schwann cells. Cell type-specific ablation of Meltrin &#x003b2; and ephrin-A5 would help understanding more precise mechanisms of the NMJ stabilization which these molecules mediate. It is noteworthy that the expression of ephrins, Ephs, and Meltrin &#x003b2; in the NMJ is sustained in adult mice, implying that these molecules are also important in the maintenance of the NMJ.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of meltrin <italic>&#x003b2;</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>ephrin-A5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice</title><p>All procedures with experimental animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Research Advisory Committee at Kyoto University.
