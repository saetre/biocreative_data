The early growth response-1 (Egr-1) transcription factor mediates profibrotic TGF-&#x003b2; responses, and its expression is elevated in biopsies from patients with scleroderma. NGF1-A-binding protein 2 (Nab2) is a conserved transcriptional cofactor that directly binds to Egr-1 and positively or negatively modulates Egr-1 target gene transcription. Despite the recognized importance of Nab2 in governing the intensity of Egr-1-dependent responses, the regulation and function of Nab2 in the context of fibrotic TGF-&#x003b2; signaling is unknown. Here we show that TGF-&#x003b2; caused a time-dependent stimulation of Nab2 protein and mRNA in normal fibroblasts. Ectopic expression of Nab2 in these cells blocked Egr-1-dependent transcriptional responses, and abrogated TGF-&#x003b2;-induced stimulation of collagen synthesis and myofibroblasts differentiation. These inhibitory effects of Nab2 involved recruitment of the NuRD chromatin remodeling complex to the COL1A2 promoter and were accompanied by reduced histone H4 acetylation. Mice with targeted deletion of Nab2 displayed increased collagen accumulation in the dermis, and genetic or siRNA-mediated loss of Nab2 in fibroblasts was associated with constitutively elevated collagen synthesis and accentuation of Egr-1-dependent TGF-&#x003b2; responses in vitro. Expression of Nab2 was markedly up-regulated in skin biopsies from patients with scleroderma, and was localized primarily to epidermal keratinocytes. In contrast, little Nab2 could be detected in dermal fibroblasts. These results identify Nab2 as a novel endogenous negative regulator of Egr-1-dependent TGF-&#x003b2; signaling responsible for setting the intensity of fibrotic responses. Defective Nab2 expression or function in dermal fibroblasts might play a role in persistent fibrotic responses in scleroderma.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Scleroderma is characterized by autoimmunity, vascular injury and tissue fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Jimenez1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Abraham1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Members of the Egr-1 family are implicated in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Although most normal cells show negligible basal expression of Egr-1, synthesis is induced in a rapid and generally transient manner by a variety of extracellular signals generated during stress and injury. Stimuli for Egr-1 expression include growth factors, hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, ultraviolet light and mechanical injury. We demonstrated previously that TGF-&#x003b2; was an additional stimulus for inducing Egr-1 expression in normal fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Chen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The response involved a Smad-independent signal transduction pathway with sequential activation of MEK1, ERK1/2 and Elk-1, as well as the non-receptor protein kinase c-Abl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Bhattacharyya1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Bhattacharyya2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Ectopic Egr-1 was sufficient for stimulating collagen gene expression in the absence of TGF-&#x003b2;. We demonstrated that levels of Egr-1 were markedly elevated in mice with bleomycin-induced scleroderma (10). Moreover, the expression of Egr-1 was found to be enhanced in skin and lung biopsies from patients with scleroderma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Chen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Bhattacharyya1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Together, these observations point to a hitherto unrecognized fundamental role for Egr-1 in the pathogenesis of fibrosis in mouse and man.</p><p>Under normal conditions, Egr-1 expression and activity are tightly regulated. One of the factors implicated in regulation of Egr-1 is NGF1-A-binding protein 2 (Nab2), a 55 kD nuclear protein originally identified based on its ability to interact with Egr-1 and inhibit its transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Russo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Svaren1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Subsequent studies revealed that Nab2 lacks DNA-binding activity, but can positively or negatively modulate the expression of Egr-1 target genes via direct interaction with Egr-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Svaren2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Nab2 shares conserved N-terminal NCD1 (Egr-1 interaction) and C-terminal NCD2 (transcriptional regulation) domains with another Egr-1 binding protein called Nab1. However, while Nab2 is an inducible modulator of transcription, Nab1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues, and functions as general transcriptional regulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Swirnoff1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The synthesis of Nab2 is stimulated by some of the same signals that also induce Egr-1, suggesting that Nab2 might function in a negative feedback for Egr-1 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Svaren1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Although Nab2 has been implicated in macrophage development, cardiac hypertrophy, peripheral neuropathy and prostate cancer, to date its in vivo functions are poorly understood. Mice with targeted deletion of Nab2 showed no obvious phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Le1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, mice lacking both Nab1 and Nab2 showed profound hypomyelination and died at an early age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Le1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Despite the potentially important role of Nab2 in modulating Egr-1 activity and target gene expression, its regulation remains incompletely understood. Furthermore, the expression and function of Nab2 in the context of physiologic and pathological fibrogenesis are unknown. Here we show that TGF-&#x003b2; stimulates the expression of Nab2 in normal skin and lung fibroblasts. The Nab2 response is slightly delayed compared to Egr-1, and involves a Smad-independent MAP kinase intracellular signaling cascade. Ectopic Nab2 blocked Egr-1-dependent transcriptional responses, and prevented the stimulation of collagen synthesis and myofibroblasts differentiation. These inhibitory effects of Nab2 were accompanied by recruitment of the histone deacetylase HDAC1 and attenuated histone H4 hyperacetylation at the COL1A2 promoter. Mice null for Nab2 showed increased accumulation of collagen in the skin. Genetic or siRNA-mediated repression of Nab2 in fibroblasts was associated with constitutive Egr-1 activity, increased collagen synthesis, and enhancement of Egr-1-dependent TGF-&#x003b2; responses in vitro. Skin biopsies from patients with scleroderma were characterized by markedly elevated Nab2 expression, localized primarily in the nuclei of epidermal keratinocytes and cells lining dermal appendages. In contrast, fibroblasts in the lesional skin had only scant Nab2 expression. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that Nab2 functions as an inducible inhibitor of Egr-1-mediated TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, and has an important physiologic role in modulating the intensity or duration of fibrotic responses. Impaired Nab2 expression or function might contribute directly to the development or progression of fibrosis in scleroderma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>Primary cultures of dermal fibroblasts were established by explantation from neonatal foreskin, and studied at early (&#x0003c;8) passage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Mori1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

First, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated from Nab2-null mice and studied in vitro. Whereas Nab2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs in vitro displayed morphology and proliferation rates indistinguishable from wildtype MEFs under standard culture conditions (data not shown), marked alterations in their biosynthetic phenotypes were evident. Western analysis and real-time qPCR revealed substantial increases in the constitutive rate of collagen synthesis, and in COL1A1 and COL1A2 mRNA expression in Nab2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs compared to wildtype MEFs cultured in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007620-g004">Figs. 4A and B</xref>). Furthermore, incubation of Nab2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs with TGF-&#x003b2; resulted in further enhancement of collagen gene expression. A potential mechanistic explanation to account for the enhanced collagen gene transcription seen in Nab2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs was provided by the finding that the basal activity of the Egr-1-responsive reporter pEBS<sub>4</sub>-luc was constitutively elevated in Nab2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs, and could be partially normalized by rescuing these cells with ectopic Nab2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007620-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). These results suggest the basal Egr-1 activity is unopposed in Nab2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs. Next, we used an siRNA knockdown approach to reduce cellular Nab2 expression. Transfection of normal dermal fibroblasts with a Nab2 siRNA reduced the baseline levels of Nab2, and abrogated the stimulation of Nab2 expression by TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007620-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>).

In unstimulated fibroblasts (basal state), small amounts of Egr-1 and Nab2 are constitutively associated with the COL1A2 promoter.

More sustained TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation leads to increased Nab2 expression and its accumulation in the Egr-1-COL1A2 transcriptional complex, with HDAC1 recruitment, H4 deacetylation, and transcriptional repression. In scleroderma fibroblasts, defective Nab2 induction or function might results in unopposed Egr-1 signaling and target gene transcription.

Whereas only low amounts of COL1A2 promoter associated with HDAC1could be detected in fibroblasts harboring empty vector, ectopic Nab2 expression was accompanied by increased accumulation HDAC1, as well as Nab2, on the Egr-1-binding region of COL1A2 promoter fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007620-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Accumulation of CHD4, another member of the NuRD complex, was also enhanced by TGF-&#x003b2;, and was markedly elevated in Nab2-transfected fibroblasts. In contrast, TGF-&#x003b2;-induced histone H4 hyperacetylation at the COL1A2 locus was markedly attenuated in the presence of ectopic Nab2. Increased nuclear levels of HDAC1 in fibroblasts harboring ectopic Nab2, and attenuation of histone H4 hyperacetylation, were confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007620-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Together, these results suggest that ectopic Nab2 expression in fibroblasts stimulated the recruitment of HDAC1 and CHD4, with ensuing decrease in histone hyperacetylation at the COL1A2 promoter.</p><p>Based on these results, we surmised that NuRD complex recruitment to the COL1A2 promoter may play a role in repression of the stimulation of collagen gene expression in the presence of ectopic Nab2. This notion was explored by disrupting NuRD function. For this purpose, transient transfection assays were performed in the presence of wildtype CHD4 or CHD4del<sup>(1&#x02013;1280)</sup>, a dominant negative CHD4 mutant that binds to Nab2 but lacks the ATPase domain required for nucleosome remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Srinivasan1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The results of transfection assays showed that ectopic Nab2 prevented the stimulation of Egr-1-dependent transcription in presence of wildtype CHD4, as expected, but it failed to block the response in fibroblasts harboring the mutant CHD4, suggesting a critical role of the NuRD remodeling complex in Nab2-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007620-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>).

In these samples, Nab2 accumulation was nuclear and primarily localized to the epidermis. In addition to keratinocytes, dermal blood vessels, hair follicles, eccrine glands and occasional infiltrating round cells also showed strong immunostaining. In contrast, however, only occasional fibroblastic cells were positive for Nab2. These were distributed throughout the dermis and showed faint and inconsistent staining. Immunostaining was specific for Nab2, as substitution of the primary antibody with nonspecific mouse IgG resulted in the absence of staining (data not shown). In the same skin biopsies, Egr-1 immunostaining was evident in majority of dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, most dermal fibroblasts showed strong expression of nuclear phospho-Smad2, indicating active TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in these cells.</p><fig id="pone-0007620-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007620.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Elevated Nab2 expression in scleroderma skin biopsies.</title><p>Lesional skin biopsies were obtained from patients with scleroderma (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6) and healthy controls (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3), and processed for immunohistochemistry as described under <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Methods</xref>.

The expression of Egr-1 was markedly up-regulated in the fibrotic lesion in a mouse model of scleroderma, as well as in skin and lung biopsies from patients with scleroderma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Bhattacharyya1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The expression and activity of Egr-1 are normally tightly regulated through a variety of mechanisms. The present studies focused on Nab2, a non-DNA-binding cofactor for Egr-1. The results demonstrated that Nab2 expression was induced by TGF-&#x003b2;, and ectopic Nab2 abrogated TGF-&#x003b2;-dependent fibrotic responses such as stimulation of collagen gene expression and myofibroblasts differentiation, by blocking Egr-1-dependent target gene transcription. Mice lacking Nab2 showed evidence of enhanced fibrogenesis in the skin, and explanted Nab2-null fibroblasts showed constitutive Egr-1 transcriptional activity and elevated collagen gene expression in vitro. Furthermore, repression of endogenous Nab2 using siRNA knockdown was accompanied by enhancement of Egr-1-dependent TGF-&#x003b2; responses in normal fibroblasts. Nab2 promoted HDAC1 recruitment to the COL1A2 promoter and abrogated histone hyperacetylation induced by TGF-&#x003b2;. While Nab2 expression was dramatically up-regulated in epithelial cells in scleroderma skin biopsies, consistent with activated TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in the fibrotic milieu, dermal fibroblasts from biopsies that were strongly immunopositive for Egr-1 and phospho-Smad2 showed a paucity of Nab2 expression. These findings indicate that in the context of TGF-&#x003b2;-induced profibrotic responses, Nab2 functions as an important negative regulator, and impaired Nab2 expression or function in activated dermal fibroblasts might contribute to the persistence or progression of skin fibrosis in scleroderma.</p><p>The expression of Egr-1 during acute injury is induced by serum, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), TGF-&#x003b2;, hypoxia and oxidative stress, and in turn, Egr-1 stimulates the expression of PDGF, tissue factor and TGF-&#x003b2; itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Gashler1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Russo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Svaren1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Milbrandt1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Houston1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

Like other transcription factor, Egr-1 interacts with cofactors that can modulate the transcription of Egr-1 target genes. Nab2, originally identified by yeast two-hybrid assays, is a non-DNA binding cofactor that directly interacts with a conserved 34-amino acid sequence in the R1 domain of Egr-1. Deletion of the R1 domain resulted in increased Egr-1 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Russo1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Svaren1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Gashler2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. We show here that TGF-&#x003b2; stimulated the expression of Nab2 in normal fibroblasts. This response was delayed compared to Egr-1, and was abolished by an inhibitor of MEK1, indicating that it was mediated via a MAP kinase signaling pathway.</p><p>The in vivo functions of Nab2 are incompletely understood.

The present studies reveal a novel physiological function for Nab2 in the regulation of fibrogenesis. While loss of fibroblast Nab2 was accompanied by constitutive Egr-1 activity that could be partially rescued by ectopic Nab2, in addition to elevated collagen gene expression and enhanced TGF-&#x003b2; responses, ectopic Nab2 abrogated the stimulation of fibrotic responses such as collagen production and myofibroblast differentiation induced by TGF-&#x003b2;. In previous studies, mice deleted for Nab2 appeared to have no obvious phenotype, whereas mice lacking both Nab1 and Nab2 developed peripheral neuropathy and abnormalities in skin development, and suffered from early lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Le1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Desmazieres1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Baloh1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. While these observations suggest functional redundancy between Nab1 and Nab2, we found here that Nab2 null mice showed excessive collagen accumulation in the dermis, and explanted Nab2-null fibroblasts in vitro showed both constitutively elevated Egr-1 transcriptional activity that could be normalized with ectopic Nab2, and elevated collagen synthesis, suggesting an important biological role for Nab2 in regulating Egr-1-dependent fibrogenesis.</p><p>It is worth noting that not all TGF-&#x003b2;-induced responses are abrogated by Nab2. Indeed, transcriptional profiling analysis using DNA microarrays indicated that the expression of multiple TGF-&#x003b2;- target genes such as PLOD2 and SMAD7, and few more in TGF-&#x003b2;-stimulated skin fibroblasts could not be inhibited by ectopic Nab2 (Bhattacahryya S et al., Ms. in preparation).

The present results indicate that repression of TGF-&#x003b2; responses by ectopic Nab2 was associated with recruitment of both HDAC1 and CHD4 to the COL1A2 promoter, and reduced local histone H4 acetylation. Furthermore, dominant negative mutant CHD4 abrogated the inhibitory effect of ectopic Nab2 on Egr-1 activity. We showed previously that TGF-&#x003b2; induced the recruitment of p300 to the COL1A2 promoter, resulting in histone H4 hyperacetylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Ghosh1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on the present results, we hypothesize that ectopic expression of Nab2 might interfere with p300 function or H4 histone acetylation at the COL1A2 locus by recruiting HDAC1, thereby inhibiting COL1A2 transcription. Sustained TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation might result in a relative imbalance between Nab2 and Egr-1 favoring the former, resulting in inhibition of selected Egr-1-dependent genes. This notion is illustrated schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007620-g007">Fig. 7</xref>.</p><p>We have shown that Egr-1 expression was up-regulated in scleroderma skin biopsies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007620-Bhattacharyya1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Strong Egr-1 staining was localized primarily to fibroblastic cells within the reticular dermis, presumably reflecting activity of TGF-&#x003b2; in the fibrotic cellular milieu. The present results show that while Nab2 expression was highly elevated in scleroderma skin biopsies, in contrast to Egr-1, it was localized almost exclusively to the epidermis and epithelial cells lining dermal appendages, whereas dermal fibroblasts showed scant Nab2 expression.</p><p>In summary, we furnish novel insight into the pathogenesis of fibrogenesis by showing that the Egr-1 cofactor Nab2 is potently induced by TGF-&#x003b2; in normal fibroblasts, and it acts in a negative feedback loop for repressing Egr-1-dependent TGF-&#x003b2; signaling. We found a marked overexpression of Nab2 in scleroderma skin biopsies, where Nab2 was localized to epithelial cells, with only scant expression in fibroblastic cells in the dermis. These findings suggest that excessive TGF-&#x003b2; activity in the lesional skin results in Nab2 up-regulation in the epidermis, whereas in dermal fibroblasts, the primary effector cells responsible for skin fibrosis, a relative imbalance between Egr-1 and Nab2 expression exists. The results suggest that Nab2 forms part of a transcriptional circuitry that normally plays a negative feedback role by extinguishing acute Egr-1 activity induced by TGF-&#x003b2;, as well as hypoxia and other stimuli associated with injury and fibrogenesis. Since inducible Nab2 expression normally appears to be responsible for restoring basal homeostasis and fibroblasts quiescence, defective function of the Egr-1/Nab2 self-regulating activity might play an important role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to J Svaren (University of Wisconsin Madison School of Veterinary Medicine, Madison, WI) for providing
