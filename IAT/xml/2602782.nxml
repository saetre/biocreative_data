Using RNA affinity chromatography with the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) of <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA and adult testis extracts, several associated proteins including a novel isoform of the AU-rich element RNA-binding protein and KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) were identified.

In addition to the &#x0223c;75-kDa KSRP, a &#x0223c;52-kD KSRP, t-KSRP, is present in the cytoplasm of a subpopulation of germ cells. t-KSRP binds directly to a 93-nt sequence (designated the F1 region) of the 3&#x02032;-UTR of the <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA and destabilizes <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA constructs in testis extracts and in transfected cells.

Mammals express two functional PGKs, PGK1, an X-linked ubiquitous protein expressed in somatic cells, oogenic cells and premeiotic and meiotic male germ cells, and a testis-specific isoform, PGK2, expressed in postmeiotic male germ cells and spermatozoa. The latter is believed to have evolved by retroposition to compensate for the loss of PGK1 expression following X-chromosome inactivation during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In mice, <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA is first detected in early stages of meiotic spermatocytes and dramatically increases in postmeiotic spermatids, while the PGK2 protein is not detected until many days later in late-stage spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>). Microarray studies have confirmed the posttranscriptional regulation of <italic>Pgk2</italic>, demonstrating that <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNAs are initially detected as ribonucleoproteins in meiotic spermatocytes and then move onto polysomes in later stage haploid germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). This temporal separation of <italic>Pgk2</italic> transcription and translation for up to 2 weeks requires both long-term <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA stabilization and translational activation/degradation, suggesting that <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors are important in controlling <italic>Pgk2</italic> expression.</p><p>In the mammalian testis, posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA is essential for the sequential expression of proteins, especially in haploid germ cells because of the termination of transcription as spermatids differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The testis contains many RNA-binding proteins, which regulate posttranscriptional events including mRNA processing, transport, localization, stability and translation. The germ cell&#x02013;specific DNA/RNA-binding Y-box protein, MSY2, and the polypyrimidine tract binding protein 2 (PTBP2) are two proteins that play important roles in germ cell mRNA stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9">7&#x02013;9</xref>). MSY2 is one of the most abundant RNA-binding proteins in male germ cells, constituting &#x0223c;0.7% of total soluble protein. It functions as a global stabilizer/translational suppressor of many germ cell mRNAs. MSY2 specifically recognizes a population of germ cell mRNAs by binding in the nucleus to a consensus promoter sequence present in their genes thereby linking the nuclear events of transcription with the cytoplasmic processes of mRNA storage and stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Deletion of MSY2 by gene targeting leads to precocious translation and destabilization/loss of many mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). PTBP2, a second protein that stabilizes testicular mRNAs, belongs to a multifunctional family of proteins that function as nuclear splicing factors, direct Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES)-directed translation initiation and stabilize mRNAs in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14 B15 B16 B17">11&#x02013;17</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> assays reveal that PTBP2 increases the stability of <italic>Pgk2 m</italic>RNA in both testis extracts and in transfected HeLa cells, suggesting that PTBP2 helps maintain the <italic>in vivo</italic> stability of the <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA by binding to a regulatory element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>To begin to identify proteins that destabilize germ cell mRNAs, RNA affinity chromatography was used to screen testis cytoplasmic extracts with the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR) of <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA. Among several RNA-binding proteins, a novel &#x0223c;52-kDa isoform of the multifunctional KH-type splicing regulatory protein (t-KSRP) was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). An &#x0223c;75-kDa KSRP that is ubiquitously expressed has been implicated in transcriptional regulation, splicing and mRNA decay in somatic tissues and cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24 B25 B26">17&#x02013;26</xref>). Here we demonstrate that t-KSRP binds to an AU-rich sequence in the 3&#x02032;-UTR of <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA and destabilizes the <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA. Moreover, the destabilization of <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA occurs when t-KSRP and PTBP2 are present together in complexes bound to the 3&#x02032;-UTR of <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction and expression of the &#x0223c;52-kDa KSRP</title><p>Mass spectrometry sequence analysis of a &#x0223c;52-kDa protein purified from an adult testis cytoplasmic extract by RNA affinity chromatography identified 17 peptides mapping to KSRP. The peptides ranged from amino acid 218&#x02013;684 (9, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In western blots, an antibody against the C-terminus of the &#x0223c;75-kDa KSRP (DB-KS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B) recognized both the testicular KSRPs, suggesting that the &#x0223c;52-kDa KSRP isoform (t-KSRP) is an N-terminally truncated form of KSRP. Based on the MS-TOF sequences, the western blotting (see below), and the &#x0223c;52-kDa electrophoretic mobility of t-KSRP, a recombinant t-KSRP was synthesized starting at methionine 207 and terminating at amino acid 748 (the last amino acid of the &#x0223c;75-kDa KSRP). This recombinant N-truncated KSRP was synthesized because it is not known if the smaller KSRP isoform is translated from an internal methionine (at amino acid 207) or is a cleavage product of the &#x0223c;75-kDa KSRP. Based on mass spectrometry and estimated protein size, the recombinant protein synthesized is very close in size to a protein containing a peptide starting at amino acid 218 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The &#x0223c;52-kDa protein, t-KSRP<sub>207-748</sub> (NM_010613), was amplified by reverse transcription&#x02013;polymerase chain reaction (RT&#x02013;PCR) from adult mouse testis total RNA and subcloned into pET-42a (Novagen, San Diego, CA). Recombinant t-KSRP was expressed in BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RP cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), purified with a Glutathione S-transferase (GST) purification kit and, when necessary, digested with thrombin to remove the GST tag. For the transfection studies, the PCR product of t-KSRP (207&#x02013;748 of full-length KSRP) was digested with HindIII and SalI and cloned into the HindIII/SalI site of pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to generate the expression plasmid, pEGFP-KSRP. <table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>MALDI-TOF analysis for 52 kDa KSRP</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Peptide sequence</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Location in 75 kDa KSRP (amino acid number)</th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GGPPGQFHDNANGGQNGTV QEIMIPAGK</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">218&#x02013;245</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AGLVIGKGGETIK</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">246&#x02013;258</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GGETIKQLQER</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">253&#x02013;263</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MILIQDGSQNTNVDKPLR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">268&#x02013;285</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ERDQGGFGDR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">306&#x02013;315</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">DQGGFGDR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">308&#x02013;315</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">VGGGIDVPVPR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">322&#x02013;332</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">HSVGVVIGR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">333&#x02013;341</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IQNDAGVR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">349-356</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IAHIMGPPDR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">370&#x02013;379</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IINDLLQSLR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">386&#x02013;395</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GRGQGNWGPPGGEMTFSIPTHK</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">415&#x02013;436</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AINQQTGAFVEISR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">450&#x02013;463</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">GSPQQIDHAK</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">480&#x02013;489</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AWEEYYK</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">622&#x02013;628; 648&#x02013;654</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IGQQPQQPGAPPQQDYTK</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">630&#x02013;647</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">QAQVATGGGPGAPPGSQPDYSA AWAEYYR</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">656&#x02013;684</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec><title>Semiquantitative RT&#x02013;PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from the testes of 17-day-old, adult, wild-type mice with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), residual genomic DNA was removed with the TurboDNA free kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and the amount of <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA was quantitated using qualitative RT&#x02013;PCR.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the full-length and truncated forms of PTBP2 are functionally indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).

There is a growing awareness that posttranscriptional events play major regulatory roles in mRNA metabolism and function in eukaryotic cells. Although microarray studies provide great insight into the temporal and cellular transcription of the testicular transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), mRNA stabilization is an essential regulatory mechanism in haploid differentiating germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Proteins such as the abundant germ cell&#x02013;specific DNA/RNA-binding protein, MSY2, stabilize many germ cell mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), while the PTBP2 selectively stabilizes mRNAs such as the PGK 2 mRNA in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Because many male germ cell mRNAs are sequestered into residual bodies, which are subsequently phagocytized by Sertoli cells, major efforts to define mechanisms that degrade male germ cell mRNAs have not been undertaken. In contrast, in somatic cells, mRNA degradation events often dependent on AU-rich sequence elements (AREs) and proteins such as KSRP that bind to them have been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>AREs are common <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in eukaryotic transcripts that promote rapid mRNA turnover by recruiting KSRP-containing protein complexes to mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In addition to its originally described function(s) as a splicing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), KSRP facilitates the degradation of short-lived mRNAs encoding proteins such cytokines, growth factors and protooncogenes through interactions with AREs in their 3&#x02032;-UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24 B25 B26">19&#x02013;26</xref>). The tethering of KSRP to HIV-1 mRNA constructs elicits rapid mRNA decay and a dramatic viral reduction by recruiting mRNA decay/machinery factors to the bound KSRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Recently, the chicken protein, ZBP2, a homologue of KSRP, has been demonstrated to bind to sequences that control the subcellular localization of actin mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Three classes of AREs have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) based on the presence of one or more of the AUUUA motifs in their 3&#x02032;-UTRs (class I), multiple overlapping motifs in their 3&#x02032;-UTRs (class II) or no obvious AUUUA motifs in their 3&#x02032;-UTRs (class III).</p><p>Although the &#x0223c;75-kDa KSRP is often the predominant KSRP in somatic cells, in the testis the &#x0223c;52-kDa KSRP, t-KSRP, is the primary isoform of KSRP in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Based on the existence of only one size of KSRP mRNA in testis, we believe that t-KSRP is not derived from an independent KSRP mRNA, but is either proteolytically cleaved from the somatic KSRP similar to the apoptotic cleavage of KSRP in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) or t-KSRP is translated from an internal initiation site (methionine 207) in the <italic>&#x0223c;</italic>4-kb KSRP mRNA. Edman protein sequencing of t-KSRP suggests an N-terminus block (data not shown). Sequence analysis of 17 peptides from t-KSRP obtained following RNA affinity chromatography indicates that although t-KSRP lacks part of the first RNA-binding domain, the remaining three KH RNA-binding domains are intact. We find that t-KSRP is functionally active in mRNA binding, consistent with i<italic>n vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies demonstrating that the third and fourth KH domains of KSRP are sufficient for promoting mRNA decay <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>The functions of multifunctional proteins such as KSRP are often defined by their subcellular location(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Numerous splicing studies with KSRP have been supported by its nuclear localization, and a recent immunofluorescent study concluded KSRP is almost exclusively nuclear in HeLa and neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Although KSRP shows flexibility in recognition of RNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), binding of KSRP to AREs in 3&#x02032;-UTRs of mRNAs is indicative of cytoplasmic roles for KSRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24 B25 B26">19&#x02013;26</xref>). To accomplish both splicing and mRNA decay in somatic cells, KSRP would need to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm as has been reported for other RNA-binding proteins such hnRNP K, Translin and Trax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The N-terminus of KSRP likely contributes to its intracellular movement. The <italic>Xenopus</italic> homologue of KSRP, which lacks a 58-amino-acid segment near the N-terminus, is present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm during oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), consistent with our observation that in mouse testis the truncated t-KSRP is primarily in the cytoplasm, while the full-length KSRP is solely nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The abundance and cytoplasmic location of t-KSRP and the nuclear location of the &#x0223c;75-kDa KSRP support a posttranscriptional mRNA regulatory role for t-KSRP in the mammalian testis.</p><p>We have identified a testicular variant of the KSRP, t-KSRP, a protein that we believe facilitates the decay of mRNAs such as <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA in meiotic germ cells. In contrast to many of the rapidly degraded mRNAs recognized by KSRP in somatic cells, t-KSRP binds to a 93-nt AU-rich class III region in the 3&#x02032;-UTR of the <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA, a germ cell mRNA that may be short-lived mRNA during meiosis, but becomes a long-lived stable mRNA in postmeiotic germ cells. This transition appears to be facilitated by another RNA-binding protein in the testis, PTBP2, which functions to maintain <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Thus, upon reduction of levels of t-KSRP during the transition from spermatocytes to spermatids, the dominant <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA decay-promoting activity is lost and the transcript-stabilizing activity of PTBP2 prevails, leading to a dramatic increase in the level of <italic>Pgk2</italic> transcript in round spermatids in the absence of any increase in transcription rate of the <italic>Pgk2</italic> gene.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> assays and transfection studies indicate the PTBP2 stabilizes the <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA by direct binding to the F1 region of the 3&#x02032;-UTR of the <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA, the same part of the 3&#x02032;-UTR recognized by t-KSRP. Since t-KSRP and PTBP2 interact and both recognize the same RNA-binding region of the <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA, this raises the question how t-KSRP destabilizes mRNAs in the presence of PTBP2. Although the mechanism resulting in the apparent dominance of the destabilizing effect of t-KSRP over the stabilizing effect of PTBP2 is not known, we do know that the two proteins interact and form F1 RNA&#x02013;protein complexes that contain both proteins. In the nuclei of WERI-1 retinoblastoma cells, the binding of full-length KSRP to RNA requires the adjacent binding of PTBP2, and the interaction of KSRP, PTBP2 and other factors facilitates the cooperative assembly of an hnRNP complex for splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In the cytoplasm, less is known about the functional interactions between the KSRP and PTBP proteins. As we propose for t-KSRP and PTBP2 in the testis, binding of KSRP and PTBP1 is believed to control the decay and stability of human inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA, but the mechanism of their molecular interactions is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>The apparent dominance of t-KSRP over PTBP2 may reflect <italic>in vivo</italic> RNA binding differences among t-KSRP, PTBP2 and accessory proteins/factors. Alternatively, protein availability may be important because during early meiosis when <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA levels are lowest, t-KSRP is most abundant and PTBP2 levels are low. t-KSRP levels decrease in later meiotic germ cells and round spermatids and is not detectable in condensing spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), consistent with the &#x0223c;20-fold increase of <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA in the testes of adult mice, resulting at least in part from the absence of t-KSRP in later stage postmeiotic germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Protein variants (isoproteins) are especially common in male germ cells. The testis expresses isoforms of many proteins including lactate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, aldolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha, PGK and even KSRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The isoprotein PGK2 is believed to have evolved to replace PGK1 because PGK1 becomes inactivated during meiotic sex-chromosome inactivation. Other isoproteins have been proposed to optimize metabolic activities unique to germ cells. The temporal synthesis patterns of many of these proteins require delayed mRNA utilization, suggesting that t-KSRP and PTBP2 are likely to regulate the cytoplasmic steady-state levels of numerous germ cell mRNAs in addition to <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA. Sequence analysis of mRNAs precipitated by anti-PTBP2 and anti-KSRP includes Tex27, Ddc8 and Spata6, genes whose mRNAs are translationally regulated similar to <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>In summary, <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA is first detectable in early meiosis in spermatocytes and increases dramatically in spermatids (2&#x02013;4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). t-KSRP is abundant in early meiosis and markedly decreases, becoming undetectable in postmeiotic male germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The decline of t-KSRP and increase of PTBP2 are concomitant with the increase in <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA levels. We speculate that in the cytoplasm of early meiotic spermatocytes, t-KSRP promotes the decay of <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA and as t-KSRP levels decrease, <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA levels rise from continued transcription and stabilization by protein complexes containing PTBP2 in late-stage meiotic spermatocytes and postmeiotic spermatids. Many additional proteins are likely essential for these processes. In somatic tissues, KSRP stimulates mRNA decay by recruiting a decay-promoting exosomal complex to target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In testis extracts, t-KSRP interacts with exosomal proteins such as EXOSC7 (Rrp42p) and Rrp40p (data not shown). Thus, a number of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors will contribute to the synthesis/stabilization/destabilization of the <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA during spermatogenesis. Recently, a number of additional germ cell mRNAs have been demonstrated to exhibit temporal RNP/polysomal regulation similar to <italic>Pgk2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The possibility that they represent additional t-KSRP target mRNAs that undergo a coordinated regulation merits investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> (grant <grant-num>HD 28832</grant-num>).</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
