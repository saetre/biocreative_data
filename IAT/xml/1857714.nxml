While studying changes in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> memory and na&#x000ef;ve T cells during HIV-1 infection, we found that a subset of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> effector memory T cells that are CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD45RO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (referred to as T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells), was significantly increased in some HIV-infected individuals. This T cell subset displayed a differentiated phenotype and skewed Th1-type cytokine production. Despite expressing high levels of CCR5, T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells were strikingly resistant to infection with CCR5 (R5)&#x02013;tropic HIV-1, but remained highly susceptible to CXCR4 (X4)&#x02013;tropic HIV-1. The resistance of T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells to R5-tropic viruses was determined to be post-entry of the virus and prior to early viral reverse transcription, suggesting a block at the uncoating stage. Remarkably, in a subset of the HIV-infected individuals, the relatively high proportion of T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells within effector T cells strongly correlated with higher CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell numbers. These data provide compelling evidence for selection of an HIV-1&#x02013;resistant CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell population during the course of HIV-1 infection. Determining the host factors within T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells that restrict R5-tropic viruses and endow HIV-1&#x02013;specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells with this ability may result in novel therapeutic strategies against HIV-1 infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>HIV-1 infection profoundly perturbs the immune system and is characterized by depletion of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and chronic immune activation, which lead to AIDS. Although HIV-1 targets CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, it also requires a second receptor in order to infect the target cells. The majority of HIV-1 strains that are transmitted use a cell surface molecule called CCR5, which is expressed on a portion of T cells. In this manuscript we identify a subset of human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, which we termed T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells, that express CCR5 but still remain resistant to infection. We show that HIV-1 infection is blocked in T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells after entry of the virus, but before it has a chance to integrate into the cellular genome. T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells are present at low frequency in HIV-1 uninfected individuals but greatly increase in some HIV-infected individuals, which correlates with higher CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell numbers. These findings provide the basis for future studies to understand the role of T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells during HIV-1 infection and identify the host factors that could restrict the virus. This knowledge may be used to endow susceptible T cells with the ability to resist infection and result in novel vaccine or therapeutic strategies against HIV-1 infection.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Oswald-Richter K, Grill SM, Leelawong M, Tseng M, Kalams SA, et al.

In contrast, T<sub>CM</sub> cells express high levels of CCR7 and lack potent effector functions.

In most uninfected individuals, this analysis divides CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells into three subsets that can be readily quantified: na&#x000ef;ve T cells (T<sub>N</sub>; CD45RO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CCR7<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), central memory T cells (T<sub>CM</sub>; CD45RO<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CCR7<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), and effector memory T cells (T<sub>EM</sub>; CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, left panel). However, in HIV-uninfected individuals, a fourth subset (CD45RO<sup>&#x02212;/dull</sup>CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), albeit with a low frequency (0.5&#x00025;&#x02013;3&#x00025;). This subset was greatly increased in some of the HIV-infected individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, right panel). Because these cells resembled a previously defined CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell subset (called CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells) with effector functions that expressed CD45RA with effector functions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030058-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, we tentatively termed them CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells (referred to as T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells hereafter).

The proportion of T<sub>EMRO</sub> and T<sub>EMRA</sub> subsets was significantly increased in HIV-infected individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). On the other hand, the proportion of T<sub>N</sub> cells was significantly decreased in HIV-infected individuals, while the proportion of T<sub>CM</sub> cells remained similar in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Phenotypic Characterization of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub> Cells</title><p>The high proportion of T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells found in HIV-infected individuals prompted further analysis of this subset.

The four subsets of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (T<sub>N</sub>, T<sub>CM</sub>, T<sub>EMRO</sub>, and T<sub>EMRA</sub>) obtained from HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals were analyzed for expression of cell surface molecules known to be expressed differentially in na&#x000ef;ve, memory, and effector T cells.

To assess the relative proliferative capacity of the different CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell subsets, each subset was purified from an HIV-uninfected individual according to CCR7 and CD45RO expression as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, and stimulated with dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with superantigen (staphylococcal enterotoxin B &#x0005b;SEB&#x0005d;).

The activated T cells were then infected with either R5-tropic replication-competent HIV (R5.HIV), CXCR4 (X4)&#x02013;tropic replication-competent HIV (X4.HIV), or replication-defective viruses that only undergo a single round of replication and are pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSV-G.HIV).

In addition, the median CCR5 expression was quantitated from 20 HIV-infected individuals, and the similar subset expression trends were confirmed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0030058-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). When each T cell subset isolated from an HIV-uninfected individual was challenged with R5.HIV, CD4 T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EMRO</sub> cells were more susceptible to infection than T<sub>N</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), most likely reflecting high CCR5 surface expression levels on these memory T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). In contrast, T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells were resistant to a high multiplicity challenge with R5.HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, top panel). This was an unexpected finding given the high cell surface CCR5 levels on T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). At day 12 post-infection, R5.HIV spread through the cultures, producing more infected T<sub>N</sub>, T<sub>CM</sub>, and T<sub>EMRO</sub> cells as compared to 5 d post-infection.

Infection was quantified based on GFP expression at different time points after inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), and viral replication was assessed by quantifying HIV p24 protein in culture supernatants.

Both CD57<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD57<sup>&#x02212;</sup> subsets of T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells were resistant to infection by R5-tropic virus, whereas both CD57<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD57<sup>&#x02212;</sup> subsets of T<sub>EMRO</sub> cells remained susceptible to R5-tropic virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g006">Figure 6</xref>, top panel). However, the CD57<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD57<sup>&#x02212;</sup> subsets of both T<sub>EMRO</sub> and T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells were similarly susceptible to X4-tropic viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g006">Figure 6</xref>, bottom panel). Thus, the relative resistance of T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells to R5-tropic HIV was not attributable to enrichment with the CD57<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> subset.</p><p>We next investigated where in the HIV-1 life cycle R5-tropic infection of T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells was blocked. Because large numbers of cells were required for these experiments, we expanded T<sub>N</sub>, T<sub>CM</sub>, T<sub>EMRO</sub>, and T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells purified from PBMCs of HIV-uninfected individuals using SEB-pulsed DCs for 12 d in IL-2&#x02013;containing medium. In order to verify that CCR5 expression levels were maintained on expanded T cell subsets and that T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells remained resistant to R5-tropic infection, CCR5 expression was determined post-activation and expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, top panel). The expanded subsets were then reactivated with SEB-pulsed DCs and subsequently infected with R5.HIV. Although the T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells maintained very high CCR5 expression, they remained resistant to R5-tropic infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, bottom panel).</p><p>We first asked whether the block of R5-tropic infection was at the level of fusion. For this experiment, we employed a recently developed reporter assay to quantify HIV particle entry &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030058-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Expanded T<sub>CM</sub>, T<sub>EMRO</sub>, and T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells were infected with either R5.HIV, X4.HIV, or VSV-G.HIV. Fusion of these three viruses with T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells was similarly efficient, whereas fusion was inhibited in both T<sub>N</sub> and Jurkat cells, which do not express CCR5, or when cells were pre-treated with T20, a fusion inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Collectively, these data indicate that the R5.HIV infection block in T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells is post-fusion.</p><p>We next conducted analysis of the stage in the HIV-1 life cycle at which R5-tropic and VSV-G pseudotyped virus replication was blocked in the T<sub>EMRA</sub> subset. Late reverse transcripts in cells infected with VSV-G.HIV, R5.HIV, and X4.HIV were analyzed. Infection was blocked at the level of reverse transcription in T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells infected with R5.HIV and VSV-G.HIV, suggesting an early block to infection in these cells that did not affect X4.HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g007">Figure 7</xref>C).</p><p>Because we did not see the accumulation of late reverse transcription products, we wanted to understand whether earlier steps in reverse transcription were impaired. Therefore, we investigated the initiation of reverse transcription of R5-tropic and VSV-G pseudotyped virus in T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells. Early reverse transcription was assessed by the presence of strong-stop, minus-strand viral DNA (R/U5 DNA) by quantitative real-time PCR. Early transcripts were not formed in T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells infected with R5.HIV or VSV-G.HIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). These data suggest that the block in the HIV-1 life cycle occurs at or prior to the initiation of reverse transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Correlation of T<sub>EMRA</sub> Cell Levels with CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Cell Numbers in HIV-Infected Individuals</title><p>Our findings that T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells are expanded in a portion of HIV-infected individuals and are highly resistant to R5-tropic infection prompted us to examine relationships between high T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells and CD4 numbers. Among HIV-infected individuals, the T<sub>N</sub> cell percentage correlated positively with absolute CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Conversely, the total T<sub>EM</sub> cell (T<sub>EMRO</sub> &#x0002b; T<sub>EMRA</sub>) percentage correlated negatively with CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g001">Figure 1</xref>B; unpublished data). To further delineate the association between T<sub>EMRO</sub> and T<sub>EMRA</sub> cell proportions and CD4 numbers, we subdivided infected individuals into three groups based on their total T<sub>EM</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Infected individuals in whom the T<sub>EM</sub> percentage of their CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells was similar to healthy individuals (bottom group) had high CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g008">Figure 8</xref>; unpublished data). In contrast, the group with a very high T<sub>EM</sub> cell percentage had low CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell numbers, and all of these individuals had high levels of T<sub>EMRO</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g008">Figure 8</xref>, top group). Importantly, however, when we subdivided the infected individuals with median levels of T<sub>EM</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g008">Figure 8</xref>, middle group), a highly significant association between higher T<sub>EMRA</sub> cell percentage and higher CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell numbers and higher T<sub>N</sub> cells was established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g008">Figure 8</xref>). These results imply that a greater proportion of T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells within the effector T cell subset may identify individuals with better preservation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell numbers, and possibly slow HIV-1 disease progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our investigation of memory T cell subsets during HIV-1 infection led to the discovery of a unique subset of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells called CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells. We found that these cells are highly susceptible to infection by X4-tropic HIV-1 but are almost completely resistant to R5-tropic HIV-1 despite high levels of cell surface CCR5 expression. These cells are also relatively resistant to infection by VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1. Our findings are consistent with a recent ex vivo analysis of T cell subsets from HIV-infected individuals, which demonstrated that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD57<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> effector memory T cells were associated with approximately ten times fewer copies of viral DNA than T<sub>CM</sub> cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030058-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Although both CD57<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD57<sup>&#x02212;</sup> subsets of T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells displayed the same R5-tropic HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g005">Figure 5</xref>C), overall, CD57<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells are more enriched within T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030058-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells represent the first unique subpopulation of CD4&#x0002b; T cells that are uniquely resistant to HIV-1 infection and may emerge as a consequence selection during infection.</p><p>Further studies are required to elucidate how T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells can be resistant to R5-tropic infection despite high levels of CCR5 expression, yet remain susceptible to X4-tropic viruses. In order to exclude that this restriction was at the level of post-entry and not because of downregulation or block of CCR5 by beta-chemokines, we showed that 1) T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells permitted entry of R5-tropic HIV-1 as measured by the BlaM-Vpr virion fusion assay, 2) T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells continued to express high levels of CCR5 at the time of infection, 3) and T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells were partly less susceptible to VSV-G pseudotyped viruses that bypass the coreceptor requirement. Taken together, these results indicate that the post-entry pathway followed by R5-tropic HIV-1 may differ in T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells compared to other CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CCR5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell subsets and to X4-tropic HIV-1&#x02013;infecting T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells. It is conceivable that either signaling or the entry pathway through the CXCR4 receptor elicits intracellular events needed for HIV replication or bypasses mechanisms that otherwise restrict HIV-1 in T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells.</p><p>Elucidating cellular mechanisms that determine why some, but not all, CCR5-expressing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are permissive to R5-tropic HIV-1 infection could provide clues to identify natural cellular HIV-1 barriers. Our findings suggest that at least one subset of primary human T cells display intrinsic restriction that limits HIV-1 infection. The presence of differentiated T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells in HIV-1 infected individuals and in uninfected individuals, albeit at lower frequency, suggests that these cells expand and survive during the course of the normal immune response. These findings also pose several important questions: How do T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells arise? Are they repeatedly stimulated memory T cells? What aspect of the T<sub>EMRA</sub> cell differentiation program renders them resistant to HIV-1 infection? For example, T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells displayed a preferential Th1 phenotype and exhibited a reduced proliferative capacity as well as a cell surface marker and cytokine profile characteristic of highly differentiated T cells. A subset of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that are CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD27<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells) has been shown to display similar phenotypic features to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells characterized here &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030058-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030058-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030058-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. It is not yet clear whether CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells are functionally similar to CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells or what role these subsets play during chronic viral infections. The homeostatic mechanisms that induce and maintain CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells also remains to be determined.</p><p>Our finding that T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells correlate with higher CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell numbers in a portion of HIV-infected individuals suggests that virus infection may positively drive selection for HIV-resistant cells in vivo, a phenomenon previously observed only in cell culture but usually involving loss of CD4 expression. Studies using animal models for HIV-1 infection may aid in determining whether there is a causal relationship between virus infection and selective enrichment of the T<sub>EMRA</sub> subset. Remarkably, HIV-infected individuals whose T<sub>EM</sub> cells were composed mostly of T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells were significantly associated with higher CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell and T<sub>N</sub> cell levels. How T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells accumulate or expand in HIV patients, and whether they have a protective role against progression of disease, remains to be determined. Memory and effector T cells are enriched for CCR5 expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030058-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030058-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that they are targets for HIV-1, especially T cells resident in the gut tissue &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030058-b027">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030058-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. It is conceivable that after continuous destruction of susceptible T<sub>EMRO</sub> cells, an HIV-resistant subset of T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells is selected. Alternatively, T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells may have a protective role against HIV-1 infection, perhaps because HIV-specific T cells are enriched in this subset. If T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells contain a high proportion of HIV-specific effector T cells, this would overcome a potential Achilles' heel of the immune response during HIV-1 infection; that is, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that are activated by HIV-1 antigens themselves become highly susceptible targets for the virus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030058-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Conferring an HIV-resistant ability to HIV-1&#x02013;specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells could lead to novel strategies aimed at potentiating a protective immune response against HIV-1 infection.</p><p>During the primary and asymptomatic phases of HIV-1 infection, R5-tropic viruses predominate, whereas X4-tropic viruses are found in about 50&#x00025; of infected individuals at late stages of HIV disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030058-b032">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030058-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. A more rapid decline in total CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell counts is often associated with a switch from R5-tropic to X4-tropic HIV or R5/X4 HIV variants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030058-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. At present, it is unclear whether the switch to X4-tropic viruses is a cause or a consequence of the collapse of the immune system. Because T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells remain highly susceptible to X4-tropic viruses, it would be expected that these cells would also be rapidly depleted when an X4-tropic switch occurs. If T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells contain HIV-specific T cells or play some other protective role against infection, then elimination of these cells by X4-tropic viruses would further weaken the immune response against HIV-1 and facilitate immunological deterioration.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells are present at a higher frequency in HIV-infected than uninfected individuals and are resistant to R5-tropic HIV infection, but not to X4-tropic HIV-1 infection. Studies focused on emergence of these effector memory T cell subsets will contribute to a better understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis and the role of these cells during normal immune responses. Decoding the precise molecular mechanism of the intrinsic resistance of T<sub>EMRA</sub> cells to R5-tropic infection may have significant implications for developing novel approaches to endow this unique phenotype on HIV-1&#x02013;susceptible T cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell isolation and culture.</title><p>PBMCs were separated from blood of HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected individuals through Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pfizer.com">http://www.pfizer.com</ext-link>).
