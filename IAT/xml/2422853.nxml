We characterized the <italic>CDC14B</italic> cell cycle gene and the functional evolution of its hominoid-specific daughter gene, <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic>. We found that <italic>CDC14B</italic> encodes four different splice isoforms that show different subcellular localizations (nucleus or microtubule-associated) and functional properties. A microtubular <italic>CDC14B</italic> variant spawned <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> through retroposition in the hominoid ancestor 18&#x02013;25 million years ago (Mya). <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> evolved brain-/testis-specific expression after the duplication event and experienced a short period of intense positive selection in the African ape ancestor 7&#x02013;12 Mya. Using resurrected ancestral protein variants, we demonstrate that by virtue of amino acid substitutions in distinct protein regions during this time, the subcellular localization of CDC14Bretro progressively shifted from the association with microtubules (stabilizing them) to an association with the endoplasmic reticulum. CDC14Bretro evolution represents a paradigm example of rapid, selectively driven subcellular relocalization, thus revealing a novel mode for the emergence of new gene function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Many new gene copies emerged by gene duplication in human and ape (hominoid) ancestors. However, little is known with respect to their functional evolution. We used a combination of evolutionary analyses and cell biology experiments to unveil the adaptive evolution of the hominoid-specific <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> gene, which arose as a reverse-transcribed copy of a messenger RNA of its &#x0201c;parent,&#x0201d; the <italic>CDC14B</italic> cell cycle gene. We first show that the <italic>CDC14B</italic> parental gene encodes different splice isoforms that differ with respect to their subcellular localization and functional properties. One of these isoforms, which is associated with microtubules throughout the cell cycle (stabilizing them and potentially contributing to their organization), spawned <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic> in the common ape ancestor 18&#x02013;25 million years ago. In the African ape (human/chimp/gorilla) ancestor, around 7&#x02013;12 million years ago, intense positive selection then led to rapid relocalization of the CDC14Bretro protein from microtubules to a new cellular location&#x02014;the endoplasmic reticulum. This radical subcellular shift likely reflects the evolution of a new function of CDC14Bretro in the African ape lineage. In contrast, CDC14Bretro retained the ancestral (parental) localization and function in Asian apes (orangutans and gibbons). Our study not only adds to the rare known cases of ape-specific genes for which selectively driven substitutions could be tied to functional protein change and adaptation, but, more generally, reveals a novel mode that may underlie the emergence of new gene function: rapid, selectively driven subcellular adaptation.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Evolutionary and experimental analyses of the hominoid CDC14 retrogene uncover a novel mode for the emergence of new gene function: selectively driven subcellular adaptation of the encoded protein.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Rosso L, Marques AC, Weier M, Lambert N, Lambot M-A, et al.

These results suggest that the localization and MT stabilization capacities are, to some extent, decoupled. The termini seem to be crucial for MT localization, while the core domain is necessary for MT stabilization. Thus, there seems to be a complex interplay of the different parts of the protein; both the protein termini and the core domain are needed for effective MT association and stabilization of the ancestral CDC14B variants. Together, the MT localization and stabilization analyses substantiate the view that most or all of the substitutions that occurred throughout the protein during the period of positive selection in the African ape ancestor were likely adaptive and required for the subcellular/functional shift of CDC14Bretro.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we set out to characterize the <italic>CDC14B</italic> cell cycle gene and, in particular, the functional evolution of its daughter gene <italic>CDC14Bretro</italic>.

This result has important consequences, as future studies of CDC14B need to take the presence of different isoforms into account and assess their functional roles separately. We have begun here to functionally characterize one of the novel splice variants, <italic>CDC14Bpar</italic>, and we find that it encodes a protein that is associated with MTs throughout the cell cycle. CDC14Bpar reorganizes from MTs in interphase to the spindle pole during mitosis and possesses a strong microtubular stabilization capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g001">Figures 1</xref>E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g003">3</xref>G&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g003">3</xref>I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060140-g007">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060140-sg003">Figure S3</xref>).

Our functional analyses&#x02014;demonstrating conservation of ancestral MT localization and stabilization patterns of CDC14Bretro from the great ape ancestor and the extant Asian apes&#x02014;suggest that until the evolutionary separation of African and Asian apes &#x0223c;12 Mya &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, CDC14Bretro may have been functionally preserved (and advantageous) to provide increased dosage of the CDC14Bpar parental isoform during the cell cycle of these tissues. In the African ape ancestor, a radical shift toward a new localization on the ER then occurred. The subcellular/functional shift of CDC14Bretro was perhaps facilitated by the evolution of increased brain (testis) expression of CDC14Bpar, which might have released selective pressure to retain a second <italic>CDC14B</italic> gene copy with similar functional properties in the African ape ancestor. Although CDC14Bretro apparently retained its phosphatase function (all sites required for its phosphatase activity have remained unchanged), it very likely changed its substrate and/or protein interaction partners after relocalizing to the ER.</p><p>The new function of CDC14Bretro from African apes on the ER may be unrelated to the cell cycle, although we note that a cell cycle&#x02013;related function of CDC14Bretro might not be so unlikely, in view of a growing body of work revealing important ties of the ER and the cell cycle (e.g., &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060140-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;).

In addition, we tested statistical significance of the excess of amino acid substitutions in the N- and C-terminal sequences compared to the core domain of CDC14Bretro from the African ape ancestor using Fisher's exact test (nine amino acid substitutions at 139 sites of the termini, 3/338 sites in the core domain). To test for purifying selection (<italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> &#x0003c; 1) on the descendant African ape (since their last common ancestor) and Asian ape lineages, respectively, we compared the likelihood of models where <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> was fixed to 1 to models where <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> was estimated from the data.
