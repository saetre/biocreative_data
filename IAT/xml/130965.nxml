Cultured normal mouse gallbladder epithelial cells, used as a model system for gallbladder epithelium, were examined for their ability to express the mRNA of various cytokines and chemokines in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. The synthesis and secretion of the tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) protein by these cells was also measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Untreated mouse gallbladder cells expressed mRNA for TNF-&#x003b1;, RANTES, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). Upon treatment with lipopolysaccharide, these cells now produced mRNA for Interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;), IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and showed increased expression of TNF-&#x003b1; and MIP-2 mRNA. Untreated mouse gallbladder cells did not synthesize TNF-&#x003b1; protein; however, they did synthesize and secrete TNF-&#x003b1; upon treatment with lipopolysaccharide.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Cells were treated with lipopolysaccharides from 3 strains of bacteria. Qualitative and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, using cytokine or chemokine-specific primers, was used to measure mRNA levels of TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-10, KC, RANTES, MCP-1, and MIP-2.

This suggests a mechanism whereby gallbladder epithelial cells in vivo may mediate gallbladder secretory function, inflammation and diseases in an autocrine/paracrine fashion by producing and secreting cytokines and/or chemokines during sepsis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The biliary system is more than a passive conduit transporting bile from the liver to the intestines. Hepatic bile is actively modified by the epithelial cells that line the bile ducts and gallbladder. Biliary epithelial function is partially under the control of secretin and vasoactive intestinal peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Other extracellular agonists that influence biliary function include neuropeptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and bile salts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition to the well-documented role that cytokines play in the immune response and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], cytokines also modify the functioning of epithelial cells. For instance, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) can modify intracellular signal transduction and regulate ionic channel activities in various epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A few studies have shown that cytokines can alter biliary epithelial cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Biliary epithelial cells are capable of producing a great variety of physiologically active compounds. For example, it has been shown that biliary epithelial cells synthesize nitric oxide, a strong vasodilator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and endothelin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], a potent vasoconstrictor. Various cytokines are also produced by biliary epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. As biliary epithelial cells are capable of both producing and responding to cytokines, these cells may use cytokines for the autocrine/paracrine regulation of their own function as well as that of other cells.</p><p>Bile in the biliary ducts and the gallbladder often contains bacteria and the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This may be due to ascending infection from the intestine or descending infection via portal venous blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Bacterial infection usually leads to activation of the immune system followed by inflammation. While inflammation is an important element in the defense against infection, it can also contribute to cholestatic biliary diseases and cholelithiasis. Therefore, the control of the immune and inflammatory response of biliary tissue to bacteria is important in determining disease progression. While the biliary epithelium can act as a physical barrier to limit bacterial infection of the underlying tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], its physiological response to bacteria and bacterial products is not well characterized. Like pulmonary and intestinal epithelial cells, biliary epithelial cells might respond to bacteria in bile by producing cytokines and other factors. To test this hypothesis, we used cultured normal mouse gallbladder epithelial cells (MGBE) as an <italic>in vitro</italic> model system to examine the ability of gallbladder epithelium to produce mRNA for various cytokines and chemokines. The synthesis and secretion of TNF-&#x003b1; protein was also measured. These cells demonstrated distinct changes in their cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression profile and TNF-&#x003b1; protein production in response to LPS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Analytical grade chemicals and tissue culture supplies were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.

After two hours, the cells were harvested by trypsinization, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD). Five &#x003bc;g of total RNA was reverse-transcribed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Superscript II Preamplification System, Gibco BRL) using oligo (dT) as primer. cDNA prepared from 0.5 &#x003bc;g RNA was subjected to PCR using murine gene-specific primers for 8 different cytokines and chemokines (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) as previously detailed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. All of the primer pairs spanned at least one intron in the corresponding genomic DNA. Positive RNA controls were performed previously to confirm specificity of primer pairs (data not shown). Negative controls were performed by omitting the RT step or the cDNA template from PCR amplification. For qualitative PCR, target sequences were amplified at 56&#x000b0;C for 25 cycles; for semi-quantitative PCR, target sequences for TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and MIP-2 (CXCL2) were amplified at 56&#x000b0;C between 22 and 32 cycles in order to yield visible products within the linear amplification range. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. All RT-PCR bands at the expected size were also directly sequenced to confirm their identity. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein (ARP) were used as internal controls.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Murine specific primer sequences used in PCR</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>mRNA</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Forward Primer</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Reverse Primer</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Expected product</bold><break/><bold> size (bp)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>GenBank accession</bold><break/><bold> number</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">IL-1&#x003b2;</td><td align="center">5'-gtgtgatgttcccattagacagc</td><td align="center">5'-tgagaggtgctgatgtaccagtt</td><td align="center">383</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">IL-6</td><td align="center">5'-gaaaatctgctctggtcttctgg</td><td align="center">5'-ttttctgaccacagtgaggaatg</td><td align="center">357</td><td align="center">M26744</td></tr><tr><td align="left">IL-10</td><td align="center">5'-tcagtcaagtgaagactttctttc</td><td align="center">5'-gcagttgatgaagatgtcaaactc</td><td align="center">358</td><td align="center">X60675</td></tr><tr><td align="left">TNF&#x003b1;</td><td align="center">5'-tgaacttcggggtgatcggtc</td><td align="center">5'-agccttgtcccttgaagagaac</td><td align="center">295</td><td align="center">X66539</td></tr><tr><td align="left">KC (CXCL1)</td><td align="center">5'-ttgaaggtgatgccgccag</td><td align="center">5'-cccagactctcatctctcc</td><td align="center">205</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">RANTES (CCL5)</td><td align="center">5'-ccccatatggctcggacacca</td><td align="center">5'-ctagctcatctccaaatagttgat</td><td align="center">205</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">MCP-1 (CCL2)</td><td align="center">5'-cactatgcaggtctctgtcacg</td><td align="center">5'-gatctcacttggttctggtcca</td><td align="center">294</td><td align="center">M57441</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MIP-2 (CXCL2)</td><td align="center">5'-cagtgagctgcgctgtccaatg</td><td align="center">5'-cagttagccttgcctttgttcag</td><td align="center">210</td><td align="center">X65647</td></tr><tr><td align="left">GAPDH</td><td align="center">5'-atgtcagatccacaacggatacat</td><td align="center">5'-actccctcaagattgtcagcaat</td><td align="center">307</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">ARP</td><td align="center">5'-gttgaacatctcccccttctc</td><td align="center">5'-atgtcctcatcggattcctcc</td><td align="center">402</td><td align="center">Z29530</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>TNF-&#x003b1; Immunoassay</title><p>Confluent MGBE were fed serum-free medium, with or without LPS added to the apical side (LPS concentration = 2 or 100 &#x003bc;g/mL).

Adding LPS to the bile of guinea pig gallbladders <italic>in vivo</italic> led to increased IL-1 concentration in the bile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

Isolated human intrahepatic epithelial ducts expressed immunoreactive IL-6 when treated with IL-1&#x003b2; or phorbal myristate acetate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Intracellular TNF-&#x003b1; mRNA and protein was detected in intrahepatic biliary duct cells in tissue sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], but not in cultured intrahepatic epithelial cells; therefore, there was no clear demonstration that biliary epithelium secretes TNF-&#x003b1;. Little research has focused on the ability of the epithelial cells of the extrahepatic biliary system to produce cytokines or chemokines.</p><p>As described in this paper, MGBE were used as an <italic>in vitro</italic> model system of gallbladder epithelium to measure the endogenous production of cytokines and chemokines by extrahepatic biliary epithelial cells. These cultured cells consist exclusively of normal, non-neoplastic epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], without other cell types such as leukocytes ordinarily found in biliary tissues. The experiments showed that unstimulated MGBE express mRNA for TNF-&#x003b1;, MIP-2, and RANTES (CCL5). After treating the apical surface of the cells with LPS, the mRNA levels for TNF-&#x003b1; and MIP-2 (CXCL2) increased, while mRNA for IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and MCP-1 (CCL2) appeared for the first time. Therefore, cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6), a C-C type chemokine (MCP-1/CCL2), and a C-X-C type chemokine (MIP-2/CXCL2) are all up regulated at the RNA level by bacterial product interaction with the epithelial cells. The effects of LPS treatment for two hours on cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression clearly suggests that biliary epithelial cells can modify their own cytokine and chemokine production after bacterial challenge at the mRNA level. As with all <italic>in vitro</italic> cell systems there is the possibility that the cells in culture may have phenotypic changes to their cytokine profile compared to <italic>in vivo</italic> cells. In other parameters tested (i.e., morphology, mucin secretion, etc.), these cells retain the normal phenotype of cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Measurements of TNF-&#x003b1; protein showed that MGBE synthesize and secrete TNF-&#x003b1; when exposed to LPS, while untreated cells do not. This demonstrates that gallbladder epithelial cells themselves secrete a cytokine in response to bacterial products. The results from RT-PCR (showing a relatively high TNF-&#x003b1; mRNA expression levels in untreated cells which is only slightly increased by LPS treatment) along with the immunoassay results suggest that TNF-&#x003b1; mRNA is constantly present in these cells, but is not translated into protein until certain triggers are provided. This is consistent with the post-transcriptional regulation of TNF-&#x003b1; observed in other cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In contrast, the mRNA of other factors, such as IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and MCP-1 (CCL2) are not synthesized until the cells are stimulated, suggesting that their production is under transcriptional control. The protein expression of these other cytokines and chemokines along with the precise nature of the interaction between LPS and cell surface receptors warrants further study.</p><p>While the exact role that gallbladder epithelial cells play in inflammatory and infectious diseases has yet to be determined, our research supports the hypothesis that gallbladder epithelium have some innate cytokine-producing capabilities in response to the presence of bacteria on their apical surface. The accumulation of TNF-&#x003b1; in the gallbladder bile of patients with cholangitis may be due in part to the apical release of TNF-&#x003b1; by biliary epithelial cells. In contrast, basolateral secretion of TNF-&#x003b1; could lead to a focal accumulation of TNF-&#x003b1; in the sub-mucosa of biliary tissue. Sufficient cytokine secretion could then stimulate the leukocytes in the sub-epithelial tissue, leading to inflammation of the tissue, without the need for the bacteria to pass through the epithelial barrier. The production of cytokines by gallbladder epithelial cells following LPS exposure demonstrates that biliary epithelial cells may be an active partner with the immune system in the detection of and defense against bacteria in bile.</p><p>During sepsis, biliary epithelial cells could mediate biliary secretory function through cytokine and chemokine production. Dog gallbladder epithelial cells demonstrated increased mucin secretion following TNF-&#x003b1; treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, exogenous TNF-&#x003b1; altered the absorptive properties of cultured human gallbladder epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that TNF-&#x003b1; produced by gallbladder epithelial cells in response to LPS could affect cellular function in an autocrine manner. Since mucin secretion and gallbladder transport properties play vital roles in cholelithiasis, changes in these parameters caused by endogenous cytokines and chemokines may promote stone formation. Epithelial-derived cytokines and chemokines also may alter biliary function leading to cholestasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Gallbladder epithelial cells demonstrated distinct patterns of expression of mRNA for various cytokines and chemokines, and responded to treatment with LPS by altering their expression of certain cytokine and chemokine RNA and increasing TNF-&#x003b1; protein synthesis and secretion. The ability of biliary epithelial cell to control endogenous cytokine and chemokine production has important implications for biliary inflammation and diseases, such as cholangitis, cholestasis, and cholelithiasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>None declared.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CES participated in the design and coordination of the study, performed the immunoassay studies, and drafted the manuscript.
