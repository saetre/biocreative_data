Furthermore, we reported recently that epigenetic changes related to gene transcription are involved in memory formation of stressful events. In view of the enhanced coping capabilities in exercised subjects we investigated epigenetic, gene expression and behavioral changes in 4-weeks voluntarily exercised rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Exercised and control rats coped differently when exposed to a novel environment. Whereas the control rats explored the new cage for the complete 30-min period, exercised animals only did so during the first 15 min after which they returned to sleeping or resting behavior. Both groups of animals showed similar behavioral responses in the initial forced swim session. When re-tested 24 h later however the exercised rats showed significantly more immobility behavior and less struggling and swimming. If rats were killed at 2 h after novelty or the initial swim test, i.e. at the peak of histone H3 phospho-acetylation and c-Fos induction, then the exercised rats showed a significantly higher number of dentate granule neurons expressing the histone modifications and immediate-early gene induction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Thus, irrespective of the behavioral response in the novel cage or initial forced swim session, the impact of the event at the dentate gyrus level was greater in exercised rats than in control animals. Furthermore, in view of our concept that the neuronal response in the dentate gyrus after forced swimming is involved in memory formation of the stressful event, the observations in exercised rats of enhanced neuronal responses as well as higher immobility responses in the re-test are consistent with the reportedly improved cognitive performance in these animals. Thus, improved stress coping in exercised subjects seems to involve enhanced cognitive capabilities possibly resulting from distinct epigenetic mechanisms in dentate gyrus neurons.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is now well established that regular physical exercise has a positive impact on a range of biological systems, including the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Friedman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Gielen1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, currently the underlying mechanisms of these beneficial effects of exercise are still largely unknown. In the present study it was our aim to gain more insight into the neurobiological basis of the enhanced stress-coping capabilities shown by voluntarily exercised animals.</p><p>In particular, we investigated the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the brain involved in transcriptional activation in coordinating adaptive behavioral responses to stressful events. Epigenetic mechanisms comprise of post-translational modifications of DNA and histone proteins within the chromatin structure, such as the methylation of DNA, and the acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and other modifications of the N-terminal tails of distinct histone molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Cheung1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically of interest is the phosphorylation of serine-10 (Ser10) combined with the acetylation of lysine-14 (Lys14) in the N-terminal tail of histone H3 (i.e. P(Ser10)-Ac(Lys14)-H3) as this modification is thought to be involved in the local opening of condensed chromatin, thereby allowing the transcriptional induction of specific, hitherto silent genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Clayton1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Nowak1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. We postulated that these specific chromatin modifications are involved in triggering gene expression responses required for physiological and functional adjustments in neurons involved in the cognitive processing of stressful events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Reul2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Indeed, we could show that psychologically stressful events such as forced swimming and exposure to a novel environment enhances the phosphorylation and phospho-acetylation of histone H3 in a distinct population of dentate gyrus granule neurons in the hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Reul2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Chandramohan2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, we obtained evidence that the phospho-acetylation of histone H3 and the induction of c-Fos is brought about by at least two, concurrently acting signaling pathways being the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the NMDA-R/ERK/MSK pathway (NMDA-R, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MSK, mitogen- and stress-activated kinase) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Reul2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Chandramohan2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, the immediate early gene responses in the nucleus accumbens and PVN were similar in exercised and sedentary control animals. Therefore, it appears that changes in histone H3 phospho-acetylation and gene expression responses in the dentate gyrus are involved in the enhanced stress-coping capabilities seen in exercised animals.</p><p>Exercised rats adopted a different coping strategy than control animals when faced with the novelty challenge. They exhibited less emotionality than their non-running counterparts, exploring their new environment initially but then settling down. In contrast, the non-running, sedentary rats remained active virtually for the full 30 min. These findings correspond with our previous work in which we showed that regular voluntary exercise reduces anxiety-related behavior and novelty-induced glucocorticoid responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Droste1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Droste3">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Binder1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, exercised animals cope better with this mild psychological challenge situation. As they basically stopped exploring the novel environment after 15 min and returned to their normal behavior of this time of the day (which is resting or sleeping), it seems that exercised animals are much quicker than their sedentary counterparts in assessing the novel situation. This may relate to the enhanced cognitive abilities reported in exercised animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-vanPraag1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although the novelty situation appeared to have less influence on the exercised rats, they showed significantly higher dentate histone H3 phospho-acetylation and c-Fos responses than the control animals. In both groups of rats the challenge mainly impacted on the dorsal (or suprapyramidal) blade of the dentate gyrus which is in agreement with our previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Chandramohan1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Currently, very little is known with regard to neuroanatomical and functional differences between the dorsal and the ventral (infrapyramidal) blade.

At the receiving side, however, it appears that the granule neurons of the dorsal blade show more extensive arborizations than those of the ventral blade.

Interestingly, the ventral blade of the exercised rats showed a relatively higher response than that of the control animals which may indicate an enhanced engagement of this part of the dentate in the response to novelty after long-term exercise. The reason for this enhanced participation remains presently unclear.</p><p>In contrast to the novelty challenge test, the forced swim test is a test to address changes in active coping styles such as struggling and swimming as well as adaptive coping strategies such as immobility or floating behavior. Apart from the moderate increase in swimming behavior during the initial test in exercised rats, there were no significant differences between the control and exercised animals. Nevertheless, there were substantial differences regarding the impact of the challenge on dentate gyrus granule neurons.

In conjunction with observations in the novelty paradigm, it seems that the neuronal response does not directly relate to the immediate behavioral reaction <italic>during</italic> the challenge but rather relates to how the information is being processed by the dentate gyrus in the hours <italic>after</italic> the challenge. The difference in processing materialized the next day when animals were re-exposed to the forced swim test.

We reported before that the phospho-acetylation of histone H3 and c-Fos induction in dentate granule cells seen after the initial forced swim test is strongly associated with the immobility behavior response observed 24 h later in the re-test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-BilangBleuel1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Chandramohan2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This behavioral response is increasingly regarded as a reflection of the strength of memory of the first forced swim experience <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Reul2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-DePablo1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Korte1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, we recently stipulated that these mechanisms may also play a role in the formation of traumatic, pathological memories as occurring in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Reul3">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>). We found that any interruption (due to pharmacological intervention or gene deletion) of the signaling cascade initiating the histone modifications and immediate-early gene induction in dentate granule neurons resulted in an impaired immobility response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-BilangBleuel1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Chandramohan2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Earlier work provided evidence specifically pointing to a critical role of the glucocorticoid receptor located in the dentate gyrus in the forced swimming-induced immobility response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Korte2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. There have been reports about a role of the nucleus accumbens in immobility behavior. This nucleus has been studied in relation to immobility behavior interpreting this behavior as being an indicator of learned helplessness or depressive behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Mague1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Porsolt1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our data question this interpretation because our exercised animals showed increased immobility behavior in the re-test. Interpretation of this increased immobility as indicating increased depressive behavior would be highly debatable given that exercised animals are known to be less anxious and cognitively better than sedentary control animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Binder1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-vanPraag1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Evidence is accumulating that exercise is anxiolytic and antidepressant in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Steptoe1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Dimeo1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, since exercised and control rats produced similar c-Fos responses in the nucleus accumbens in the face of different immobility responses in the re-test, it seems that this brain structure does not play a critical role in the differential immobility responses in exercised and control rats. Moreover, mitogen and stress-activated kinase 1/2 (MSK1/2) double knockout mice showed highly impaired immobility behavior in the re-test of the forced swim test in conjunction with virtually absent histone H3 phospho-acetylation and c-Fos responses to forced swimming in the dentate gyrus; elsewhere in the brain (including the nucleus accumbens) c-Fos responses to forced swimming were normal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Chandramohan2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>(Chandramohan Y and Reul JMHM, unpublished observations). Collectively, these results point to behavioral immobility reflecting an adaptive response in which formation of memories of the initial swim event plays an important role. In addition, these cognitive processes seem to involve distinct epigenetic and gene expression mechanisms in dentate granule neurons.</p><p>Our previous work has shown that the phospho-acetylation of histone H3 in dentate neurons after forced swimming and novelty is brought about by concurrent signaling via the GR and NMDA/ERK/MSK pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Reul2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Reul3">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Currently the mechanisms underlying the enhanced epigenetic and gene expression responses in the exercised animals are unknown. Yet, a variety of possible mechanisms contributing to the altered responses after exercise can be identified. Changes in the two principal pathways identified by us, i.e. NMDA receptors and GRs, may be involved. Recent work has shown that exercise leads to changes in NMDA receptor composition and NMDA receptor-related neuroplasticity processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Farmer1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Vasuta1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, we reported recently that the expression of GRs is increased in the hippocampus of exercised rats resulting most likely in an enhanced impact of stress-induced elevations in glucocorticoid hormone levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Droste3">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Reul5">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Other neurotransmitter systems possibly involved in the differential epigenetic and gene expression responses in the exercised rats include the central noradrenergic, serotonergic and GABAergic systems. These systems are known to modulate dentate neuron excitability and are known to be altered after voluntary exercise or during general motor activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Droste1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Linthorst1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Linthorst2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Hill1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> (Papadopoulos A., Chandramohan Y., Collins A., Droste S.K., Nutt D.J. and Reul J.M.H.M., unpublished observations). In addition, changes in intracellular pathways such as the ERK/MSK pathway and/or histone acetyl transferase (HAT) activities cannot be excluded. Finally, it also cannot be ruled out that changes in the cyto-architecture of the dentate gyrus may have contributed to the enhanced responses in histone H3 phospho-acetylation and c-Fos expression to forced swimming and novelty in the exercised rats.</p><p>Here we showed that exercised rats have improved capabilities to cope with psychologically stressful challenges. This enhanced stress coping materialized during the exposure to a novel environment and when re-submitted to a forced swim challenge. This improved adaptive capacity may be the logical consequence of the complex of elevated cognitive abilities, lowered anxiety levels and decreased impulsiveness known of exercised subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Droste3">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-Binder1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004330-vanPraag1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. The increased responses in histone H3 phospho-acetylation and c-Fos induction in dentate granule neurons of exercised rats strengthens our concept that these epigenetic and gene expression responses are part of neuroplasticity processes in the hippocampus aimed at establishing memories of the event in case the event would re-occur in the future. Further investigation of these mechanisms should be of great relevance for the elucidation of stress-related psychiatric disorders such as major depression and PTSD.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0004330-Friedman1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
