There are three system A isoforms: SNAT1, SNAT2 and SNAT4, but the contribution of each to system A-mediated transport is unknown. Here, we have used immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that all three isoforms are present in the syncytiotrophoblast suggesting each plays a role in amino acid transport across the placenta. We next tested the hypothesis that the SNAT4 isoform is functional in microvillous plasma membrane vesicles (MVM) from normal human placenta using a method which exploits the unique property of SNAT4 to transport both cationic amino acids as well as the system A-specific substrate MeAIB. The data show that SNAT4 contribution to system A-specific amino acid transport across MVM is higher in first trimester placenta compared to term (approx. 70% and 33%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Further experiments performed under more physiological conditions using intact placental villous fragments suggest a contribution of SNAT4 to system A activity in first trimester placenta but minimal contribution at term. In agreement, Western blotting revealed that SNAT4 protein expression is higher in first trimester MVM compared to term (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). This study provides the first evidence of SNAT4 activity in human placenta and demonstrates the contribution of SNAT4 to system A-mediated transport decreases between first trimester and term: our data lead us to speculate that at later stages of gestation SNAT1 and/or SNAT2 are more important for the supply of amino acids required for normal fetal growth.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>During intrauterine life an adequate supply of amino acids from the maternal circulation is essential for normal fetal growth and development. In humans the maternal and fetal circulations are separated by a polarized epithelium in the placenta known as the syncytiotrophoblast. Amino acid transfer across the syncytiotrophoblast is mediated by a number of transporters found in the maternal-facing microvillous plasma membrane (MVM) and fetal-facing basal plasma membrane (BM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Moe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Jansson, 2001</xref>). Each class of transporter is specific for a particular group of amino acids and, based on competitive interactions between amino acid substrates, at least 15 transport systems for neutral, basic and acidic amino acids have been identified in the syncytiotrophoblast analogous to those described for other epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Moe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Jansson, 2001</xref>).</p><p>System A is a Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent transporter that actively transports small, zwitterionic, neutral amino acids with short, unbranched side chains such as alanine, serine, and glutamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Johnson &#x00026; Smith, 1988</xref>). It can also transport <italic>N</italic>-methylated amino acids such as &#x003b1;-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (MeAIB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Christensen <italic>et al.</italic> 1965</xref>). This non-metabolizable amino acid analogue has been used extensively to study system A activity in the placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Mahendran <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Novak <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Jozwik <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Jansson <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). Reduced system A activity has been demonstrated in MVM vesicles isolated from placentas in which the fetus was growth restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Dicke &#x00026; Henderson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Mahendran <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Glazier <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Jansson <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Whether this represents a primary event in cases of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or is secondary to the growth restriction is unknown. However, evidence from three separate animal studies suggests reduced system A activity may be a cause of, rather than merely be associated with, altered fetal growth. Inhibition of system A in pregnant rats leads to fetal growth restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Cramer <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>); in a mouse model of IUGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Constancia <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>) and also in a dietary model of IUGR in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Jansson <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), fetal growth restriction is preceded by alterations in placental system A activity.</p><p>Molecular characterization of system A has revealed that there are three highly homologous protein subtypes of this Na<sup>+</sup>-coupled neutral amino acid transporter known as SNAT1, SNAT2, and SNAT4, which are encoded by three members of the SLC38 gene family (<italic>SLC38A1</italic>, <italic>SLC38A2</italic>, and <italic>SLC38A4</italic>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Hediger <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Mackenzie &#x00026; Erickson, 2004</xref>). <italic>SLC38A2</italic> is expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hatanaka <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Sugawara <italic>et al.</italic> 2000<italic>a</italic></xref>) and expression of <italic>SLC38A1</italic> has been shown in various tissues including human placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Desforges <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Functionally, SNAT1 and SNAT2 operate via similar mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hatanaka <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Yao <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). SNAT4 has a lower substrate affinity for neutral amino acids and MeAIB than SNAT1 and SNAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Sugawara <italic>et al.</italic> 2000<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hatanaka <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>) and also has a unique ability amongst the other system A isoforms to interact with cationic amino acids in a Na<sup>+</sup>-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hatanaka <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). It was originally thought that <italic>SLC38A4</italic>/SNAT4 was a liver-specific isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hatanaka <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). However, we have demonstrated expression in human placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Desforges <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), and expression in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Novak <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) and mouse placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Mizuno <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Smith <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>) has also been documented.</p><p>The relative contribution of each SNAT isoform to total placental system A activity is not known; indeed it is not certain that all three isoforms are active. We have previously shown that SNAT4 protein is localized to the MVM in human placenta at first trimester and term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Desforges <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), a location consistent with a role in uptake of amino acids into the syncytiotrophoblast. Our laboratory has also demonstrated SNAT2 protein localization to the syncytiotrophoblast of term placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Champion <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>) but localization in first trimester is unknown and SNAT1 localization has yet to be investigated.</p><p>System A activity in human placental MVM increases between first trimester and term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Mahendran <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>) coinciding with the increased fetal nutrient demand as gestation advances and fetal growth rate accelerates. Our previous investigations have shown SNAT4 protein expression increases in placental homogenates (containing a mixture of all placental cell types) between first trimester and term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Desforges <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) suggesting amino acid transport by this isoform could be particularly important for maintaining normal fetal growth. Furthermore, in a mouse model of IUGR which displays alterations in placental structure and function similar to those found in human IUGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Sibley <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>), altered placental MeAIB transport is specifically associated with altered <italic>Slc38a4</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Constancia <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>).</p><p>In the current study we have used immunohistochemistry to compare localization of SNAT1, SNAT2 and SNAT4 in first trimester and term human placenta and then examined any changes in the specific localization of SNAT4 to the MVM between these two gestations using Western blotting. We then performed experiments to test the hypothesis that the SNAT4 isoform is functional in normal human placenta and to estimate its contribution to total system A activity both in the first trimester and at term. Definitively identifying the contribution of SNAT4 to total system A transport in placenta, which expresses all three SNAT isoforms, is complicated by their overlapping substrate specificities. Therefore our initial experiments were performed using isolated MVM vesicles which allowed optimization of experimental conditions, outside the normal physiological range, to measure SNAT4 activity. Our experimental approach was to exploit the unique property of SNAT4 to transport cationic amino acids as well as MeAIB by measuring the arginine-inhibitable component of MeAIB uptake by MVM vesicles. Subsequently, experiments were performed using intact placental villous tissue fragments to examine whether SNAT4 activity could be measured under more physiological conditions in tissue from first trimester and term pregnancy.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.

Non-specific staining was prevented by quenching endogenous perxoidase activity with 3% aqueous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, followed by a 30 min incubation with non-immune block (10% normal swine serum, 2% normal human serum (&#x02018;in-house&#x02019;), 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS). Primary antibodies (affinity-purified rabbit IgG) were custom-made (Eurogentec: Seraing, Belgium) using the following amino acid sequences of the human system A isoforms as antigen: SNAT1 &#x02013; VPEDDNISNDSNDFT (residues 18&#x02013;32); SNAT2 &#x02013; SNLGKKKYETEFHPG (residues 55&#x02013;69); SNAT4 &#x02013; YGEVEDELLHAYSKV (residues 391&#x02013;405). Antibodies were diluted to 1 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in non-immune block and applied to sections overnight at 4&#x000b0;C.

Alkaline phosphatase enrichment factors (mean &#x000b1;<sc>s.e.m.</sc>) for first trimester and term MVM vesicles (<italic>n</italic>= 6 for both) were 18 &#x000b1; 2 and 19 &#x000b1; 2, respectively.

BeWo choriocarcinoma cell homogenate was included as a negative control for SNAT4 expression as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Desforges <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) in order to confirm primary antibody specificity. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using 3% stacking gel and 10% resolving gel. Proteins were then electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane.

[<sup>14</sup>C]MeAIB uptake in the presence of 30 m<sc>m</sc> MeAIB was also measured and considered to be non-system A mediated because at this high concentration of substrate it is predicted that all three SNAT isoforms would be saturated. The difference between total [<sup>14</sup>C]MeAIB uptake and uptake in the presence of 30 m<sc>m</sc> MeAIB was calculated to give a measure of system A-specific uptake.

We proceeded to design experiments to explore whether the SNAT4 isoform of system A is functional in human placental MVM during first trimester and at term. This study is the first to investigate the activity of a single SNAT isoform in the placenta, or in any tissue, which expresses all three system A isoforms.</p><p>Western blotting revealed higher SNAT4 protein expression in first trimester MVM compared to term. SNAT4 protein expression was also considerably variable between term MVM samples. The emerging pattern of SNAT4 expression and activity in human placenta across gestation appears to be quite complex. We have previously shown SNAT4 protein expression is lower in first trimester human placental homogenates, comprising many cell types, compared to term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Desforges <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). However, our current Western blotting data suggest that during first trimester a greater proportion of the SNAT4 protein pool is localized to the MVM. Consistent with this observation, immunohistochemical detection of SNAT4 shows strong staining in the cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblast of term placental tissue whereas in first trimester syncytiotrophoblast there is relatively more MVM staining of the syncytiotrophoblast layer. This accords with evidence from other cell types that shows preformed SNAT proteins are stored in cytoplasmic compartments before translocation to the plasma membrane takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Hundal <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Ling <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Hyde <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). As SNAT4 protein was also localized to fetal blood vessels, which are widespread at term but poorly developed during the first trimester, this may contribute to the higher SNAT4 protein expression previously observed in term placental homogenates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Desforges <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>).</p><p>Following consideration of the substrate specificity and kinetic characteristics of SNAT4 we defined SNAT4-mediated transport by MVM vesicles as arginine-inhibitable [<sup>14</sup>C]MeAIB uptake. The strategy of using the cationic amino acid arginine as a SNAT4 substrate is confounded by its specificity also for the amino acid transporter systems y<sup>+</sup> and y<sup>+</sup>L which are active in MVM of first trimester and term human placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ayuk <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). However these two cationic amino acid transporter systems do not support MeAIB as a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Fei <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Pfeiffer <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Broer <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>) strengthening the rationale for using this competitive inhibition approach. In the current study, experimental conditions using MVM vesicles were designed to promote MeAIB transport by SNAT4: the pH and the Na<sup>+</sup> gradient set across MVM vesicles were optimized to promote neutral amino acid transport by SNAT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hatanaka <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). Furthermore, we used a relatively high concentration of [<sup>14</sup>C]MeAIB (0.4 m<sc>m</sc>) compared to previous studies of system A activity in placenta (0.165 m<sc>m</sc>) in order to achieve contribution to transport across MVM by SNAT4. This was based on functional expression studies of the cloned SNAT transporters in HRPE cells, which demonstrate SNAT4 has a relatively low affinity for MeAIB (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>= 6.7 m<sc>m</sc>) compared to the other SNAT isoforms (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>= 0.89 and 0.39 m<sc>m</sc> for SNAT1 and SNAT2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hatanaka <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Mahendran <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>), and using a modified assay system, we have shown that total system A activity in placental MVM is higher at term than during first trimester. Consistent with these observations, we have also demonstrated increased placental system A activity between first trimester and term using freshly isolated villous fragments. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Ericsson <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> reported no significant difference in Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent transport of MeAIB into villous fragments between first trimester and term. The reason for these differing observations could be related to the size of fragments used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Greenwood &#x00026; Sibley, 2006</xref>) or due to the concurrency of our experiments in contrast to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Ericsson <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref> study, which compared first trimester data to term data arising from an earlier study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Jansson <italic>et al.</italic> (2003)</xref>.</p><p>Despite there being increased total system A activity in human placenta between first trimester and term, our data demonstrate that SNAT4 activity in first trimester MVM is comparable to in term MVM; however, the contribution of SNAT4 to total system A activity is lower in term MVM compared to first trimester. Collectively these data indicate, firstly, that this broader specificity isoform has a particularly important role in delivering amino acids to the fetus in early pregnancy, and secondly, that the gestational increase in system A transporter activity between first trimester and term is likely to be mediated by up-regulation of SNAT1 and/or SNAT2. It will therefore be important to determine the contribution of these particular SNAT isoforms to system A transport across MVM during normal pregnancy in order to further understand the complex gestational changes associated with this transporter.</p><p>MVM vesicles lack the intracellular regulatory components present in intact placental tissue which influence amino acid transporter activity. Therefore, <italic>in vivo</italic>, the absolute contribution of SNAT4 to total system A activity may be somewhat different from that suggested by the vesicle data (i.e. approximately 70% in first trimester compared to 33% at term). To address this issue we performed experiments designed to measure SNAT4 activity under more physiological conditions in villous fragments from human placenta. Any measurable Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent uptake of [<sup>14</sup>C]MeAIB (0.01 m<sc>m</sc>) in the presence of 5 m<sc>m</sc> MeAIB was considered to be SNAT4-mediated system A activity based on kinetic data showing that SNAT1 and SNAT2 activity is saturable at this concentration of MeAIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hatanaka <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Wang <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). It is therefore interesting that there was measurable Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent uptake of [<sup>14</sup>C]MeAIB by first trimester villous fragments but not by term villous fragments in the presence of 5 m<sc>m</sc> MeAIB. These data suggest there is little or no SNAT4-mediated transport of neutral amino acids in term placenta and higher SNAT4-mediated transport in first trimester placenta, a trend which agrees well with the MVM vesicle data. Expression of SNAT4 protein in term MVM does suggest a functional role in amino acid transport and therefore it is reasonable to speculate that SNAT4 could mediate the transport of cationic, rather than neutral, amino acids at term. Although this is a possibility, our laboratory has previously demonstrated evidence for only two transport systems for cationic amino acids in the MVM of term human placenta, identified to be systems y<sup>+</sup> and y<sup>+</sup>L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ayuk <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies have shown there is reduced MVM system A activity in pregnancies associated with IUGR compared to normal pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Dicke &#x00026; Henderson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Mahendran <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Glazier <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Jansson <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). In a mouse model of IUGR which displays alterations in placental structure and function that are similar to those found in human IUGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Sibley <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>), reduced placental system A activity is specifically associated with altered <italic>Slc38a4</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Constancia <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Furthermore, ablation of the major placental promoter for <italic>Slc38a4</italic> in mice is associated with fetal growth restriction (G. Kelsey and M. Const&#x000e2;ncia, personal communication). These data suggest the SNAT4 isoform of system A plays an important role in the provision of amino acids for normal fetal growth in mice. In mouse placenta <italic>Slc38a4</italic> is imprinted, being paternally expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Mizuno <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Smith <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), which further suggests a role in promoting fetal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Coan <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Fowden <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). It will therefore be interesting to investigate placental <italic>SLC38A4</italic>/SNAT4 expression in human IUGR and measure SNAT4 activity across MVM using the methods described in this study, in conjunction with the fragment experiments also described, to determine any differences from normal pregnancy. One study has shown placental <italic>SLC38A1</italic> and <italic>SLC38A2</italic> mRNA expression in human IUGR is comparable to that in normal pregnancies but the authors did not investigate <italic>SLC38A4</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Malina <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). As shown in the current study, there is broad distribution of SNAT isoforms in human placenta highlighting the importance of performing functional assays in parallel to expression studies. Development of isoform-specific knockdown protocols for each of the three SNAT isoforms in cytotrophoblast cells and intact placental tissue will greatly assist in defining the relative contribution of each to placental system A activity over gestation and in relation to fetal growth anomalies.</p><p><italic>SLC38A4</italic> mRNA is expressed in various tissues from mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Mizuno <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>) and also cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Zaitoun &#x00026; Khatib, 2006</xref>). In the current study we demonstrated expression of <italic>SLC38A4</italic> in various human tissues previously shown to be devoid of <italic>SLC38A4</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hatanaka <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). These observations confirm this isoform of system A should no longer be considered liver-specific, and suggest it may be important for the transport of amino acids required for metabolism and protein synthesis in a variety of tissues. The experimental approaches described in this study for measuring SNAT4 activity could be applied to other human tissues besides placenta. This would be useful for identifying the involvement of SNAT4 in altered system A activity associated with certain diseases. For example in diabetes there is increased system A activity in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Handlogten &#x00026; Kilberg, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Rosenthal <italic>et al.</italic> 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Schenerman &#x00026; Kilberg, 1986</xref>), a key gluconeogenic organ. As gluconeogenesis primarily involves the conversion of amino acids and the recycling of glucose-derived carbon skeletons to glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Felig, 1975</xref>), with alanine an important glucose precursor, an altered system A activity in the liver could impact on the rate of alanine-supported gluconeogenesis and influence circulating glucose levels. <italic>SLC38A2</italic> and <italic>SLC38A4</italic> mRNA expression is increased in experimentally induced diabetic liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Varoqui &#x00026; Erickson, 2002</xref>). It would therefore be interesting to investigate whether the increased hepatic system A activity in diabetes can be attributed to increased SNAT4 activity using similar approaches to those described in this study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the midwives and nursing staff of St. Mary's Hospital for their assistance in obtaining placentas.
