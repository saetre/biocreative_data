Using a mouse model of co-colonization, we have shown that one bacterial species (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Haemophilus influenzae</named-content>) can take advantage of the innate immune response of its host to outcompete and eliminate another species (<named-content content-type="genus-species">Streptococcus pneumoniae</named-content>) that resides in the same microenvironment of the upper respiratory tract. The molecular mechanism for this effect involves recognition of a cell wall fragment found on <italic>H. influenzae,</italic> but not on <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pneumoniae</named-content>. The response to this immunostimulatory fragment requires Nod1, a host molecule that transmits inflammatory signals in response to specific peptides of the bacterial cell wall. This Nod1-mediated inflammatory stimulation triggers an increase in the ability of a type of white blood cell (neutrophil) to engulf and then kill <italic>S. pneumoniae,</italic> effectively removing it from its niche on the mucosal surface of the host airway. Our study, therefore, provides a demonstration of the importance of Nod1 in neutrophil-mediated clearance of bacterial infection. In addition, we have described a mechanism for interspecies competition between microbes that occurs through selective stimulation of host innate immune responses.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Lysenko ES, Clarke TB, Shchepetov M, Ratner AJ, Roper DI, et al.

We demonstrate here that the Nod1 signaling pathway can respond to <italic>meso</italic>-DAP-containing compounds to increase clearance of <italic>Sp</italic> from the mucosal surface of the airway. Thus, Nod1 was shown to be important in dictating the outcome of competition between two pathogens that occupy a similar niche in their host &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030118-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Enhanced killing of <italic>Sp</italic> required products from another organism, since cell wall fragments from <italic>Sp,</italic> like most Gram-positive species, do not signal through Nod1. Our findings are relevant to polymicrobial infection and situations in which products from multiple types of organisms are present. This information adds to our previous report, which describes how combinations of microbes and microbial products synergize to enhance inflammatory responses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030118-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Mucosal surfaces, in particular, are generally colonized simultaneously with multiple species. The paradigm of one species promoting an innate immune response that affects a competitor may be underappreciated, because most models of infection typically examine responses to individual microbial species.</p><p>While our model was useful in revealing a role for Nod1 in vivo, it also demonstrates that bacteria that succeed in such environments must have mechanisms to evade its clearance-promoting effects. The specificity for bacterial cell wall components that act through Nod1 suggests a mechanism whereby many Gram-positive pathogens that lack <italic>meso</italic>-DAP may avoid signaling events that lead to neutrophil-mediated killing. Likewise, the density of colonizing <italic>Hi</italic> during co-infection was not affected by Nod1 signaling, in contrast to clearance of <italic>Sp</italic> during co-colonization. This suggests that <italic>Hi</italic> may be resistant to the response induced by its <italic>meso</italic>-DAP-containing peptidoglycan, and also to the enhancement of opsonophagocytic killing by neutrophils seen against <italic>Sp</italic>. In addition to the synthesis of stem peptides without <italic>meso</italic>-DAP, there may be multiple mechanisms to evade peptidoglycan recognition and stimulation of immune signaling through Nod1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030118-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. For example, it has recently been reported that modification of the &#x003b1;-carboxylic acid group of iso-glutamic acid, the residue proximal to <italic>meso</italic>-DAP, to an amide diminishes signaling through Nod1 and may be a mechanism for immune invasion by some pathogens &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030118-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Both <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Hi</italic> are considered extracellular pathogens, which are unable to effectively access intracellular pathways &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030118-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. In the case of epithelial cells, pore-forming toxins or delivery via the type IV pilus have been shown to be necessary for peptidoglycan to gain access to the cytoplasm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030118-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030118-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our observation in this report that peptidoglycan fragments alone are sufficient to induce Nod1-dependent effects shows that access to these cytoplasmic pathways may not be similarly limited for professional phagocytes. In killing assays, however, bacteria or peptidoglycan fragments were delivered in vivo and their activity tested <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Thus, we cannot confirm whether the effect of injected compounds or bacterial products on neutrophil function was direct. Attempts to treat neutrophils in vitro with immunostimulatory fragments that are active when provided in vivo were not sufficient to elicit a direct effect in killing assays. It is unlikely that this is due to a lack of Nod1 expression in these cells, because in contrast to other members of the Nod protein family, Nod1 expression is ubiquitous &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030118-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. It remains possible that Nod1-mediated signaling requires other cell types, such as epithelial cells, and that its effects on neutrophil function are indirect.</p><p>A further consideration is that neutrophils have cell wall&#x02013;degrading enzymes, such as lysozyme, that may generate more biologically active peptidoglycan fragments. This could account for the effects of purified peptidoglycan in our study, which contrasts with prior reports where only synthetic products are active. Thus, both the processing of peptidoglycan and the ability of cell wall fragments to access the cytoplasm may be important factors for signaling events involving neutrophils. In this regard, it has been suggested that <italic>Sp</italic> and other Gram-positive pathogens synthesize modified peptidoglycan that is resistant to lysozyme &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030118-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030118-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030118-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, a number of adaptations may contribute to minimizing Nod-mediated signaling by Gram-positive bacteria despite their greater quantity of peptidoglycan per cell.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that the resistance of <italic>Sp</italic> to killing by neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030118-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) can be overcome by a specific immune signaling pathway.

Bacterial killing in our system required opsonization, which for <italic>Sp</italic> strain <italic>Sp</italic>1121 occurred through activation of the alternative pathway of complement, followed by phagocytosis by activated, Mac-1 (CR3, CD11b/CD18)-expressing neutrophils.

It remains unclear how Nod1-mediated signaling enhances Mac-1-dependent opsonophagoytic killing of complement-opsonized <italic>Sp</italic>. It has been suggested that Nod1 transduces signals that can stimulate chemokine production and neutrophil recruitment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030118-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. We did not observe, however, a Nod1-related effect on the increase in MIP-2 levels or influx of neutrophils into either the peritoneal cavity or the nasal spaces in response to bacteria. Likewise, no effect of Nod1 on the uptake of bacteria or generation of an oxidative burst was detected. Rather, killing of <italic>Sp</italic> in our model resulted from stimulation of non-oxidative activity of neutrophils. Reduced killing in the presence of inhibitors of actin polymerization and rearrangement, and the requirement for complement, argue against Nod1-mediated enhancement of previously described mechanisms for extracellular killing of <italic>Sp</italic> by neutrophils &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030118-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, the effect of fragments acting through Nod2, including MDP, purified <italic>Hi</italic> or <italic>Sp</italic> peptidoglycan, and live or killed <italic>Hi</italic> or <italic>Sp</italic>, was minor in comparison to those acting through Nod1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030118-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030118-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.
