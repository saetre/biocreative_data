Genetic and biochemical approaches have identified Raf family serine/threonine kinases B-Raf and C-Raf as major mediators of cell survival. C-Raf cooperates with Bcl-2/Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> in suppression of apoptosis by a mechanism that involves targeting of C-Raf to the outer mitochondrial membrane and inactivation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad. However, apoptosis suppression by C-Raf also occurs in cells lacking expression of Bad or Bcl-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we show that even in the absence of Bcl-2/Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>, mitochondria-targeted C-Raf inhibits cytochrome c release and caspase activation induced by growth factor withdrawal. To clarify the mechanism of Bcl-2 independent survival control by C-Raf at the mitochondria a search for novel mitochondrial targets was undertaken that identified voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), a mitochondrial protein (porin) involved in exchange of metabolites for oxidative phosphorylation. C-Raf forms a complex with VDAC <italic>in vivo</italic> and blocks reconstitution of VDAC channels in planar bilayer membranes <italic>in vitro.</italic></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose that this interaction may be responsible for the Raf-induced inhibition of cytochrome c release from mitochondria in growth factor starved cells. Moreover, C-Raf kinase-induced VDAC inhibition may regulate the metabolic function of mitochondria and mediate the switch to aerobic glycolysis that is common to cancer cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members are overexpressed in a large number of cancers and are responsible for resistance to anticancer drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Oncogenic C-Raf contributes to the processes of cellular transformation and tumor development through its ability to suppress apoptotic cell death. Experimental evidence has been obtained, showing that C-Raf maintains cell survival by (i) induction of autocrine loops via the mitogenic cascade resulting in the activation of protein kinase B (PKB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and (ii) cooperation with Bcl-2, which targets C-Raf to mitochondria and results in the inactivation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Additionally, Raf may suppress apoptosis by activation of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and interaction with IAP proteins (Sendtner, Troppmair and Rapp, unpublished results). The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members expressed in the outer mitochondrial membrane inhibit the release of apoptogenic cytochrome c from mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], antagonize the pore-forming activity of Bax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and directly interact with the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) that regulates mitochondrial membrane potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. C-Raf induces phosphorylation of Bad, which in turn leads to sequestration of Bad in a complex with 14-3-3 in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, C-Raf also suppresses apoptosis in cells that do not express Bad or are deficient for Bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] suggesting the existence of other targets for C-Raf at the outer mitochondrial membrane. Here we provide evidence that C-Raf regulates the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) that can contribute to cell survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>First we examined the effect of C-Raf on mitochondrial cytochrome c release. For this we used the expression plasmid pcDNA3-Mas-BXB, in which constitutively active C-Raf, BXB, was fused with the transmembrane domain of the yeast outer mitochondrial membrane protein Mas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], allowing targeting of C-Raf to mitochondria independently of Bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. BXB, the mutant of Raf used, lacks the N-terminal domain of C-Raf (residues 26&#x02013;303) to prevent interaction with the small G protein Ras at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Upon transfection of interleukin 3 (IL-3) dependent 32Dcl.3 promyeloid cells, Mas-BXB was detected by western blotting almost exclusively in the mitochondrial fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). When deprived of IL-3 for 24 hours 32Dcl.3-Mas-BXB cells showed delayed cell death (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) compared to 32Dcl.3 cells expressing the empty vector or a kinase dead version of mitochondrial Raf, Mas-BXB K375W, as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. IL-3 deprivation induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization observed in 32Dcl.3-vector and 32Dcl.3-Mas-BXB K375W cells is attenuated in 32Dcl.3-Mas-BXB cells and almost completely suppressed in 32Dcl.3 overexpressing Bcl-2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These effects correlated with a partial blockage of cytochrome c release from mitochondria (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and inhibition of pro-caspases 3 and 9 cleavage in 32Dcl.3-Mas-BXB, but not in 32Dcl.3-Mas-BXB K375W or vector transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Once in the cytoplasm cytochrome c binds with ATP to Apaf-1, which recruits and activates pro-caspase 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Caspase 9 subsequently induces caspase 3 activation, which triggers the execution of apoptotic cell death. Taken together these data suggest that C-Raf inhibits apoptosis through mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;m) stabilization and inhibition of cytochrome c release.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>C-Raf modulates the mitochondrial membrane potential during apoptosis</italic>.

It is a core component of the permeability transition pore (PTP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Opening of the PTP causes &#x00394;&#x003a8;m disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and release of cytochrome c, most likely through VDAC/Bax channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Bcl-2 induces closure of these channels, thereby inhibiting the release of cytochrome c and &#x00394;&#x003a8;m loss. To examine a potential interaction of C-Raf with cytochrome c releasing channels we first examined binding of C-Raf to Bax. Binding studies and the analysis of Bax phosphorylation in cotransfected 293 cells gave negative results (data not shown). The situation was different when VDAC was used instead of Bax. For this, constitutively active C-Raf (C-RafDD) and hemagglutinin-tagged VDAC (HA-VDAC) were transiently transfected into 293 cells and immunoprecipitation was performed 48 hours later using anti-C-Raf or anti-HA-antibody. C-Raf and VDAC coimmunoprecipitated from doubly transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Coimmunoprecipitation was also detected with cells coexpressing kinase inactive form of C-Raf together with HA-VDAC (data not shown), demonstrating that C-Raf kinase activity is not required for the interaction with VDAC. To narrow down the region of C-Raf binding to VDAC, HA-VDAC and the C-terminal half of C-Raf, BXB, were coexpressed in 293 cells. BXB and HA-VDAC were present in pull down experiments with either HA or C-Raf antibody, suggesting that the C-terminal part of C-Raf is sufficient for binding of VDAC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). No interaction was detected between VDAC and the regulatory N-terminal part of C-Raf (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><italic>C-Raf interacts with VDAC.</italic> C-Raf and HA-VDAC proteins were transiently coexpressed in 293 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-C-Raf (A) or anti-HA antibodies (B) before SDS-PAGE analysis.

No phosphorylation of HA-VDAC was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), whereas Mas-BXB induced phosphorylation of HA-Bad as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We conclude that C-Raf binding does not induce phosphorylation of this mitochondrial protein.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><italic>C-Raf kinase does not phosphorylate VDAC protein.</italic> A. <italic>In vitro</italic> kinase assay was performed using GST-C-Raf recombinant protein and HA-VDAC immunoprecipitated from 293 cells.

When reconstituted in a planar lipid bilayer membrane purified rat liver VDAC protein forms voltage-dependent and large conductance ion channels (1 nS in 0.3 M KCl) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Rat liver VDAC protein was pre-incubated with recombinant GST-C-Raf or GST proteins before analysing the VDAC channel activity. Recombinant active C-Raf protein (GST-C-RafDD) abolished the channel activity whereas GST or the inactive form of C-Raf (GST-C-RafK375W) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) or wild type protein (data not shown) had no effect. Inhibition of VDAC channel activity by C-Raf was specific since GST-C-RafDD did not alter the properties of Bcl-2 pores (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Moreover, the anti-apoptotic PAK1 kinase (active His-PAK1-T423E enzyme) and the MAPK pathway activating Src family kinase Lck (His-LckY505F kinase) did not modify the VDAC channel conductance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). The interaction between VDAC and C-Raf is not sufficient for inhibition of channel activity since kinase dead C-Raf bound but did not inhibit VDAC. To check if C-Raf closed the VDAC channel or inhibited its reconstitution into the membranes, active or inactive C-Raf was added in lipid bilayer experiments to preformed rat liver VDAC channels. In these experiments active C-Raf had no effect on already existing VDAC but blocked further reconstitution presumably by opposing membrane insertion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Stimulation of C-Raf kinase activity is paralleled by autophosphorylation, regulatory (S338, Y340/341) as well as feedback phosphorylation (multiple S/T phosphorylation sites) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A negative net charge resulting from autophosphorylation (seen in the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) and the presence of negatively charged glutamic acids in the mutant GST-C-RafDD protein (YY340/341-DD) might be the basis for the inhibitory effect of C-Raf on VDAC in contrast to inactive GST-C-Raf, which possesses near neutral charge. The negatively charged form of C-Raf may bind to the N-terminal amphipatic &#x003b1;-helix of VDAC and induce a conformational change of the channel. The C-Raf-VDAC dimer may no longer be able to insert into the membrane in an analogous fashion to the binding of antibodies to VDAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Binding of active C-Raf kinase to VDAC may thus block cytochrome c release and apoptosis by decreasing the number of channels in the outer mitochondrial membrane. C-Raf shares with Bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] the ability to bind to VDAC and suppress cytochrome c release albeit by different mechanism, pore reduction versus pore closure. C-Raf and Bcl-2 could cooperate to directly block the VDAC protein inhibiting the VDAC-induced depolarization and preventing functional PTP formation during apoptosis. Moreover, as regulation of respiration and cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] are coupled we cannot exclude the possibility of additional targets for C-Raf such as VDAC-bound oxidative phosphorylation- or glycolysis-enzymes. Our data, together with those showing an involvement of A-Raf in controlling glycolysis (submitted data) provide evidence that Raf kinases are involved in mitochondrial function and regulation of cell metabolism, which might be an essential feature of their oncogenic potency.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><italic>C-Raf kinase inhibits the VDAC channel function.</italic> Single channel recordings of purified rat liver VDAC protein in a DiphPC membrane.

Moreover, C-Raf kinase-induced VDAC inhibition may regulate the metabolic function of mitochondria and mediate the switch to aerobic glycolysis that is common to cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>Human Bcl-2 cDNA encoding a protein lacking the COOH-terminal transmembrane domain (TM) (Bcl-2&#x00394;C21: residues 219&#x02013;239 in Bcl-2). cDNA coding for GST-Bcl-2&#x00394;Tm was expressed in pGEX-4T1 plasmid (gift of J.

VDAC or Bcl-2&#x00394;Tm proteins were added to the KCl buffer in both compartments of the chamber and the single-channel conductance of the pores was measured after application of a fixed membrane potential. To test the effect of C-Raf kinase on VDAC or Bcl-2&#x00394;Tm-formed channels, GST-C-RafYY340/341DD, GST-C-RafK375W or GST alone were incubated with channel-forming proteins in kinase buffer in presence of ATP for 30 min at 30&#x000b0;C. Samples were applied on both sides of the DiphPC membrane in KCl buffer and single-channel formation was measured. As a control GST, GST-C-RafYY340/341DD and GST-C-RafK375W were checked to not be able to form channels in artificial bilayer membranes. In control experiments VDAC was first added to an artificial membrane. After reconstitution of several channels active and inactive C-Raf were added to the aqueous phase and their effect on VDAC was investigated.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>V.L.: performance of tissue culture, survival and protein interaction analyses, performance and interpretation of the lipid bilayer experiments, manuscript preparation, J.T.: participation in the planning and discussion of the study, support to V.L. in the planning of experiments, manuscript preparation, R.B. performance and interpretation of the lipid bilayer experiments, U.R.R.: design and coordination of the study, manuscript preparation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors want to thank Drs.
