We have previously shown that the double-stranded RNA-binding protein Staufen 1 (Stau1), likely through an interaction between its third double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD3) and the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>, participates in HIV-1 assembly by influencing Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We now report the fine mapping of Stau1/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>association using co-immunoprecipitation and live cell bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays. On the one hand, our results show that the Stau1-Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>interaction requires the integrity of at least one of the two zinc fingers in the NC domain of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>but not that of the NC N-terminal basic region. Disruption of both zinc fingers dramatically impeded Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization and virus particle release. In parallel, we tested several Stau1 deletion mutants for their capacity to influence Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization using the Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>BRET assay in live cells. Our results revealed that a molecular determinant of 12 amino acids at the N-terminal end of Stau1 is necessary to increase Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization and particle release. However, this region is not required for Stau1 interaction with the viral polyprotein Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data highlight that Stau1 is a modular protein and that Stau1 influences Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization via 1) an interaction between its dsRBD3 and Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>zinc fingers and 2) a regulatory domain within the N-terminus that could recruit host machineries that are critical for the completion of new HIV-1 capsids.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) assembly consists in the formation of new viral particles which is the result of the radial multimerization of approximately 1,400 to 5,000 copies of the viral polyprotein Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>(also named Gag) according to their quantification in mature or immature particles, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>is thought to contain most of the determinants required for viral assembly since the expression of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>alone leads to the formation and release of virus-like particles (VLPs), structurally not really distinguishable from immature HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>is a modular protein that contains 6 domains: matrix (MA), capsid (CA), nucleocapsid (NC), p6 and two spacer peptides, p2 and p1. Each of these domains plays specific roles during HIV-1 life cycle. During assembly, the MA domain, through its myristylated moiety and its highly basic domain, anchors assembly complexes to membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Whether assembly takes place at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane or at the multivesicular bodies (or both) is still under debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization is likely initiated by NC/NC contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] probably when Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>is still in a cytosolic compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The basic amino acid stretch present in NC is thought to non-specifically recruit RNA that serves as a scaffold for multimerizing Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Indeed, mutations abrogating the global positive charge of this sub-domain compromise viral assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. NC also possesses two zinc fingers that are important for the specific packaging of HIV-1 genomic RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Recently, Grigorov <italic>et al. </italic>demonstrated the involvement of both NC zinc fingers in Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>cellular localization and HIV-1 assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Similarly, the first NC zinc finger was shown to be part of the minimal Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>sequence required for multimerization (called the I domain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Since NC function during assembly can be mimicked by its substitution with a heterologous oligomerization domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], NC/NC contacts probably serve as a signal for the higher order multimerization of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>under the control of other domains. Indeed, the C-terminal third of the CA domain and the spacer peptide p2 are part of the I domain and have been shown by mutagenesis and structural analyses to be also very important players during HIV-1 assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>The HIV-1 assembly process within the cell appears to be tightly regulated in time and space and relies on the sequential acquisition and release of host proteins that are required for the cellular localization, multimerization and budding of new capsids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. For instance, the ATP-binding protein ABCE1/HP68 is important for the completion of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization via a transient interaction with the NC domain of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Adaptor proteins 1, 2, 3 (AP-1; AP-2; AP-3) are involved in Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>intracellular trafficking through their association with the MA domain of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Finally, endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-I and -III machineries are recruited by the p6 domain of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>and are crucial for the budding and release of the neosynthesized viral particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>Staufen1 (Stau1) is also a Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>-binding protein that influences HIV-1 assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Stau1 belongs to the double-stranded RNA-binding protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] and is involved in various cellular processes related to RNA. Stau1 was first studied for its role in the transport and localization of mRNAs in dendrites of neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. More recently, Stau1 was identified as a central component of a new mRNA decay mechanism termed Staufen-mediated decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. In addition to its functions in RNA localization and decay, Stau1 can also stimulate translation of repressed messengers containing structured RNA elements in their 5'UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>].</p><p>Stau1 is a host factor that is selectively encapsidated into HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Stau1 co-purifies with HIV-1 genomic RNA and interacts with the NC domain of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] suggesting that Stau1 assists NC's functions during the HIV-1 replication cycle. Stau1 levels in the producer cells are important for HIV-1 since both Stau1 overexpression and depletion using RNA interference affect HIV-1 infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In addition to a putative role in HIV-1 genomic RNA packaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], we recently showed that Stau1 modulates HIV-1 assembly by influencing Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Indeed, using a new Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization assay relying on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), we demonstrated that both Stau1 overexpression and depletion enhanced multimerization and consequently increased VLP production. Although Stau1 and Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>interact in both cytosolic and membrane compartments, this effect of Stau1 on Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>oligomerization was only observed in membranes, a cellular compartment in which Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>assembly primarily occurs. However, the mechanism by which Stau1 influences HIV-1 assembly at the molecular level remains unknown although it is likely that it relies on the Stau1 interaction with HIV-1 Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>.</p><p>Using co-immunoprecipitation and BRET assays, we showed that both Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>NC zinc fingers are involved in Stau1/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>interaction as does the Stau1 dsRBD3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Unexpectedly, we found that the binding of Stau1 to NC is not sufficient per se to fully enhance Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization. To determine which domain of Stau1 modulates the HIV-1 Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization process, we analyzed several Stau1 deletion mutants for their capacity to enhance Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization. Using the Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>BRET assay either in live cells or after cell fractionation, we showed that the first 88 amino acids at the N-terminal of Stau1 confer the capacity to enhance both Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization and VLP production. Although unable to enhance multimerization, this mutant was still able to interact with Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>. This study provides important new information about the molecular determinants required for Stau1 function in HIV-1 assembly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>Human embryonic kidney fibroblasts (HEK 293T) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum (HyClone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics (Multicell).

Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 &#x000d7; g. Resulting cytoplasmic extracts were separated using the membrane flotation assay as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Membrane-associated complexes were collected (fractions 2 and 3). Membranes were solubilized by treating these complexes with 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 5 minutes and samples were subjected to S100/P100 fractionation as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 &#x000d7; g for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C.

BRET assays were performed as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] using a Fusion &#x003b1;-FP apparatus (Perkin-Elmer). In this interaction assay, an X-<italic>R</italic>luc fusion protein is used as an energy donour whereas a Y-YFP fusion protein is an energy acceptor. When the two fusion proteins are in close proximity (&#x0003c; 100&#x000c5;), non-radiative resonance energy is transferred from X-<italic>R</italic>luc to Y-YFP which in turn emits measurable fluorescence. This can be quantified by the calculation of the BRET ratio which allows detection of protein-protein interactions. The BRET ratio was defined as [(emission at 510 to 590 nm)-(emission at 440 to 500 nm) &#x000d7; Cf]/(emission at 440 to 500 nm), where Cf corresponds to (emission at 510 to 590 nm)/(emission at 440 to 500 nm) when <italic>R</italic>luc fused protein is expressed alone. The total YFP activity/<italic>R</italic>luc activity ratio reflects the relative levels of the two fusion proteins in the cells. The BRET ratio increases with the total YFP activity/<italic>R</italic>luc activity ratio since more YFP-fused molecules bind to <italic>R</italic>luc-fused proteins. For Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization assays, in order to avoid misinterpretation due to variations in relative levels of the Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>fusion proteins, changes in the Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>BRET ratios following Stau1 overexpression were always analyzed at similar total YFP activity/<italic>R</italic>luc activity ratio.</p><p>When Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>BRET assays were performed following membrane flotation assays, the <italic>R</italic>luc substrate coelenterazine H (NanoLight Technology) was added to 90 &#x003bc;L of each fraction and BRET ratio was determined as in live cells. BRET ratios in fractions 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were not considered because luciferase activity was too low in these fractions and hence, did not lead to the determination of a reliable BRET ratio.</p><p>For CA-p2-NC-p1-<italic>R</italic>luc/Stau1-YFP and Stau1<sup>55</sup>-<italic>R</italic>luc/NC-p1-YFP interaction assays, BRET ratios were always compared at similar total YFP activity/<italic>R</italic>luc activity ratio. The BRET ratio determined in the context of the expression of the unfused YFP protein (YFP) corresponds to non specific interactions between the energy donor and the YFP. Hence, this background BRET ratio was always subtracted from all BRET ratios and was set to 0%. The BRET ratio determined following co-expression of the energy donor and the wild type energy acceptor was set to 100%.</p><p>For dose-response Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>BRET assays, 293T cells were transfected with fixed amounts of pCMV-Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>-<italic>R</italic>luc and pCMV-Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>-YFP and increasing amounts (0.25&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g) of different Stau1-HA<sub>3 </sub>expressors.

Moreover, we showed that Stau1/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>interaction required the NC domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] that contains motifs involved in several steps during HIV-1 assembly. As a first step, to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying Stau1 influence on HIV-1 assembly, we identified which NC sub-domain is required for Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>/Stau1 association using the BRET assay with Stau1<sup>55</sup>-<italic>R</italic>luc and wild type or mutant NC-p1-YFP fusion proteins. Four NC mutants were constructed. Point mutations were introduced in the NC-p1-YFP fusion protein to disrupt the first zinc finger (NC-p1<sup>C15S</sup>-YFP), the second (NC-p1<sup>C49S</sup>-YFP), both zinc fingers (NCp1-YFP<sup>C15&#x02013;49S</sup>) or the N-terminal basic residues (NCp1-YFP<sup>R7</sup>)(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). For this mutant, Arg<sup>7</sup>, Arg<sup>10 </sup>and Lys<sup>11 </sup>were substituted for serines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Mutations in this basic region were previously reported to severely affect HIV-1 assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Constructs encoding the wild type and mutants NC fusion proteins were transfected in 293T cells and their expression patterns were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-GFP antibody. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> shows that wild type and mutant NC-p1-YFP proteins were well expressed and have the expected molecular weight. However, for unknown reasons, NC-p1<sup>C15&#x02013;49S</sup>-YFP was always slightly less expressed than the other NC-p1-YFP proteins.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Design and expression of NC mutants used for the fine mapping of Stau1/NC interaction</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Schematic representation of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>with emphasis on the sequence of NC and its two zinc fingers.

This technique allows us to detect protein-protein interaction in live cells between <italic>R</italic>luc-fused Stau1 and NC-p1-YFP molecules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Indeed, when the two fusion proteins are in close proximity (&#x02264; 100&#x000c5;) as a consequence of Stau1-NC interaction, non-radiative resonance energy is transferred from the emitting <italic>R</italic>luc to YFP which becomes excited and in turn emits fluorescence. A BRET ratio is calculated for each condition (see Methods). To perform BRET saturation experiments, we transfected 293T cells with constant amounts of pCMV-Stau1<sup>55</sup>-<italic>R</italic>luc plasmid and increasing amount of different NC-p1-YFP expressors. BRET assays were performed 48 hours post-transfection (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, B</xref>). BRET saturation experiments allowed us to compare BRET ratios at the same relative ratio between fusion proteins (comparable total YFP/<italic>R</italic>luc ratio) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). As expected, we readily detected a specific BRET between wild type NC-p1-YFP and Stau1<sup>55</sup>-<italic>R</italic>luc (arbitrarily set to 100% in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) as compared to co-expression of Stau1<sup>55</sup>-<italic>R</italic>luc and YFP alone (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, B</xref>). Mutations that modify the NC N-terminal basic region did not affect the binding of NC to Stau1 since the saturation profile for Stau1/NC-p1<sup>R7</sup>-YFP BRET was almost identical to the one obtained with Stau1/NC-p1-YFP (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, B</xref>). In contrast, when the two zinc fingers were mutated (NC-p1<sup>C15&#x02013;49S</sup>-YFP), the BRET saturation profile was comparable to that obtained with YFP alone and hence, mostly attributable to background (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). When compared to NC-p1-YFP at the same total YFP/<italic>R</italic>luc ratio, the corrected BRET ratio was decreased by 80% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). This suggests that NC-p1<sup>C15&#x02013;49S</sup>-YFP lost almost completely its ability to interact with Stau1. Mutations in individual zinc finger (NC-p1<sup>C15S</sup>-YFP and NC-p1<sup>C49S</sup>-YFP) only affected the BRET ratio by 30&#x02013;40% and these two mutants showed an intermediate profile (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The NC zinc fingers mediate Stau1/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>interaction</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Top: schematic representation of the Stau1/NC-p1 BRET assay.

We generated a Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>-YFP-expressing plasmid in which both zinc fingers were mutated (Pr55<sup>Gag C15&#x02013;49S</sup>-YFP)(see below). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, this mutant was expressed to the same level as the wild-type Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>-YFP and migrated in SDS-containing acrylamide gels at the expected molecular weight (80 kDa). Following co-expression of Flag-tagged Stau1<sup>55 </sup>with wild type or mutated Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>-YFP in 293T cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, upper panel), Stau1<sup>55</sup>-Flag-containing complexes were immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag antibodies. Immunopurified material was analyzed by Western blot using monoclonal anti-GFP and anti-Flag antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, lower panel). As expected, Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>-YFP successfully co-precipitated with Stau1<sup>55</sup>-Flag. In contrast, despite similar levels of expression in the cell (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, upper panel), the Pr55<sup>Gag C15&#x02013;49S</sup>-YFP mutant was not efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with Stau1<sup>55</sup>-Flag as compared to wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, lower panel) suggesting that the association between this mutant and Stau1<sup>55 </sup>is impaired. Pr55<sup>Gag C15S</sup>-YFP and Pr55<sup>Gag C49S</sup>-YFP mutants retained some association with Stau1<sup>55</sup>-Flag although they displayed lower binding capability than the wild type Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>(not shown), consistent with the BRET assay. Altogether, these results show that the two zinc fingers within the NC domain of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>mediate its association with Stau1. Moreover, this suggests that Stau1 influences those assembly processes that depend on NC zinc fingers.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutations in the NC zinc fingers severely compromises Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization and release</title><p>The fact that Stau1 influences HIV-1 Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization and associates with NC zinc fingers is consistent with previous reports showing that these structural motifs are important in HIV-1 assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. To confirm this hypothesis in a system that tests direct interaction, we evaluated the consequence of mutations in the Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>zinc fingers on VLP release and on Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>dimerization using the BRET assay. 293T cells were transfected with Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>-YFP and Pr55<sup>Gag C15&#x02013;49S</sup>-YFP expressors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, VLPs were collected from the supernatant and cells were collected. In the cell extracts, Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>-YFP and Pr55<sup>Gag C15&#x02013;49S</sup>-YFP were present at similar levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, left panel).

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>homo-dimerization was readily detectable with a BRET ratio of 0.09 at saturation. In contrast, Pr55<sup>Gag C15&#x02013;49S</sup>-YFP failed to interact with Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>-<italic>R</italic>luc in the BRET assay since its saturation curve was similar to the one obtained with the monomeric Gag mutant MA-CA<sup>WM184&#x02013;185AA</sup>-YFP. Altogether, these results clearly show that, in the context of VLP assembly, Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>zinc fingers are important for multimerization and release. This suggests that Stau1, through its binding to the NC zinc fingers could influence crucial processes that are controlled by these motifs during HIV-1 assembly.</p></sec><sec><title>The N-terminal domain of Stau1 is required for the Stau1-mediated enhancement of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization</title><p>We previously showed that Stau1 over-expression or depletion from cells enhanced Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization. To determine if the binding of Stau1 to NC is sufficient for Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization or whether other determinants within Stau1 are required for this process, we tested several Stau1 deletion mutants for their capacity to enhance assembly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). To this end, we used the previously described Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>BRET assay in live 293T cells as a sensor for changes in Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Indeed, <italic>R</italic>luc- and YFP-fused Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>co-expression generates a positive BRET ratio in live cells as a consequence of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization. In order to compare BRET ratio changes at the same relative levels of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>fusion proteins, we performed BRET saturation experiments. As previously reported, when Stau1<sup>55</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>was co-expressed with Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>-<italic>R</italic>luc and Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>-YFP in 293T cells, the Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>BRET ratio increased as a consequence of enhanced Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Several HA-tagged Stau1 deletion mutants were then tested for their capacity to enhance Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>BRET ratio and hence, Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization. Interestingly, Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt88</sup>-HA<sub>3</sub>, a mutant that lacks the dsRBD2 as a consequence of the deletion of the first N-terminal 88 amino acids (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) was unable to significantly increase the Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>BRET ratio in live cells [1.29 (+/-0.13 S.D. n = 4)-fold induction] as compared to Stau1<sup>55</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>[2.04 (+/-0.09 S.D. n = 4)-fold induction] (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B, D</xref>). Western blot analyses showed that Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt88 </sup>was expressed at levels comparable to that of wild type Stau1-HA<sub>3 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Nevertheless, a moderate increase in Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization was seen when Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt88 </sup>was highly over-expressed although its effect on Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization was always weaker than that obtained with Stau1<sup>55</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>(see below). In contrast, mutants with deletion in dsRBD4, dsRBD5 or tubulin-binding domain (TBD) all enhanced the Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>BRET ratio at levels comparable to that obtained with Stau1<sup>55</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>(data not shown). As control, Stau1<sup>F135A</sup>-HA<sub>3</sub>, a Stau1 mutant that does not bind Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>, failed to stimulate Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization (data not shown)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Therefore, the Stau1-mediated enhancement of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization requires two determinants: dsRBD3 for the association with NC and the N-terminus.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The N-terminus of Stau1 is required for the modulation of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization in live cells</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Schematic representation of HA-tagged Stau1<sup>55 </sup>expressors.

We had previously shown that Stau1-mediated increase in Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization correlated with a partial resistance to mild detergent treatment of membrane-associated Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Stau1 expressors and the protease-defective provirus HxBRU PR-were cotransfected in 293T cells. Forty hours post-transfection, membrane flotation assays on cytoplasmic extracts were performed and fractions containing membrane-associated complexes were collected. The resulting complexes were then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 &#x000d7; g for 1 hour (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). In this assay, insoluble or high-density complexes are found in the pellet (P100) whereas proteins that are soluble or components of small complexes are retained in the supernatant (S100). Resulting P100 and S100 fractions were analyzed by Western blot. As previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>as well as the membrane marker, sodium potassium (Na-K) ATPase, were primarily found in the P100 fraction because Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>was membrane-associated (data not shown). This was observed whether Stau1 proteins were over-expressed or not (data not shown). To separate Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>complexes from membranes, membranes were solubilized with 0.5% Triton-X100. These experiments were done at room temperature to also solubilize lipid rafts and other membrane compartments that are detergent-resistant at 4&#x000b0;C. As reported before, membrane solubilization prior to S100/P100 fractionation resulted in a complete shift of Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>complexes and Na-K ATPase into the S100 fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Stau1<sup>55</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>overexpression led to a partial resistance of 33% of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>complexes to Triton-X100 treatment, likely as a consequence of enhanced Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>).

Using the Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>BRET assay in live 293T cells, Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt25</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>enhanced the BRET ratio like wild type Stau1<sup>55</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>suggesting that the first 25 amino acids are not required for this function (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). In contrast, Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt37</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>did not significantly enhance the BRET ratio and generated a BRET curve similar to that obtained with Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt88</sup>-HA<sub>3</sub>.

However, when highly expressed, they slightly enhanced the BRET ratio by 1.34&#x02013;1.47-fold. These results suggest that the sequence located between amino acids 26 and 37 is important for Stau1-mediated enhancement of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization and show that Stau1 acts on Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization in a dose-dependent manner.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of the N-terminal region of Stau1<sup>55 </sup>as a regulatory sequence for HIV-1 assembly</bold>. <bold>(A, B) </bold>293T cells were transfected as described in Figure 4B but included additional Stau1<sup>55</sup>-HA deletion mutants. <bold>(A) </bold>For each condition, an aliquot of the cells (providing equivalent total YFP/<italic>R</italic>luc ratio) was used for Western blot analysis using anti (&#x003b1;)-HA and anti (&#x003b1;)-CA antibodies.

Therefore, considering the inability of Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt88 </sup>to influence Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), we suspected that over-expression of Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt88 </sup>would not stimulate VLP production. To test this idea, Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>and either Stau1<sup>55</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>or Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt88</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>were co-expressed in 293T cells. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the levels of VLP release were analyzed by Western blotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). As expected, a 2-fold increase in the expression of Stau1<sup>55</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>as compared to endogenous Stau1 resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in VLP release while the cellular level of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>remained unchanged. In contrast, over-expression of Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt88</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>did not stimulate VLP production. To confirm these results, dose-response assays were performed. Constant amounts of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>were co-expressed with increasing amounts of either Stau1<sup>55</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>or Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt88</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). As previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], Stau1<sup>55</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>over-expression stimulated VLP production in a dose-dependent manner up to 10-fold with no significant change in the intracellular level of Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>.

However, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. In this report, we show that, in addition to Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>-binding via its dsRBD3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], Stau1's effect on Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization depends on amino acids located within its N-terminus. Moreover, we show important contributions from both NC zinc fingers for the Stau1/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>interaction suggesting that Stau1 influences processes that depend on these NC sub-domains.</p><p>HIV-1 Gag mutants whose zinc fingers were disrupted, failed to interact with Stau1 as seen in BRET and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This suggests that Stau1 directly makes contact with these structures although we cannot rule out the possibility that these combined mutations affect the structure of other sub-domains of NC and potentially a Stau1-binding motif. Interestingly, viruses that harbour these mutations do not encapsidate Stau1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Although this phenotype could be attributed to the loss of HIV-1 genomic RNA packaging and to Stau1 RNA-binding activity, this strongly suggests that Stau1 encapsidation into HIV-1 may be achieved by the formation of a Stau1-Gag-RNA ternary complex where Stau1 interactions with both Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>and genomic RNA contribute to this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>NC zinc fingers are known to play important roles during several steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle such as genomic RNA packaging and reverse transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. In addition, they have been shown to be involved in Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Our results with the BRET assay that monitors direct interaction between wild type and mutated Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>proteins are consistent with these results. Whereas some studies reported dramatic defects in assembly and particle production only when both zinc fingers were disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], other showed that mutations in either of the NC zinc fingers (especially the C-terminal one) impaired HIV-1 assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It is possible that the loss of one zinc finger can be compensated by the intact one and would explain why, in certain studies, single mutation within these motifs have no major effects on HIV-1 assembly. Interestingly, mutations in both zinc fingers are required for a complete loss of interaction between Stau1 and Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>, mutation in one zinc finger causing only a partial reduction. Therefore, through its interaction with the zinc fingers, Stau1 most likely influences steps of assembly that are controlled by the NC zinc fingers. In addition, we do not exclude the possibility that Stau1 also participates in other steps of HIV-1 life cycle that depend on NC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>].</p><p>Although both Stau1 and the Gag-NC zinc fingers are engaged in specific interactions with the genomic HIV-1 RNA, we do not have any evidence that Stau1 interacts with NC via the genomic RNA since the Stau1-Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>association was shown to be resistant to RNase treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Moreover, although the C15/49S NC mutant retains its ability to bind RNA nonspecifically through its basic amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], this mutant is unable to recruit Stau1 supporting the idea that Stau1/Gag-NC interaction is not bridged by RNA. Nevertheless, it is possible that Stau1-Gag-NC interactions favour recruitment of the genomic RNA and its subsequent trafficking and encapsidation. Indeed, mutating the conserved CCHC residues of the NC zinc fingers drastically impairs genomic RNA packaging in newly formed virions and that of Stau1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. We previously showed that Stau1 association with HIV-1 genomic RNA is required for its subsequent encapsidation into the viral particle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], our results now suggest that Stau1/Gag-NC interaction is also a critical determinant for this process. In addition, whether Stau1 interacts first with NC or with the genomic RNA to recruit the other partner or independently interacts with each of them through different pathways during HIV-1 assembly and RNA packaging processes is still unknown. The identification of a Stau1 mutant that retains its ability to associate with genomic RNA but is defective for Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>binding will help answer these questions.</p><p>We identified the first 88 amino acids of Stau1 as a regulatory motif of its activity during HIV-1 assembly. Indeed, whereas Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt88</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>mutant is still able to interact with Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>, it fails to enhance Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization as seen by BRET, fractionation and VLP release assays. These results strongly suggest that Stau1-binding to Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>is not sufficient to influence HIV-1 assembly. They eliminate the possibility that the observed increase in the Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>BRET ratio upon Stau1<sup>55</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>over-expression was the result of non-specific changes in the proximity of <italic>R</italic>luc and YFP tags due to Stau1 recruitment towards assembly complexes. Similarly, the possibility of major overall structural changes in Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt88</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>can be ruled out. Indeed, the Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt88</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>mutant retains its capacity to homo-dimerize, to enhance translation of repressed mRNAs, to bind ribosomes and to associate with membranes (unpublished data). Consequently, this sequence probably confers highly specific functions to Stau1 that are advantageous for HIV-1 assembly. It will be interesting to study Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt88 </sup>encapsidation into HIV-1 as a means to determine whether the Stau1-mediated enhancement of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>multimerization is a prerequisite for its intraviral packaging or whether it relies on its association with HIV-1 genomic RNA and on the control of RNA selection for encapsidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>How does this region control Stau1 activity? It is likely that Stau1, in conjunction with its Pr55<sup>Gag</sup>-binding activity, attracts host factors to Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>complexes that are crucial for assembly. NC-associated proteins that are also important for the transition between specific Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>assembly intermediates such as ABCE1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] are good candidates. Although ABCE1/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>interaction depends on NC basic amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], the disruption of both NC zinc fingers resulted in the loss of ABCE1/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>association by 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Thus, it will be important to elucidate the functional relationship between Stau1 and NC-associated proteins to determine if their respective acquisition by assembly intermediates and functions during HIV-1 assembly are simultaneous or sequential.</p><p>Within the first 88 N-terminal amino acids of Stau1, a region of 12 amino acids (M<sup>26</sup>RGGAYPPRYFY<sup>37</sup>) controls Stau1 functions in regard to Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>assembly. Post-translational modifications are very common among RNA-binding proteins such as hnRNPs and RNA helicase A and are known to regulate their cellular proteome, function and localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. It is then conceivable that post-translational modification of Stau1's N-terminal region controls the recruitment of protein partners and/or modulates Stau1 function during HIV-1 assembly. Alternatively, the N-terminal sequence may recruit ubiquitin ligase through two potential ESCRT targeting domains (PPRY and YPFPVPPL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In most retroviruses (except HIV-1), the PPXY motif in Gag recruits a ubiquitin ligase and is required for virus budding and release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Resulting ubiquitination allows targeting of the PPXY-containing protein to the ESCRT machinery located to the multivesicular bodies. Similarly, the YPX(n)L domain that is also present in some retroviruses (including HIV-1) recruits the AIP1/ALIX protein that also targets the cargo to the ESCRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. Although Stau1<sup>&#x00394;Nt88</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>associates with membrane as efficiently as Stau1<sup>55</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>(data not shown), it is conceivable that these signals control the localization of Stau1 to specific membrane compartments to support HIV-1 assembly. Interestingly, Popov <italic>et al. </italic>recently showed that AIP1/ALIX, through its Bro1 domain, is able to bind the NC domain of Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>in addition to p6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Strikingly, this interaction requires the integrity of both zinc fingers and is RNA-independent, as observed for Stau1/Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>association. When over-expressed, AIP1/ALIX rescues the release defect of late domain-mutated HIV-1. Although AIP-1/ALIX over-expression has no effect on wild type HIV-1 release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>], in contrast to Stau1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], it is possible that Stau1 and AIP-1/ALIX, through their simultaneous or sequential association with the NC zinc fingers, cooperate during HIV-1 assembly. The putative interplay between AIP1/ALIX, ESCRTs and Stau1 during both wild type and L-domain-mutated virus assembly will be very interesting to explore in future studies.</p><p>Finally, our work highlights the modular nature of the Stau1 protein in the following ways. The double-stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD3) interacts with Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] whereas the N-terminus controls its activity during HIV-1 assembly. This is supported by the fact that Stau1<sup>&#x00394;88</sup>-HA<sub>3 </sub>still associates with HIV-1 Gag (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) but fails to enhance its multimerization (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Strikingly, Drosophila Stau1 orthologue, dStau, has also been shown to function as a modular protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. The third dsRBD of dStau for example is involved in dStau association to <italic>oskar </italic>RNA whereas the second dsRBD is important for the microtubule-dependent transport of the mRNP and the fifth dsRBD is involved in the derepression of <italic>oscar </italic>mRNA translation, once localized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we provide important new information about the determinants in both Stau1 and Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>that impact on HIV-1 assembly.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LCC participated in the design of the study, carried out most of the experiments and drafted the manuscript.</p><p>KB carried out the immunoprecipitation experiments shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>, contributed to figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>, reproduced the experiment shown in figure 8A and generated the Flag constructs.</p><p>AJM participated in the design and coordination of the study and critically revised the manuscript.</p><p>LDG participated in the design and coordination of the study and wrote the final version of the manuscript.</p><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Louise Cournoyer, Alexandre Desjardins, Alexandre Ben Amor and C&#x000e9;line Fr&#x000e9;china for technical assistance, Miroslav Milev for critical comments on the manuscript, Dr. &#x000c9;ric Cohen for HxBRU PR-provirus, Dr. George Pavlakis for Rev-independent Pr55<sup>Gag </sup>expressor and Dr. Michel Bouvier for anti-Na-K ATPase.</p><p>KB is a recipient of the Fonds de la Recherche en Sant&#x000e9; du Qu&#x000e9;bec studentship.
