Oocytes cease developing at metaphase of the second meiotic division, when transcription stops and translation is reduced. After fertilization, sperm chromatin is reprogrammed into a functional pronucleus and zygotic genome activation (ZGA) begins, whereby the maternal genetic program governed by maternally stored RNAs and proteins must be switched to the embryonic genetic program governed by <italic>de novo</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C2">2</xref>). Our previous gene expression profiling during preimplantation development revealed distinctive patterns of maternal RNA degradation and embryonic gene activation, including two major transient &#x02018;waves of <italic>de novo</italic> transcription&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C3">3</xref>). The first wave during the 1- to 2-cell stage corresponds to ZGA. The second wave during the 4- to 8-cell stage, known as mid-preimplantation gene activation (MGA), induces dramatic morphological changes to the zygote including compaction and blastocele formation, particularly given that few genes show large expression changes after the 8-cell stage. ZGA and MGA together generate a novel gene expression profile that delineates the totipotent state of each blastomere at the cleavage stage of embryogenesis, and these steps are prerequisite for future cell lineage commitments and differentiation. The first such differentiation gives rise to the inner cell mass (ICM), from which embryonic stem (ES) cells are derived, as well as the trophectoderm at the blastocyst stage. However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying this preimplantation development and ES-cell generation from the ICM remain unclear.</p><p>Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are ES cell-like pluripotent cells, generated by the forced expression of defined factors in somatic cells, including Pou5f1/Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C4">4</xref>). These iPS factors are thought to reprogram somatic nuclei in a somewhat similar way as ooplasm does in reconstructed oocytes by nuclear transfer (NT). However, with the exception of Oct4, these factors are not highly expressed maternally in oocytes, and only increased by zygotic transcription during preimplantation, based on expression sequence tag (EST) frequencies in Unigene cDNA libraries and microarray data from oogenesis to preimplantation development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C5">5</xref>). Although pluripotency is achieved within 2 days in NT embryos reconstructed with a somatic nucleus, it takes approximately 2 weeks for the establishment of iPS cells. Such immediate induction of pluripotency during preimplantation development is attributed to well-organized transcriptional regulation, i.e. waves of transcription whereby maternal gene products trigger ZGA, which in turn fuels MGA. On the other hand, the forced simultaneous transcription of iPS factors in somatic cells does not efficiently induce these waves of transcription, and it takes a long time to activate the other genes necessary for pluripotency. Studying transcriptional regulation during preimplantation development would therefore also help unravel the establishment of iPS cells as well as pluripotency in these cells.</p><p>Large-scale EST projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C8">8</xref>) and DNA microarray studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C11">11</xref>) have revealed many novel genes zygotically expressed during preimplantation development. Very few of these genes, however, are exclusively expressed in preimplantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C12">12</xref>), and such genes ought to have important roles during preimplantation development. For example, <italic>Zscan4</italic>, a novel transcription factor, is expressed specifically in 2-cell stage embryos and a subset of ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C13">13</xref>). Reduction of <italic>Zscan4</italic> transcript levels by siRNAs delays progression from the 2-cell to the 4-cell stage, and produces blastocysts that neither implant <italic>in vivo</italic> nor proliferate in blastocyst outgrowth culture. Thus, a transcription factor expressed exclusively in preimplantation embryos is potentially a key regulator of global gene expression changes during preimplantation development. On the other hand, reprogramming gene expression during ZGA and MGA requires considerable changes in chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C16">16</xref>), and modulation of chromatin folding affects access of regulatory factors to their cognate DNA-binding sites. This modulation can be achieved by loosening the chromatin structure, by disrupting the nucleosome structure, by DNA bending and unwinding, and by affecting the strength of DNA-histone interactions via postsynthetic modifications of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C18">18</xref>). Many of these structural changes are mediated by a large and diverse superfamily of high-mobility-group (HMG) proteins, which are the second most abundant chromosomal proteins after histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C18">18</xref>).</p><p>This study identified a novel preimplantation-specific gene, <italic>Hmgpi</italic>, which encodes a chromosomal protein containing HMG box domains. It reports a detailed expression analysis of <italic>Hmgpi</italic> and the <italic>Hmgpi-</italic>encoded protein (HMGPI), which was translocated from the cytoplasm to nuclei at the blastocyst stage. Loss-of-function studies were also conducted using siRNA technology. The siRNA-induced reduction in <italic>Hmgpi</italic> expression caused developmental loss at preimplantation stages and hampered implantation through reduced proliferation of both ICM-derived cells and trophectodermal cells during peri-implantation development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Gene structure of a preimplantation-stage-specific gene, <italic>Hmgpi</italic></title><p><italic>In silico</italic> analysis identified <italic>Hmgpi</italic> (an <bold>HMG</bold>-box protein, <bold>p</bold>re<bold>i</bold>mplantation-embryo-specific) as a preimplantation-stage-specific gene encoding a chromosomal protein containing HMG box domains. The <italic>Hmgpi</italic> transcript levels are probably upregulated during ZGA (1- to 2-cell stages) to peak at the 4-cell stage, based on gene expression profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C9">9</xref>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP512F1">1</xref>A). Using the public expressed-sequence tag (EST) database, 16 cDNA clones were found exclusively in preimplantation-embryo libraries (2- to 8-cell stages) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP512F1">1</xref>B). One of these contained the full <italic>Hmgpi</italic> gene coding sequence (AK163257) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP512F1">1</xref>C), spanning 2579 bp and split into two exons, which encode a protein of 394 amino acids (aa) (NP_001028965) harboring a SANT domain (&#x02018;SWI3, ADA2, N-CoR, and TFIIIB&#x02019; DNA-binding domain) and two HMG-box domains, based on SMART domain prediction analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C19">19</xref>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP512F1">1</xref>C). In the NCBI Gene database, the <italic>Hmgpi</italic> gene is called Ubtf-like 1 (<italic>Ubtfl1</italic>) based on aa sequence similarity (36% identity and 58% positives by BLAST) to <italic>Ubtf</italic>-encoded protein &#x02018;upstream binding transcription factor&#x02019;, which contains a SANT domain and six HMG-box domains. Two rat homologs (<italic>Ubtfl1</italic> and <italic>RGD1304745</italic>) and three human homologs (<italic>UBTFL1-3</italic>) of the mouse <italic>Hmgpi</italic> were identified by BLASTing of NP_001028965 against the NCBI nucleotide database. Pairwise alignment scores by BLAST of amino acid sequences for rat and human homologs are 72.3&#x02013;72.5% and 53.8&#x02013;54.1%, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP512F1">1</xref>D and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp512/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>), while those for nucleotide sequences are 83.7 and 66.8&#x02013;67.0%, respectively. All these human homologs were predicted by <italic>in silico</italic> genome-based analysis, and have no ESTs in the Unigene database. The absence of human ESTs may reflect the paucity of cDNA libraries of human preimplantation embryos in the Unigene database, despite specific expression of the Hmgpi gene in human preimplantation embryos. Based on the number and the type of HMG-box domains, this novel protein could also be categorized into the HMG-box family (HMGB). A dendrogram of aa sequence similarity in HMG family proteins indicates two HMG subgroups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP512F1">1</xref>E). One includes the HMG-nucleosome binding family (HMGN) and the HMG-AT-hook family (HMGA), and the other is HMGB that includes HMGPI.

In addition, preincubation with the HMGPI peptide antigen abolished detection of the HMGPI protein, while preincubation with a control peptide had no effect on the immunodetection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp512/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>).

The HMG family proteins are abundant nuclear proteins that bind to DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner, influence chromatin structure and enhance the accessibility of binding sites to regulatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C17">17</xref>). Based on the number and the type of HMG domains, <italic>Hmgpi</italic> is relevant to the HMGB subfamily, characterized by containing two HMG-box domains (&#x02018;HMG-box&#x02019; or &#x02018;HMG-UBF_HMG-box&#x02019;), rather than either the HMGA or HMGN subgroups. <italic>Hmgpi</italic> is also known as <italic>Ubtfl1</italic> in the NCBI gene database, based on sequence similarity to <italic>Ubtf</italic>, a well-known ZGA gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C22">22</xref>). <italic>Ubtf</italic>, encoding a SANT domain and six HMG-box domains, functions exclusively in RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C23">23</xref>) and acts through its multiple HMG boxes to induce looping of DNA, which creates a nucleosome-like structure to modulate transcription of the 45S precursor of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) by Pol I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C25">25</xref>). Because the association of UBTF with rRNA genes <italic>in vivo</italic> is not restricted to the promoter and extends across the entire transcribed portion, UBTF promotes the formation of nucleolar organizer regions, indicative of &#x02018;open&#x02019; chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C26">26</xref>). Based on the sequence similarity between UBTF and HMGPI, HMGPI might also bind to DNA in a non-specific manner, and modulate chromatin during peri-implantation when dynamic chromatin change is essential.</p><p>Alternatively, HMGPI may act as a cytokine during preimplantation development in a similar manner to HMGB1. HMGB proteins are found primarily in the cell nucleus, but also to varying extents in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C28">28</xref>), and have been suggested to shuttle between compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C17">17</xref>). HMGB1 is indeed passively released from nuclei upon cell death and actively secreted as a cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C29">29</xref>), and the addition of recombinant HMGB1 into culture medium enhances <italic>in vitro</italic> development of mouse zygotes to the blastocyst stage in the absence of BSA supplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C30">30</xref>). Although HMGPI failed to be detected in culture media after <italic>in vitro</italic> culture of preimplantation embryos or ES cells in this study (data not shown), two different modes of Hmgpi action, chromatin modulator and secreted mediator, should be taken into consideration as discussed later.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Role of <italic>Hmgpi</italic> during peri-implantation</title><p>The HMGPI protein was first detected in 4-cell embryos and then abundantly expressed in 8-cell embryos, morulae, ICM, trophectoderm and ES cells. Although <italic>Hmgpi</italic> transcription peaked at the 4-cell stage, the most dramatic siRNA effect appeared at the blastocyst and subsequent stages. This discrepancy between temporal expression and phenotype is attributed to three possible mechanisms. First, protein expression is generally delayed from transcription, indicated here by the <italic>Hmgpi</italic> transcripts and HMGPI protein expression peaking at the 4-cell stage and blastocyst stage, respectively. Similarly, <italic>Stella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C31">31</xref>) and <italic>Pms2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C32">32</xref>) are maternal-effect genes, but do not cause developmental loss until later preimplantation stages. A second possibility is the incompleteness of siRNA knockdown. One limitation of such knockdown experiments is the potential variability in levels of silencing of a target gene, which could in turn underlie the observed phenotypic variability in the present study. Embryos with complete suppression of Hmgpi may exhibit developmental arrest at earlier stages (e.g. at the morula stage), while those with less suppression may not display a phenotype until the later stages (e.g. at the implantation stage). Ideally, the suppression level of each embryo could be experimentally analyzed to correlate with the phenotype. The third possibility is spatial translocation of HMGPI protein in the blastocyst cells. The HMGPI expression pattern indicated differential spatial requirements during early embryogenesis, supported by the apparent ability of HMGPI to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm; the cytoplasmic HMGPI observed from the 4-cell to morula stages and the nuclear HMGPI in blastocysts and ES cells could have different functions. A bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptide (FKKEKEDFQKKMRQFKK) similar to NLS of HMGN2/HMG-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C33">33</xref>) is also present in the HMGPI sequence. Thus, the nuclear HMGPI in blastocysts and ES cells might exert a critical transcriptional role to regulate gene expression essential for peri-implantation development. Indeed, the siHmgpi-induced knockdown of <italic>Hmgpi</italic> expression downregulated <italic>Cdx2</italic> in trophectodermal cells and <italic>Oct4</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic> in ICM cells, with subsequently reduced proliferation of trophectodermal cells and ICM-derived cells during blastocyst outgrowth.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Genes indispensable for derivation of ES cells</title><p>Like <italic>Hmgpi</italic>, <italic>Zscan4</italic> is another exclusively zygotic gene not expressed at any other developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C13">13</xref>). <italic>Zscan4</italic> is a putative transcription factor harboring a SCAN domain and zinc finger domains, and transcribed not only in preimplantation embryos but also in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C13">13</xref>). Reduction of <italic>Zscan4</italic> by RNA interference showed a phenotype similar to that induced by <italic>Hmgpi</italic> knockdown: developmental deterioration at the preimplantation stages, especially cleavage pause at 2-cell stage, and failure in blastocyst outgrowth, ES-cell derivation and implantation. Thus, a preimplantation-specific gene expression pattern could indicate a function in ES-cell derivation and/or maintenance. Indeed, <italic>Hmgpi</italic> was also expressed in entire ES colonies, whereas <italic>Zscan4</italic> shows a peculiar mosaic expression pattern in undifferentiated ES cell colonies. Furthermore, the <italic>Hmgpi</italic> gene is highly expressed in ES cells, but not in EC cells; <italic>Hmgpi</italic> is thus eligible as a putative ECAT (ES cell-associated transcript), whose ESTs are overrepresented in cDNA libraries from ES cells compared with those from somatic tissues and other cell lines including EC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C34">34</xref>). It is also likely that <italic>Hmgpi</italic> is expressed in iPS cells, based on <italic>in silico</italic> analyses of expression profiles [NCBI GEO database, e.g. GSE10806 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C35">35</xref>)]. Thus, <italic>Hmgpi</italic> is likely to have a role in maintaining pluripotent cells, since the ECATs such as <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>Eras</italic> and <italic>Gdf3</italic> are required for pluripotency and proliferation of ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C37">37</xref>). In the current study, <italic>Hmgpi</italic> was indeed involved in blastocyst outgrowth of ICM cells. On the other hand, several genes including ECAT members have been implicated in trophectodermal development as well as in early embryonic development. Like <italic>Hmgpi</italic> that was expressed in both ICM cells and trophectodermal cells, <italic>Dnmt3l/Ecat7</italic> has a role in embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues in early developmental stages. <italic>DNMT3L</italic> is recruited by <italic>DNMT3A2</italic> to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C38">38</xref>) to function in DNA methylation in ES cells, and defects in maternal <italic>DNMT3L</italic> induce a differentiation defect in the extra-embryonic tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C39">39</xref>). The reduced CDX2 expression in blastocysts and poor BrdU incorporation during blastocyst outgrowth following siHmgpi knockdown suggested the potential involvement of <italic>Hmgpi</italic> in trophectodermal development.</p><p>In summary, <italic>Hmgpi</italic> is required early on in mammalian development to generate healthy blastocysts that implant successfully and produce ES cells. HMGPI translocates into the nucleus from cytoplasm at the blastocyst stage, which is importantly a turning point of early embryonic development when DNA-methylation levels are at their lowest and implantation takes place. The nuclear HMGPI in blastocysts and ES cells is expected to act as a transcription factor to regulate gene expression networks underlying the generation, self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotent cells. Because E7 embryos have already stopped expressing <italic>Hmgpi</italic>, it is likely that <italic>Hmgpi</italic> stage-specifically regulates a set of genes that drive peri-implantation development. It will be valuable to identify both cofactors that bind HMGPI and recognize specific DNA sequences, as well as genes that are regulated by <italic>Hmgpi</italic> using ES cells.

Blastocysts were immunostained using a monoclonal anti-Oct4 antibody (mouse IgG2b isotype, 200 &#x000b5;g/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-Nanog antibody (ReproCELL, Tokyo, Japan), mouse monoclonal anti-Cdx2 antibody (CELL MARQUE, Rocklin, CA, USA), mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody (Santa Cruz) and rabbit monoclonal anti-active caspase 3 (Abcam) antibody, all diluted at 1:50&#x02013;300. The appropriate secondary antibodies (IgG) were diluted at 1:300 and supplied by Molecular Probes/Invitrogen: goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 546 and goat anti-mouse IgG(H + L) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488. The cellular DNA (nuclei) was stained with 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Wako; diluted 1:300). The cells were then washed with PBS and viewed by laser confocal microscopy (LSM510, Zeiss). For HMGPI immunostaining, all samples were processed simultaneously. The laser power was adjusted so that the signal intensity was below saturation for the developmental stage that displayed the highest intensity and all subsequent images were scanned at that laser power. This allowed us to compare signal intensities for HMGPI expression at different developmental stages. The other molecules in blastocysts and outgrowth were viewed and imaged as for the HMGPI expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Immunocytochemistry of blastocyst outgrowths and ES cells</title><p>Cultured ES cells and blastocyst outgrowths were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C, treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 15 min at RT, and then incubated for 30 min at RT in protein-blocking solution consisting of PBS supplemented with 5% normal goat serum (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The samples were then incubated overnight with the primary antibodies to OCT4, HMGPI, BrdU or active caspase 3 in PBS at 4&#x000b0;C. The cells were then extensively washed in PBS and incubated at RT with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG1 (anti-OCT4 and anti-BrdU antibodies, diluted 1:300; Molecular Probes) or Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG(H + L) (anti-HMGPI and anti-caspase 3 antibodies, diluted 1:300), and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI for 30 min. To prevent fading, cells were then mounted in Dako fluorescent mounting medium (Dako).</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)</title><p>E3.5 blastocysts and blastocyst outgrowths were cultured for 16 h in KSOM and ES medium, respectively, supplemented with 10 &#x000b5;M BrdU (Sigma). Samples were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed in PBS and then treated with 0.5 M HCl for 30 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>RNA extraction and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT)&#x02013;PCR</title><p>Embryos for qRT&#x02013;PCR analysis were collected at 18 h post-hCG and cultured as described above. They were harvested at 0.5, 1.25, 1.75, 2.25, 2.75 and 3.75 dpc to obtain fertilized eggs 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula and blastocyst embryos, respectively. Three subsets of 10 and 50 synchronized and intact embryos were transferred in PBS supplemented with 3 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and stored in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA from 10 and 50 embryos was extracted using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus, La Jolla, CA, USA). The reverse transcription reaction, primed with polyA primer, was performed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA isolated was reverse transcribed in a 20 &#x000b5;l volume. The resulting cDNA was quantified by qRT&#x02013;PCR analysis using the SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C43">43</xref>). An amount of cDNA equivalent to 1/2 an embryo was used for each real-time PCR reaction with a minimum of three replicates, with no-RT and no-template controls for each gene. Data were normalized against <italic>H2afz</italic> by the &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP512C44">44</xref>). PCR primers for the genes of <italic>Hmgpi, H2afz</italic> and <italic>Gapdh</italic> were listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp512/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S4</ext-link>. Calculations were automatically performed by ABI software (Applied BioSystems). For alpha-amanitin studies, fertilized eggs were first harvested at 18 h post-hCG, instead of eggs already advanced to the two-pronucleus stage. After 3 h of incubation, eggs that carried both male and female pronuclei were selected at 21 h post-hCG and randomly assigned to two experimental groups: with and without addition of alpha-amanitin to the culture medium. The eggs were further cultured in KSOM at 37&#x000b0;C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until the specified time point (32, 43 and 54 h post-hCG). Embryos used for alpha-amanitin studies and RNA interference experiments were subjected to qRT&#x02013;PCR as described for the normal preimplantation embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Immunoblot analysis</title><p>Protein samples from embryos were solubilized in Sample Buffer Solution without 2-ME (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), resolved by NuPAGE Novex on Tris-acetate mini gels (Invitrogen), and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore). The membrane was soaked in protein blocking solution (Blocking One solution, Nacalai) for 30 min at RT before an overnight incubation at 4&#x000b0;C with primary antibody, also diluted in blocking solution. The membrane was then washed three times with TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20), incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (0.04 &#x000b5;g/ml) directed against the primary antibody for 60 min, and washed three times with TBST. The signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate, Thermoscientific, Rockford, IL, USA) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The intensity of the band was quantified using NIH Image J software. Briefly, the signal was outlined and the mean intensity and background fluorescence were measured. The specific signal was calculated by dividing the band intensities for HMGPI by those for actin.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences between groups were evaluated statistically using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test or ANOVA, with <italic>P</italic>-values &#x0003c; 0.05 considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp512/DC1">Supplementary Material is available at <italic>HMG</italic> online</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported, in part, by Grants-in-Aid from the <funding-source>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</funding-source> (<award-id>19591911</award-id> to T.H., <award-id>21390456</award-id> to H.A.), by a National Grant-in-Aid from <funding-source>Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare</funding-source> (<award-id>H21-001, H20-001</award-id> to T.H., <award-id>H18-004</award-id> to H.A. and N.K.) and by a Grant-in-Aid from the <funding-source>Yamaguchi- Endocrine Organization</funding-source> to T.H.
