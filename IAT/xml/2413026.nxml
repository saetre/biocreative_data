Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important for the activation of innate immunity against microbial pathogens. We demonstrate a critical role of TLR9 in the dysregulated immune response and death associated with sepsis. Compared with wild-type (WT) mice, TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibited lower serum inflammatory cytokine levels, higher bacterial clearance, and greater survival after experimental peritonitis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Protection of TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice after CLP was associated with a greater number of peritoneal dendritic cells (DCs) and granulocytes than in WT controls. Adoptive transfer of TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DCs was sufficient to protect WT mice from CLP and increased the influx of peritoneal granulocytes. Subsequent experiments with a depleting antibody revealed that granulocytes were required for survival in TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Remarkably, a single injection of an inhibitory CpG sequence that blocks TLR9 protected WT mice, even when administered as late as 12 h after CLP. Our findings demonstrate that the detrimental immune response to bacterial sepsis occurs via TLR9 stimulation. TLR9 blockade is a potential strategy for the treatment of human sepsis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Sepsis remains the leading cause of death in critically ill patients, with mortality rates ranging between 30 and 70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). The syndrome of sepsis develops when the initially appropriate host response to infection becomes excessive, resulting in widespread inflammation and multiorgan failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Several strategies to treat human sepsis have targeted proinflammatory mediators. Unfortunately, most of these therapies have not proven to be efficacious in large multicenter clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Blockade of TNF, IL-1&#x003b2;, bradykinin, platelet-activating factor, elastase, nitric oxide, and LPS has not affected outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). In addition, it was recently demonstrated that corticosteroid therapy for septic shock failed to alter survival in a randomized trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Consequently, the current treatment of sepsis is largely supportive, and definitive therapies have remained elusive.</p><p>Septic peritonitis has a particularly high mortality and is characterized by a massive infiltration of neutrophils into the peritoneum, where they act as a first line of defense against microbial pathogens. When innate defenses become overwhelmed, bacteria escape the peritoneum and disseminate throughout the host, inducing an exaggerated inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Immune recognition of bacteria occurs via pattern-recognition receptors that detect conserved microbial components or products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). The best-characterized pattern-recognition receptors are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). There are at least 10 TLRs in mammals. TLR4 functions as the signal-transducing receptor for LPS, and TLR2 detects a broad range of Gram-positive bacterial products, including lipotechoic acid and peptidoglycan. The ligands for TLR9 are unmethylated CpG motifs present in bacterial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). The importance of TLRs in the pathogenesis of sepsis has been demonstrated in mice deficient in the signaling protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). MyD88 has been identified as a central adaptor protein for the signal transduction of all TLRs except for TLR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Although MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have attenuated responses to polymicrobial infection, the contribution of individual TLRs seems less critical. In a mouse model of septic peritonitis, it was shown that mice with single or combined deficiency in TLR2 and TLR4 had similar survival as WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). These surprising findings raised the possibility that individual TLRs are dispensable for the progression of bacterial sepsis and instead support an alternative hypothesis that stimulation of multiple TLRs is needed for an overwhelming inflammatory response. In this report, however, we show that eliminating TLR9 stimulation is sufficient to avert the unrestrained immune response in polymicrobial sepsis.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are resistant to polymicrobial sepsis</title><p>To determine the relative importance of TLR9 stimulation in polymicrobial sepsis, we performed cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Strikingly, nearly all TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice survived, whereas WT mice died at a median of 24 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The increased survival of TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was associated with enhanced clearance of bacteria from the blood (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and peritoneal cavity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), as well as a dramatic decrease in serum inflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The reduction in cytokine levels was most evident at 12 h and ranged between 15- and 300-fold, depending on the particular cytokine. To understand the basis of protection, we analyzed the cellular composition of the spleen and peritoneum. Compared with animals undergoing sham laparotomy, WT mice that underwent CLP had fewer splenocytes, which was consistent with previous data demonstrating apoptosis of splenic lymphocytes during sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). In contrast, we found that TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had a greater number of total splenocytes after CLP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The absence of lymphodepletion in TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice likely contributed to their protection because inhibiting apoptosis improves survival in sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). In the peritoneum, the number of lymphocytes increased markedly after CLP in TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals and to a lesser extent in WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Consistent with our findings of reduced serum cytokine levels in TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), the peritoneal cells of TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice isolated 12 h after CLP and cultured without restimulation made fewer cytokines than peritoneal cells from WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have less inflammation and increased survival after CLP.</bold> (A) The survival rates of WT B6 and TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were monitored for 6 d after CLP (15 mice per group, with data pooled from three experiments, each of which had similar statistical significance).

In mice, TLR9 is primarily expressed on DCs, B cells, and, to a lesser extent, macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). DCs play a pivotal role in sepsis, and DC recruitment to sites of inflammation in response to chemotactic stimuli is necessary for an optimal immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). During sepsis in mice and humans, the number of DCs is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). In addition, depletion of the remaining DCs in an inducible model of DC ablation demonstrated that DCs are protective during sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Furthermore, intrapulmonary transfer of DCs to mice 2 wk after sublethal CLP has been shown to reverse the sepsis-induced susceptibility to <italic>Aspergillus</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>We therefore determined whether DCs were altered in TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice during sepsis. As expected, DCs were reduced in the spleen and peritoneum of WT mice after CLP. However, the reverse was seen in TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, as sepsis actually increased the number of DCs in both the spleen and peritoneum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). We then examined the maturation, function, and subset composition of DCs 12 h after CLP. There was no difference in DC maturation between WT and TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice after sham laparotomy, as measured by CD40, CD80, and CD86 expression. However, CLP induced a similar increase in the maturation of DCs from WT and TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080162/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080162/DC1</ext-link>).

In vitro, iCpG also inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines when WT splenocytes were cultured directly with heat-inactivated contents from mouse cecum (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080162/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080162/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>TLR9 inhibition protects WT mice from CLP.</bold> (A) Immediately before CLP, WT mice received 100 &#x003bc;g iCpG or control oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), and survival rates were monitored for 6 d.

Thus, continued TLR9 stimulation was necessary for progression to death, because WT mice could be rescued at 12 h despite already being burdened by high bacterial counts and widespread inflammation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have been shown to be highly susceptible to Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), Gram-positive pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), and infection with the intracellular parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). In contrast, we have found TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to be markedly resistant to septic peritonitis. One potential explanation for this apparent discrepancy may be the diversity and magnitude of TLR stimulation between infection with a single pathogen and polymicrobial peritonitis. TLR stimulation may be protective up to a certain threshold, beyond which it becomes detrimental. It is conceivable that during infection by a single pathogen there is a restricted degree of TLR stimulation that initiates protective innate immunity, whereas in polymicrobial peritonitis there is widespread TLR stimulation that leads to an exaggerated inflammatory response. Nevertheless, in certain settings, stimulation of individual TLRs can be lethal. For instance, administration of bacterial DNA or LPS after sensitization with <sc>d</sc>-galactosamine is rapidly lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). In CLP, a more relevant model of clinical sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), the diverse pathogens residing in the enteric tract stimulate multiple TLRs, but inhibition of TLR9, as we have shown, and not TLR2 or TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), affects the outcome. In polymicrobial infection, it has generally been assumed that the stimulation of multiple TLRs collectively promotes the pathological hyperinflammatory response. Our findings, however, suggest a hierarchy of TLR responses, with TLR9 having a major role in the immunopathogenesis of polymicrobial sepsis. This is exemplified by the near abrogation of serum inflammatory cytokines in TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, a finding also observed in MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which are largely devoid of TLR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our data demonstrate that the absence of TLR9 signaling during peritoneal sepsis promotes the local influx of DCs, which is associated with an enhanced granulocyte response that is necessary for survival. The dependence on granulocytes may be independent of TLR9 or DC involvement. Nevertheless, we speculate that DCs mediate the enhanced granulocyte recruitment into the peritoneum, because adoptive transfer of TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DCs into WT recipients enhanced granulocyte recruitment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). DCs are known to produce high levels of chemokines, and their ability to do so has been shown to enhance the recruitment and activation of granulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Finally, the availability of inhibitors to human TLR9 provides the opportunity to translate our findings to the treatment of human sepsis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Animal procedures.</title><p>6&#x02013;10-wk-old WT CD45.1 and CD45.2 C57BL/6 (B6) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.

Mice subjected to sham laparotomy underwent the same procedure without the CLP. Mice were monitored every 8 h for 6 d to determine survival. Granulocyte depletion was accomplished with an i.p. injection of 500 &#x003bc;g anti-GR1 antibody (RB6.8C5; Monoclonal Core Facility, Sloan-Kettering Institute) 24 and 2 h before CLP. In vivo blockade of TLR9 was accomplished with a subcutaneous injection of 100 &#x003bc;g iCpG or control DNA sequence (InvivoGen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). The animals were maintained in a pathogen-free animal housing facility at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Cell isolation and adoptive transfer.</title><p>Peritoneal cells were isolated by injecting 5 ml PBS i.p. and retrieving the fluid 1 min later. The data depicted in the figures indicate the cell or bacterial count per milliliter of the retrieved peritoneal fluid. Spleens were mechanically disrupted, digested in 0.05% type IV collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich), and rendered free of erythrocytes by treatment with a hypotonic solution of ammonium chloride. In vivo expansion of DCs was accomplished with daily i.p. injections of 10 &#x003bc;g of recombinant human fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L; Amgen) for 10 d. Expanded splenic DCs were purified with anti-CD11c immunomagnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec). Splenic granulocytes were purified from CD45.1 mice with an anti-Ly6G (1A8) biotinylated antibody and streptavidin microbeads (Milteny Biotec). 10<sup>7</sup> expanded WT or TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD45.2 splenic DCs or 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> splenic CD45.1 granulocytes were injected into the lateral tail vein of CD45.1 or CD45.2 WT and TLR9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, respectively. Adoptively transferred cells were also labeled with 50 &#x003bc;M CFSE (Invitrogen) to facilitate their proper identification.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Flow cytometry.</title><p>Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSAria (BD Biosciences). Fc receptors were blocked with 1 &#x003bc;g anti-Fc&#x003b3;RIII/II antibody (2.4G2; Monoclonal Core Facility, Sloan-Kettering Institute) per 10<sup>6</sup> cells. Conventional DCs were defined as CD11c<sup>high</sup>MHCII<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and granulocytes were defined as Ly6G<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080162/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080162/DC1</ext-link>). Cells were stained with fluorescent-conjugated CD11c (HL-3), MHCII (AF6-120.1, I-Ab), CD45.1 (A20), CD45.2 (104), and Ly6G (1A8) antibodies (BD Biosciences). Dead cells were excluded with 7-amino-actinomycin D (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Measurement of cytokines and CFUs.</title><p>For cytokine measurement, peritoneal cells were cultured at a concentration of 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in media for 24 h. Blood was obtained by direct cardiac puncture. Supernatant and serum cytokine levels were determined using a cytometric bead array (BD Biosciences). Aerobic bacterial CFUs were determined by plating serial dilutions of blood and peritoneal fluid on brain&#x02013;heart infusion (BHI) agar plates.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Statistics.</title><p>Statistical significance was determined by the Student's <italic>t</italic> test and the log-rank test using statistical software (Prism 4.0; GraphPad Software, Inc.).
