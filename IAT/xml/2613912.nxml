Haplotype models did not fit better to the data than single marker models.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that intronic variation in <italic>ESR1 </italic>was associated with endometrial cancer risk.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Estrogens, whether from endogenous or exogenous sources, are potent mitogens in the endometrium and thus constitute a major carcinogen in this tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Endometrial cancer is therefore a good model for investigating clinical effects of estrogen signaling. Estrogen receptor alpha is the principal estrogen receptor expressed in the endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and it is considered to be crucial in the development of endometroid endometrial carcinoma, the most common histological subtype among endometrial neoplasms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Since altered ER function could have impact on the risk of endometrial cancer, the estrogen receptor alpha gene (<italic>ESR1</italic>) is a plausible endometrial cancer candidate gene which has been investigated in a few studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We have investigated whether polymorphic variation in the <italic>ESR1 </italic>is associated with invasive endometrial cancer risk, overall and in subgroups defined by other hormonally related factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Parent study</title><p>This nation-wide population-based case-control study encompassed all cases of incident, primary histopathologically confirmed invasive endometrial cancer among women 50 to 74 years of age resident in Sweden between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1995 as previously described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Endometrial cancer patients were identified at diagnosis through a notification system organized within the six Swedish regional cancer registries, to which reporting of all malignant tumors is mandatory. Controls were women randomly selected in 5-year age strata (to match the expected age frequency distribution among the cases) from the Swedish Total Population Register. Only women with an intact uterus and no previous history of endometrial cancer were eligible for this study.</p><p>Endometrial cancer patients were asked to participate by their respective physicians. After their informed consent, we mailed self-administered questionnaires asking for detailed information about use of menopausal hormones and oral contraceptives, weight, height, reproductive history, medical history, and other lifestyle factors. Controls were contacted directly with the questionnaire. Seventy-six percent of eligible cases (n = 802) and 84 percent of the controls (n = 3 550) ultimately participated in the parent study by answering the questionnaire. Among these controls, 491 who failed to return the mailed questionnaire were interviewed by phone. Slides with tumor tissue were collected from all cases and reviewed by one study pathologist to confirm the diagnosis, and to document tumor grade and myometrial invasion. The specimens were reclassified as: endometroid adenocarcinoma (n = 648), seropapillary carcinoma (n = 36), clear cell carcinoma (n = 10), adenoacanthoma (n = 3), adenosquamous carcinoma (n = 12), endometrial atypical hyperplasia (n = 80) (adenomatous hyperplasia with slight, moderate or severely pronounced atypia), and anaplastic carcinoma (n = 13). Results from the parent study have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of present study population</title><p>In the analysis, we included all women with endometrial cancer (n = 802) and 802 randomly selected controls (frequency-matched by age) from the parent study. In order to increase statistical power in subgroup analyses, we additionally selected all remaining eligible controls who had taken menopausal hormone treatment, either preparations containing medium potency estrogen only (mainly estradiol or conjugated estrogens) or medium potency estrogen in combination with progestin for at least 2 years (277 controls) and all remaining control women with self-reported diabetes mellitus (124 controls). For a detailed description of the hormone treatment variables, please see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In total, 802 cases and 1 203 controls were selected. In addition, we included 871 controls from the parent study who had also participated and been genotyped in a parallel breast cancer study, who fulfilled the inclusion criteria (including having an intact uterus). The Institutional Review Board at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden and the six other Swedish regional review boards approved this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Collection of biological material</title><p>All selected living women were contacted by mail and those who gave informed consent received a blood sampling kit by mail. Whole blood samples were drawn at a primary health care facility close to the woman's home and were sent to us by standard mail. A majority of the samples arrived at Karolinska Institutet within 24 hours after blood draw. All blood samples were immediately stored at -20&#x000b0;C. Endometrial cancer cases who declined to donate a blood sample were asked to permit to our use of normal tissue from archived paraffin embedded tissue taken at cancer surgery (consisting of, for example, cancer-free lymph nodes, uterine tube or myometrium). We also attempted to retrieve archived tissue samples from all deceased endometrial cancer cases. Samples were coded and transferred to the laboratories. Blood samples or archived tissue samples were obtained for 603 and 104 endometrial cancer patients, respectively, and blood samples from in total 1 574 control women (922 selected for this study + 652 genotyped in the breast cancer study), yielding participation rates of 88 percent for cases (707 of 802 eligible) and 76 percent for controls (1 574 of 2 074 eligible). Considering also the participation rate in the parent study, overall participation rates were 67 percent and 64 percent among cases and controls, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of SNPs and microsatellite markers</title><p>We selected <italic>ESR1 </italic>polymorphisms to be analyzed from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The polymorphisms were not intended to capture variation across the entire gene. The 5' promoter microsatellite (TA<sub>n</sub>) rs2234670 is located -1174-base pairs upstream of exon 1, while the SNPs rs2234693 (also known as PvuII) and rs9340799 (also known as XbaI) are found in intron 1, and the synonymous coding rs4986934 (codon 243 CGC&#x0003e;CGT) and rs1801132 SNPs (codon 325 CCC&#x0003e;CCG) are located in exon 3 and 4, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA extraction</title><p>DNA was isolated from 3 ml whole blood using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

For the fluorescence polarization and the minisequencing assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], we designed minisequencing primers complementary to the sequence immediately adjacent to the SNPs. For the Molecular Beacon assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], we designed two fluorescently labeled allele specific probes for each SNP, carrying the variable position in the middle of the loop region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We used a web-based DNA folding program (mfold) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] to estimate the stability of the stem and loop structure of the MB probes.

Five microliters of PCR product was aliquoted to 384-well microtiter plates and 5 &#x003bc;l of a PCR cleanup mixture containing 0.1 U/&#x003bc;l shrimp alkaline phosphatase (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) and 0.1 U/&#x003bc;l Exonuclease I (USB Corporation) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>was added.</p><p>The plate was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 hour, followed by 15 minutes at 95&#x000b0;C to inactivate the enzymes. Five microliters of extension mixture containing 5 &#x003bc;M extension primers, and 0.08 U/&#x003bc;l Thermosequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 9, 50 &#x003bc;M KCl, 5 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 8% glycerol, and fluorescently labeled and unlabeled ddNTPs was added to each reaction. The two ddNTPs relevant for the particular SNP were labeled and included at a 1:5 ratio relative to unlabeled ddNTPs. The total concentration of ddNTP was 0.125 &#x003bc;M. The fluorescent dye rhodamine 110 (R110) was used to label ddGTP and ddCTP, and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) were used to label ddATP and ddUTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA, USA). The cyclic extension reaction was performed at 92&#x000b0;C for 1 minute followed by 40 cycles of 92&#x000b0;C for 10 seconds and 55&#x000b0; for 30 seconds. The fluorescence signals in the 384 well plates were read on an Analyst AD&#x02122; (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Genotypes were assigned using the software AlleleCaller &#x02122; supplied with the instrument, and a custom-made Excel macro. In each run, positive controls for the three genotypes and negative controls were included. Both DNA polarities were analyzed and the results were concordant in all samples. Approximately 30 percent of the assays were repeated and the results were identical. In addition, 3% of the genotypes were validated by solid-phase minisequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular Beacon assay</title><p>To analyze the exonic SNPs rs4986934 and rs1801132, 10 ng of genomic DNA was amplified in a 25 &#x003bc;l reaction containing 0.02 U/&#x003bc;l of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems), 3.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 250 &#x003bc;M of dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 1 &#x003bc;M of PCR primers in TaqMan Buffer A containing the ROX dye (Applied Biosystems).

The increase in fluorescent signal was registered during the annealing step of the reaction and the end-point signals were used to assign the genotypes as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In each run, positive controls for the three genotypes and negative controls were included. Both possible nucleotides of the SNP were interrogated in the same reaction. Approximately 3% of the assays were repeated and the results were identical. Two percent of the assays were validated by solid-phase minisequencing.

None of the covariates appeared to be confounders. However, including information about parity, BMI, smoking status and use of oral contraceptives significantly improved the model fit.

The addition of either rs2234670 or rs2234693 to a model with rs9340799 did not significantly improve explanation of disease status (LR test p = 0.70 and p = 0.50, respectively). Conversely, starting with rs2234670 or rs2234693 and adding rs9340799 significantly improved model fit (LR test p = 0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively). Adding any of the last two markers, rs4986934 or rs1801132, neither improved fit nor changed estimates nor confidence intervals for the first three markers considered one at the time.

Neither did adding the rs1801132 (LR test p = 0.31) or the rs2234670 (LR test p = 0.83) and the respective interactions improve fit.

We were primarily interested in potential interactions between the marker and use of menopausal hormones and BMI, since these factors are the most important determinants of serum estrogen levels in postmenopausal women, though we also examined other hormonally related variables. We could not estimate main effects of variables that we used in our sampling scheme (see Methods section) and thus the results presented (first in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>) from the analyses stratified by these factors convey only genetic effects. In subdividing the cases and controls by use of menopausal hormones, the protective effect of rs9340799 emerged among never users while the pattern was unclear among users, possibly due too small numbers of observations (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). P-values for interaction were 0.007, 0.35, and 0.08 for compounds containing estrogen only, estrogen plus progestins cyclically and estrogen plus progestins continuously, respectively. Despite the small p-values, there were no allele-dose response relations. Association analyses stratified by various other risk factors for endometrial cancer are given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>. BMI did modify the association between rs9340799 and endometrial cancer (p = 0.91). This result was not sensitive to BMI category cutpoints (p = 0.75 and p = 0.45 using BMI&#x0003e;30 or BMI&#x0003e;31 as the highest category, respectively).

With regard to the rs9340799 locus, homozygotes for the rare G allele had an almost halved risk for endometrial cancer compared to common allele homozygotes. This protection seemed more pronounced when only cases with invasion through more than 50 percent of the myometrium were considered. The latter analysis was based on few cases and needs further confirmation. We found no convincing modification of this association by other endometrial cancer risk factors or histopathological grade.</p><p>We found no evidence of additional effects of other markers than rs9340799. However, we cannot determine whether this SNP is functional or in LD with some other functional locus. Furthermore, we cannot be completely certain that rs9340799 is more influential than rs2234693 because of the strong LD between these markers, separated by only 46 bp.</p><p>The association between rs9340799 and endometrial cancer was not convincingly modified by exposures that alter the availability of estradiol or estrone such as use of menopausal hormone preparations or high BMI. In our parallel breast cancer study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] the <italic>ESR1</italic>-disease risk association was stronger in women with high BMI but this appeared not to be the case in endometrial cancer. The effect of rs9340799 was largely the same in any stratum with sufficient sample size.</p><p>Our study is population-based and the largest investigating the relation between <italic>ESR1 </italic>and endometrial cancer to date. Furthermore, the study population is genetically homogenous, which limits concern about population stratification and which also preserves power as no additional stratifications based on ethnicity need to be made. The vast majority of cases in this study were of the strongly estrogen related endometroid type, and thus constitute a sample in which functional <italic>ESR1 </italic>alterations are expected to become evident.</p><p>The markers that we have studied here were selected because they were known to be polymorphic according to the literature available when the study was planned (around 1996). They were not selected, as is usually the case with current studies, in an attempt to represent the entire gene. This is a weakness but it should not discredit the reported association.</p><p>It appears as if the <italic>ESR1 </italic>gene is composed of three different LD blocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. All markers that are typed in the present study are located within the first region, towards the 5' end of the gene. We did not find evidence of any interactions between markers, which would have indicated that functional combinations of alleles exist in the gene. We initially intended to investigate if we could establish whether any SNP was functional or instead in LD with a functional locus, by comparing a model with genotype main effects and interactions, to a haplotype model, using SNPs rs9340799 and rs2234693. If the haplotype model had exhibited a significantly better fit then there would have been indication that other, linked, un-typed, SNPs were responsible for the association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, only three out of the four possible haplotypes of rs9340799 and rs2234693 exist in our data, so that we could not make this comparison. In contrast to our findings in the parallel breast cancer study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], a haplotype model with rs9340799 and rs1801132 did not provide any additional explanatory information.</p><p>Our main results replicate our own findings in a separate but equivalent Swedish study population where we observed associations of similar strength and magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. They also corroborate results of a small Japanese study where rs9340799 GG and rs2234693 CC genotypes were associated to a lower risk for endometrial cancer compared to those homozygous for the common allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]; OR 0.26 (CI 0.09&#x02013;0.79) and OR 0.23 (CI 0.07&#x02013;0.82), respectively. Another Japanese study found no such association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] but a decreased risk with allele-dose effect with the rare allele of a <italic>ESR1 </italic>codon 10 SNP.</p><p>Weel and colleagues found the rs2234693 CC genotype to be associated with an earlier onset of natural menopause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], which would entail a lower risk of endometrial cancer, but we did not find any similar association, nor any interaction between <italic>ESR1 </italic>genotype and age at menopause.</p><p>There is no evidence in the literature that rs9340799 affects the amount or function of the estrogen receptor protein. Herrington and colleagues found that the adjacent rs2234693 C allele produced an additional binding site for the myb family of transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Binding of B-myb to this site appeared to have the capability of enhancing <italic>ESR1 </italic>transcription. Since B-myb is in itself estrogen responsive there is a possibility of a positive feedback loop that could amplify estrogenic response. It is possible that in fact rs2234693 is the functional variant and that our finding was due to the strong LD between the markers in addition to random variation in the data. Ongoing studies that include dense mapping of <italic>ESR1 </italic>variants will give guidance as to what variants need to be further functionally validated.</p><p>Although our results, which are in line with a priori theories, might indicate a true influence of <italic>ESR1 </italic>variation on estrogen dependent phenotypes they could conceivably be due to selection bias, a potential problem in case-control studies. Our participation rates, 88 and 76 percent among cases and controls, respectively (67 and 64 percent using those eligible for the parent study in the denominator) could lead to bias if participation were related to genotype. Non-participating cases had a more advanced disease as measured by myometrial invasion. If, for example, a genetic variant is associated to severe cancer but not to less severe cancer and the more severe cases are less likely to participate because they have died, any association with cancer overall would be biased towards the null. Furthermore, genotype frequencies were not different between participants who donated blood and those who took part via a tissue sample, the latter of which were more often deceased. Our results cannot be generalized to include all endometrial cancer because there is data that indicates differing etiologies between endometroid and non-endometroid endometrial cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Another possible mechanism for selection bias is if an <italic>ESR1 </italic>variant influences a phenotype that differentially affects ascertainment or recruitment probability among cases and controls. In this case one would expect to find case-control associations with multiple otherwise unrelated phenotypes. <italic>ESR1 </italic>variation has indeed been associated with a host of other outcomes such as coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], height [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], bone mineral density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and age at menarche [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, despite the diversity among these outcomes there is reasonable evidence of etiological roles for estrogen. Our comparisons of characteristics among participants and non-participants do not point to any plausible mechanism for selection bias as an explanation to the observed association.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we found an association between genetic variation in <italic>ESR1 </italic>and endometrial cancer risk; the rs9340799 GG genotype was associated to an almost 50 percent decreased risk for endometrial cancer compared to the AA genotype. Our results strengthen belief in this <italic>a priori </italic>strong candidate gene but we cannot, based on our data, establish the importance of any single genetic locus within the gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SW planned and coordinated the collecting of biological samples, participated in the genotyping, performed most of the biostatistical analyses, interpreted results, and wrote the manuscript.
