Using a protocol where neurons are exposed to an EC<sub>50</sub> concentration of the muscarinic agonist methacholine (MCh) prior to (R1), and following (R2) a desensitizing pulse of a high concentration of this agonist, we have found that the reduction in M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor responsiveness is decreased in quiescent (+tetrodotoxin) neurons and increased when synaptic activity is enhanced by blocking GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with picrotoxin. The picrotoxin-mediated effect on M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor responsiveness was completely prevented by &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor blockade. Inhibition of endogenous G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 by transfection with the non-G<sub>q/11</sub>&#x003b1;-binding, catalytically-inactive <sup>D110A,K220R</sup>G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 mutant, decreased the extent of M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor desensitization under all conditions. Pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) activity, or chronic phorbol ester-induced PKC down-regulation had no effect on agonist-mediated receptor desensitization in quiescent or spontaneously synaptically active neurons, but significantly decreased the extent of receptor desensitization in picrotoxin-treated neurons. MCh stimulated the translocation of diacylglycerol- sensitive eGFP-PKC&#x003b5;, but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>/diacylglycerol-sensitive eGFP-PKC&#x003b2;II in both the absence, and presence of tetrodotoxin. Under these conditions, MCh-stimulated eGFP-myristoylated, alanine-rich C kinase substrate translocation was dependent on PKC activity, but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin. In contrast, picrotoxin-driven translocation of myristoylated, alanine-rich C kinase substrate was accompanied by translocation of PKC&#x003b2;II, but not PKC&#x003b5;, and was dependent on PKC and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin. Taken together these data suggest that the level of synaptic activity may determine the different kinases recruited to regulate M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor desensitization in neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>G protein-coupled receptor kinase</kwd><kwd>hippocampal neuron</kwd><kwd>muscarinic acetylcholine receptor</kwd><kwd>protein kinase C</kwd><kwd>receptor desensitization</kwd><kwd>synaptic activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Cholinergic innervation within the hippocampus originates mainly from the medial septal nuclei forming direct synaptic inputs to both principal neurons and interneurons throughout the dentate gyrus and CA3 and CA1 regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Dutar <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Rouse <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>). There is also evidence that some cholinergic terminals do not associate with specific postsynaptic sites, indicative of additional diffuse modulator influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Vizi and Kiss 1998</xref>). Effective transmission of cholinergic input is mediated by nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptors, with the M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>3</sub> mACh receptor subtypes being expressed on principal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Levey <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>). A major function of cholinergic transmission is to enhance the excitability of the hippocampal glutamate circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Dutar <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>) via a number of ionic conductances and second messenger systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Cobb and Davies 2005</xref>) suggesting a role in long-term excitability and synaptic plasticity. Indeed, there is recent strong evidence for modulation of synaptic plasticity by the physiological activation of hippocampal M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Shinoe <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) and cholinergic neurotransmission has long been associated with cognitive processes, such as learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Blokland 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Fadda <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Segal and Auerbach 1997</xref>).</p><p>M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptors are the major subtype signalling through G<sub>q/11</sub> to phospholipase C (PLC) and phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Porter <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>) and we have provided direct evidence for this signalling using fluorescence imaging approaches in single hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Nash <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Willets <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Young <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). We have also already provided substantial evidence that M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor/PLC signalling in hippocampal neurons is regulated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). GRKs are widely expressed in the brain and we have identified GRKs 2, 3, 5 and 6 in our hippocampal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Willets <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). However, there is still little direct evidence for their role in neuronal signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Willets <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gainetdinov <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Endogenous GRK6 regulates M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptors through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism in hippocampal neurons, whilst endogenous GRK2 is able to use both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent (through the direct interaction of the regulator of G-protein signalling-like domain on the N-terminus of GRK2 and GTP-bound G&#x003b1;<sub>q/11</sub>) mechanisms to regulate M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptors in PLC signalling and desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Willets <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2005</xref>). In the current study we have investigated mechanisms of regulation in mature hippocampal neurons that form synaptic interconnexions in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bacci <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>) and in which glutamate-mediated synaptic activity can be dramatically increased by suppressing inhibitory GABAergic inputs with picrotoxin, or suppressed with tetrodotoxin (TTx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bacci <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Nash <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Young <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Indeed, previous studies have revealed that the level of synaptic activity in such cultures dramatically alters M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Nash <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>), and there is much evidence that mACh receptors can modulate oscillation frequency in hippocampal networks (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Cobb and Davies 2005</xref>). Our current data suggest that increased synaptic activity enhances hippocampal M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor desensitization through mechanisms involving endogenous GRK2 and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzyme(s).</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Cell culture supplies and lipofection reagents were obtained from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK).

Based on these findings we applied a similar protocol (see Materials and methods) to study receptor desensitization in mature (&#x02265; 14 DIV) neurons. Comparison of the responses before (R1) and following (R2), the addition of a desensitizing pulse of MCh (100 &#x003bc;mol/L), showed a clear reduction in the R2 response 5 min after the desensitizing pulse under all conditions. In the presence of TTx (500 nmol/L; to block spontaneous synaptic activity), desensitization, indicated as the decrease in R2 response relative to the R1 response, was similar to our previous findings in immature neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1a</xref>). However, in the absence of TTx the hippocampal cultures display spontaneous, glutamate-driven and &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bacci <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Nash <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Young <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), which results in AMPA receptor-mediated depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via NMDA receptors and voltage-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. In agreement with our previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Nash <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>) such activity promotes enhanced IP<sub>3</sub> formation, seen as spikes above the level of IP<sub>3</sub> produced by the presence of agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1b</xref>). However, in the presence of spontaneous synaptic activity the difference between R2 and R1 responses was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1b</xref>), suggesting that synaptic activity may increase the rate/extent of M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor desensitization. To test this hypothesis, we enhanced spontaneous synaptic activity by adding picrotoxin (100 &#x003bc;mol/L) to block GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and enhance the effect of glutamate-driven AMPA receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> excitability within the neuronal culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Nash <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Young <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Picrotoxin (100 &#x003bc;mol/L) was added 3 min prior to the start of, and throughout the experiment. The presence of picrotoxin significantly suppressed the R2 response compared to R1, indicating that the level of synaptic activity within the neuronal culture directly effects receptor responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Effects of synaptic activity on M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptor responsiveness and re-sensitization assessed through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) imaging of hippocampal neurons.

No further re-sensitization was seen even following 30 min washout (data not shown). In the absence of TTx, R2 responses were slower to recover following the R<sub>max</sub> stimulus, and full recovery did not occur until 15 min post-desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1d</xref>). When synaptic activity was enhanced with picrotoxin, receptor-stimulated PLC responses were significantly depressed for up to 15 min post-R<sub>max</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1d</xref>).

In contrast, while agonist addition caused minimal translocation of eGFP-PKC&#x003b2;II, picrotoxin treatment (100 &#x003bc;mol/L) induced rapid, transient eGFP-PKC&#x003b2;II translocations to the plasma membrane, which mirrored the changes in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8c</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent studies from this laboratory have provided strong evidence that endogenous GRK2 and GRK6 can regulate the responsiveness of M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor signalling in cultured rat hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Willets <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">2005</xref>). Our approach has been to image the activation of PLC by this receptor using the eGFP-PH<sub>PLC&#x003b4;</sub> biosensor and co-transfection of wild-type, catalytically-inactive or antisense constructs to various kinases. In particular, we have established that GRK2 can suppress neuronal M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor signalling by both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms with the latter probably involving the direct binding of the RH domain of GRK2 to G&#x003b1;<sub>q/11</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Willets <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Our previous studies were performed on immature neurons (&#x02264; 8 DIV) before the development of spontaneous synaptic activity within the culture. Beyond &#x0223c;10 DIV these cultures form synaptic connections, which, via glutamatergic transmission, result in spontaneous, often synchronous bursts of action potentials that generate oscillatory changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Ogura <italic>et al.</italic> 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bacci <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Hardingham <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Nash <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>) which resembles, at least to some degree, the complex neuronal network activity observed in intact hippocampal preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">LeBeau <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). We have also shown that activation of M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptors can increase synaptic excitability in hippocampal neurons, probably via an agonist-mediated depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and activation of I<sub>h</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Young <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Furthermore, enhanced synaptic activity in hippocampal neurons, initiated by suppression of inhibitory GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with picrotoxin, dramatically enhances M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor-stimulated IP<sub>3</sub> production and Ca<sup>2+</sup> store release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Nash <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Moreover, very recent studies have revealed that conditions that mimic the <italic>in vivo</italic> environment of continuous synaptic bombardment of neocortical neurons show dramatically reduced mACh receptor agonist effects on membrane conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Desai and Walcott 2006</xref>).</p><p>In view of these data, we have examined M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor responsiveness in mature cultures of hippocampal neurons in which the level of synaptic activity has either been suppressed by TTx or enhanced by picrotoxin. Our data reveal clear evidence that agonist-mediated desensitization of M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor (with respect to the stimulation of PLC activity) is both enhanced and prolonged under conditions of increased synaptic activity. Furthermore, a combined action of GRK2 and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PKC(s) is indicated in the enhanced desensitization of M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor signalling observed in such synaptically active hippocampal neuronal cultures. Our current data also emphasize that the role of GRK2 in this regulation is dependent on its kinase activity. There is now much evidence that GRK2 can suppress a receptor-mediated G&#x003b1;<sub>q/11</sub> activation in a phosphorylation-independent manner through a specific interaction of GTP-loaded G&#x003b1;<sub>q/11</sub> with the RH domain located at the N-terminal of GRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Carman <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Sterne-Marr <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Tesmer <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Willets <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). In hippocampal neurons over-expression of GRK2, or its kinase-dead mutant form, completely suppresses M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor-stimulated PLC signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Willets <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). However, data obtained by expressing a dominant-negative GRK2 construct that also possesses a mutation (D110A) in the RH domain (preventing binding to GTP-loaded G&#x003b1;<sub>q/11</sub>), suggest that the phosphorylation-dependent activity of endogenous GRK2 is required for M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor desensitization in synaptically-active hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Willets <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>).</p><p>The enhanced and prolonged desensitization of M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor signalling observed in picrotoxin- and agonist-treated cultures appears to depend on both GRK2 and PKC activities, as expression of the dominant-negative <sup>D110A,K220R</sup>GRK2 construct only partially ameliorated agonist-induced receptor desensitization and further amelioration was observed in the presence of either a PKC inhibitor, or following phorbol ester-induced down-regulation of PKC activities. Moreover, our studies, using the translocation of eGFP-MARCKS have provided evidence for the activation of PKC in hippocampal neurons following M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor stimulation under conditions of increased synaptic activity. MARCKS is normally associated with the plasma membrane and translocates to the cytoplasm on phosphorylation by PKC and/or CaM binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Graff <italic>et al.</italic> 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arbuzova <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Here we provide evidence that the translocation of eGFP-MARCKS stimulated by MCh is predominantly dependent on PKC activity, supporting our previous studies with M<sub>3</sub> mACh receptors both in Chinese hamster ovary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bartlett <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) and in cerebellar granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Young <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Increased synaptic activity induced by picrotoxin in the hippocampal neurons also resulted in the translocation of MARCKS and inhibitor studies implicate both a PKC and CaM regulatory component under these conditions. Indeed, MARCKS translocation in response to MCh was paralleled by a reciprocal movement of eGFP-PKC&#x003b5;, but not PKC&#x003b2;II, to the plasma membrane. In hippocampal neurons the M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor stimulates robust IP<sub>3</sub>/diacyglycerol accumulation, but only limited and transient intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Increased synaptic activity induced by picrotoxin in the hippocampal neurons, however also resulted in the translocation of MARCKS, which was now accompanied by both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PKC&#x003b2;II and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent PKC&#x003b5; translocations. These results together with inhibitor studies strongly implicate PKC- and CaM-dependent components to MARCKS translocation under these conditions. Similar conclusions were reached in our previous studies on NMDA receptor-stimulated cerebellar granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Young <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Therefore, under conditions of picrotoxin-enhanced synaptic activity in hippocampal neurons, synchronous bursts of action potentials result in robust oscillatory changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Nash <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Young <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>) with consequent activation of CaM-dependent protein kinase and PKCs, as revealed by eGFP-MARCKS translocation. How this complex cross-talk results in an enhanced and prolonged M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor desensitization in synaptically-active neurons is not yet clear. Indeed, it should be emphasized that in immature, quiescent neurons neither Ca<sup>2+</sup> nor PKC appear to be involved in agonist-evoked M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Willets <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Whether independent/permissive phosphorylations of the M<sub>1</sub> receptor by PKCs and GRK2 occur, or whether a synergistic modulation of GRK activity by PKC results in such regulation remains to be established. However, in relation to the latter, PKC has previously been shown to phosphorylate GRK2 resulting in enhanced desensitization of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chuang <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>), and more recently phosphorylation of GRK2 by PKC was shown to suppress its inhibition by CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Krasel <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>).</p><p>Whatever the mechanism(s), the present studies provide a novel insight into the regulation of endogenous G protein-coupled receptor activity in synaptically-active hippocampal neurons. As such it provides the first evidence that ionotropic glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic activity can dramatically alter M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor responsiveness by mechanisms involving both GRK2 and PKC(s) in primary neurons. What might be the consequences of greater and/or more sustained M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor desensitization? There is substantial evidence that GRK-mediated phosphorylation of mACh receptors brings about the recruitment of arrestins that enhance receptor internalization and lead to the redistribution of receptors to organellar compartments within the cytoplasm in primary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Volpicelli and Levey 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bernard <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). In addition, it is now well established that phosphorylated-receptor recruited arrestins can act as scaffolds for various signalling proteins, including components of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Daaka <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Lefkowitz and Shenoy 2005</xref>). It has also been shown previously that M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor stimulation can activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Berkeley <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Berkeley and Levey 2003</xref>), although it is not yet known whether this is GRK2/arrestin-dependent. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that ionotropic modulation of the magnitude and/or longevity of receptor desensitization might not only lead to changes in plasmalemmal M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor expression, but also potentially lead to altered neuronal signal transduction through arrestin-dependent orchestration of key signalling pathways.</p><p>Our study has revealed novel information on the regulation of M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptors by both agonist and synaptically activated excitability changes. Whether this represents an important mechanism of acute regulation of G protein-coupled receptor activity in neurons, or whether this increases the potential of the receptor to integrate with glutamate-mediated synaptic activity and, for example, signalling to the nucleus to influence dendritic function and plasticity, requires further investigation. However, in this regard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Power and Sah (2002)</xref> have showed that following physiological activation of mACh receptors in hippocampal CA1 neurons, Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves invade the nucleus by a mechanism dependent on IP<sub>3</sub>-sensitve stores. We have also shown that increased synaptic activity in hippocampal neurons results in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent enhancement of M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptor-mediated PLC activity and increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> store release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Nash <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). Finally, another recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Buttery <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) has shown that stimulation of hippocampal M<sub>1</sub> mACh receptors (and mGlu receptors) recruits &#x003b1;1-chimaerin, a Rac-GTPase-activating protein, to the plasma membrane and its expression is highly dependent on the excitability of the neuronal culture. &#x003b1;1-chimaerin is known to modulate dendritic spine formation/removal in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Van de Ven <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Overall, this could provide a complex bi-directional cross-talk between ionotropic and metabotropic signalling in neurons that may underlie the regulation of longer-term modifications, such as synaptic plasticity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust of Great Britain (Grant Number: 062495).
