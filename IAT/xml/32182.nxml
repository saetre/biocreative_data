Only recently, CFTR has also been detected in vascular endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Endothelial cells (EC) form an anticoagulative barrier but also control many other functions, such as regulation of the vascular tone by secretion of vasoactive compounds such as bradykinin, and autocoids, such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These functions are modulated by a diversity of ion channels among which Cl<sup>-</sup> channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Endothelial Cl<sup>-</sup> channels, the volume-regulated anion channel, VRAC, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels, CaCC, have been shown to modulate EC electrogenesis, are possible mechano-sensors, serve as permeation pathways for amino acids and organic osmolytes and may be involved in regulation of the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry [for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This list of Cl<sup>-</sup> channels has been extended with CFTR, which is functional in human umbilical vein endothelium and in human lung microvascular endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], but not in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. As we show in this work, it is also functional in mouse aorta endothelial cells.</p><p>MAEC express different types of putative ion channel transcripts which are encoded by genes of the trp family, trp1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. TRP4 forms part of a store operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry channel which is involved in the control of NO-dependent relaxation of the mouse aorta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, TRP4 has been shown to interact via a VTTRL motif in its C-terminal region with the first PDZ domain of the regulatory factor of the Na<sup>+</sup>- H<sup>+</sup>exchanger NHERF, which also interacts with PLC&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The two PDZ domain protein NHERF associates also with the actin cytoskeleton via members of the ezrin/radixin/moesin family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It is also well established that the C terminus of CFTR constitutes a PDZ-interacting domain (QDTRL for the last five C-terminal amino acids) that is required for CFTR polarization to the apical plasma membrane and interaction with the PDZ domain-containing protein NHERF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus, both TRP4 and CFTR may bind to similar PDZ-domain proteins.</p><p>We have studied the functional expression of CFTR in both trp4 wild type and in trp4 deficient MAEC cells. We show here that CFTR is present in both cell types, but is not functional in trp4 deficient endothelial cells. These data may hint to a more general function of trp4 as regulator of other ion channels and to a novel regulatory mechanism for CFTR.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of CFTR in mouse aorta endothelium</title><p>We have been unable to detect CFTR in bovine pulmonary endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], but its expression has recently been described in endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. We have therefore assessed the expression of CFTR in mouse aorta EC (MAEC) by means of two sets of primers, the one detecting exon 5 through exon 9 of CFTR transcripts, and the other one detecting exons 23 and 24 of CFTR transcripts (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). The data show that CFTR is expressed in both wild-type and trp4 deficient MAEC cells, and are consistent with the recent detection of CFTR expression in human umbilical vein endothelium and human lung microvascular endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional characterization of CFTR in MAEC</title><p>Subsequently, we have investigated the functional expression of CFTR in wild type MAEC. Application of the phosphorylating cocktail, containing10 &#x003bc;M forskolin and 100 &#x003bc;M IBMX, activated in these cells a current without any apparent rectification and voltage-independent kinetics, which reversed at -26 &#x000b1; 6 mV (n = 6), i.e. close to the Cl<sup>-</sup>equilibrium potential, E<sub>Cl</sub> (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Its phenotype was completely different from that of Cl<sup>-</sup> currents activated by loading the cells with Ca<sup>2+</sup> (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), which are outwardly rectifying, slowly activate at positive potentials and inactivate at potentials negative to E<sub>Cl</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Challenging the MAEC with a 25 % hypotonic extracellular solution activated another type of Cl<sup>-</sup> current that inactivates at positive potentials and shows a less pronounced outward rectification (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The latter currents have been described in detail in other EC as VRAC, volume-regulated anion currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The cAMP-activated current reached a stationary value approximately 2 minutes after application of the phosphorylating cocktail (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), and disappeared after wash-out of the phosphorylation cocktail. The cAMP-activated current was observed in 16 out of 22 cells, but its density was rather small (4.9 &#x000b1; 1.1 pA/pF at +50 mV, obtained from voltage ramps, n = 16) compared to that of the other Cl<sup>-</sup> currents. It was activated without any change in cell volume or elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Glibenclamide (50 &#x003bc;M) blocked the cAMP-activated current by 62 &#x000b1; 4 % (n = 6) (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Obviously, the profile of this current is similar to that of CFTR currents in other tissues, i.e. slow activation, linear I-V curve, time-independent kinetics and inhibition by glibenclamide, indicating that CFTR channels are also functionally expressed in MAEC, and coexist with at least two other types of Cl<sup>-</sup>channels.</p></sec><sec><title>Down-regulation of CFTR currents in trp4-deficient MAEC</title><p>The phosphorylating cocktail failed to activate a similar current in trp4-deficient MAEC. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows an example for stimulating wild-type and trp4- deficient MAEC. On the other hand, the CaCC current activated by loading MAEC with 1 &#x003bc;M [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was not significantly different from that in wild type MAEC, i.e. 16 &#x000b1; 4 pA/pF in WT(n = 11) compared to 24 &#x000b1; 6 pA/pF (n = 8) in trp4 -/- cells at +100 mV. Also VRAC was not significantly different in both cell types (peak currents at +100 mV: 58 &#x000b1; 8 pA/pF, n = 7, in WT cells; 55 &#x000b1; 11 pA/pF, n = 6 in trp4 -/- MAEC).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We show that mouse aorta endothelial cells express functional CFTR channels, and that their activation is defective in mouse aorta endothelium of trp4-deficient mice, although these cells still expressed the CFTR transcripts.</p><p>CFTR expression has already been demonstrated in human umbilical vein (HUVEC) and lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], but was not detectable in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We show here that CFTR is also expressed as a functional channel in mouse aorta endothelial cells. It has been suggested that the endothelial CFTR has 100% identity with the corresponding epithelial cDNA from exon 3 to exon 6, including exon 5 which is absent in cardiac CFTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. CFTR is also present in corneal, non-vascular endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In MAEC cells, the first arterial cell type described to express CFTR, cAMP activated Cl<sup>-</sup> currents are smaller than Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated and volume-regulated Cl<sup>-</sup> currents in the same cell type. Activation of CFTR in endothelial cells could be of functional interest in transendothelial transport, in pH regulation because of the CFTR permeability for bicarbonate, and intriguingly also as part of the NO signaling cascade because of their sensitivity to cGMP, which might be elevated during endothelial NO production.</p><p>Besides its role as a Cl<sup>-</sup> channel, CFTR also regulates the activity of various ion channels and transporters, mainly via direct protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Some of these interactions might be mediated by the association of CFTR via its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (D-T-R-L) with the PDZ-binding domains of other proteins, such as NHERF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. CFTR also functions as regulator of ATP release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], which might be important for EC function because the released ATP could in turn bind to endothelial P2Y2 and P2X4 receptors [for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The finding that CFTR, although detectable in RT-PCR, cannot be activated in trp4-defiecint mouse aorta endothelium might be of a special interest, since it shows that the functional activity of CFTR may be connected to the expression of trp4, a member of the trp-family that is involved in capacitative Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CCE). CCE, mediated via store-operated channels (SOC), may affect CFTR activity indirectly via modulation of adenylyl or guanyl cyclases. It has indeed been shown that block of CCE by micromolar concentrations of La<sup>3+</sup> ions inhibits cyclic AMP synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In endothelial cells, CCE is the principle stimulus for sustained activation of eNOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and the concomitant elevation of the cGMP concentration may in turn activate CFTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Alternatively, TRP4 may interact more directly with CFTR by forming a signaling complex via binding of their PDZ-binding motifs to PDZ-domain proteins. The Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger regulatory factor, NHERF, has been identified as a protein that binds both TRP4 and CFTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Also light activated TRP channels in the Drosophila photoreceptor cluster with several other signaling proteins by associating with the PDZ-domain protein INAD. It is therefore not unlikely that TRP4 and CFTR associate in MAEC via similar PDZ-domain proteins, such as NHERF or the human INAD-Like (hINAD-L) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first report describing a functional interaction between a member of the TRP family and CFTR. It is therefore tempting to speculate that TRPs might be either regulators of CFTR or targets of CFTR regulating proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell isolation</title><p>Gene targeting for the construction of the trp4 deficient mouse has been described in detail elsewhere[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In short, part of the exon encoding transmembrane domain 4 and 5 and part of the linker between S5 and S6 was replaced by the neomycin-resistance gene and the deletion of the trp4 gene and lack of expression was confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The "primary explant technique" was used to study freshly isolated endothelial cells from mouse aorta of trp4 +/+ (wild type) and trp4 -/- mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In short, the aorta was removed form anesthetized and heparinized mice. Small pieces of the aorta were placed with their intimal side on matrigel-coated six well plates containing a very small volume of growth medium (mix for 100 ml: 80 ml DMEM (GIBCO BRL 41965) with in addition 10 ml FCS, 7.5 mg ECGF, 200 &#x003bc;l heparin (10 U/ml final), 2 ml penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/ml final, GIBCO BRL 15070), 1 ml L-glutamine (100x, GIBCO BRL 25030-024), and 1 ml Minimal Essential Amino acids so that the aortic pieces adhere to the substratum. Matrigel-coated plates contained TGF&#x003b2;, FGF, and tPA. Additional endothelial cell growth factors were added (75 &#x003bc;g/ml, ECGS, endothelial cell growth factor supplement, E2759, Sigma). Addition of heparin induced an antiproliferative effect on smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. After approximately 6 days, we removed the aortic pieces and let the endothelial cells that have migrated from the aortic segments grow to confluence. In this state, explanted endothelial cells can be studied on the matrigel support. For further investigations, cells were passaged by using dispase (Becton Dickinson, Two Oak Park, Bedford, MA, USA). Thereafter, growth medium was added to stop the dispase activity by dilution. Cells were then harvested, centrifuged and resuspended with DMEM.</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)</title><p>Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Gibco BRL Life Technologies), according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. After priming with oligo-dT oligonucleotides, cDNA was synthesized with MLV reverse-transcriptase (Life Technologies) according to the recommendations of the supplier. The cDNA was used as template in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using 5 &#x003bc;l of a cDNA synthesis reaction in a 50 &#x003bc;l amplification reaction. The amplification was performed in a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin Elmer). The temperature cycling conditions were: denaturation for 1 minute at 95&#x000b0;C, annealing for 1 minute at a temperature that is specific for each pair of primers (55&#x000b0;C for the primer couple P.CFTR-661.5 (5'-AAG TAT TGG ACA ACT TGT TAG TC-3' corresponding to nucleotides 661 to 683 of mouse CFTR cDNA, Accession number M69298) and P.CFTR-1360.3 (5'-TAA TTC CCC AAA TCC CTC CTC-3' 3' corresponding to nucleotides 1360 to 1340 of mouse CFTR cDNA, Accession number M69298), which amplify a 700 base pair fragment encompassing exon 5 (partial) through exon 9 (partial); and 60&#x000b0;C for the primer couple P.CFTR-3249.5 (5'-TGG AAT CTG AAG GCA GGA GTC-3' corresponding to nucleotides 3249 to 3269 of mouse CFTR cDNA, Accession number M69298) and P.CFTR-3428.3 (5'-TTC TCA TTT GGA ACC AGC GCA-3' corresponding to nucleotides 3428 to 3408 of mouse CFTR cDNA, Accession number M69298), which amplify a 180 base pair fragment excompassing exons 17a and 17b partially), extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 1 minute for fragments smaller than 1 kb for a total of 35-45 cycles, with a final extension step of 10 minutes to fully extend any remaining single stranded DNA. The first denaturation step was done for 6 minutes at 95&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Solutions and electrophysiology</title><p>For measurement of CFTR currents, we started the experiment by using a bath solution that contained (in mM): 150 NaCl, 6 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, titrated with NaOH to pH 7.4. The Cl<sup>-</sup> equilibrium potential, E<sub>Cl</sub>, is -36 mV. We then switched to a solution in which KCl had been substituted by CsCl. CFTR-channels were activated by a cocktail containing 100 &#x003bc;M IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) and 10 &#x003bc;M forskolin (both from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie) dissolved in the bath solution. The pipette solution contained (in mM): 40 CsCl, 100 Cs-aspartate, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 EGTA, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 with CsOH. Experiments were done at room temperature, &#x0223c; 22&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated Cl<sup>-</sup> currents were measured as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The bath solution contained (mM): 150 NMDG-chloride, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 50 mannitol, 50 nM charybdotoxin, 10 HEPES, titrated with NaOH to pH 7.4. Mannitol was used to suppress co-activation of volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC). Charybdotoxin (Sigma) was added to inhibit the big-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated K<sup>+</sup> channels, BK<sub>Ca</sub> which is also present in MAEC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The pipette solution contained (mM): 100 Cs-aspartate, 40 CsCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 1 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffered with 10 mM EGTA (CaBuf program, G.

In short, at the beginning of the patch-clamp recording, the Krebs solution was replaced by an isotonic Cs<sup>+</sup> solution to suppress K<sup>+</sup> currents, containing (in mM): 105 NaCl, 6 CsCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, 90 mannitol, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH (320 &#x000b1; 5 mOsm). Hypotonic solutions were obtained by omitting 90 mM mannitol from this solution (240 &#x000b1; 5 mOsm). A pipette solution was used containing (in mM): 40 CsCl, 100 Cs-aspartate, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.93 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 EGTA, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 with CsOH (290 mOsm). This solution is slightly hypotonic compared to the Krebs' solution to avoid spontaneous activation of volume-sensitive Cl<sup>-</sup> currents. The concentration of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in this solution was buffered at 100 nM, which is below the threshold for activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> currents and also prevents activation of non-selective cation channels.</p><p>MAEC cells were patch clamped as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].
