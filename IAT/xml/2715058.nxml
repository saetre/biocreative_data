We have recently found that tumors can alter the normal developmental process of M&#x003c6; to trigger transient activation of monocytes in peritumoral stroma. We showed that a fraction of monocytes/M&#x003c6; in peritumoral stroma, but not in cancer nests, expresses surface PD-L1 (also termed B7-H1) molecules in tumors from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Monocytes activated by tumors strongly express PD-L1 proteins with kinetics similar to their activation status, and significant correlations were found between the levels of PD-L1<sup>+</sup> and HLA-DR<sup>high</sup> on tumor-infiltrating monocytes. Autocrine tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; and interleukin 10 released from activated monocytes stimulated monocyte expression of PD-L1. The PD-L1<sup>+</sup> monocytes effectively suppressed tumor-specific T cell immunity and contributed to the growth of human tumors in vivo; the effect could be reversed by blocking PD-L1 on those monocytes. Moreover, we found that PD-L1 expression on tumor-infiltrating monocytes increased with disease progression, and the intensity of the protein was associated with high mortality and reduced survival in the HCC patients. Thus, expression of PD-L1 on activated monocytes/M&#x003c6; may represent a novel mechanism that links the proinflammatory response to immune tolerance in the tumor milieu.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Tumor progression is now recognized as the product of evolving cross talk between different cell types within the tumor and its stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Although normal stroma is nonpermissive for neoplastic progression, cancer cells can modulate adjacent stroma to generate a supportive microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). This includes the ability to alter the ratios of effector to regulatory T cells and to affect the functions of APCs and the expression of cosignaling molecules, which in turn creates an immunosuppressive network to promote tumor progression and immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). There is also emerging evidence that the proinflammatory response at the tumor stroma can be rerouted in a tumor-promoting direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). These observations suggest that different tumor microenvironments can create either immune suppression or activation at distinct sites to promote tumor progression.</p><p>Macrophages (M&#x003c6;) constitute a major component of the leukocyte infiltrate in tumor stroma. These cells are derived almost entirely from circulating monocytes, and in response to environmental signals, they acquire special phenotypic characteristics that are associated with diverse functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). We have recently found that tumor environments can alter the normal development of M&#x003c6; that is intended to trigger transient early activation of monocytes in the peritumoral region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Furthermore, in a study of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), it was noted that an increased number of activated monocytes/M&#x003c6; (HLA-DR<sup>high</sup>CD68<sup>+</sup> cells) in the liver was associated with progression of the disease. Thus, immune functional data of activated monocytes/M&#x003c6; in cancer environments are essential for understanding their roles and potential mechanisms in tumor immunopathogenesis.</p><p>PD-L1 (also termed B7-H1 and CD274) is a member of the B7 family of cosignaling molecules, and it possesses the dual functions of co-stimulation of naive T cells via an as yet unidentified receptor and coinhibition of activated effector T cells through PD-1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Expression of PD-L1 (B7-H1) is often induced or maintained by many inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), of which IFN-&#x003b3; is the most potent. In addition to being expressed on activated immune cells, most human cancers also express high levels of PD-L1 (B7-H1) protein, which correlates with poor prognosis in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). In contrast, low or rare PD-L1 (B7-H1) expression is observed in most mouse and human tumor cell lines, possibly because of the lack of a complete cancer microenvironment in cell lines in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). At present, little is known about the expression and function of PD-L1 (B7-H1) on APCs in the inflammatory activated stroma of human tumors in situ.</p><p>HCC is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, with an extremely poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). By using HCC as a model system, the present study showed that PD-L1<sup>+</sup> monocytes were accumulated in the peritumoral stroma area of cancers and increased with tumor progression. The pattern of PD-L1 (B7-H1) expression coincided with the transient activation of monocytes/M&#x003c6; during their initial exposure to the tumor environment. These activated PD-L1<sup>+</sup> monocytes suppressed tumor-specific T cell immunity, and their high infiltration was associated with poor survival of the HCC patients. Moreover, we found that blocking PD-L1 (B7-H1) effectively attenuated this monocyte-mediated T cell anergy and restored their antitumor activity in vivo. Therefore, PD-L1 (B7-H1) expression on activated monocytes may represent a novel mechanism by which the proinflammatory response is linked to immune tolerance in the tumor milieu.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>PD-L1<sup>+</sup> monocytes are highly enriched in the peritumoral stroma of HCC patients</title><p>To evaluate the potential role of PD-L1 in tumor immunopathology, we examined surface expression of this protein on circulating leukocytes from HCC patients and healthy donors, and on infiltrating leukocytes freshly isolated from tumor and nontumor liver tissues of patients with various stages of HCC (<italic>n</italic> = 28 in each group). In all of the samples analyzed, 92 &#x000b1; 7% of the PD-L1<sup>+</sup> leukocytes were CD14<sup>high</sup> cells that were considered as monocytes. PD-L1 was weakly expressed on a fraction of circulating monocytes in both healthy donors and patients. Although the percentage of PD-L1<sup>+</sup> cells was increased in nontumor-infiltrating monocytes, their intensity of PD-L1 expression was low. Compared with nontumor-infiltrating monocytes, the monocytes isolated from the corresponding tumor tissues comprised a significantly greater proportion of PD-L1<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>high</sup> cells and expressed significantly larger amounts of PD-L1 (both P &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Moreover, we found that the ratios of PD-L1<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>high</sup> cells in both nontumor and tumor-derived monocytes were higher in advanced stage HCC patients (stages III and IV; <italic>n</italic> = 13) than those in early stages (stages I and II; <italic>n</italic> = 15; P &#x0003c; 0.05 for nontumor and P &#x0003c; 0.001 for tumor tissues; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Monocytes isolated from human HCC tumor tissue expressed PD-L1.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) FACS analysis of PD-L1 expression on fresh monocytes isolated from peripheral blood and tissues.

The numbers of samples collected from patients and donors in A&#x02013;C were as follows: blood from 28 healthy individuals, and 21 stage I and II and 7 stage III and IV HCC patients; and paired nontumor and tumor tissue from 15 stage I and II and 13 stage III and IV HCC patients.

Using confocal microscopy, we confirmed that PD-L1 protein was expressed mainly on CD68<sup>+</sup> monocytes/M&#x003c6; (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and was only weakly expressed on other stromal and hepatoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Interestingly, only CD68<sup>+</sup> cells in the peritumoral stroma showed marked expression of PD-L1, whereas most CD68<sup>+</sup> cells in the cancer nests were weakly expressed or negative for PD-L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that PD-L1 is selectively expressed on monocytes/M&#x003c6; in peritumoral stroma at levels that increase with progressive stages in HCC patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Tumor environmental factors induce early transient expression of PD-L1 on monocytes</title><p>We have recently shown that tumor microenvironments may co-opt the normal development of M&#x003c6; to dynamically educate the recruiting monocytes in different niches of a tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). To investigate whether such mechanisms are also responsible for selective expression of PD-L1 on monocytes/M&#x003c6; in peritumoral stroma, we incubated normal blood monocytes with supernatants from cultures of hepatoma or normal liver cell lines. Exposure to 15% tumor culture supernatants (TSNs) from hepatoma (SK-Hep-1 and HepG2) cells induced rapid expression of PD-L1 on monocytes, reaching a maximum within 36 h and then gradually declining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). On day 7, TSN-exposed M&#x003c6; displayed significantly reduced expression of PD-L1. In contrast, supernatant from normal liver cells (LO2) had only a marginal effect on PD-L1 expression by monocytes/M&#x003c6;, even when used at a high concentration (30%).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Tumor environments regulated PD-L1 expression on monocytes/M&#x003c6;.</bold> (A) Monocytes were left untreated or cultured with the indicated supernatants for different times.

In parallel, some untreated monocytes were incubated for 24 h with TSNs from mock or SiHAS2 cells. (E) Monocytes were incubated for 24 h with rhIL-10 or rhTNF-&#x003b1; at the indicated concentrations (ng/ml).

The results showed that the expression of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD86 was significantly up-regulated on monocytes after exposure to TSNs from hepatoma cells for 24 h, but was reduced on day 7 when the cells developed into M&#x003c6; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Similar patterns of cytokine productions were obtained in TSN-exposed monocytes, including the accumulations of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-10, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-1&#x003b2; in the culture media at their early differentiation stage and a subsequent decline on day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Furthermore, comparison of the kinetics of PD-L1 expression and cytokine production in TSN-exposed monocytes revealed that cytokine profiles preceded PD-L1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). These findings suggest that TSN-induced activation of monocytes led to expression of PD-L1. The TSNs we used did not contain any measurable levels of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-10, IL-1&#x003b2;, or IL-12, except for a low concentration of IL-6 (227 &#x000b1; 53 pg/ml).</p></sec><sec><title>Autocrine cytokines from activated monocytes induce expression of PD-L1</title><p>Cytokines derived from myeloid cells have previously been found to induce expression of PD-L1 in human tumor DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). To ascertain whether autocrine cytokines from activated monocytes contribute to the expression of PD-L1, we used specific neutralizing antibodies to abolish the effects of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-10, or IL-6. As expected, blocking IL-10 effectively inhibited the up-regulation of PD-L1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Interestingly, monocyte PD-L1 expression was also partially attenuated by the anti&#x02013;TNF-&#x003b1; antibody, whereas it was not affected by treatment with a concentration of anti&#x02013;IL-6 antibody that effectively neutralized IL-6 in the culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082173/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>). To gain further support for roles of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10 in induction of PD-L1 on monocytes, we tested recombinant human (rh) cytokines in the culture system. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>, rhIL-10 induced significant expression of PD-L1 on monocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Although rhTNF-&#x003b1; alone, at concentrations up to 10 ng/ml, only had a marginal effect, it did synergistically increase the IL-10&#x02013;mediated PD-L1 expression on monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). These findings imply that IL-10 is involved in PD-L1 expression on human monocytes, and that effect can be potentiated by TNF-&#x003b1;.</p><p>We have recently observed that hyaluronan fragments constitute a common factor produced by several types of human tumors, including hepatoma, to stimulate the production of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether hyaluronan fragments are involved in inducing expression of PD-L1 on monocytes. The results showed that the up-regulation of PD-L1 protein on TSN-exposed monocytes was significantly impaired both by adding a hyaluronan-specific blocking peptide (Pep-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) and by reducing hyaluronan levels in TSNs via silencing of hyaluronan synthase 2 in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>), both of which have been shown to attenuate the release of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10 by these monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PD-L1 expression and activation of monocytes/M&#x003c6; are correlated in peritumoral stroma in HCC patients</title><p>The results described above suggested that monocytes are activated by tumor environments to express PD-L1 protein during the early migration/differentiation stage. To test this, we examined the coexpression of PD-L1 and HLA-DR on monocytes freshly isolated from peripheral blood, tumor, or nontumor liver tissues from HCC patients (<italic>n</italic> = 28 for each group). Consistent with the results for PD-L1 expression, we observed a significantly increased percentage of CD14<sup>high</sup> cells with high HLA-DR intensity in the tumor tissues (63.3 &#x000b1; 3.7%; P &#x0003c; 0.001 for all; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A&#x02013;C</xref>), and a higher ratio of HLA-DR<sup>high</sup>CD14<sup>high</sup> cells in monocytes was found in tumor masses from advanced stage HCC patients (stages III and IV [<italic>n</italic> = 13] vs. stages I and II [<italic>n</italic> = 15]; P &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Approximately 90% of HLA-DR<sup>high</sup>CD14<sup>high</sup> cells from tumors also expressed substantial amounts of PD-L1 (<italic>n</italic> = 28).

The coexistence of HLA-DR and PD-L1 on monocytes/M&#x003c6; was further confirmed by examining expression of these proteins in serial sections of HCC tumor samples. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>, most of the HLA-DR<sup>high</sup>CD68 cells were accumulated in the peritumoral stroma area, and they were also positive for PD-L1 (<italic>n</italic> = 15).

To test this assumption, 262 HCC patients received curative resection with follow-up data and were divided into two groups according to the median value of peritumoral stroma CD68 density (low, &#x02264;118 cells [<italic>n</italic> = 134]; high, &#x0003e;119 cells [<italic>n</italic> = 128]).

Multivariate analysis revealed that the number of CD68<sup>+</sup> cells in peritumoral stroma was an independent prognostic factor of OS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).

However, in spite of the generalized immunosuppressive status in cancer patients, many malignancies arise at sites of chronic inflammation, and inflammatory mediators are often produced in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). The present study demonstrates that the activated monocytes in a tumor microenvironment express PD-L1 (B7-H1) molecules to suppress tumor-specific T cell function, which may represent a novel link between proinflammatory response and immune tolerance in the tumor milieu.</p><p>Human tumor tissues can be anatomically classified into areas of intratumoral and peritumoral stroma, each with distinct compositions and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Intratumoral environments usually contain abundant immunosuppressive molecules and cells to inhibit the T cell responses and create conditions that are conducive to tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). In contrast, the stromal areas in most tumors contain a significant amount of leukocyte infiltrate, which was long assumed to represent the host response to the malignancy. In the current study, we observed that monocytes in the peritumoral stroma had an activated phenotype with increased expression of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref> and not depicted). Data from an in vitro study showed that such tumor-activated monocytes produced significant levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-12, and TNF-&#x003b1;. However, these activated APCs were unable to stimulate effective antitumor T cell responses, and instead they suppressed the T cell immunity both in vitro and in vivo, which suggests that such monocytes can actually benefit tumor progression. This notion is supported by our finding that the density of monocytes/M&#x003c6; in peritumoral stroma was correlated with advanced disease stages and poor survival in HCC patients. Consistent with our results, other investigators have recently reported that the increased CD68<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> cells in peritumoral liver tissues are positively associated with metastatic potential in HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>M&#x003c6; are versatile, plastic cells that can respond to environmental signals through diverse functional programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). We have recently shown that tumors dynamically regulate recruiting monocytes at distinct sites, which leads to transient activation of monocytes in peritumoral stroma and subsequent formation of suppressive M&#x003c6; in cancer nests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). The present study provided evidence that a fraction of these activated monocytes express PD-L1, and that those cells significantly inhibit tumor-specific T cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic potential in vitro. We also found that PD-L1<sup>+</sup> monocytes inhibited tumor-specific immunity in vivo and fostered tumor growth in NOD/SCID mice bearing human tumors. Several of our observations support the notion that tumor monocyte PD-L1 signals contribute to immunopathology. First, tumor-activated monocytes in our experiments strongly expressed PD-L1 molecules with kinetics similar to their activation status, and significant correlations were found between the levels of PD-L1<sup>+</sup> and HLA-DR<sup>high</sup> on tumor-infiltrating monocytes. Second, these PD-L1&#x02013;expressing monocytes effectively suppressed the tumor-specific T cell immunity, and that effect was attenuated by blocking PD-L1 on these monocytes. Third, expression of the PD-L1 receptor PD-1 was significantly increased on tumor-infiltrating T cells, and many of those cells were in close contact with activated PD-L1<sup>+</sup> monocytes in peritumoral stroma. Fourth, expression of PD-L1 on tumor-infiltrating monocytes was increased with HCC progression, and greater intensity of such protein was associated with high mortality and reduced survival in the patients. Therefore, expression of PD-L1 on activated monocytes may represent a novel mechanism that represses antitumor T cell immunity.</p><p>PD-L1 is a cell-surface glycoprotein belonging to the B7 family of cosignaling molecules with a profound regulatory effect on T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Studies in mouse models have revealed that expression of PD-L1 helped dormant tumor cells to evade cytotoxic T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Although expression of PD-L1 protein is often found on activated cells and various human carcinomas, the regulatory mechanisms of human PD-L1 remain to be defined. We found that autocrine TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10, but not IFN-&#x003b3;, released from activated monocytes, stimulated monocyte PD-L1 expression. Furthermore, in vitro study using recombinant TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10 indicated that IL-10 was essential for PD-L1 induction and that proinflammatory TNF-&#x003b1; acted synergistically with antiinflammatory IL-10 to enhance PD-L1 expression on monocytes. Moreover, comparison of the kinetics of cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) and PD-L1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>) in TSN-treated monocytes revealed that accumulation of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10 preceded the up-regulation of PD-L1. Such sequential cytokine production and PD-L1 expression on TSN-activated monocytes may reflect a novel immune-editing mechanism by which tumors render activated monocytes to perform a suppressive role by stimulating PD-L1 expression. This hypothesis is compatible with previous studies showing that the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1&#x003b2; or TNF-&#x003b1; can significantly enhance IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;dependent indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression on epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>).</p><p>In addition to PD-L1, another member of the B7 family, B7-H4, is also selectively expressed by various cellular components in the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). High levels of B7-H4 have been detected on a fraction of tumor-associated M&#x003c6; in patients with ovarian carcinoma, and these B7-H4<sup>+</sup> M&#x003c6; were found to inhibit tumor-specific T cell effector function both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Moreover, regulatory T cells can trigger production of IL-10 by APCs, which in turn stimulates such cells to express B7-H4 in an autocrine manner and renders them immunosuppressive via the B7-H4 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Therefore, manipulating the expression of and signaling through these molecules may open new avenues for developing novel immune-based therapies to enhance antitumor immunity in human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>).</p><p>Emerging evidence indicates that it is not inflammation per se but inflammatory &#x0201c;context&#x0201d; that determines the ability of proinflammatory factors to facilitate or prevent tumor growth. Our results suggest that there is fine-tuned collaborative action between immune activation and immunosuppression in tumor microenvironments. Soluble factors derived from cancer cells can trigger transient activation of newly recruited monocytes in the peritumoral stroma area, and thereby induce the monocytes to produce significant amount of cytokines, including TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10, which in turn leads to the expression of PD-L1 (B7-H1) protein on their surface and ultimately impairs the antitumor T cell immunity. These findings provide important new insight into the significance about how activated monocytes in tumors may perform a suppressive role by stimulating PD-L1 (B7-H1) expression, which would be helpful for the rational design of novel immune-based anticancer therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Patients and specimens.</title><p>Tumor or peripheral blood samples were obtained from 312 untreated patients with pathologically confirmed HCC at the Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center.
