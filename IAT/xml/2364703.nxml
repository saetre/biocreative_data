One factor, TRF1-interacting protein 2 (TIN2), binds TRF1 and TRF2 directly and POT1 indirectly. Along with two other proteins, TPP1 and hRap1, these form a soluble complex that may be the core telomere maintenance complex. It is not clear whether subcomplexes also exist in vivo. We provide evidence for two TIN2 subcomplexes with distinct functions in human cells. We isolated these two TIN2 subcomplexes from nuclear lysates of unperturbed cells and cells expressing TIN2 mutants TIN2-13 and TIN2-15C, which cannot bind TRF2 or TRF1, respectively. In cells with wild-type p53 function, TIN2-15C was more potent than TIN2-13 in causing telomere uncapping and eventual growth arrest. In cells lacking p53 function, TIN2-15C was more potent than TIN2-13 in causing telomere dysfunction and cell death. Our findings suggest that distinct TIN2 complexes exist and that TIN2-15C&#x02013;sensitive subcomplexes are particularly important for cell survival in the absence of functional p53.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>S.-h.

Telomere integrity and length maintenance are essential for prolonged cell proliferation and are thought to play important roles in suppressing aging and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackburn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rodier et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Telomere length is generally maintained by telomerase, a reverse transcription that adds telomeric DNA repeats to chromosome ends. Telomere length homeostasis also depends on proteins that act at telomeres in cis to control the recruitment or access of telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smogorzewska and de Lange, 2004</xref>). Most human cells do not express telomerase. Because DNA replication machineries cannot fully copy DNA 3&#x02032; ends, such cells lose telomeric DNA with each S phase. When telomeres become critically short, the cells enter a permanent growth-arrested state termed senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rodier et al., 2005</xref>). Both telomerase-expressing and telomerase-negative cells use a host of proteins to ensure a proper protective telomeric structure.</p><p>The precise structure of mammalian telomeres is not known. However, a &#x0201c;t-loop&#x0201d; structure, in which the 3&#x02032; overhang loops back and invades the telomeric DNA duplex, has been inferred by electron microscopy and biochemical experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Griffith et al., 1999</xref>). The t-loop model explains how telomeric ends are protected from recognition by DNA repair machineries. This protection is sometimes termed capping. Telomeres can become uncapped when critically short, presumably too short to form a t-loop, or when certain telomeric proteins are defective.</p><p>Several telomere-associated proteins are known to be important for telomere length regulation and capping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smogorzewska and de Lange, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rodier et al., 2005</xref>). These include the direct telomeric DNA-binding proteins telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1), TRF2, and protector of telomeres 1 (POT1), proteins that associate with these telomeric DNA binding actors (e.g., TRF1-interacting protein 2 [TIN2], hRap1, and tankyrases), and a variety of proteins involved in other processes, such as DNA repair and recombination. Of the direct DNA-binding proteins, TRF1 binds double-stranded telomeric DNA and is an important regulator of telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van Steensel and de Lange, 1997</xref>). In contrast, TRF2, which also binds double-stranded telomeric DNA, is more important for telomere capping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Steensel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karlseder et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smogorzewska and De Lange, 2002</xref>). POT1 binds the single-stranded 3&#x02032; overhang and is likely a terminal regulator of telomere length and end protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumann and Cech, 2001</xref>).</p><p>TIN2 is an important telomere-associated protein because it binds both TRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 1999</xref>) and TRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ye et al., 2004a</xref>) and indirectly interacts with POT1 via the intermediary protein TPP1 (also termed pTOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2004b</xref>], PIP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ye et al., 2004b</xref>], and TINT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Houghtaling et al., 2004</xref>]). TIN2 participates in the regulation of telomere length through its interactions with TRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 1999</xref>) and TPP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Houghtaling et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ye et al., 2004b</xref>). In addition, TIN2 appears to be a critical component in forming telomere complexes that function in end protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The functions of the three telomeric DNA-binding proteins (TRF1, TRF2, and POT1) are very likely coordinated. Perturbations of either TRF1 or TRF2 or their associated proteins POT1, hRap1, or TIN2 influence both telomere length and capping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van Steensel and de Lange, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loayza and De Lange, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iwano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). These observations suggest that TRF1, TRF2, POT1, and TIN2 may function in the same pathway. Consistent with this idea, six proteins copurified in a large molecular weight complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ye et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Connor et al., 2006</xref>). This complex may be the core molecular machinery that regulates mammalian telomeres. However, gel filtration identified a TRF2&#x02013;hRap1 complex that also contains TIN2 and POT1 but not TRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ye et al., 2004a</xref>). Furthermore, when TRF1 is removed from telomeres, TIN2 and TPP1 remain at telomeres via increased association with TRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Houghtaling et al., 2004</xref>). And, although POT1 was shown to be associated with TRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loayza and De Lange, 2003</xref>), POT1 and TRF2 also form a complex with telomeric DNA, and POT1 overexpression protects against loss of telomeric single-stranded DNA caused by expression of a dominant-negative TRF2 (DN-TRF2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, there may be distinct telomeric complexes that participate in maintaining telomere length and capping.</p><p>It is not yet clear whether there is a single TIN2 complex that always contains TRF1, TRF2, and TPP1/POT1 and their interacting proteins or whether TIN2 forms multiple complexes, some of which contain TRF1, whereas others contain TRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Houghtaling et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ye et al., 2004a</xref>). Furthermore, although it is hypothesized that telomeric complexes respond to telomere shortening, it is not known which telomere complexes are important for telomere capping, cellular senescence, and cell death. Here, we find that at least two major TIN2 complexes can be identified by immunoprecipitation and gel filtration of cell lysates and that one of these is crucial for cellular senescence and cell survival in the absence of p53.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>TIN2 depletion disrupts TRF1 and TRF2 and causes cell death in the absence of p53 function</title><p>To understand the effects of TIN2 on cell fate and telomeric complex integrity, we used RNAi to ablate TIN2 expression. We expressed short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brummelkamp et al., 2002</xref>) complementary to three regions of the TIN2 mRNA (T2i-1, T2i-2, and T2i-3) in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. Two of the shRNAs, T2i-2 and T2i-3, reduced TIN2 protein levels by 70&#x02013;80% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>). T2i-2 and T2i-3 (not depicted) also reduced TRF1 and TRF2 protein levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>), which is consistent with the reported degradation of TRF1 upon removal from telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2003</xref>). T2i-2 also reduced focal immunostaining, which is indicative of telomeric localization of TIN2, TRF1, and TRF2 (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710028/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710028/DC1</ext-link>). Thus, loss of TIN2 completely disrupted telomeres, as determined by the loss of TRF1 and TRF2 protein levels and telomeric occupancy.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of TIN2 ablation on TRF1, TRF2, and cell viability.</bold> (a) RNAi reduces TIN2 expression. HT1080 cells were transiently transfected with pSuper vectors expressing shRNAs corresponding to a nonexpressed (nonspecific [N/S]) mRNA or one of three distinct regions in the TIN2 mRNA (T2i-1, T2i-2, and T2i-3) as described in Materials and methods. Transfection efficiency varied from 60 to 70%. Cell lysates were analyzed 48 h later by Western blotting for TIN2 expression with &#x003b1;-tubulin used as a loading control. TIN2 protein levels were reduced to 23 and 24% of control levels by T2i-2 and T2i-3, respectively. Control cells expressed the N/S shRNA. (b)TIN2 reduction decreases TRF1 and TRF2 protein expression. Lysates from HT1080 cells transfected with the N/S (control) or T2i-2 pSuper vectors described above were analyzed for TIN2, TRF1, TRF2, and &#x003b1;-tubulin by Western blotting. The protein band intensities were analyzed as described in panel a. TIN2 and TRF2 protein levels were reduced to 16 and 13%, respectively, of control levels. (c) TIN2 reduction induces apoptosis in human tumor cells. HT1080 cells were transiently transfected with pSuper vectors containing no insert (vector) or N/S (control), T2i-1, T2i-2, or T2i-3 shRNAs and analyzed 48 h later for apoptosis as described in Materials and methods. Transfection efficiency was 60&#x02013;70%. Where indicated, the caspase inhibitor ZVAD (100 &#x003bc;M) was added 8 h after transfection. 200 cells were analyzed for apoptosis in three independent experiments. Error bars represent the standard deviation. (d) TIN2 reduction induces apoptosis in normal human cells. Normal human fibroblasts (HCA2 and WI-38) were transiently cotransfected with pSuper vectors containing no insert (vector) or T2i-1 or T2i-2 shRNAs, and a lenti-GFP vector at a ratio of 10:1. 48 h later, GFP positive cells were analyzed for apoptosis as described in Materials and methods. Where indicated, WI-38 cells were first infected with a retrovirus expressing GSE-22, selected, and then infected with the pSuper and GFP vectors. 200 cells were analyzed in three experiments. Error bars represent the standard deviation. (e) GSE-22 inactivates p53 activity in normal cells. WI38 cells were infected with a retrovirus expressing GSE-22 or an insertless virus, selected, plated, and irradiated with a 10-Gy x ray. The cells were fixed 19 h later and immunostained for p21 and p53.

Cell death was not observed when cells expressed an insertless vector, a nonspecific shRNA or T2i-1, which did not reduce TIN2 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, a and c</xref>). T2i-2 also induced apoptosis in primary human fibroblasts (strains HCA2 and WI-38; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 d</xref>). Strikingly, inactivation of p53 by GSE-22, a short peptide that disrupts p53 tetramerization and causes accumulation of monomeric p53 in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gudkov et al., 1993</xref>), failed to rescue WI-38 cells from T2i-2&#x02013;induced apoptosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 d</xref>). Loss of p53 activity was confirmed by the absence of detectable p21 immunostaining and enhanced p53 immunostaining in x-irradiated GSE-22&#x02013;expressing but not control cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 e</xref>). Thus, TIN2 was essential for TRF1 and TRF2 stability and occupancy at telomeres as well as the viability of normal and tumor-derived human cells, regardless of p53 status. This result suggests that the loss of TIN2 promotes a seriously aberrant telomeric structure that induces cell death even in the absence of p53, which is similar to the effects of telomere disruption caused by expression of a mutant telomerase template RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>TIN2 subcomplexes are formed in cells</title><p>To gain insight into physiologically relevant TIN2 complexes, we prepared nuclear extracts from HeLa cells using a modified Dignam protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dignam et al., 1983</xref>). The majority of endogenous TRF1 is extracted by this high salt (&#x0003e;0.3 M KCl) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Okabe et al., 2004</xref>). To detect TIN2 complexes, the extracts were dialyzed into buffer approximating physiological ionic strength and then fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography. The resulting fractions were analyzed by Western blotting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, a and b</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>TIN2-mediated complexes.</bold> (a) Endogenous TIN2 complexes in HeLa nuclear lysate. Telomeric proteins in HeLa nuclear extracts (2. 5 ml) were fractionated on a Sepharcryl S-300 HR column and immunobloted for the indicated proteins. 20 &#x003bc;l aliquots of the indicated fractions were loaded.

(c) TIN2-complexes. We prepared lysates from HT1080 cells that transiently expressed V5-tagged POT1 and stably expressed Flag-TIN2 (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) or HA-TRF1 (lanes 1 and 10), or both Flag-TIN2 and HA-TRF1 (lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 1999</xref>).

TRF1 eluted in two distinct peaks, coeluting with TIN2 in fractions 15&#x02013;17 and 27&#x02013;33. All six telomere-associated proteins (TRF1, TIN2, TRF2, hRap1, POT1, and TPP1) cofractionated in fractions 15&#x02013;17, which is consistent with the large complex termed shelterin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Lange, 2005</xref>) and referred to here as complex C. We also observed a protein complex containing TIN2, TRF2, hRap1, POT1, and TPP1 but lacking TRF1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>, fractions 19&#x02013;23), which is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ye et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Connor et al., 2006</xref>). We term this complex complex B. The complex B we detected here differs somewhat from that previously reported (termed fraction 1, isolated by a two-step chromatographic protocol; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Connor et al., 2006</xref>) in which TPP1 was only marginally detectable. Our one-step protocol, in contrast, showed that TPP1 was a prominent component of complex B. We quantified the signals from the Western blots to illustrate the elution profiles of the six telomeric proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 b</xref>).</p><p>Under our experimental conditions, we observed an additional telomere protein complex (complex A) containing significant amounts of TIN2 and TRF1 in the lower molecular mass range (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>, fractions 27&#x02013;33). Fractions 27&#x02013;31 also contained low levels of a TPP1&#x02013;POT1 complex, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xin et al., 2007</xref>). However, in contrast to our findings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>), these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ye et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Connor et al., 2006</xref>) did not detect complex A in the same molecular mass range, possibly because of the lower salt used for extraction or different gel-filtration conditions. Complex A does not appear to arise from larger complexes (e.g., complex C) as a consequence of high salt extraction because there is no evidence of dissociated or degraded monomeric proteins (TRF2, POT1, TPP1, and hRap1) in the low molecular weight fractions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, fractions 35&#x02013;49). This result is most consistent with a bona fide TRF1&#x02013;TIN2 complex (complex A) existing in vivo. As expected, we detected degraded TIN2 in fractions 57&#x02013;65. We confirmed the absence of monomeric proteins (and the presence of degraded protein) using twice the amount of sample and a different gel filtration column (Superdex S-200, 600&#x02013;10 kD) that is better at fractionating low&#x02013;molecular weight proteins (Fig. S2 a, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710028/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710028/DC1</ext-link>). This fractionation showed that low molecular ranges (Fig. S2 a, fractions 29&#x02013;55) contained only degradation products of TIN2 and TRF1. TRF1 is degraded when dissociated from telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, the high salt nuclear extracts contained &#x0003e;90% of the TRF1, TRF2, and TIN2, which suggests that most of these proteins were released from telomeres (Fig. S2 b). These results suggest that complex A (TRF1&#x02013;TIN2) might be degraded upon dissociation from telomeres by high salt (0.5 M); in lower salt (0.3&#x02013;0.4 M), this complex is not released from telomeres and is therefore not detected.</p><p>Our chromatographic results are consistent with the existence of three heteromeric complexes (complexes A, B, and C), although, taken alone, the results are also consistent with each of the proteins being assembled into homomeric complexes of approximately equal size.</p><p>To discriminate between these possibilities and more directly probe telomeric protein assemblies without high salt extraction, we overexpressed epitope-tagged POT1, TIN2, or TRF1 (V5-tagged POT1, Flag-tagged TIN2, and HA-tagged TRF1) in HT1080 cells. We prepared cell lysates using physiological ionic strength (0.15 M NaCl), which does not liberate endogenous TRF1 and TIN2 as determined by Western blotting (unpublished data).

We define presenescent cultures as those that retain &#x0003e;70% of their replicative life span and thus contain cells with mostly long, functional telomeres. In contrast to the robust cell death caused by complete loss of TIN2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, c and d</xref>), TIN2-13 or TIN2-15C caused little or no cell death when expressed in presenescent or senescent cells with normal p53 function (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 a</xref>). However, when p53 was inactivated, the fraction of apoptotic cells increased in both cell populations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 a</xref>). Notably, coexpression of TIN2-13 and GSE-22 elevated apoptosis only about twofold above the levels in control cells (expressing GFP and GSE-22), whereas coexpression of TIN2-15C and GSE-22 increased cell death 8- to 10-fold above control levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 a</xref>).

To further test the idea that disruption of different telomeric complexes differentially affects the survival of cells that lack p53 function, we used lentiviral vectors to express TIN2 mutants and GSE-22 in replicatively senescent HCA2 fibroblasts. These senescent cells have several short, dysfunctional telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zou et al., 2004</xref>), similar to those in late-generation telomerase-deficient mice. Moreover, because HCA2 cells express low levels of p16 (unpublished data), which inhibits the proliferation of cells that lack p53 function, p53 inactivation causes senescent HCA2 cells to resume proliferation, as reported for other low p16-expressing human fibroblast strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beausejour et al., 2003</xref>). We measured the ability of senescent HCA2 cells to form colonies after p53 inactivation and disruption of telomere complexes by TIN2 mutants.

The differences between TIN2-15C and TIN2-13 or DN-TRF2 in supporting colony formation could not be explained by differences in protein expression levels because TIN2-13 and DN-TRF2 were expressed more robustly than TIN2-15C (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 c</xref>).</p><p>Together, these findings suggest that p53-dependent cell growth requires both TIN2 A and B complexes.

These results suggest that TIN2-15C causes cell death by disrupting telomeric structure and capping rather than by shortening telomere length.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of telomerase and a proposed model.</bold> (a) Telomerase does not rescue cell death by TIN2-15C. 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> senescent cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing GFP (control), the telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT, TIN2-15C, or both TIN2-15C and hTERT. The cells were then infected with lenti-GSE-22. After 2 d, the cells were subcultured and plated for colony formation. Colonies were fixed and stained 61 d later. (b) Colonies were counted 5, 11, and 61 d after plating. Colonies were scored in two or three independent experiments for each transfection. Error bars represent the standard deviation. (c) Proposed model for TIN2 complexes at telomeres. Complex A and B cooperate, albeit at different positions on telomeres, to form t-loops or other terminal structures. Complex B may localize preferentially or uniquely near t-loop junctions, whereas A complexes may modulate the tertiary structure of telomeres and promote B complex stability. TIN2-13 disrupts complex A, thereby reducing the tertiary telomeric structure and destabilizing B complexes, resulting in partial or mild disruption of t-loops and telomere uncapping. TIN2-15C directly disrupts B complexes, resulting in severe disruption of t-loops and telomere uncapping. Cells expressing wild-type p53 and TIN2-13 or TIN2-15 undergo growth arrest, whereas cells lacking functional p53 undergo cell death. In both cases, the consequences of TIN2-15C expression are more severe than that of expressing TIN-13.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1810447f06"></graphic></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>TIN2 telomeric complexes</title><p>Six telomere-associated proteins (TRF1&#x02013;TIN2&#x02013;TPP1&#x02013;POT1&#x02013;TRF2&#x02013;hRAP1) have been isolated as a single soluble complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ye et al., 2004a</xref>). TIN2 occupies a unique position in this complex because it interacts directly with TRF1 and TRF2 and indirectly (through TPP1) with POT1. In these studies, TRF2 complexes contained TIN2 and POT1 but not TRF1, which suggests that TRF1 is not required for the TIN2&#x02013;TRF2/hRap1&#x02013;TPP1/POT1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Houghtaling et al., 2004</xref>). TRF1 and TRF2 bind noncooperatively along telomeric repeats and have high off-rates in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 1999</xref>). These results suggest that TIN2 may form dynamic TRF1 or TRF2 complexes at telomeres. We identified three major soluble TIN2 complexes (TRF1&#x02013;TIN2, complex A; TIN2&#x02013;TRF2/hRap1&#x02013;TPP1/POT1, complex B; and TRF1&#x02013;TIN2&#x02013;TRF2/hRap1&#x02013;TPP1/POT1, complex C) from nuclear extracts containing endogenously expressed proteins, which supports the idea that TRF1 and TRF2 complexes are separable.</p><p>Previously reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ye et al., 2004a</xref>) did not detect complex A, which suggests that our nuclear extraction protocol, which used higher salt concentrations, was more effective at dissociating TRF1&#x02013;TIN2 complexes from telomeres or the nuclear matrix. TRF1 cross-reactivity was detected as multiple bands in low molecular weight fractions, which is likely due to proteolysis after release from telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2003</xref>) or the nuclear matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Okabe et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, we did not detect complex C as a major complex in cells that overexpressed TRF1 and TIN2 and were extracted by physiological salt. Complex C formation may require telomeric DNA, t-loop formation, and/or posttranslational modifications to TRF1 or matrix-associated TRF1.</p><p>We used two TIN2 mutants with distinct abilities to disrupt the major TIN2 complexes (A and B). TIN2-13 affected the TRF1-TIN2 complex A, whereas TIN2-15C affected TRF2 complexes. If the major telomeric complex was a single entity (complex C), TIN2-13 and TIN2-15C should disrupt this complex similarly. However, our results are more consistent with the existence of two separable TIN2 complexes, which may have different functions in cells.</p></sec><sec><title>TIN2 complexes may function differently</title><p>In normal cells, telomeres shorten with each division, eventually causing senescence. TIN2-15C, which disrupts complex B, removes TRF2 from telomeres and induces DNA damage foci but TRF1 remains at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2004</xref>). DN-TRF2 also removes TRF2 and induces DNA damage foci containing TRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takai et al., 2003</xref>). Senescent cells with short telomeres and telomeric DNA damage foci frequently lack TRF2 but not TRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herbig et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, short telomeres may preferentially attract A complexes, and senescent cells may be unable form enough complex B (TIN2&#x02013;TRF2/hRap1&#x02013;TPP1/POT1) because TIN2 is bound primarily in A (TRF1&#x02013;TIN2) complexes. Alternatively, complexes A and B may have different preferred locations on the telomere or t-loop and cooperate in telomere capping.</p><p>TRF1&#x02013;TIN2 complexes stimulate interactions between telomeric DNA tracts in vitro, which suggests that this complex modulates a tertiary telomeric structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2003</xref>). TIN2-13, which disrupts this complex (complex A), may decrease the complexity of the telomeric structure. However, deletion of TRF2 or POT1 causes telomere uncapping and chromosome fusion, which suggests that complex B is essential for telomere end protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hockemeyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with this view, we found that TIN2-15C, which disrupts complex B, uncapped telomeres and caused telomeric fusions and anaphase bridges. Thus, we favor the hypothesis that TRF1&#x02013;TIN2 (A) complexes and TIN2&#x02013;TRF2/hRap1&#x02013;TPP1/POT1 (B) complexes have different locations at telomeres and cooperate to form the telomeric cap (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 c</xref>). B complexes are more important for ensuring a proper terminal or t-loop structure, whereas A complexes modulate the telomeric tertiary structure and enhance the stability and function of complex B. Although TIN2-13 induces some telomere uncapping and telomeric fusion, the effects of TIN2-13 are less pronounced than those of TIN2-15C, which suggests that complex A supports the functions of complex B.</p><p>Alternatively, complexes A and B may cooperate to form the six-protein complex C (also termed shelterin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Lange, 2005</xref>), and this complex may be the essential entity for telomere capping and cell survival. TIN2-13 may be less efficient than TIN2-15C at disrupting complex C. TPP1 may be an important regulator of complex C formation because loss of TPP1 can reduce the TRF1&#x02013;TRF2&#x02013;Rap1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Connor et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Telomere-dependent cell survival in cells with or without p53 function</title><p>Late generation mice lacking both telomerase and p53 have a higher incidence of cancer relative to animals lacking only telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chin et al., 1999</xref>), implicating p53 as a key regulator of the response to telomere dysfunction. However, mice deficient in both p53 and telomerase lose sterility after only a few generations, which indicates a second p53-independent block to cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chin et al., 1999</xref>). Expression of dominant-negative telomerase proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hahn et al., 1999</xref>) or mutant telomerase RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guiducci et al., 2001</xref>) induces death in cells with either wild-type or mutant p53, which supports the idea that the loss of viability caused by telomere dysfunction is not dependent on a functional p53 response. In contrast, cell death or growth inhibition caused by expression of DN-TRF2 is p53 dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karlseder et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smogorzewska and De Lange, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Our results indicate that complex B disruption by TIN2-15C induces telomere dysfunction and cell cycle arrest in p53-positive cells. However, p53-deficient cells that express TIN2-15C continue to divide, developing chromosome-end fusions and anaphase bridges. These abnormalities result in cell death, which does not require p53 function. Thus, our findings support the idea that complex B disruption by TIN2-15C causes cell death that is independent of p53 due to severe genomic damage and mitotic catastrophe (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 c</xref>). Our results also suggest that DN-TRF2 and TIN2-15C have different effects on the integrity of complex B.</p><p>In the absence of p53 activity, senescent cells that express little or no p16 can resume growth, although their proliferation is eventually limited by severe telomere shortening, crisis, and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beausejour et al., 2003</xref>). Expression of telomerase eliminated this growth limitation. Expression of TIN2-13 and DN-TRF2 only minimally affected this growth resumption, whereas TIN2-15C expression accelerated this growth limitation. Recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hockemeyer et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2006</xref>) suggest an explanation for why the effects of TIN2-15C differ from those of DN-TRF2. Although POT1 deficiency causes a telomere uncapping phenotype similar to that caused by TRF2 loss, POT1 and TRF2 likely have distinct functions in protecting telomeres, regulating nucleolytic processing, and controlling telomeric recombination. Thus, TIN2-15C and DN-TRF2 likely inactivate TRF2 and POT1 differently in complex B. Because DN-TRF2 induces p53-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karlseder et al., 1999</xref>), whereas TIN2-15C caused cell death in p53-deficient cells, our findings offer an explanation for why ablation of TIN2 in cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and in the mouse germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2004</xref>) causes cell lethality or senescence regardless of p53 status.</p><p>It remains to be understood how telomere dysfunction causes cell death in p53-deficient cells, how dysfunctional telomeres are sensed as DNA damage, and the nature of the p53-dependent and -independent sensing mechanisms. Despite these gaps in our knowledge, telomerase inactivation has been proposed as an anticancer strategy because most cancer cells maintain telomere length by expressing this enzyme. Likewise, disruption of TIN2 complexes may provide a strategy for preferential killing of cancer cells, most of which lack p53 function. Thus, TIN2-15C&#x02013;sensitive complexes may provide a sensitive target for selective elimination of p53-deficient cancer cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture, senescence, and apoptosis characterization</title><p>We cultured all cells and measured senescence-associated &#x003b2;-galactosidase as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dimri et al., 1995</xref>).
