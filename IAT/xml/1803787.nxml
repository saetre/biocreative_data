Studies have shown that mice heterozygous for <italic>PTEN </italic>develop spontaneous tumors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and that conditional tissue-specific tissue disruption of <italic>PTEN </italic>leads to tumors in the affected tissues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Through its actions on multiple downstream signaling proteins, including but not limited to the PI3K/Akt pathway, PTEN has the capacity to affect a variety of cancer-relevant signaling cascades.</p><p>Germline mutations of <italic>PTEN </italic>occur in 80% of patients with Cowden syndrome, which is characterized by the occurrence of multiple non-cancerous hamartomas; in addition, these patients are at high risk for breast, thyroid, and endometrial carcinomas, as well as an increased risk of bladder and renal cell carcinoma (RCC)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Consistent with these data, PTEN protein and gene expression have been variously described as reduced[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], absent[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], mutated[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], or deleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] in human RCCs; a recent study demonstrated PTEN loss in 20% of RCCs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and another study quoted an LOH of 27% in kidney cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Since RCC is a malignancy associated with frequent treatment failures when metastatic, and because RCC and other tumors lacking PTEN are often resistant to conventional chemotherapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the mechanism by which PTEN contributes to chemotherapy failure is of immediate clinical importance and may lead to new therapeutic options for patients with such cancers.</p><p>Cell cycle progression, both in normal and cancer cells, is finely regulated by the interplay between the cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and CDK inhibitors (CKIs), as well as by fluctuation in their levels at different points of the cell cycle (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). The earliest described role of p21 was in cyclin/cdk inhibition[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], but more recent data also has shown that p21 is involved in positive effects on cyclin/cdk activation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] through its "assembly factor" function[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In addition, p21 has been shown to be anti-apoptotic in many tissues, including cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and, as such, has been suggested to be a target for cancer therapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. There are also reports of a role of p21 in inducing senescence, a mechanism which seems to protect against malignant transformation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We have previously shown that p21 is a prognostic marker in clear cell RCC (ccRCC) such that its elevated levels portend a poorer prognosis in patients who have metastatic ccRCC at diagnosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>While <italic>p21 </italic>is transcriptionally regulated by p53[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] (hence its function in DNA damage repair), the mechanisms that regulate the activity of p21 and its post-translational modification are less clear. A previous report demonstrated that p21 is phosphorylated by Akt, which leads to increased p21 stability as well as enhanced cell survival[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and another report showed that cytoplasmic localization of p21 results from HER2/Neu activation of Akt with subsequent p21 phosphorylation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We have shown that p21 accumulates in the cytoplasm of actively growing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and that forced localization of p21 to the cytosolic compartment results in increased cell growth[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and resistance to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Given the complex relationship between PTEN, phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), Akt, and p21, which are all signaling proteins involved in cell growth and apoptosis in cancer, we now address how PTEN deficiency influences p21. In this study, we demonstrate that, in an RCC cell line that retains wild type genes for PTEN and p53, knockdown of PTEN using RNA inhibition increases p21 stability, but not transcription. This event results in increased cytosolic localization of this protein, a property which, having been earlier shown to result in apoptosis resistance and cell cycle progression, may explain the chemoresistance of PTEN-deleted tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Rapamycin decreases p21 in response to cisplatin-induced DNA damage</title><p>Inhibition of mTOR has been shown to decrease p21 in human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells, and, in fact, such attenuation of p21 is required for sensitization of these cells to apoptosis induced by DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. A clinical trial using the rapamycin analog CCI-779 (an mTOR inhibitor) showed this compound has antitumor activity against RCC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We thus hypothesized that both the results from this trial and the chemotherapy resistance that is characteristic of PTEN-deficient RCC may be due, at least in part, to the anti-apoptotic function of p21.</p><p>There is no "standard" chemotherapeutic agent in RCC, since none has been proven unequivocally effective in this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] which is highly resistant to chemotherapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, for these studies we have utilized the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin, given the available data on sensitization of tumor cells to this agent with p21 attenuation by the mTOR inhibitors and other agents[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. To begin to address the hypothesis that the chemotherapy resistance of PTEN-deficient RCC may be due to p21 induction, we asked whether cisplatin increases p21 in ACHN cells (a PTEN-wt ccRCC cell line) and whether this increase is antagonized by mTOR inhibition (which has been shown to have antitumor activity). When ACHN cells were incubated with cisplatin at concentrations of 0.001 and 0.01 &#x003bc;g/ml, p21 levels increased, presumably in response to DNA damage; yet, this increase did not occur in cells incubated with rapamycin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In addition, when used in combination with cisplatin, rapamycin inhibited the accumulation of p21 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Thus, DNA damage leads to increased levels of p21, and this increase is prevented by inhibition of mTOR.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cisplatin increases p21 in ACHN cells</bold>.

We utilized an shRNA construct to stably attenuate PTEN expression in the PTEN-wt RCC cell line, ACHN (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Stable clones of PTEN shRNA (N = 2)-, mutant-shRNA- (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>) and empty vector-transfected (control) cells were selected and examined for expression of PTEN and p21. As expected, levels of PTEN were significantly reduced (by as much as 20-fold) in cells transfected with PTEN shRNA, but not in those containing pSuper (empty) vector alone or mutant shRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>), indicating that the attenuation of PTEN was not due to non-specific effects of introducing shRNA into the cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Attenuation of PTEN expression by pSuper RNAi system</bold>. a.

Intriguingly, p21 levels were increased by ~5-fold in the PTEN-knockdown cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) suggesting that p21 is involved in the resistance to apoptosis seen upon loss or inactivation of PTEN; subsequent experiments were performed to ascertain the mechanisms underlying this effect.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>PTEN-knockdown reduces sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis</bold>.

Semi-quantitative assessment of p21 and PTEN using immunohistochemistry showed an inversely proportional relationship between expression of PTEN and cytoplasmic localization of p21 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), an indirect indicator of increased expression (see below).

Since initial efforts showed no change in p21 mRNA in PTEN knockdown as compared to PTEN-wt cells (data not shown), we utilized the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) to assess protein stability. Incubation of the cells with CHX abolishes translation of new p21, such that tracking p21 levels over time can be used as an indicator of its half-life. We incubated ACHN cells with CHX and followed the disappearance of the protein by immunoblotting. Both wild type cells and cells containing empty pSuper vector as control showed the half-life of p21 was ~2 h, consistent with previous reports[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

We found a similar increase in p21 levels after proteasome inhibition, using each of the inhibitors, in both control transfectants and PTEN-knockdown cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), suggesting that the proteasome pathway is intact in both cell lines. The cells incubated with CHX for 6 h showed minimal p21 due to the relatively short half-life of this protein (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), a fact which is not altered by the continuing presence of PTEN shRNA and its effects on PTEN.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>PTEN knockdown does not alter proteasome-dependent degradation</bold>.

To investigate this possibility, we tested p21 stability under conditions where we inhibited the activity of either PI3K or Akt. First, we confirmed that loss of PTEN had the expected effects on activation of PI3K by evaluating Akt phosphorylation at Ser 473 (an activating event that requires PI3K activity). The levels of steady state Akt phosphorylation were high both under conditions of serum-deprivation and serum-stimulation in PTEN-knockdown cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that attenuation of PTEN removed its antagonistic effects on PI3K-mediated Akt activation. Conversely, serum-deprivation led to a predictable reduction of phospho-Akt in cells transfected with the mutant control shRNA, yet Akt phosphorylation remained responsive to serum-stimulation in these cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, lanes 3 and 4), as is observed in wild type ACHN cells. This provides evidence of specificity, and excludes non-specific effects of shRNA transfection on PTEN attenuation. We also observed increased levels of phospho-Mdm2 in PTEN-knockdown cells (data not shown), which similarly supports a functional effect of PTEN-knockdown on related signaling pathways.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Akt phosphorylation is increased in PTEN-knockdown cells</bold>.

In agreement with the immunofluorescence data, we found that the ratio of p21 in the cytosol as compared to the nucleus was markedly enhanced in PTEN-KD cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13b</xref>). Whether these findings are due to a generalized increase in cellular p21 with a stoichiometric redistribution of a proportion of the total p21 from the nucleus to the cytosol, or to a specific augmentation of cytosolic p21 through a separate signaling mechanism (such as alteration of the nuclear localization sequence), remains to be determined. However, augmentation of total p21 as well as specific increases in cytosolic p21 in PTEN-deficient cells may be an important mechanism through which PTEN-altered tumors acquire resistance to chemotherapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Many malignancies, including kidney cancer, are characterized by resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapy. While the mechanisms of this effect remain incompletely understood, they appear to relate to activation of survival pathways that occur in the setting of DNA damage repair. For example, exposure to ionizing radiation causes DNA strand breaks leading to increases in p53, which in turn activates either the cell death (apoptosis) program, or alternatively, genes involved in cell cycle arrest and subsequent DNA repair (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]). Thus, tumors harboring p53 mutations (~50% of all human malignancies), fail to apoptose or growth arrest after DNA damage[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and may thus escape death upon exposure to chemotherapeutic agents; this can lead to chemotherapy failure. The cyclin kinase inhibitor p21 is induced by p53 in situations of DNA damage, and it likely plays a role in the decision pathways leading to apoptosis or DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; for this reason, not only has p21 been proposed as a target for chemotherapy sensitization, but also, the mechanisms by which p21 becomes activated have attracted considerable interest in the study of chemotherapy-resistant cancers.</p><p>p21 was initially characterized based on its function as an inhibitor of G1 cyclin kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], but after the discovery that p21 possesses pro-proliferative[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] as well as anti-apoptotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] effects, research on this protein expanded to include to its roles in cancer progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. A putative relationship of p21 to PTEN was proposed after reports emerged that p21 is phosphorylated and stabilized by Akt[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our present findings reported here, that PTEN deficiency augments p21 stability and alters its subcellular localization so that it is situated more in the cytosolic compartment, may explain at least part of the observed chemotherapy resistance that is observed in PTEN-deficient tumor cell lines as well as in tumors derived from PTEN-knockout mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Other investigators have demonstrated a tissue-specific relationship between PTEN and p21. Using a Cre-Lox model of tissue-specific PTEN-deficiency, Yoo et al detected higher levels of p21 protein and transcripts in PTEN-deficient bladder tissue (but not prostate), a finding which they interpreted as a potential bladder-specific tumor suppression mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Another group showed a similar phenomenon in PTEN-deficient prostate tissue, which they interpreted as confirming the activation of a p21-related senescence pathway[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, ours is the first study to report increased p21 levels and altered subcellular compartment localization in PTEN-knockdown cells, and to begin to elucidate a mechanism for this finding.</p><p>Our use of a kidney cancer cell line for these studies was prompted by the facts that (i) kidney cancer is exquisitely chemotherapy-resistant such that 5-year survival for the metastatic form of the disease is less than 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and (ii) decreased PTEN expression is frequently seen in this disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In an earlier study, we found elevated levels of cytoplasmic p21 expression at time of surgery were associated with a worse prognosis in patients with metastatic ccRCC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] consistent with the data in the present study; assessment of PTEN and p21 status in a small set of ccRCC (N = 9) from the University of Colorado Hospital archives showed loss of PTEN and elevated levels of p21 staining in every tumor, as compared to unaffected kidney samples from age and sex matched controls (R. Weiss, J. Modiano, and K. Shroyer, unpublished observations).</p><p>Akt regulates the balance of apoptosis and cell survival by phosphorylating proteins crucial in apoptotic and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Based on the fact that altered PTEN expression is often observed in RCC, deregulated Akt activation is likely one of the underlying mechanisms of RCC tumorigenesis. Use of the Akt inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol ether lipid analogue class that we utilized in this study has been shown to cause apoptosis in various RCC lines which are characterized by elevated Akt activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Among a variety of downstream targets of Akt, phosphorylation of Bad, an important pro-apoptotic protein, was prominently decreased when treated with the Akt inhibitor, possibly due to decreased Akt activity. In addition, expression of Bcl-XL, an anti-apoptotic protein, was decreased resulting in increased cell death. Consistent with these findings, our data suggest that pharmaceutical approaches to target Akt inhibition may be useful in designing more efficient therapeutic regimens for ccRCC.</p><p>The most recognized and universal response of a cell to DNA damage is activation of p53 transcription, followed by p53-mediated transcriptional activation. p53, the "guardian of the genome" is responsible for apoptosis of cells which cannot be repaired, and some of these biochemical events are mediated by p21[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, it has been described that PTEN may protect p53 from Mdm-2-mediated degradation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], so it is possible that the observed increase in p21 levels is mediated via p53 or Mdm-2, or through a p53-independent mechanism.</p><p>The clinical relevance of our findings is supported by recent data indicating that p21 is involved in the mechanism of action of mTOR inhibitors. Beuvink et al showed that the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 sensitizes cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis through inhibition of p21 translation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Our data suggests an explanation for the anti-tumor activity of mTOR inhibition in a clinical trial of RCC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], especially in those RCCs with PTEN alterations, and these data support further trials of mTOR inhibitors in RCC and other HIF-activated cancers.</p><p>One possible means to sensitize cancer cells to DNA damage induced apoptosis would be to attenuate p21 prior to application of a DNA damaging agent in order to direct DNA damaged cells into the apoptotic (rather than the repair) pathway[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].
