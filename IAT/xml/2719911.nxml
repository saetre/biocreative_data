Costimulatory molecules are a receptor/ligand class of molecules capable of regulation of inflammation in innate immunity via macrophage/neutrophil contact. We recently described that CD80/86 ligation is required for maximal macrophage activation and CD80/86<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice display reduced mortality and inflammatory cytokine production after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). However, these data also demonstrate differential regulation of CD80 and CD86 expression in sepsis, suggesting a divergent role for these receptors. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the individual contribution of CD80/86 family members in regulating inflammation in sepsis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>CD80<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had improved survival after CLP when compared to WT or CD86<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This was associated with preferential attenuation of inflammatory cytokine production in CD80<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Results were confirmed with pharmacologic blockade, with anti-CD80 mAb rescuing mice when administered before or after CLP. <italic>In vitro</italic>, activation of macrophages with neutrophil lipid rafts caused selective disassociation of IRAK-M, a negative regulator of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling from CD80; providing a mechanism for preferential regulation of cytokine production by CD80. Finally, in humans, upregulation of CD80 and loss of constitutive CD86 expression on monocytes was associated with higher severity of illness and inflammation confirming the findings in our mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our data describe a differential role for CD80 and CD86 in regulation of inflammation in the innate immune response to sepsis. Future therapeutic strategies for blockade of the CD80/86 system in sepsis should focus on direct inhibition of CD80.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response to infection (SIRS), is a devastating condition affecting nearly 750,000 people/year and resulting in over &#x00024;17billion/year in health care expenditure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Angus1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Hotchkiss1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, in spite of maximal supportive care and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, mortality remains in excess of 25&#x00025; underscoring the need for better adjuvant therapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Angus1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Hotchkiss1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The innate immune response forms the corner stone of regulation of inflammation and pathogen control in sepsis. This is characterized by an initial burst of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, which in controlled settings, can recapitulate many of the clinical findings of sepsis. However, numerous trials have shown that neutralization of any of these cytokines individually has little to no impact on survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Abraham1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Opal1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. One potential reason for their failure is the redundant and overlapping nature of many of these individual cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Saha1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, while neutralization of ether TNF-&#x003b1; or IL-1&#x003b2; has little effect on mortality in humans or in mice subjected to lethal polymicrobial sepsis via Cecal Ligation and Puncture (CLP), combined neutralization does improve survival in CLP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Remick1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Remick2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Remick3">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. As a result, many investigators have begun to target receptors/mediators capable of simultaneously regulating numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p><p>Costimulatory molecules are one class of receptors which have recently been implicated as fulfilling this role in the innate immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Gold1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-MalmborgHager1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Kopf1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Gold2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. CD80 and CD86 represent one class of costimulatory receptors. They are stimulated via CD28 while CTLA4 serves as both a stoichiometric inhibitor of CD28-CD80/86 engagement as well as serving to directly induce immunosuppressive signals within dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Orabona1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Sharpe1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Grohmann1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the high degree of homology and functional overlap between CD80 and CD86, studies investigating their function have sought to either inhibit their common ligand (CD28) or to use a CD80/CD86<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse.</p><p>While a large body of evidence points to a critical role for the CD28-CD80/86 system in regulating inflammation in autoimmune disease and graft vs. host disease in the adaptive immune response, our group and others have now described a similar role in the innate immune response. Specifically, neutrophils expressing CD28 activate macrophages in a contact dependent manner via engagement of CD80/86 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Hoshino1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Specifically, sepsis was associated with an increase in CD80 expression, while there appeared to be a downregulation of constitutive CD86 expression. Further, recent studies suggest CD80 and CD86 have differential regulation in the inflammatory response <italic>in vivo</italic> in diseases regulated by the adaptive immune response, including allergic rhinitis and graft rejection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Okano1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Hosiawa1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Combined, these data imply a possible differential role for CD80 and CD86 in regulating mortality and inflammation in the innate immune response as well. Consequently, the goals of this study were to determine the individual contribution of CD28, CD80 and CD86 to the inflammatory response in murine sepsis, and to better correlate expression of these molecules with outcome in humans with sepsis and septic shock.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal studies were approved by the New York University and Oregon Health and Sciences University Institutional Animal Care &#x00026; Use Committee (IACUC).

The ability of CD28 to regulate inflammation in the innate immune response to sepsis is consistent with prior reports documenting CD28 expression on PMNs and the ability of CD28, either soluble or in PMN lipid rafts, to induce NF-&#x003ba;B and pro-inflammatory cytokine production via CD80/CD86 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Orabona1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Hoshino1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Venuprasad1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results are also consistent with earlier reports suggesting an important role for CD28 in regulating abdominal abscess formation in CLP as well as the role for CD28 in mediating toxic shock in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Saha1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Tzianabos1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, these data support the recent observations of lethal cytokine storm in with administration of an agonist CD28 antibody in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Suntharalingam1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Together these data imply a prominent role for the CD28-CD80/86 system in regulating multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines in the innate immune response.</p><p>While CD28 is capable of activating both CD80 and CD86, the relative contribution of the interaction and differential effect of these <italic>in vivo</italic> has been less well defined. The finding of improved overall survival in CD80<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and not CD86<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice implies CD80 is the dominant receptor for regulating lethality in the innate immune response in the early stages of CLP. This is corroborated by the relative attenuation in IL-6 in CD80<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> vs. CD86<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and is consistent with the known ability of CD28 to regulate IL-6 production from dendritic cells in a CD80 dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Orabona1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, recent studies suggest CD86, not CD80, plays a dominant role in mediating graft vs. host disease and abdominal abscess formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Hoshino1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Okano1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Hosiawa1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The reasons for these contrasting results are likely due to the source of CD28 and the chronicity of inflammation. In those model systems, there is a much more prominent role for CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells, as opposed to PMNs or soluble CD28 as observed in the early phases of sepsis. Future studies are required to determine the interaction between the cellular source of CD28 and predilection for CD80 vs. CD86 activity. Finally, the improved survival with anti-CD80 as opposed to anti-CD86 confirms the results obtained with the knockout mice and the ability of anti-CD80 to rescue mice when given after the onset of sepsis suggests this is a potential therapeutic target as well.</p><p>The ability of CD80 to regulate inflammation can be in part explained by its known ability to regulate the induction of NF-&#x003ba;B in response to CD28 engagement. The NF-&#x003ba;B signaling complex contains numerous adapter molecules which serve to both stimulate and repress NF-&#x003ba;B signaling. IRAK-M is a well described repressor of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling and successful induction of pro-inflammatory signals requires loss of IRAK-M from the NF-&#x003ba;B signalsome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Kobayashi1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. We now show that IRAK-M is directly associated with CD80 and CD86 and that stimulation of macrophages with PMN lipid rafts causes preferential loss of this association with CD80, providing one potential mechanism to explain the preferential ability of CD80 to regulate multiple inflammatory cytokines. Further studies are required to ascertain whether this is specific for the presence and source of CD28 (PMNs vs. T-cells), explaining the predilection for CD80 in innate immunity while CD86 appears more prominent in the adaptive immune response.</p><p>Another potential reason for the prominent effect for CD80 in innate immunity, centers on the differential expression of CD80 and CD86 in sepsis. Our group and others have previously demonstrated that sepsis is associated with marked an increase in CD80 expression and a loss of constitutively expressed CD86 in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Nolan1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. We now extend these observations to humans. Similar to mice, humans with sepsis exhibit a loss of CD86 and upregulation of CD80 on circulating monocytes. A prominent role for CD80 in regulating lethal inflammation is supported by a direct correlation between CD80 levels and severity of illness (SOFA score) and presence of shock. Of even greater interest was the inverse correlation of CD86 and severity of illness, with loss of CD86 being associated with mortality, a reduction in ICU free days and increased likelihood of shock. Further, the negative association of CD86 with circulating levels of IL-10 and IL-6 suggest a potential direct anti-inflammatory role for CD86 <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the mechanism of CD86 loss remains incompletely understood.</p><p>While our data provide strong evidence for a predominant role for CD80 in regulation of lethal inflammation in sepsis, the role for CD86 remains conflicted. Overall, CD86 appears to exert a protective role, especially in the context of CD80 inhibition. This is supported by the antagonistic effects of CD86 blockade/deletion on survival in the setting of CD80 blockade. A potentially beneficial/protective role for CD86 is further supported by our human observations that persistence of CD86 expression is associated with improved outcome. This finding is consistent with a prior study showing reduced levels of CD86 mRNA in lethal pediatric septic shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Wong1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the modest survival benefit associated with <underline>isolated</underline> CD86 blockade/deletion suggests that some of these protective effects may be modulated by CD80 as well. The reason for the predilection of CD80 for lethality and CD86 for protection may lie in their relative affinities and binding kinetics for their ligands, CD28 and CTLA4, with CD80 having a relative higher affinity for CTLA4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Sharpe1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-vanderMerwe1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Sansom1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Linsley1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus we cannot discount a potentially protective role for a CTLA4-CD86 interaction which is unmasked by the absence of CD80 in our system. This is a distinct possibility given the ability of CTLA4 to both inhibit CD28 engagement as well as direct induce signaling, including induction of tryptophan catabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Grohmann1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Investigators have also described a CD28/CTLA4 independent ligand for CD86, which may also modulate our system both signaling via the receptor and ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Mandelbrot1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Addressing both of these possibilities will be the subject of further studies. Finally, it is highly probable, that the role of CD86 may indeed be tissue compartment specific. In our previous study, we noticed differential regulation of CD86 in blood (down regulation) and peritoneal lavage (upregulation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Nolan1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. This most likely explains the differential cytokine response, especially IL-10, between these differing compartments. However, we are still unable to provide a mechanism for this differential compartment specific regulation.</p><p>However, there are many important limitations to our study. Most notably is the use of a highly lethal form of polymicrobial sepsis in our murine model. It is well established that there are multiple phases to the immune response in sepsis, with the early phases dominated by massive pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and the latter phase by immunoparalysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Hotchkiss1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006600-Schwulst1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. It is likely, that during the transition to these latter stages, a more prominent role for CD86 could be observed. In addition, the mechanism for loss of CD86 expression also remains incompletely understood. Whether this results in a true loss of expression or recruitment of additional low expressing CD86 monocytes from the bone marrow is also unclear. Future studies will be required to address these questions. Finally, while our data now suggest IRAK-M may be capable of differentially regulating CD80 and CD86 mediated cellular activation, there are still multiple limitations to this data. Most notably, is we can not explain the reason for the differential affinity for CD80 and CD86 for IRAK-M under resting or stimulated conditions. Understanding the reasons for this and the true biological significance of this association will be the subject of future studies detailing all members of the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling complex.</p><p>In conclusion, we document a pivotal role for CD28-CD80 interaction in regulating the lethality of the acute phases of sepsis and septic shock. This occurs predominantly through the interaction between CD80 and CD28. These data suggest that any future therapies targeting this system in sepsis be directed specifically at CD80.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0006600-Angus1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Angus</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Linde-Zwirble</surname><given-names>WT</given-names></name><name><surname>Lidicker</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Clermont</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Carcillo</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>2001</year><article-title>Epidemiology of severe sepsis in the United States: analysis of incidence, outcome, and associated costs of care.</article-title><source>Crit Care Med</source><volume>29</volume><fpage>1303</fpage><lpage>1310</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11445675</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0006600-Hotchkiss1"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hotchkiss</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name><name><surname>Karl</surname><given-names>IE</given-names></name></person-group><year>2003</year><article-title>The pathophysiology and treatment of sepsis.</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><volume>348</volume><fpage>138</fpage><lpage>150</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12519925</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0006600-Martin1"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name><name><surname>Mannino</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Eaton</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Moss</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><year>2003</year><article-title>The epidemiology of sepsis in the United States from 1979 through 2000.</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><volume>348</volume><fpage>1546</fpage><lpage>1554</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12700374</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0006600-Abraham1"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abraham</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Anzueto</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Gutierrez</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Tessler</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>San Pedro</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><year>1998</year><article-title>Double-blind randomised controlled trial of monoclonal antibody to human tumour necrosis factor in treatment of septic shock.
