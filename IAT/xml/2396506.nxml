Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mice, harboring defects in nucleotide excision repair and transcription due to a mutation in the Xpd gene (R722W), display severe symptoms of premature aging but have a reduced incidence of cancer. To gain further insight into the molecular basis of the mutant-specific manifestation of age-related phenotypes, we used comparative microarray analysis of young and old female livers to discover gene expression signatures distinguishing Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mice from their age-matched wild type controls. We found a transcription signature of increased apoptosis in the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mice, which was confirmed by in situ immunohistochemical analysis and found to be accompanied by increased proliferation. However, apoptosis rate exceeded the rate of proliferation, resulting in homeostatic imbalance. Interestingly, a metabolic response signature was observed involving decreased energy metabolism and reduced IGF-1 signaling, a major modulator of life span. We conclude that while the increased apoptotic response to endogenous DNA damage contributes to the accelerated aging phenotypes and the reduced cancer incidence observed in the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mice, the signature of reduced energy metabolism is likely to reflect a compensatory adjustment to limit the increased genotoxic stress in these mutants. These results support a general model for premature aging in DNA repair deficient mice based on cellular responses to DNA damage that impair normal tissue homeostasis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is a highly complex process characterized by functional decline, reduced reproductive capacity and an increase in the likelihood of disease and death.

Global genome NER (GG-NER) operates genome-wide and is important for preventing mutations. Transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER), on the other hand, eliminates lesions that block the transcription machinery, thus helping to repair those genes that are currently active. Mice completely devoid of GG-NER, as in Xpa knock out mice, are similar to human xeroderma pigmentosum patients and show increased susceptibility to UV-induced skin cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-deVries1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, but no obvious signs of premature aging. However, two other NER-related disorders, Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) and Cockayne Syndrome (CS), display prominent symptoms of accelerated aging, which is reflected by the corresponding mouse models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-deBoer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-vanderHorst1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The XPD gene encodes the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; DNA helicase subunit of basal transcription factor TFIIH, which is involved in both GG- and TCR-NER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-Hoeijmakers1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Complete inactivation of the XPD helicase is not viable in the mouse or in cells. Mice carrying a trichothiodystrophy (TTD) type of mutation (R722W) in the Xpd gene revealed a striking correspondence with the complex pleiotropic human phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-deBoer1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. This includes the hallmark of the disorder, reduction of hair-specific cysteine-rich matrix proteins resulting in brittle hair, but also growth delay, reduced fertility and life span, loss of subcutaneous fat, and UV sensitivity. At the level of DNA repair the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutation causes a partial defect in both GG-NER and TC-NER. In addition, the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> causes a defect in general transcription resulting in 60&#x02013;70&#x00025; reduction of basal transcription in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-Dubaele1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The phenotype of Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mice not only mimics that of the human disease, TTD, but is also reminiscent of segmental premature aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-deBoer2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-Wijnhoven1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Apart from reduced body and organ weight, age-related pathology was found to be most prominent in liver, kidney, bones, and lymphoid tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-Wijnhoven1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. These include lipofuscin accumulation, intranuclear inclusions, and hepatocellular atrophy in the liver; karyomegaly, tubular dilatation, and hyaline glomerulopathy in the kidney; lymphoid depletion in the spleen and thymus; aortic sarcopenia; and osteoporosis femur. Unexpectedly, these premature aging features are accompanied by phenotypes that are normally observed after caloric restriction (CR), the only intervention known to extend life span and delay many aspects of aging in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-Masoro1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. These include a lower incidence and/or severity of cancer, cataract, ulcerative dermatitis, hypodermal fat, nerve demyelination, thyroid follicular distension, and inflammation in various organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-Wijnhoven1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. It is thus an open question as to how the mechanisms that lead to accelerated aging in the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> coexist with the pathways that extend life span and delay age-associated pathology in CR mice.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the impact of the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutation on the physiology of the liver, using global microarray gene expression analysis. Liver was selected for this analysis because as the central metabolic organ of the body it is a major target of oxidative DNA damage, a postulated cause of aging, and suffers from some prominent aging-related pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-Wijnhoven1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The results indicate apoptosis-related genes as a prominent gene expression signature associated with the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutation. This was confirmed by the direct demonstration of increased apoptosis, which was accompanied by increased proliferation. However, apoptosis rate exceeded the rate of proliferation, resulting in homeostatic imbalance. Somewhat surprisingly, this homeostatic imbalance of apoptosis and cell renewal in the liver was found to be associated with gene expression profiles pointing towards a metabolic response involving decreased energy metabolism and reduced IGF-1 signaling, normally associated with delayed aging and increased life span. The data presented here support the hypothesis that the homeostatic imbalance between cell loss and cell renewal underlies premature aging in the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mice through a complex interplay between cellular responses and compensatory metabolic adjustments to increased genotoxic stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Expression profiling of Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutant liver</title><p>To gain insight into the molecular basis of the mutant-specific manifestation of age-related phenotypes, we used comparative microarray analysis of young (3 months) and old (20 months) female livers to discover gene expression signatures distinguishing Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mice from their age-matched wild type controls, using custom long-oligonucleotide (70-mer) DNA microarrays containing 16,463 genes. We chose liver because it is a central metabolic organ of the body and plays a key role in whole-body energy metabolism through the integrated control of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. We identified a total of 417 genes (182 up-regulated, 235 down-regulated) at young age and 656 genes (312 up-regulated, 344 down-regulated) at old age, which were significantly different between the mutant and wild type. The complete lists of these genes are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002346.s002">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002346.s003">S2</xref>. We selected genes with a diverse range of fold change (from 1.3 to 7) for our validation studies using qRT-PCR. Of the 31 genes tested, all genes produced gene expression patterns consistent with the microarray data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002346.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The microarray data clearly underestimated the gene expression fold changes when compared with the qRT-PCR analysis, as almost all of the genes show more dramatic fold changes in gene expression according to the qRT-PCR than with the microarray data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002346.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Despite the underestimation of fold change, the strong correlation between results from microarray and qRT-PCR indicate that the data obtained from the microarray analysis are highly reliable.</p><p>Gene Ontology (GO) annotation using GoMiner software identified functional categories that were significantly over-represented in the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> livers (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002346.s004">Tables S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002346.s005">S4</xref> for the complete list). At young age, major GO categories included cell death, defense/immune response, oxidoreductase activity, and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002346-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The behavior of genes in some of these major categories shows a significant unidirectional tendency to be either mostly upregulated or mostly down-regulated (see Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002346.s004">Table S3</xref>). For example, at young age, among the genes in the GO category of cell death, significant over-representations of up-regulated genes were prominent for the categories of apoptosis (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.02) and induction of apoptosis (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.04). Similarly, over-representation of genes involved in defense response (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.04) was mostly due to significant over-representation of up-regulated genes in the sub-category of immune response (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.03) rather than over-representation of down-regulated genes in this sub-category (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.34). Especially over-representation of up-regulated genes in the sub-categories of acute-phase response (p&#x0003c;0.0001) and humoral immune response (p&#x0003c;0.001) was highly significant. Likewise, genes involved in the category of oxidoreductase activity were over-represented by significant down-regulation of genes in the sub-categories of monooxygenase activity (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.01) and transferase activity (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.02). Moreover, genes involved in the category of lipid metabolism were over-represented by significant down-regulation of genes in the sub-categories of fatty acid metabolism (p&#x0003c;0.001) and lipid/steroid biosynthesis (p&#x0003c;0.001).</p><fig id="pone-0002346-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002346.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Biological characterization of the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> global gene expression profile in liver.</title><p>(A) Selected Gene Ontology categories of significant changes in the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutant mice compared to the wild type at 3 months (young).

Old Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> livers showed trends very similar to their young counterparts, except that the genes under the category of defense/immune response were significantly down-regulated (p&#x0003c;0.001) and up-regulation of genes in this same category was not significant (p&#x0003e;0.9). Down-regulation of genes involved in the sub-categories of antigen presentation (p&#x0003c;0.001) and humoral immune response (p&#x0003c;0.001) was highly significant, the opposite direction as in their young-counterparts. Although not significantly over-represented as a category in GO analysis (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.52), a total of 27 genes in the category of apoptosis were differentially regulated at old age in the liver of Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mice compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002346.s006">Table S5</xref>).</p><p>Complex phenotypes are controlled by the dynamic actions of thousands of genes. While GO analysis offers tremendous value, it also has limitations, such as the lack of direct association with pathways. Global organization of genes into pathways and their interactions can be identified through construction of genomic networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-Fraser1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. To analyze functional pathways that are co-coordinately regulated and that may contribute to premature aging phenotypes associated with the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutation, we further analyzed microarray expression data using PathwayAssist (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Several functionally linked clusters of gene interactions altered in the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> liver in comparison to age-matched wild type controls were identified. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002346-g001">Figure 1C</xref> shows an example of the comparison between the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutant and wild type controls at old age. We observed clustering of genes into four integrated modules: lipid metabolism, defense/immune response, electron transport and cell signaling/cell proliferation. In keeping with the GO analysis, of these clusters lipid metabolism was mostly down-regulated in the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutant liver. Interestingly, the pathway analysis pointed towards PPAR&#x003b1; as a major regulator responsible for the coordinated down-regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism in the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutant liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002346-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly the pathway analysis also revealed the signature of IGF1 resistance in the liver, namely up-regulation of IGF1R and IGFBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-Papaconstantinou1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, in the cell signaling/cell proliferation cluster. At young age, lipid metabolism module was prominent, whereas the functional clusters of other modules were not immediately apparent by the pathway analysis (results not shown).</p><p>Thus, we identified a series of interacting genes, which constitute differential regulation of potentially important signaling pathways, as characteristic of the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutant liver. Of these pathways, since up-regulation of apoptosis has been considered as a causal factor in premature aging phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-Suh1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, we directly quantified the frequency of apoptotic cells in Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutant liver (see below). In addition, we further explored the down-regulation of IGF1 signals, which could possibly explain the observed decrease in lipid and energy metabolism consistently found in Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutant liver. Of note, down-regulation of IGF1 signaling is linked to extension but not shortening of life span across multiple species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-Bartke1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and could possibly explain the CR symptoms that are also part of the Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-Wijnhoven1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Apoptosis and cell renewal in the liver of Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutant mice</title><p>Apoptosis, a major cellular response to DNA damage, is known to be regulated at the post-transcriptional level through activation of protein cascades, especially the core apoptotic machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-Desagher1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Surprisingly, however, GO analysis highlighted the functional categories of genes related to apoptosis as significantly over-represented in young but not in old Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutants compared to the wild type controls. These include upregulation of genes under the category of apoptosis (TNFRSF6 (FAS), TNFRSF3 (LTBR), TRAF1, F2, EIF5A. CLU, C9, CSTB, CEBPB, DSIP1, APOE, TDE1, IL18) and down-regulation of genes under the subcategory of anti-apoptosis (PRLR, TGFB1, VEGFA) suggesting that the induction of apoptosis may occur through the expression of pro-apoptotic genes and the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes in the liver of Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutants at young age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002346.s006">Table S5</xref>).

Apoptosis was among a few functional categories that were over-represented, due to the up-regulation of genes in the category at young age.

Subsequent validation of this finding, using in situ immunohistochemistry indicated a dramatic increase in apoptosis in liver of Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutant mice at both young and old age, concomitant with activation of p53.

The set also included randomized oligonucleotides and bacterial sequences as negative control and multiple sequenced of sets of house-keeping genes as positive control. Oligonucleotides were spotted on Corning UltraGAPS slides in 3&#x000d7; SSC buffer, using a GeneMachines OmniGrid (Genomic Solutions, MI, USA) microarray printer, and a Qiagen BioRobot 3000 liquid handler (LabX, ON, Canada) to manage oligonucleotide libraries (Operon Biotechnologies, AL, USA). For each experimental sample, Cy3-labeled mutant sample and Cy5-labled wild type sample were co-hybridized to a spotted microarray. In each comparison, dye was swapped and co-hybridized to another microarray. Hybridization was conducted in Lucidea SlidePro (Amersham Biosciences, CA, USA) automated hybridization station. Following hybridization, microarrays was imaged using an Axon GenePix 4000 microarray scanner (Axon Instrument, CA, USA). Image analysis was carried out using the software Spot, a software package for the analysis of microarray images to extract spot intensity data from 16-bit tiff image files. Quality measurement of arrays was carried out using Marray, a package for diagnostic plots and normalization of microarray data in Bioconductor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org">www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>), to assess quality.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Microarray data analysis</title><p>Linear Models for Microarray Data Package (Limma, Bioconductor) was used for data analysis. Within Limma, minimum background correction and print-tip loess normalization was performed for each array to remove intensity-dependent dye bias and spatial effect. Differential expression of genes was determined using an empirical Bayes (EB) approach within Limma. Fold difference was calculated from the estimated log ratio. We computed moderated t-statistics, log-odds ratios of differential expression (based on empirical Bayes shrinkage of the standard errors towards a common value), and adjusted p-values (obtained using the Bonferroni correction) using functions in the limma library of the Bioconductor software package. After EB analysis within Limma, genes was ranked as being differentially expressed in decreasing order of the B-statistic (essentially the log-odds of differential expression) and cut-off for significance was determined through volcano plots. To identify functional pathways that significantly alter Gene Ontology (GO) annotations was assigned using GoMiner. This tool identifies GO categories of genes that are significantly over-represented relative to overall proportion of all altered genes to the total number of genes on microarray, using two-tailed Fisher's exact test. Since a particular protein may function in several processes, may contain domains that carry out diverse molecular functions, and may be active in multiple locations in the cell, single genes were redundantly associated with multiple GO categories. Since Gominer does not take multiple testing into consideration, we also used three other software applications for GO annotation, Gostat, GoToolBox, and EASE, to identify the GO categories that stay over-represented after multiple testing. Complex phenotypes are controlled by the dynamic actions of thousands of genes. While GO offers tremendous value, it also has limitations, such as the lack of direct association with pathways. Global organization of genes into pathways and their interactions can be identified through construction of genomic networks. To analyze functional pathways that are coordinately regulated, the gene list generated by microarray analysis was analyzed using PathwayAssist software (Ariadne Genomics, Rockville, MD, USA), which is a software tool to generate biological association network. It allows for the identification and visualization of pathways, gene regulation networks and protein interaction maps. The software program utilizes a natural language processor to extract information from databases such as Pub Med to provide direct associations and graphically identify all known relationships between the differentially expressed genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Microarray experimental design</title><p>To identify the biochemical and metabolic pathways that are altered in the liver of Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutant, we compared the gene expression profiles between Xpd<sup>TTD</sup> mutant and wild type. Our experimental design involved direct pair-wise comparison between mutant and wild type at young age (3 months, 5 individuals per group) including a dye swap comparison (a total of 10 slides). For old age (20 months) we had 3 individuals available per group. Since this reduced number of animals would lead to a loss of power, both due to animal-to-animal variation and a smaller number of replicates, to compensate for the latter, we compared all possible combinations between mutant and wild type animals, including dye swap experiments (a total of 18 slides). Agreement among the technical replicates was high, with correlation coefficient r<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.88. The statistical cut off at old young age was p&#x0003c;0.01 when adjusted for multiple testing (B&#x0003e;0), while at old age the cut off was much more stringent (p&#x0003c;1E-7, B&#x0003e;10) as we had 6 technical duplicates in each sample as compared to 2 technical duplicates at young age, artificially lowering the standard error.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Real-time quantitative PCR</title><p>The ABI Prism 7900HT system was used for amplification and data collection. All reactions were run using a ready to use primer and probe set predesigned by Applied Biosystems (Assay-on demand Gene Expression Product). Reactions were carried out in a total volume of 10 &#x000b5;l. Each reaction contained 5 &#x000b5;l of 2&#x000d7; Master Mix, 800 nM of each primer, dH<sub>2</sub>O, and 2 &#x000b5;l of cDNA template. A pre-incubation step of 10 min at 95&#x000b0;C to activate the AmpliTaq DNA Gold<bold>&#x000ae;</bold><sup> DNA</sup> polymerase was followed by 40 amplification cycles. Each cycle consisted of a 15 s denaturation step at 95&#x000b0;C and an annealing/extension step for 1 min at 60&#x000b0;C. A disassociation step to detect non-specific amplification was added to the end of the run. The PCR raw data was analyzed using Applied Biosystems SDS v2.0 software. We tested samples from the five mutant and five wild type control mice at young (13 weeks) age and three mutant and three wild type control mice at old age (20 months). The C<sub>T</sub> value for each biological replicate represents the average of three technical replicates. The relative amounts of specifically amplified cDNAs were calculated with the comparative threshold cycle (&#x00394;&#x00394;C<sub>T</sub>) method. Beta-actin was used as a normalizer.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Tissue arrays and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Livers were removed, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned. For tissue array construction, a H&#x00026;E-stained tissue section was made from each donor block to define representative regions. Two core tissue biopsies were taken from individual paraffin-embedded liver samples (donor blocks) and arranged in a new recipient paraffin block (tissue array block) using a trephine apparatus (Superbiochips Laboratories, Seoul, Korea). Each tissue array block contained up to 60 samples. Sections of 4 &#x000b5;m were cut from each tissue array block, deparaffinized and dehydrated. Immunohistochemical detection of apoptosis was carried out using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Boehringer Mannheim) following the procedures provided by the manufacturer as described before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-Suh2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were dewaxed and rehydrated according to standard protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002346-PorteraCailliau1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> and then treated with proteinase K (20 &#x000b5;g/ml in 10 mM Tris pH 7.4) for 15 min at 30&#x000b0;C. After rinsing the slides with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the sections were incubated with a blocking solution (0.3&#x00025; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol) for 1 hr at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, the sections were incubated in a permeabilization solution (0.1&#x00025; Triton X-100 in 0.1&#x00025; sodium citrate) for 2 min at 4&#x000b0;C. After rinsing twice with PBS, the sections were incubated with 50 &#x000b5;l TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 hr at 37&#x000b0;C, 50 &#x000b5;l Converter-POD for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C, and 100 &#x000b5;l DAB-substrate solution for 2 min at room temperature, where the sections were rinsed three times with PBS between each step. The slide was analyzed under a light microscope. The number of apoptotic cells was scored from pictures of six images made from two core biopsies from an individual animal with three animals per age group per genotype, and average numbers of apoptotic cells from two different slides were plotted against time genotype and age. Immunohistochemical staining against p53 &#x0005b;1&#x02236;100; IC12, #2524 (Cell Signaling Technology, USA)&#x0005d; and Caspase-3 &#x0005b;1&#x02236;100; #9661 (Cell Signaling Technology)&#x0005d; was performed using a streptavidin peroxidase procedure. After deparaffinization and rehydration, tissue sections were treated three times with microwaves in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 5 min each time. The sections were then immersed in methanol containing 0.3&#x00025; hydrogen peroxidase for 6 min to block the endogenous peroxidase activity, and incubated in 2.5&#x00025; blocking serum to reduce non-specific binding. After incubation with primary antibodies, the sections were incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG and avitin&#x02013;biotin peroxidase (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and visualized using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. Two antibodies among various commercially available antibodies were selected after the test procedure using a human control slide for immunohistochemistry (Superbiochips Laboratories). Statistical analysis was performed in SAS (version 9.01) using the Npar1 way procedure. The Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test with the EXACT p-value option was utilized for significance test.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>ELISAs for Mouse IGF-1, IGFBP-1, and -3</title><p>The levels of murine IGF-1, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-3 were measured using in-house enzyme-linked immunoassays. Mouse recombinant IGF-1, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-3 protein standards, monoclonal antibodies and biotinylated polyclonal antibodies were purchased from R&#x00026;D systems (Minneapolis, MN). Microtiter plates were obtained from Nalge Nunc International (Rochester, NY). Streptavidin-HRP conjugate, o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) and hydrogen peroxide substrate were purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Ninety-six well microtiter plates were coated with capture antibody at pH 7.4, incubated overnight at room temperature on a shaker, then washed 3 times with PBS/Tween-20 followed by incubation with blocking buffer and 3 final washes. Recombinant mouse protein standards were diluted in sample buffer in concentrations ranging from 0 to 250 ng/ml. For IGF-1 assay, the serum samples were pre-extracted with acid/ethanol reagent (12.5&#x00025; 2N HCl and 87.5&#x00025; ethanol), neutralized with 1M Tris base and diluted with assay buffer. For IGFBP assays, serum samples were pre-diluted 10&#x02013;400-fold prior to assay. Standards, controls or diluted samples were incubated at room temperature for 2 hour on shaker. The wells were washed 3 times with wash buffer followed by the addition of detection antibody and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. The wells were then washed 3 times and streptavidin-HRP conjugate was added and further incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After 4 washes, 100 &#x000b5;l of OPD (1 mg/ml in hydrogen peroxide substrate) was added to each well and incubated for additional 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 &#x000b5;l of 2N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and the absorbance was determined at 490 nm in a plate reader (Molecular Design, Sunnyvale, CA). The standard curve was analyzed using 4-parameter logistic curve-fit. The IGF-1 assay has a sensitivity of 0.1 ng/ml. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient of variations were &#x0003c;10&#x00025; in the range from 1 to 10 ng/ml. IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-3 assays have a sensitivity of 0.2 ng/ml. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient of variations were &#x0003c;6&#x00025; and &#x0003c;8&#x00025;, respectively, in the range from 1 to 6 ng/ml.</p></sec></sec><sec
