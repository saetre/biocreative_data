It has been estimated that &#x0223c;100&#x02009;000 modifications occur daily in the DNA of a single cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In order to remove damage and to maintain the integrity of the genome, different DNA repair pathways have evolved. The major repair pathway protecting cells against a single-base DNA damage is base excision repair (BER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), although other pathways such as nucleotide excision repair and methyltransferase-mediated error-free repair are also involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). BER is often initiated by a damage type specific DNA glycosylase that cleaves the <italic>N</italic>-glycosydic bond of the damaged base, leaving an apurinic/apyrimidinic site, also referred to as an abasic site or apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Subsequently, AP endonuclease 1 (APE 1) cleaves the sugar-phosphate backbone at the 5&#x02032;-side of the AP site resulting in 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl and 5&#x02032;-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) groups flanking a one-nucleotide gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (Pol &#x003b2;) inserts a first nucleotide into the gap, leaving nicked DNA with a 5&#x02032;-dRP flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). At this point, the repair can be accomplished via two different BER sub-pathways depending on the nature of the AP site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In case of regular AP sites, Pol &#x003b2; removes the 5&#x02032;-dRP group through its associated dRP-lyase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), and the resulting nick is sealed by the DNA ligase III/XRCC1 complex. This sub-pathway is referred to as short-patch BER (SP-BER). However, if the sugar group is oxidized or reduced, Pol &#x003b2; cannot remove the 5&#x02032;-dRP moiety and repair proceeds through the alternate long-patch BER (LP-BER) sub-pathway involving removal and replacement of 2&#x02013;10 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). It has been found that, in the LP-BER pathway, the collaboration of Pol <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkl1139i1.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), replication factor C (RF-C), and flap endonuclease 1 (Fen 1) can displace the strand 3&#x02032; to the nick and synthesize up to 10 nucleotides. The resulting flap is cut by Fen 1 and the final nick is sealed by Lig I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12 B13">9&#x02013;13</xref>). However, growing evidence indicates that Pol &#x003b2; is a key enzyme in BER, that not only initiates both sub-pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) but can also perform efficient strand displacement via the &#x02018;hit and run&#x02019; mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In this model Pol &#x003b2; and Fen 1 act successively, followed by the action of Lig I.</p><p>DNA repair is coordinated with cell-cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and with DNA-damage checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). DNA-damage checkpoint pathways are activated at specific points during the cell cycle when the integrity of DNA is examined before progression to the next cell-cycle phase is allowed. The checkpoint response is a signal transduction cascade, where sensor proteins detect a lesion in the double helix and stimulate several effectors through the activity of different protein kinases. This may lead to temporary cell cycle arrest, slowing down of DNA replication, changes in the cellular transcriptional program, chromatin remodeling, induction of DNA repair genes, and occasionally to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Some of the major checkpoint proteins namely ataxia telangectasia mutated protein (ATM), ATM-related protein (ATR), ATR interacting protein (ATRIP), Rad17, Rad9, Rad1, and Hus1, are thought to be involved in sensing and triggering DNA repair processes. Among those, the three human proteins Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1 form a heterotrimeric complex (the 9-1-1 complex) which exhibits structural similarity with the homotrimeric clamp formed by PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). The 9-1-1 complex has been characterized as a sensor of DNA damage and is targeted to damage sites following genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24 B25 B26 B27">22&#x02013;27</xref>). In addition, Rad17 associates with the four small subunits of the heteropentameric RF-C complex in a manner similar to the RF-C complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28 B29 B30">28&#x02013;30</xref>). Several studies showed that the 9-1-1 complex and Rad17-RF-C<sub>2-5</sub> function as a clamp/clamp&#x02013;loader pair, similarly to PCNA and RF-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Moreover, the 9-1-1 complex, Rad17-RF-C<sub>2&#x02212;5</sub> and PCNA co-localize in foci formed upon DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). These data suggested a mechanism in which Rad17- RF-C<sub>2&#x02212;5</sub> would recognize DNA lesions, allowing the recruitment of the 9-1-1 complex to those sites. ATM and ATR kinases are recruited simultaneously to the same sites of DNA damage but in a 9-1-1 complex and Rad17-RFC<sub>2&#x02212;5</sub> independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The current model suggests that the 9-1-1 complex may facilitate the recruitment of the checkpoint effector kinase Chk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) that is subsequently phosphorylated by the ATR/ATM kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Additionally, it has been recently proposed by two different groups, that the 9-1-1 complex and the Rad17&#x02013;RFC<sub>2&#x02212;5</sub> alternative clamp loader could stabilize stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>Recently several new links between DNA damage checkpoints and various DNA repair processes have been discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Moreover, recent investigations showed several possible connections between the human 9-1-1 complex and the BER pathway (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). First, a physical and functional interaction of the 9-1-1 complex with Pol &#x003b2; revealed that the 9-1-1 complex has a specific stimulatory effect on Pol &#x003b2; activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Pol &#x003b2; stimulation resulted in an increase in its affinity for the primer-template. Interaction with the 9-1-1 complex stimulated DNA strand displacement synthesis raising the possibility that the 9-1-1 complex might attract Pol &#x003b2; to DNA-damage sites, thus connecting directly checkpoints and DNA repair. Very recently, we showed that the 9-1-1 complex interacts with and stimulates Lig I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). In addition, similar physical and functional interactions with the 9-1-1 complex were identified for Fen 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) and for the MutY DNA glycosylase homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). In summary, these results suggested that the 9-1-1 complex could act as a recruiting platform for different factors involved in LP-BER. </p><p>In order to get more insight into the functional consequences of these interactions, we have reconstituted LP-BER <italic>in vitro</italic> by using a duplex oligonucleotide substrate containing a lesion (a tetrahydrofuran (THF) moiety) that mimics a reduced AP site and the four human proteins APE 1, Pol &#x003b2;, Fen 1, and Lig I. Our results suggest for the first time that the 9-1-1 complex specifically stimulates the endonuclease activity of APE 1 in a single-enzyme assay as well as in the reconstituted LP-BER <italic>in vitro.</italic> Further analysis revealed that the 9-1-1 complex physically interacts with APE 1 <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also present evidence that the 9-1-1 complex specifically stimulates LP-BER <italic>in vitro</italic> through the stimulation of strand displacement activity of Pol &#x003b2;. Importantly, under conditions applied in the reconstituted LP-BER assay, we could not detect any effect of the 9-1-1 complex on the enzymatic activities of Fen 1 and Lig I. Our data suggest that in a reconstituted LP-BER <italic>in vitro</italic> system, a hierarchy of interactions between the 9-1-1 complex and the components of the LP-BER repairosome exists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>[&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (3000&#x02009;Ci/mmol), [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]dTTP (3000&#x02009;Ci/mmol) and Sephadex G-25 spin column were from Amersham Biosciences; unlabeled dNTPs were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

Therefore, our aim was to determine if the 9-1-1 complex could also stimulate the complete repair of an abasic site through the stimulation of different components of LP-BER. To address this question, we first reconstituted LP-BER <italic>in vitro</italic> using a set of the four different protein components APE 1, Pol&#x003b2;, Fen 1, and Lig I, all of which were highly purified from recombinant sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). First they were tested for their enzymatic activities as described in &#x02018;Material and Methods&#x02019;. As a substrate for all repair reactions we used a 100&#x02009;bp oligonucleotide duplex containing a THF moiety at the position 43, which resembles a reduced abasic site (AP site) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The requirement of the different components of LP-BER was tested as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B. In this experiment we used a THF-containing substrate labeled at its 5&#x02032; end. For this reason the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> lane 8) and the product of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> lane 7) showed the same migration. However, when deoxyribonucleotides or Pol &#x003b2; were absent from the reaction (lane 2 and 4, respectively) the product corresponded to the DNA substrate cleaved by APE 1. Subsequently, the reaction performed in the absence of Fen 1 showed an efficient strand displacement synthesis performed by Pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> lane 5). However, the resulting flap-structure intermediates could not be ligated by Lig I to generate the fully repaired product. When Lig I was excluded from the reaction mixture, Pol &#x003b2; synthesized up to 6 nucleotides, which led to the generation of the flap structure, subsequently removed by Fen 1 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 6). This limited DNA synthesis (compare lanes 5 and 6) reflects the effect of Fen 1 on Pol &#x003b2; strand displacement synthesis, illustrating the previously described so-called &#x02018;hit and run&#x02019; mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Surprisingly, incubation of the substrate with all four protein components but without addition of ATP resulted in the complete repair of the damaged strand even though ATP is known to be required for Lig I activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 1). The explanation for this observation is that a fraction of Lig I used in this assay might have been purified in its pre-adenylated form, thus allowing ligation to occur in the absence of ATP. As expected, omission of APE 1 resulted in the absence of cleavage and of the subsequent LP-BER reaction. This results show that the reconstituted LP-BER reaction is dependent on the presence and proper activity of all required enzymatic components, hence demonstrating that all the steps of the reconstituted reaction are functional. Incubation of the oligonucleotide substrate in the reaction buffer alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 8) or with addition of the maximal amount of the 9-1-1 complex used in the study, did not show any enzymatic contamination of the purified 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp. </p></sec><sec><title>Fine-tuning of the different steps of long patch base excision repair <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Next, in order to study the effect of the 9-1-1 complex on the LP-BER machinery, each protein component was titrated against all the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This allowed us to determine the amount of enzyme that significantly reduces repair at any given step, therefore serving as a limiting factor of the total reaction. First, the repair was performed by adding increasing amounts of APE 1 to the reaction mixture, which contained saturating amounts of Pol &#x003b2;, Fen 1 and Lig I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). In order to avoid the problem of the substrate and the BER reaction product running at the same position on the gel, the substrate remained unlabeled in this experiment, and the repair was visualized by the incorporation of [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P] dTTP, the first nucleotide incorporated opposite A after the lesion. The minimal amount of APE 1 that incised the damaged strand and allowed repair to take place although at a low level, was 14-fold lower than the amount of enzyme required for the complete repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, compare 5 and 55&#x02009;fmols). Incubation of 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P labeled substrate with saturating amounts of APE 1, Fen 1, and Lig I and increasing amounts of Pol &#x003b2; then allowed determining the amount of enzyme performing a limited strand displacement DNA synthesis (15&#x02009;fmol, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). That was approximately 4-fold less as compared with the amount of Pol &#x003b2; used to obtain complete repair (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, 50&#x02009;fmols). To determine the fine-tuning of Fen 1 and Lig1 activities in LP-BER, both enzymes were titrated in the presence of 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P labeled substrate. All the proteins were present in saturating amounts in the reaction mixture except of Fen 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C) and Lig I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D), respectively. For further experiments we chose amounts of Fen 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, compare 20 and 100&#x02009;fmols) and Lig I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, compare 25 and 250&#x02009;fmols) that were 10-fold decreased as compared with the level required for the complete LP-BER. </p></sec><sec><title>The Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complex specifically stimulates the endonuclease activity of APE 1 without encircling the DNA substrate</title><p>Previous studies have shown that the 9-1-1 complex stimulates the activities of Pol &#x003b2;, Fen 1, and Lig I on the substrates that mimic transient intermediates of the respective steps of LP-BER. We sought to determine whether the 9-1-1 complex exerts the same effect on the activity of APE 1. Incubation of 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P labeled, THF-containing substrate with APE 1 and increasing amounts of the 9-1-1 complex led to a 6-fold stimulation of the APE 1 endonuclease activity, as shown by the accumulation of APE 1 cleavage product (42 nucleotides) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, 45 and 450&#x02009;fmols and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Moreover, in control experiments this stimulation was not observed when the substrate and APE 1 were incubated with increasing amounts of either PCNA or BSA, thus confirming the specificity of this stimulation (data not shown). Next we tested whether the loading of the 9-1-1 complex onto DNA is necessary for the observed stimulatory effect. It has been shown that 9-1-1 complex can be loaded onto DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> in a Rad17-RFC<sub>(2&#x02212;5)</sub> dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). In order to determine if the 9-1-1 complex has to encircle DNA to stimulate APE 1 activity, we used a THF-containing substrate with both ends blocked with biotin. Efficient blockage of the ends was checked in a pol &#x003b4; stimulation assay in the presence of PCNA, and resulted in a complete abolishment of PCNA dependent pol &#x003b4; activity (data not shown). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, incubation of 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P labeled, blocked substrate with APE 1 and increasing amounts of the 9-1-1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, 45 and 900&#x02009;fmols) led to a similar extent of APE 1 stimulation as compared with the reactions performed in the presence of unblocked substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Thus, we concluded that the loading of the checkpoint clamp onto DNA is not required to stimulate APE 1 endonuclease cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>The 9-1-1 complex physically interacts with APE 1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Next, in order to assess the relevance of the observed stimulation of APE 1 by the 9-1-1 complex, we investigated the physical interaction of the two proteins. We first performed pulldown experiments in order to determine whether the two proteins interact specifically and directly <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). By incubation of APE 1-bound sepharose beads with purified 9-1-1 complex, we were able to show that the 9-1-1 complex was interacting with APE 1 as Rad9, Rad1 and Hus1 were detected in the pulled-down fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, left panel). Next, to confirm these data, his-9-1-1 complex was incubated together with APE 1 followed by binding of the 9-1-1 complex to Ni<sup>2+</sup> beads via the his-Rad9 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, right panel). We were first able to show that the three subunits hisRad9, Rad1, and Hus1, indeed form a complex under those conditions, as the three subunits were co-precipitated with the Ni<sup>2+</sup> beads in the presence or absence of APE 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, right panel and data not shown), although only Rad9 possessed a his-tag. In this pulldown, APE 1 was also co-precipitated with the 9-1-1 complex. Hence, these results demonstrate for the first time a direct physical interaction of the 9-1-1 complex with APE 1. </p><p>We next investigated whether APE 1 was able to interact with all three subunits of the 9-1-1 complex, as previously shown for the other LP-BER proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39 B40 B41 B42 B43">39&#x02013;43</xref>). To address this question we performed pulldown experiments using his-tagged Rad1, Rad9, or Hus1 incubated with APE 1 and subsequently bound to Ni<sup>2+</sup> beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). As revealed by western-blot against APE 1, APE 1 was able to interact with the three separated subunits of the 9-1-1 complex, although with a weaker intensity for Rad1.</p><p>Finally we tested whether the interaction of the 9-1-1 complex with APE 1 could also be detected in cell extracts, in order to confirm its <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance. Indeed by performing co-immunoprecipitation with an anti-human Rad9 antibody we were able to detect APE 1 in the immuno-precipitated fraction, whereas it was not detectable in the negative control performed with un-immunized rabbit IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, bottom). The immuno-precipitation of Rad9 was checked by detecting of one of its phosphorylated forms, known to be present in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), that migrated above the heavy IgG chains, whereas the main band corresponding to the non-phosphorylated form was not visible due to its migration at the same level than the heavy IgG chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, top). In addition, the same experiment performed with HeLa cell extracts gave similar results (data not shown). We therefore concluded that the interaction of the 9-1-1 complex with APE 1 also occurs in human cells, thus supporting an <italic>in vivo</italic> role for this interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>The Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complex specifically stimulates the endonuclease activity of APE 1 in LP-BER <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Having established that APE 1 can be stimulated by the 9-1-1 complex via a direct interaction, an important question arose; namely if the 9-1-1 complex is able to enhance the activity of APE 1 directly in the reconstituted LP-BER reaction. To address this question we performed a LP-BER assay where APE 1 was the limiting factor of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, compare 4 and 70&#x02009;fmols of APE 1). Indeed, addition of increasing amounts of the 9-1-1 complex to the reaction mixture enhanced the yield of repair up to 4-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, 45&#x02013;450&#x02009;fmols). In contrast, PCNA and BSA had no significant effect on the repair efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, D and E, respectively). In addition, we tested if the blockage of the substrate ends influenced the reported stimulation. We observed that the 9-1-1 complex was able to stimulate APE 1 activity without being loaded onto DNA in the reconstituted BER reaction, as well as in the single enzyme assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>F). Thus, our results demonstrate for the first time that the 9-1-1 complex specifically stimulates LP-BER <italic>in vitro</italic> via stimulation of the endonucleolytic cleavage by APE 1. </p></sec><sec><title>The Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complex enhances the strand displacement activity of Pol <bold>&#x003b2;</bold> in long patch base excision repair <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Our next aim was to examine whether the 9-1-1 complex can influence LP-BER <italic>in vitro</italic> via stimulation of Pol &#x003b2; activity. We have previously shown that the 9-1-1 complex increases the affinity of Pol &#x003b2; for the primer-template and stimulates its DNA strand displacement activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). To test if the same effect could be observed in LP-BER, we performed a repair reaction using a 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P labeled, THF-containing substrate in the presence of limiting amounts of Pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, compare 64 and 15&#x02009;fmols of pol &#x003b2;). Addition of the 9-1-1 complex to the reaction resulted in approximately 3-fold stimulation of the Pol &#x003b2; strand displacement activity and therefore increased efficiency of the total repair. In contrast no effect was observed when PCNA and BSA were tested under the same conditions, which confirms the specificity of the reported stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B and C). </p></sec><sec><title>The Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complex has no effect of the activities of Fen 1 and Lig I in long patch base excision repair <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To further elucidate the involvement of the 9-1-1 complex in LP-BER we studied the effect of the checkpoint clamp on the activities of Fen 1 and Lig I in LP-BER <italic>in vitro</italic>. Similar to the previous experiments, we performed the LP-BER assay in the presence of limiting amounts of Fen 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A) or Lig I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). Surprisingly, under those conditions, the 9-1-1 complex was unable to stimulate the enzymatic activities of Fen 1 and Lig I in LP-BER <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, the same 9-1-1 complex used in a single enzyme assay using DNA substrates representing the corresponding LP-BER intermediates was, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), able to stimulate enzymatic activities of Fen 1 and Lig I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C and D). Thus, it appears that in the reconstituted LP-BER pathway, the 9-1-1 complex predominantly stimulates the enzymatic activities of those components of BER that act in the early steps of repair, such as APE 1 and Pol &#x003b2;, whereas the repair enzyme activities occurring during later steps, i.e. Fen 1 removal of the displaced strand or Lig I ligation, are not influenced directly by the checkpoint clamp in the presence of all the LP-BER proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A growing amount of evidence indicates that the 9-1-1 complex, initially shown to be important for the DNA damage sensing and signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), plays also a more direct role in various DNA repair processes such as nucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), double strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), translesion synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), and BER (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). In previous reports we and others have demonstrated that the 9-1-1 complex physically and functionally interacts with several important components of the BER machinery namely Pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), Fen 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), Lig I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), and the MutY DNA glycosylase homolog (MYH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). In this work we provide evidence that the 9-1-1 complex is directly involved in LP-BER. The evidence is derived from our demonstration that the 9-1-1 complex markedly stimulates a reconstituted LP-BER system <italic>in vitro</italic> and that this stimulation is due to the effect the 9-1-1 complex exerts on the enzymatic activities of the two early components of LP-BER namely APE 1 and Pol &#x003b2;.</p><p>Interestingly, we showed for the first time that the 9-1-1 complex directly interacts with APE 1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that the 9-1-1 complex specifically stimulates the APE 1 endonuclease activity on a THF-containing substrate independently of its loading onto DNA. However, it is well known that <italic>in vivo</italic>, APE 1 is a very abundant protein possessing multiple cellular functions. In addition to its role in BER, it is involved in oxidative DNA damage repair and stimulates the DNA binding activity of AP-1 (Fos, Jun) proteins as well as nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B), the polyoma virus enhancer-binding protein 2 (PEBP2), the early growth response-1 (Egr-1), Myb, members of the ATF/CREB family, the hypoxia inducible factor-1&#x003b1;(HIF-1&#x003b1;), the HIF-like factor (HLF), Pax-5, and Pax-8 [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>)]. APE 1 possesses also the major AP-1 redox activity in cells and represents a novel redox component of signal transduction cascades that regulates eukaryotic gene expression. In addition APE 1 has been implicated in the control of p53 activity through redox dependent and independent mechanisms. It has been also closely linked to apoptosis and altered levels of APE 1 have been found in some cancers. Therefore, APE 1 appears to form a link between the BER pathways, cancer, and regulation of transcription factors, oxidative signaling and cell cycle control. Hence, although APE 1 is known to be very abundant, some regulatory mechanisms must exist, that target this multifunctional enzyme in a timely and spatially regulated manner towards its required functions in specific cellular conditions. For this reason and considering our data, we hypothesize that the 9-1-1 complex may not simply stimulate APE 1 but it may also attract it to the sites of damage and target its functions towards the BER pathway. On the other hand, our efforts to determine the mechanism of stimulation of APE 1 by the 9-1-1 complex by biochemical ways remained still unsolved. First, the use of kinetic studies to address this point proved difficult, since the stimulatory effect of the 9-1-1 complex on APE1 appears to be of a complex nature and does not follow the classical rules of enzymology (e.g. reduction of the Km and/or increase of the Vmax). Second, in electro-mobility shift assays (EMSA) performed in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, addition of the 9-1-1 complex did not lead to an increase in the binding of APE 1 to a double stranded THF-containing substrate (data not shown). However, the absence of divalent cation in this experiment might create a context in which the 9-1-1 complex can not exert its stimulatory effect on APE 1, thus making it impossible to conclude whether the 9-1-1 complex does not affect the binding of APE 1 to DNA at all, or only in the system we used. More importantly we showed in this manuscript that the 9-1-1 complex interacts <italic>in vivo</italic> with APE 1 in human cells, as it has been shown previously for other LP-BER enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), thus supporting a functional role for the interaction of the 9-1-1 complex with APE 1. In addition preliminary experiments performed in our group indicated that APE 1 and the 9-1-1 complex co-localize <italic>in vivo</italic> and that this effect is enhanced upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and IR treatment (Gembka and H&#x000fc;bscher, unpublished data).</p><p>Moreover, we showed that in our <italic>in vitro</italic> system the 9-1-1 complex significantly stimulates Pol &#x003b2; strand displacement activity, which is in agreement with previously reported functional and physical interactions between these two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). However, we could not observe any effect of the 9-1-1 complex on the activities of Fen 1 and Lig I in the reconstituted LP-BER <italic>in vitro</italic>. At first sight, this suggests a strong discrepancy between our findings and previous reports indicating that the 9-1-1 complex stimulates the enzymatic activities of Fen 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) and Lig I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). However, we suggest that in our <italic>in vitro</italic> system a hierarchy of stimulation and protein&#x02013;protein interactions between the 9-1-1 complex and the BER components exists. Thus, it seems to be reasonable to speculate that the 9-1-1 complex, which functions as a sensor of DNA damage, once localized to the damage site recruits other repair proteins where their functions are necessary. This is in agreement with the reported <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction studies showing that the 9-1-1 co-immunoprecipitates with nearly all components of LP-BER (this work, 41,43,45). However, at the site of lesion, the 9-1-1 complex may exert its stimulatory effect only on the enzymatic activities of the early components of the repair machinery e.g. APE 1 and Pol &#x003b2;. This effect seems to be no longer necessary at the latter steps of repair involving the action of Fen 1 and Lig I. However, those enzymes, acting late in the BER process, are known to be stimulated by PCNA whereas this has not been shown for Pol &#x003b2; and APE 1 so far. Hence, one might speculate that after a first step of recruitment of the early repair enzymes to the lesion by the 9-1-1 complex, PCNA might be responsible for completion of the pathway through its action on the late BER enzymes. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that PCNA has also been shown to co-localize with DNA repair factories containing the 9-1-1 complex upon DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In addition the complete BER reaction involves several proteins that establish a complex network of physical and functional interactions with each other and with the 9-1-1 complex. An example of this is the recently demonstrated &#x02018;hit and run&#x02019; mechanism that shows how Fen 1 influences Pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In this context, one can assume that the effect of the 9-1-1 complex can be abolished or masked by the influence of the other proteins present in the reaction, or that the complex might be trapped by one of the enzymes present in the reaction.</p><p>On the other hand we cannot exclude that the proposed model may differ from the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation. Another striking finding we and the others observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) using <italic>in vitro</italic> systems is that encircling of the DNA substrate by the 9-1-1 complex is not required to stimulate the activities of repair enzymes. This indicates a different mechanism than in case of the PCNA ring, which absolutely requires a loading process to further stimulate Fen 1 and Lig I activities. One explanation could be that the observed stimulatory effect results from the direct protein&#x02013;protein interactions and does not involve the loading of the 9-1-1 complex in Rad17- RFC<sub>2&#x02212;5</sub> dependent manner. This is supported by the fact that APE 1, as well as Pol &#x003b2;, Fen 1, and the MutY DNA glycosylase also interact <italic>in vitro</italic> with the single subunits of the checkpoint clamp (this work, 39&#x02013;43 for details). Still, <italic>in vivo</italic> only the loading of the 9-1-1 complex onto chromatin leads to the local increase of its concentration at the damage sites, which is very important for the functions of the 9-1-1 complex in DNA damage signaling and most probably, in DNA repair.</p><p>Moreover, the tumor suppressor p53 and its downstream target p21 are other important components of DNA damage response that are directly connected to BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52 B53 B54 B55">52&#x02013;55</xref>). It has been speculated that at low level, p53 actively functions in BER whereas a high level of p53 supports a global DNA-damage response and, in cases of excessive genotoxic stress, apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). During cellular stress p53 up-regulates the expression of p21, which in turn interacts with many other proteins involved in replication, transcription, and signal transduction. In particular it binds to PCNA causing the inactivation of PCNA mediated stimulation of Fen 1, Lig I, and Pol &#x003b4; activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). Recently it has been proposed that the 9-1-1 complex may substitute for PCNA during cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). According to this hypothesis the 9-1-1 complex might act as a platform for repair proteins when the ability of PCNA to stimulate certain components of BER is reduced due to the binding to p21. Importantly, the activity of Pol &#x003b2; is not affected by PCNA but is strongly enhanced by the 9-1-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).This is in contrast to the enzymatic activity of Pol &#x003b4;, which requires PCNA but is not influenced by the 9-1-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). These properties of the two pols suggest that p21 induced by DNA damage inhibits PCNA-dependent Pol &#x003b4; activity, whereas Pol &#x003b2; remains unaffected, thus allowing LP-BER to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). On the other hand, since the 9-1-1 complex is recruited to the sites of DNA damage where it associates with various DNA damage sensors and repair proteins it may well be that it functions as a targeted response stimulator independently of the PCNA level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate for the first time that the 9-1-1 complex is directly involved in LP-BER. Under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions we showed that there is a hierarchy of stimulation by the 9-1-1 complex in the BER repairsosome and the enhancement of LP-BER activity occurs due to the specific stimulation of the two early components of repair machinery namely APE 1 and Pol &#x003b2;. Importantly, our data reflect a detailed biochemical study performed <italic>in vitro</italic> and, for the first time, an investigation of the effect of the 9-1-1 in a complex system containing several proteins. Although this system is simplified compared with the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, it provides a tool to give a better insight in understanding how the 9-1-1 complex stimulates the different steps of the LP-BER process. Moreover, we showed in this report that the 9-1-1 complex interacts <italic>in vivo</italic> with APE 1, as it has previously been shown for several other LP-BER enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Taken together the data presented in this manuscript and the previous studies performed on LP-BER and the 9-1-1 complex, directly connect the DNA damage response with DNA repair, suggesting that the 9-1-1 complex might act as a core component of this vital connection.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank M.
