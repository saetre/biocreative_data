It is one of the leading causes of blindness in adults with an incidence of around 1 in 3,500 worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Clinical manifestations include pigment deposition in the retina and attenuation of retinal blood vessels followed by atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Electroretinogram (ERG) changes are present with abnormalities of both rod and cone ERGs, but rod ERGs are more affected than cone ERGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. In advanced RP both rod and cone ERG responses are undetectable. RP can be inherited in an autosomal dominant (ad), recessive (ar), or x-linked (xl) manner, as well as in digenic, mitochondrial, or simplex patterns. Most patients with RP are isolated or sporadic with no known affected relatives, although some of these may have inheritances that are autosomal or X-linked recessive or dominant with incomplete penetrance. Despite having similar characteristics, there is a wide spectrum of clinical and genetic heterogeneity between the different modes of inheritance. RP involves nearly 37 genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sph.uth.tmc.edu/RetNet/">RetNet</ext-link>). However, this is only a partial representation of the total number of genes since it is believed that more than 60% of RP genes have yet to be identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="t1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Number of retinitis pigmentosa genes and loci</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col width="163" span="1"/><col width="163" span="1"/><col width="83" span="1"/><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mapped and identified genes<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>CA4, CRX, FSCN2, GUCA1B, IMPDH1, NR2E3, NRL, PRPF3, PRPF8, PRPF31, PRPH2, RHO, ROM1, RP1, RP9, SEMA4A, TOPORS, ABCA4, CERKL, CNGA1, CNGB1, CRB1, LRAT, MERTK, NR2E3, PDE6A, PDE6B, PRCD, PROM1, RGR, RLBP1, RPE65, SAG, TULP1, USH2A, RP2, RPGR</italic><hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mapped loci (not identified)<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RP33, RP22, RP25, RP28, RP29, RP32, RP6, RP23, RP24, RP34<hr/></td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10<hr/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" scope="row" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">47</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Tremendous research in the field of RP allowed the identification of nearly 47 genes.

These values were derived from different studies, with the highest value being found in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>] and the lowest in southern Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. However, accurate data on the frequency of RP in India is not available. To date, about 17 genes have been identified as causative of adRP. Rhodopsin (<italic>RHO)</italic> is the most frequently reported adRP gene, contributing to 20%&#x02013;25% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], followed by pre-mRNA processing factor 31 (<italic>PRPF31</italic>) (2%&#x02013;8% of adRP cases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], retinitis pigmentosa 1 (<italic>RP1</italic>) (5%&#x02013;10%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (<italic>IMPDH1</italic>) (5%&#x02013;10%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>].

Currently, treatment for RP is unavailable; however, animal models for a variety of retinal degenerations have been successfully rescued, using gene therapy approaches. Based on this success, it is anticipated that such treatments may become available for patients. Therefore, we undertook the first mutational analysis of four most frequently reported adRP genes in our patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Study participants were selected after clinical examination (retina clinic) and pedigree analysis (genetic clinic) at Sankara Nethralaya.

In the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe, <italic>RHO</italic> mutations account for 20%&#x02013;25% of all adRP cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. So far, only limited research has been performed in India on the genetics of RP hence such data was not available.</p><p>Prior to this study, only two RP-related studies have been reported using families from India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. However these studies did not report the frequency rate of <italic>RHO</italic> mutations in isolated/adRP patients. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&#x00026;Cmd=Search&#x00026;Term=%22Kumaramanickavel%20G%22%5BAuthor%5D&#x00026;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstractPlus">Kumaramanickavel</ext-link> et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] identified an <italic>RHO</italic> mutation in a family with arRP, whereas Dikshit et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>] mainly focused on the mutations reported in codons 345 and 347. In the latter study, the whole gene was not screened and 100 Indian RP patients were recruited from 76 families, irrespective of the inheritance of RP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. However, in the present study, a p.Gly106Arg mutation was detected in approximately 2% of isolated RP cases thus suggesting low frequency of <italic>RHO</italic> mutations in the Indian population. The observed low frequency of <italic>RHO</italic> mutations in the current study could be due to ethnic variation or small sample size. However since single gross deletions have also been encountered at a frequency of 0.8% in <italic>RHO</italic>, the direct sequencing based method in the current study would have failed to detect this type of mutation. Another finding is that, similar to previous reports, the same missense mutation was identified in an isolated RP patient, who clinically displayed the sectoral form of RP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>].</p><p>Two novel disease-causing changes were identified in <italic>PRPF31</italic>. Although our sample included patients from all over India, <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutations were identified only in the patients from the northern region of the country. The frameshift mutation, p.Lys120GlufsX122, was identified in an isolated RP patient. However, as the proband was not available for further analysis, we could not assess the penetrance status of the disease in the family. The second novel mutation identified was a splice site mutation, IVS6+1G/A. Upon further genetic analysis of other family members of the proband with IVS6+1G/A, we found the mutation in clinically affected as well as in a clinically normal individual, suggesting incomplete penetrance of the disease in this pedigree. Normally the process of splicing occurs at the first nucleotide of an intron that removes the noncoding region. However, in this case splicing at the first nucleotide of intron 6 was skipped due to the transversion of G/A, thus resulting in the retention of intron 6. Intron retention was confirmed by sequencing cDNA derived from lymphocyte RNA. The introduction of novel nucleotides in the coding region altered the open reading frame, resulting in the premature termination of the protein with a total of 186 amino acids instead of in the wild-type of 499 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>); this change was a novel finding.</p><fig id="f6" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Alignment of protein sequences of the PRPF31 protein The wild-type sequence and two identified novel mutants, IVS6+1G/A and p.Lys120GlufsX122, are shown.

The percentage would increase to 4% in adRP, considering that the isolated RP patient with p.Lys120GlufsX122 could be an adRP case showing incomplete penetrance. In such a case, the frequency of <italic>PRPF31</italic> mutations in adRP was found to be approximately equal to that reported in the United Kingdom (5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>], but it is more than what has been reported in Spain (2%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>], and Japan (2%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. However, the frequency of these mutations are relatively low when compared to reports from the United States (8%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. This could be due to the presence of large deletions, insertions, or genomic rearrangements, which could not be detected by the current techniques employed in this study.</p><p>The two novel mutations identified in this study result in the production of protein devoid of nuclear localization signal (NLS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). NLS is located between residue 351&#x02013;364, and it is critical for the export of PRPF31 protein from the cytoplasm to nucleus. Since NLS is absent in both the mutant proteins, the translocation of the protein from the cytoplasm into the nucleus is hindered, affecting its spicing function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Thus, these mutations seem to induce a pathogenic mechanism by haploinsufficiency rather than by a dominant negative effect.</p><fig id="f7" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of <italic>PRPF31</italic> and its protein structure.
