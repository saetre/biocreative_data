When neurons reach their final destinations, however, somal translocation and axon extension are uncoupled. Insights into the mechanisms underlying this process of disengagement came from our study of the behaviour of embryonic spinal motor neurons following ablation of boundary cap cells. These are neural crest derivatives that transiently reside at motor exit points, central nervous system (CNS):peripheral nervous system (PNS) interfaces where motor axons leave the CNS. In the absence of boundary cap cells, motor neuron cell bodies migrate along their axons into the periphery, suggesting that repellent signals from boundary cap cells regulate the selective gating of somal migration and axon outgrowth at the motor exit point.

Our RNA interference studies further revealed a role for Plexin-A2, but not Plexin-A1 or Plexin-A4.

However, no increased numbers of ectopic motor neurons are found in <italic>Sema3B </italic>null mouse embryos. In contrast, <italic>Sema6A </italic>null mice display an ectopic motor neuron phenotype. Finally, knockdown of MICAL3, a downstream semaphorin/Plexin-A signalling molecule, in chick motor neurons led to their ectopic positioning in the PNS.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that semaphorin-mediated repellent interactions between boundary cap cells and immature spinal motor neurons regulates somal positioning by countering the drag exerted on motor neuron cell bodies by their axons as they emerge from the CNS at motor exit points. Our data support a model in which BC cell semaphorins signal through Npn-2 and/or Plexin-A2 receptors on motor neurons via a cytoplasmic effector, MICAL3, to trigger cytoskeletal reorganisation. This leads to the disengagement of somal migration from axon extension and the confinement of motor neuron cell bodies to the spinal cord.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The migration of neurons is a key process in the development of the nervous system since sites of neurogenesis are often separated by long distances from final destinations. Neuron migration is complex, requiring synchronisation of multiple stepwise processes that differ in important respects from other types of migrating cells. In non-neuronal cells, nucleokinesis or somal translocation is tightly coupled to that of the exploratory lamellopodia. Neuron migration, in contrast, is initiated independently of the cell soma by the extension of long processes preceded by an exploratory growth cone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Somal translocation occurs only after the leading process becomes consolidated by sustained movement in one direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. On reaching its destination, the cell body stops and somal migration and axonal extension become irreversibly disengaged by unknown mechanisms. Since the guidance of migrating neurons appears to be regulated by cues similar to those that govern the guidance of axons, how do these mechanisms become uncoupled within individual post-migratory neurons? For example, motor neuron subtypes arise from a common source of ventricular zone progenitors that migrate into the ventral neural tube where they are initially intermingled. Later, however, motor neurons with similar muscle targets and sensory afferent inputs cluster together into columns and sort out into distinct pools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Expression of a combinatorial code of transcription factors belonging to the ETS and homeodomain families regulates both the distinct settling positions of motor neuron soma within the ventral spinal cord and the targeting of their axons in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Evidence suggests that this may be achieved by the column- and pool-specific expression of receptors for guidance cues that may be distinct from those that control axon guidance. Thus, EphrinA- EphA4 interactions regulate axon guidance along the dorsoventral axis of limbs but appear to have no influence on motor neuron settling positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Similarly, the chemokine receptor Cxcr4 has been implicated in the choice between dorsal and ventral exit points by the axons of spinal accessory motor neurons but does not affect migration of their soma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Conversely, class II cadherins play an important part in pool-specific sorting of motor neuron subtypes but have not so far been implicated in the control of motor axon guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In other instances, however, both axon guidance and cell positioning mechanisms rely on the same ligand-receptor complexes. Thus, in zebrafish neuropilin (Npn)-1a morphants, motor axons have abnormal branching and exit the spinal cord at inappropriate levels whilst at the same time the somata of some motor neurons migrate to ectopic positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Likewise, in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, mutation in the Eph kinase homologue vab-1 causes both the anterior overshooting of mechanosensor posterior lateral motor (PLM) axons and the mispositioning of PLM neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The question of the uncoupling of axonal growth and cell body stabilisation in post-migratory neurons is highlighted in the case of developing spinal motor neurons whose cell bodies and axons come to reside in separate nervous system compartments, that is, the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) respectively. We previously described evidence that after motor axons first emerge from the CNS but before motor neurons acquire their final settling positions, interactions with neural crest derivatives located at motor exit points, boundary cap (BC) cells, influence somal migration. Ablation of BC cells led to the ectopic positioning of many motor neuron cell bodies that escape the spinal cord by apparently translocating along their axons into ventral nerve roots. This result suggested that disruption of this interaction influenced a key process in the maturation of motor neurons: the positional stabilisation of their soma. We proposed that the mechanism for uncoupling somal migration from axonal extension in immature motor neurons requires localised repellent signalling from BC cells to restrain the innate tendency of cell bodies to follow the path taken by their axons. In the search for possible repellents that could mediate this process, several lines of evidence suggest the semaphorin family and its receptors deserve closer scrutiny. Thus, semaphorins and their multimeric surface receptors, neuropilins and/or plexins, have been implicated in the control of the guidance, fasciculation and target selection of motor axons in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and have been suggested to be involved in motor pool sorting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Also, both secreted and membrane bound semaphorins have been implicated more generally in neuronal migration, including the sorting of striatal from cortical interneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and the radial migration of cerebellar granule cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Here we use genetic approaches in chick and mouse embryos to show that BC cell-motor neuron interactions that regulate somal migration are mediated by neuropilin and/or plexin interactions with semaphorin ligands. We show that targeted knock down in motor neurons of Npn-2, a high affinity co-receptor for secreted class 3 semaphorins, cause motor neuron cell bodies to migrate to ectopic positions in ventral nerve roots, a finding corroborated in <italic>Npn-2 </italic>null mice. BC cells express semaphorin-3B, a Npn-2 ligand, and semaphorin 6A, a transmembrane semaphorin. Ectopic motor neurons are found when <italic>Sema6A </italic>short hairpin RNA (shRNA) but not <italic>Sema3B </italic>shRNA is expressed in chick neural crest and in <italic>Sema6A </italic>but not <italic>Sema3B </italic>null mice. RNA interference (RNAi) in chick targeting potential Npn-2 and Sema6A co-receptors reveals a role for Plexin-A2 but not Plexin-A1 or Plexin-A4. The knockdown of MICAL3, a cytoplasmic semaphorin/plexin signalling molecule, in motor neurons results in a very large number of ectopic motor neuron somata in the PNS. Together, our data point to the involvement of BC cell semaphorin-induced signalling pathways controlling motor neuron somal positioning in the embryonic ventral spinal cord.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Semaphorin receptors Npn-1 and -2 and Plexin-A1, -A2 and -A4 are expressed by developing spinal motor neurons</title><p>Previously, we proposed that neural crest BC cells at the motor exit point (MEP) express repellent signals that help confine motor neuron somata within the chick embryo spinal cord as their axons first emerge into the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This requires that candidate receptors for putative repellents should be expressed by motor neurons from embryonic day (E) 2 when the first motor axons exit the spinal cord at the MEP. Available expression data in mouse and chick embryos suggested that prominent amongst these were the multimeric surface receptors for secreted class 3 semaphorins, neuropilins and/or plexins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We therefore analysed in detail expression of chick neuropilins and the three known members of the chick Plexin-A family, Plexin-A1, -A2 and -A4 (there is no chick Plexin-A3 orthologue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]) during the appropriate period.

We used an electroporation protocol that targets the plasmid DNA towards the ventral neural tube (for details see Materials and methods and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). By doing so, effects on migration of the neural crest derivatives, including BC cells, can be excluded, an important consideration since both Npn-1 and Npn-2 have been implicated in neural crest migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>We quantified the effect of shRNA-EGFP electroporation, compared to that of EGFP only, by counting ectopically positioned, EGFP-positive motor neurons. These were localised outside the spinal cord, along the ventral roots, and were characterised by their large soma linked to both trailing and leading EGFP-positive processes. Their identities were confirmed by dual labelling with antibodies to the transcription factors Islet-2 and motor neuron restricted protein (MNR)2.

This process must be coordinated with the establishment of connectivity and requires differential responses of distinct neuronal compartments to the multitude of guidance cues in the environment. This could be achieved in several ways: first by the sorting of compartment-specific receptors, such as at the axonal initial segment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]; the selective accumulation of kinesin motors in axons versus dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]; by the localised intracellular content of modifiers, such as small cyclic mononucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]; and lastly by the different extracellular environments in which each compartment is located. While this is obvious at the level of the growth cone, where localised signals lead to the re-organisation of the cytoskeleton and growth cone turning, an appealing idea is that the cell bodies of neurons are similarly responsive to cues in their local environment. The logistics of this problem is particularly challenging in the case of long distance projection neurons like somatic motor neurons. Their cell bodies begin to settle in position within the ventral spinal cord at an early phase of differentiation before their axons and dendrites make appropriate connections with their target cells.</p><p>In previous work we identified a key role for neural crest derived BC cells in the regulation of this process. In the absence of these cells, spinal motor neuron cell bodies follow their axons at the MEP and migrate into the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Here we have begun to identify the molecules involved in the interaction between BC cells positioned at the MEP and motor neurons that prevent somal migration out of the spinal cord. Using loss-of-function studies in chick and mouse, we present evidence for the involvement of members of the semaphorin family in BC cells and their receptors on motor neurons. Loss of Npn-2, a receptor for class 3 semaphorins, in motor neurons leads to ectopic migration of these neurons, both in chick and mouse spinal cord, as does loss of the transmembrane semaphorin Sema6A in BC cells. RNAi studies in chick identified a role for Plexin-A2 in motor neurons, either as a transducing component in a signalling complex with the ligand binding receptor Npn-2, or as a direct receptor for Sema6A. The requirement for semaphorin-plexin signalling in cell body positioning is revealed by the potent effect of loss-of-function of MICAL3, a member of a conserved family of intracellular Plexin-A binding proteins that have been identified as key modulators of semaphorin-plexin signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Loss-of-function analysis in the chick with shRNA/EGFP vectors</title><p>We started our search for candidate molecules involved in the control of motor neuron migration at the MEP using an RNAi approach that we had developed in the chick, utilising a vector system co-expressing shRNA and EGFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We combined this loss-of-function approach with protocols for targeted expression of transgenes in chick embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), which allowed us to selectively knock down expression of candidates in either the ventral neural tube, where motor neurons develop, or in the neural crest, the progenitors of BC cells. Thus, we were able to conclude that Npn-2 and Plexin-A2 are required in motor neurons, whereas Sema6A functions as a BC cell expressed ligand in helping stabilise motor neuron cell body position in the ventral spinal cord.</p><p>Since the emergence of RNAi as a powerful experimental tool, several pitfalls associated with this technique have become apparent. First, when using randomly selected small interfering RNA (siRNAs) duplexes or shRNAs, at least half of the sequences will not induce any reduction of their targets and less than 5% will reduce expression by 90% or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Therefore, we selected our RNAi targets using an algorithm for rational siRNA design (SFOLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]) that predicts target accessibility and applies empirical rules for functional siRNA duplexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Consequently, approximately one in three of our constructs proved effective, in that they significantly reduced expression of their intended targets as determined by an <italic>in vitro </italic>co-expression assay or by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridisation (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>).</p><p>Second, off-target and non-specific effects have been widely reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and are a serious concern when using RNAi. However, we are confident that the ectopic motor neuron phenotypes we report here are related to the loss-of-function of the intended targets of our constructs, as they are duplicated by constructs targeting the mRNAs on different sites (<italic>Npn-2, Plexin-A2 </italic>and <italic>MICAL3</italic>). During this study we tested a total of 38 shRNA hairpin constructs aimed at 10 targets for the induction of ectopic motor neurons after ventral electroporation. Even when considering our collection of shRNAs as random (yet they are all aimed at molecules involved in semaphorin signalling, and all of those are expressed in the ventral spinal cord to some extent), the probability of six hits appearing in three pairs is quite small (<italic>p </italic>= 0.0111; using an analysis derived from a hypergeometric test). Were we to expand our analysis with shRNAs aimed at truly random targets, the predicted outcome would be that the hit rate would decrease and, concomitantly, the significance of hits appearing in pairs would increase even further. This indicates that general non-specific or random off-target effects are a highly unlikely explanation for the set of data that we have obtained. Finally, the fact that we were able to confirm the roles for Npn-2 and Sema6A in the mouse reinforces the main conclusion from the chick RNAi work that multiple semaphorin-induced pathways are involved in maintaining the stability of motor neuron somal position.</p></sec><sec><title>A role for semaphorin-plexin signalling from BC cells in the maintenance of motor neuron soma position is conserved in amniotes</title><p>Our loss-of-function studies in chick and mouse implicate two proteins in the control of motor neuron migration at the MEP. Npn-2 is required in motor neurons and Sema6A in BC cells. Sema6A and Npn-2 are not known to interact with each other. Therefore, we propose the involvement of at least two separate pathways mediating this mechanism, although, in contrast to Npn-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], a contribution of Npn-2 to class 6 Sema signalling cannot formally be ruled out. Our more extensive studies in chick identified a role for Plexin-A2 in motor neurons. Consistent with its expression in motor neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e,k</xref>), chick Plexin-A2 could function as a dual receptor for both class 6 and class 3 semaphorins. However, in the mouse we failed to detect significant expression of Plexin-A2 in motor neurons at any stage (results not shown). Considering there are three members of the Plexin-A family in chick, unlike in mouse, where there are four, differences in the individual contributions of the various members of the Plexin-A family to chick or mouse neural development are to be expected. The role of Plexin-A2 as a class 6 semaphorin receptor in chick motor neurons could be adopted by Plexin-A4 in the mouse, as this receptor is more strongly expressed by mouse spinal motor neurons (unpublished observations) and can function as a Sema6A receptor in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Plexin-A3, which is expressed by motor neurons in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], has already been implicated as the preferred co-receptor for Npn-2 in mouse sympathetic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].

Since at least two known Npn-2 ligands are expressed by BC cells, a single hit loss-of-function approach may fail as a result of compensatory mechanisms. Experiments aimed at reducing the expression of Sema3B and Sema3G in chick neural crest simultaneously by RNAi have so far not demonstrated a significant increase in the numbers of ectopic motor neurons (not shown). However, considering we found that the ectopic motor neuron phenotype after surgical ablation is effectively rescued by small numbers of grafted BC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], residual levels of repellent molecules at the MEP after partial knockdown are unlikely to produce a strong phenotype. Therefore, a thorough analysis of the role of Sema3B and -3G in motor neuron somal positioning at the MEP will probably require creating double mutants in mouse. Such an analysis will be feasible when Sema-3G mutant mice become available.</p><p>It has been proposed, based on their complementary expression patterns, that semaphorins and their receptors could play a role in motor pool sorting in the embryonic mouse ventral spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We cannot presently exclude the possibility that some of our loss of function experiments could directly perturb interactions between neighbouring motor neurons, leading to a possible disruption of pool cohesion and motor neuron positioning. However, this seems unlikely for two reasons. Firstly, no evidence was found in earlier studies of semaphorin and <italic>Npn-2 </italic>null mutants of any effects on motor pool organisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Secondly, in our chick electroporation experiments where motor neurons were targeted, we rarely saw HB9-positive ectopic cells that were not GFP-positive (less than 1% of the ectopic motor neurons were GFP-negative; for example, see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a,b,e,f</xref>). Moreover, targeted disruptions by electroporation of transgenes in spinal motor neurons engineered to induce pool sorting errors lead to minor cell body displacements within the ventral spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] rather than the large scale ectopic migration we found.</p><p>An unexpected finding is the restriction of an ectopic motor neuron phenotype to caudal-most regions of <italic>Npn-2 </italic>and <italic>Sema6A </italic>null mouse embryos. It seems unlikely that BC cells in the mouse confine motor neurons to the spinal cord only at caudal levels since we have previously described the occurrence of ectopic motor neurons at rostral levels in the Splotch (<italic>Pax3</italic>) mutant mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], as well as in <italic>Sox10 </italic>null mouse embryos (Vermeren and Cohen, unpublished). In both mutants, embryos lack BC cells at rostral levels and their ventral nerve roots contain numerous ectopic motor neurons. One possible explanation is that this could reflect level-specific differences in expression of both Npn-2 and Sema6A in spinal motor neurons and BC cells. These differences clearly exist in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] (unpublished observations) but not to such an overt extent that could explain the restricted localisation of this phenotype. Another explanation may lie in the temporal gradient of maturation along the rostro-caudal neuraxis, making the more immature hindlimb motor pools more susceptible to perturbations. This is perhaps hinted at by the higher background levels of ectopically positioned motor neurons we saw in caudal-most regions of wild-type mouse embryos (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>).</p><p>Further evidence for the involvement of semaphorin-plexin signalling in motor neuron somal settling is the potent effect of MICAL3 loss-of-function in the chick. MICALs are a family of conserved cytosolic signalling proteins known to interact directly with Plexin-As and cytoskeletal or cytoskeleton associated molecules (for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]). <italic>Drosophila </italic>MICAL was identified in a yeast-two-hybrid screen using D-Plexin-A cytoplasmic domain as bait and the D-MICAL loss of function (LOF) mutant has severe motor axon guidance defects, similar to those found in <italic>Sema-1a </italic>and <italic>PlexA </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In relation to axon guidance, MICALs have been implicated in Plexin-A signalling only. Furthermore, D-MICAL does not interact with PlexB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus, the evidence so far suggests that MICALs might be specific mediators of semaphorin-plexin-A signalling. Experiments with a pharmacological inhibitor of flavoprotein monooxygenases, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), suggested that axon repulsion by class 3 semaphorins might depend on the oxidoreductase activity of MICALS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. EGCG did not inhibit the repulsive effects of a number of other ligands, including Sema6A. However, this does not rule out that MICALs are intermediaries in the signalling induced by Sema6A and other repellents, independent of their oxidoreductase activity.</p><p>Our loss-of-function studies in the chick ventral spinal cord suggest a ranking of targets, according to the severity of the phenotype, MICAL3 LOF &#x0003e; Plexin-A2 LOF &#x0003e; Npn-2 LOF (quantified in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>). This ranking is consistent with a signalling hierarchy, where a diverse set of semaphorins (Sema3B, 3G, 6A) interacts with a number of signalling receptors or receptor complexes (Plexin-A2 and Npn-2/Plexin-A). The signals emanating from these receptors then converge on a common intermediate (MICAL3). The effect of MICAL3 LOF approaches the severity of the ectopic motor neuron phenotype observed after surgical neural crest ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This suggests that, if they exist at all, the contributions of parallel, MICAL3-independent pathways will be necessarily minor. We are currently investigating the role of the two other chick MICAL orthologues, alongside other intermediary molecules known to be involved in semaphorin-plexin signalling pathways, such as CRMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Future directions: linking interactions at the cell surface with the regulation of somal translocation</title><p>The saltatory motion of migrating immature neurons is dependent on a microtubule perinuclear cage that drags the nucleus and soma unidirectionally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Several intracellular proteins are known to be involved in this process and their loss leads to pathologies characterised by ectopic migration, such as lissencephalies and epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. We propose that the effect of the localised semaphorin-PlexinA2-MICAL3 signal that we have identified is to neutralise or provide an opposing force to the axon-driven perinuclear cage drag (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Summary of the pathways in motor neurons implicated in mediating a BC cell derived repellent signal that stops somal migration. Boundary cap cells (yellow) located at the MEP express repellent signals (red) that act either directly on motor neuron cell bodies or retrogradely via their axons to disengage somal migration from axon extension. Our data suggest that these signals comprise a combination of class 3 semaphorins and Sema6A (red). Plexin-A2 (purple) expressed by the motor neurons can function as a dual receptor for class 3 and class 6 semaphorins, the former in conjunction with Npn-2 (blue). In this scheme, MICAL3 (green), by linking Plexin-A to the cytoskeleton, is a key downstream mediator of the somal stabilising signal. As a result of cytoskeletal re-organisation, the force (green arrow) exerted from the axonal growth cone that leads to somal translocation in migrating neurons is disrupted.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1749-8104-2-21-9"/></fig><p>Little is known about exactly what MICALs interact with except an affinity for the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. However, MICALs have clearly been implicated in class3 semaphorin signalling, which is best known for its role in axon guidance and cytoskeletal remodelling following growth cone turning (for reviews, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]). This process relies notably on type II myosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], the over-activation of which leads in the fly to the ectopic migration of photoreceptor cell bodies from the single layered eye disk along the optic nerve as far as the optic lobe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. In growth cones, type II myosin generates a force that underlies the retrograde flow of actin. This force is antagonised by dynein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], part of the dynein/dynactin negative end microtubule motor transport complex. Interestingly, null mutation of p150 glued, a subunit of dynactin, in <italic>Drosophila </italic>photoreceptors also leads to their ectopic migration into the optic lobe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. There are clear parallels between these observations and our results: in both scenarios normally unipolar neurons become bipolar through the perturbation of a signal (or its effectors) that antagonises perinuclear cage drag. Recently, it was shown that knock-down of both cytoplasmic dynein and myosin II stalls glial-guided somal migration of neuronal precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. These findings resonate with our work but leave open the question how these changes are regulated at the cell surface of neurons. We suggest that for motor neurons, semaphorin signalling from BC cells triggers cytoskeletal changes that lead to migration arrest. When cell body migration stops, the stabilisation of neuronal cell body position requires that uncoupling of the perinuclear cage drag be sustained throughout the lifetime of the neuron. Since BC cells are a transient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], what constraints prevent motor neuron somata from emigrating at later stages? The most likely explanation is that as motor neurons mature, their polarised structure becomes stabilised by the onset of cadherin-mediated interactions with neighbouring motor neuron somata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], under the influence of a variety of environmental factors, most importantly innervation from muscle targets, primary sensory afferents and the corticospinal tract.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have found evidence that semaphorin-mediated interactions between BC cells and immature spinal motor neurons regulate somal positioning by counteracting an intrinsic tendency of motor neuron cell bodies to translocate along their axons into the PNS. These data support a model in which BC cell semaphorins signal through Npn-2 and/or Plexin-A2 receptors on motor neurons via MICAL3, a cytoplasmic effector, to trigger cytoskeletal reorganisation. This leads to the irreversible uncoupling of somal migration from axon elongation at the MEP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines. <italic>Npn-2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], <italic>Sema3B </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and <italic>Sema6A</italic>-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] were bred and genotyped as described.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In ovo </italic>electroporation and shRNA constructs</title><p>Targeted electroporation towards the ventral neural tube was essentially performed as described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], using an Intracept TSS10 pulser (IntraCell Shepreth Herts, UK) or a Grass-Telefactor SD9 stimulator and 0.25 mm silver electrodes. Plasmid DNA, resuspended in TE buffer at 1 mg/ml with 0.2% Fast Green FCF, was injected in the neural tube of embryonic day 2 (HH stage 10&#x02013;15) embryos and 3&#x02013;5 square pulses of 10&#x02013;12 V were applied with the positive electrode piercing the egg shell and positioned underneath the trunk and the bent, negative electrode above the embryo, parallel to the positive electrode.</p><p>For dorsal horn/neural crest targeting, the polarities of the electrodes were reversed and 2&#x02013;3 square pulses of 7&#x02013;10 V applied. To limit the size of the targeted area, the positive electrode was positioned perpendicularly to the negative electrode. As a consequence, expression in the dorsal neural tube is restricted to the equivalent of one or two somites, whereas EGFP expressing neural crest derivatives can be observed several somites away from the electroporation site (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).

When the ventral spinal cord was electroporated, the ectopic neurons were EGFP-positive, and when the neural crest was electroporated, peripheral glia and BC cells were EGFP-positive. Since electroporation results in a mosaic embryo, there were instances where the region of the ventral spinal cord that was EGFP-positive contained few labelled motor neurons. As results were expressed as the number of sections containing EGFP-Islet2/MNR2 positive neurons over the overall number of sections containing EGFP, the proportions obtained represent an underestimate of the incidence of ectopic motor neurons. A minimum of six embryos were analyzed for each construct.
