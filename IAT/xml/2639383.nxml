The Arp2/3 complex has been implicated in lamellipodial actin assembly as a major nucleator of new actin filaments in branched networks. The interplay between filopodial and lamellipodial protrusions is an area of much interest as it is thought to be a key determinant of how cells make motility choices.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We find that Arp2/3 complex localises to dynamic puncta in filopodia as well as lamellipodia of spreading cells. Arp2/3 complex spots do not appear to depend on local adhesion or on microtubules for their localisation but their inclusion in filopodia or lamellipodia depends on the activity of the small GTPase Rac1. Arp2/3 complex spots in filopodia are capable of incorporating monomeric actin, suggesting the presence of available filament barbed ends for polymerisation. Arp2/3 complex in filopodia co-localises with lamellipodial proteins such as capping protein and cortactin. The dynamics of Arp2/3 complex puncta suggests that they are moving bi-directionally along the length of filopodia and that they may be regions of lamellipodial activity within the filopodia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We suggest that filopodia of spreading cells have regions of lamellipodial activity and that this activity affects the morphology and movement of filopodia. Our work has implications for how we understand the interplay between lamellipodia and filopodia and for how actin networks are generated spatially in cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Two major types of structures dominate actin formations in cells: unbranched filaments that are bundled together and branched networks of unbundled filaments. In the migrating cell, the leading edge contains both types of actin structure, branched networks of actin filaments that form lamellipodia and parallel bundles that form filopodia.</p><p>The Arp2/3 complex, a seven subunit complex containing two actin-related proteins (Arp2 and Arp3), is responsible for the generation of branched networks of actin filaments. Arp2/3 complex cooperates with proteins such as cofilin and gelsolin that make available actin templates for Arp2/3 complex to form branches (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). The Arp2/3 complex is activated by WASP-family proteins via a variety of different signal inputs such as activation of tyrosine kinase receptors and small GTPases of the Rho-family (Reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Activation of Arp2/3 complex increases its binding to the sides of actin filaments and induces the formation of an actin branch, which grows and is thought to push against the plasma membrane causing lamellipodial protrusions. Lamellipodial networks are subsequently reorganised so that the cell can form specialised structures for motility.</p><p>It has been proposed that filopodia are generated by the reorganisation of an Arp2/3 complex generated actin network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Proteins that mediate filament elongation (e.g. VASP and formins) bind to actin filaments in lamellipodia and come together to form a filopodial tip complex that elongates a group of actin filaments forming a filopodium. However, lamellipodia do not seem to be essential for filopodia formation, as filopodia form regardless of loss of most of the Arp2/3 complex or the Scar/WAVE complex in mammalian cells or in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that all filopodia are largely dependent on a dendritic network, as spreading fibroblasts and platelets clearly produce filopodia in the absence of detectable lamellipodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Here, we describe the localisation of the Arp2/3 complex to filopodia in a manner that is apparently independent of adhesion but coincident with the localisation of other lamellipodial proteins to filopodia and dependent on Rac1 signaling. We suggest that filopodia in spreading cells may contain regions of lamellipodial activity, which could offer the cell flexibility in its motility choices.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The Arp2/3 complex localises to filopodia during cell spreading</title><p>After attachment to the fibronectin substrate, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) produced filopodia within 5 minutes (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Filopodia production is followed by extension of lamellipodia and cell spreading continued with repeated cycles of filopodia and lamellipodia assembly. Once lamellipodial extension had begun, the spread area of the cell continually increased until 30 minutes after plating, with very little or no retraction of the cell perimeter (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Between 30 and 60 minutes MEFs began to form a more characteristic fibroblast shape but there was little change in the total cell area (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><p>We aimed to determine the involvement of Arp2/3 complex in cell spreading, so first we localised Arp2/3 complex in spreading MEF. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> shows a sequence of representative photos of Arp2/3 complex localization during a spreading time course. At approximately 5 minutes after plating, before lamellipodia were formed, Arp2/3 complex had a punctate localisation in the cytoplasm. From 15 minutes onwards Arp2/3 complex was at the edge of the cell as well as cytoplasmic. Between 15 and 30 minutes, the localisation of Arp2/3 complex to the cell cortex became more distinct and lamellipodia were present at multiple sites. By 60 minutes, Arp2/3 complex was usually restricted to a few well-defined lamellipodial protrusions with intense labelling.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The localisation of the Arp2/3 complex in spreading mouse embryonic fibrobloasts</bold>. MEFs were plated onto fibronectin and fixed at 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes. Actin was labelled with rhodamine phalloidin and Arp2/3 complex with an antibody to the p34-Arc subunit. Boxed areas are enlarged in B. Scale bar 10 &#x003bc;m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-9-65-1"/></fig><p>Unexpectedly, Arp2/3 complex was also localised to some of the filopodia-like actin protrusions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, enlargements of boxed areas) produced during spreading. A monoclonal antibody to Arp2 showed near identical labelling to the p34-arc antibody in lamellipodia, on cytoplasmic spots and in filopodia (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). We identified the protrusions as filopodia by expressing the filopodial actin bundling protein fascin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] tagged with GFP in spreading cells. In cells expressing relatively low levels of fascin, cell morphology was not affected (data not shown). In low expressing cells, fascin labelled the filopodial-like protrusions that contained Arp2/3 complex but fascin and Arp2/3 complex were not especially coincident in filopodia (data not shown).</p><p>We next examined the dynamics of the actin structures that contained Arp2/3 complex to confirm that they behaved as typical filopodia- i.e. thin projections that grew from the cell edge and whose tips moved relative to the cell body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Arp2/3 complex containing filopodia were identified by immunofluorescence and these same filopodia found in correlative DIC time lapses. At least some of the filopodia labelled with Arp2/3 complex were actively protruding filopodia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). The behaviour of the structures labelled with Arp2/3 complex, together with the molecular evidence from the labelling with fascin, confirmed that we were frequently observing genuine filopodia that contained multiple spots of Arp2/3 complex.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Arp2/3 complex localises to actively protruding filopodia</bold>.

At 15 and 30 minutes about 30% of filopodia contained Arp2/3 complex and by 60 minutes this had increased to 40% (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Correlative DIC time-lapse and immunofluorescence microscopy showed that discounting retraction fibres at 60 minutes, cells had 36% Arp2/3 complex containing filopodia, which agrees with data from fixed cell studies (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Arp2/3 complex is present in filopodia at the earliest stages of spreading and, as with lamellipodia, filopodia were more frequent and strongly labelled by Arp2/3 complex at 30 and 60 minutes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, 60 minutes time point). A range of cell types contained Arp2/3 complex in their filopodia, including J774 macrophages, HeLa, Human embryonic lung fibroblasts (data not shown) and the social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, the localisation of Arp2/3 complex to filopodia seems to be a general but often overlooked feature of cytoskeletal organization.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Average number of filopodia and filopodia containing Arp2/3 complex per cell.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Average number per cell</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>15 minutes</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>30 minutes</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>60 minutes</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Filopodia</td><td align="center">11.7 (&#x000b1; 2.5)</td><td align="center">14.1 (&#x000b1; 1.3)</td><td align="center">17.3 (&#x000b1; 3.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Filopodia containing Arp2/3 complex</td><td align="center">3.2 (&#x000b1; 1.4)</td><td align="center">3.9 (&#x000b1; 1.4)</td><td align="center">7.0 (&#x000b1; 0.4)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><italic>Percentage</italic></td><td align="center"><italic>27.4</italic></td><td align="center"><italic>26.2</italic></td><td align="center"><italic>40.5</italic></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Cells were spread on fibronectin for the ties indicated before fixation.

We examined the dynamics of Arp2/3 complex in filopodia during cell spreading using p21-arc subunit of the Arp2/3 complex tagged with GFP. RFP actin was co-expressed to confirm the location of filopodia. The patches of Arp2/3 complex in filopodia were highly dynamic, changing size and intensity much in the same way as lamellipodial ruffles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). Arp2/3 complex puncta appeared and disappeared within filopodia, rather than seeming to be transported from within the cell or from lamellipodia.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Arp2/3 complex patches in filopodia are highly dynamic and co-localise with increases in RFP actin signal</bold>.

Scale bar 10 &#x003bc;m.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-9-65-4"/></fig><p>From time-lapse fluorescent imaging, Arp2/3 complex was present in both filopodia extending from a dynamic leading edge (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7A</xref>) and in less dynamic filopodia present at previously retracted cell edges (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7B</xref>). Of the several filopodia containing Arp2/3 complex analyzed (53 Arp2/3 complex containing filopodia, 11 cells) by live imaging the patches did not apparently become larger areas of protrusion even when positioned immediately in front of the leading edge. Therefore, we do not think that individual small Arp2/3 complex patches that we have observed in filopodia lead to a larger lamellipodial expansion, but we cannot exclude the possibility that this is a rare event or that coalescence of several patches might not lead to lamellipodial expansion.</p></sec><sec><title>Arp2/3 complex localisation to filopodia is not dependent on vinculin, microtubules or local interaction with a fibronectin surface</title><p>The focal adhesion protein vinculin has been reported to directly associate with the Arp2/3 complex during spreading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and therefore we looked at the localisation of vinculin and Arp2/3 complex in filopodia. Filopodia were labelled with vinculin in varying degrees in some cases as intensely as in focal adhesions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Arp2/3 complex and vinculin were occasionally coincident in filopodia but did not show the same distribution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). We observed this general staining pattern in over 200 cells in three separate experiments. We concluded that vinculin did not strongly co-localise with Arp2/3 complex in filopodia during the first 60 minutes of spreading. To further explore the potential involvement of vinculin in localizing Arp2/3 complex to filopodia we made use of vinculin null MEFs. After 60 minutes cells lacking vinculin had similar morphology to wild type cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]) with 33% of filopodia containing Arp2/3 complex at 60 minutes also comparable to wild type cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>; data not shown). Paxillin, also part of the focal adhesion complex, similarly showed some coincidence with Arp2/3 complex but no clear co-localisation (data not shown). Thus, neither vinculin nor paxillin were reliably co-localised with Arp2/3 complex and vinculin was not required for localising Arp2/3 complex to filopodia. Disruption of microtubules also did not have any effect on the localization of Arp2/3 complex in filopodia, although the morphology of the filopodia was altered, with cells displaying many clubbed or bent filopodia (data not shown).</p><p>By using BSA to block cell adhesion after initial attachment to a glass substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] we could assess the cell adhesion requirements of Arp2/3 complex localisation. After 60 minutes, cells did not have lamellipodia and no localisation of Arp2/3 complex to the cortex was seen (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>). Filopodia were abundant and the majority of them were clubbed (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">8</xref>) as with inhibition of microtubules (data not shown). This suggested that lamellipodia but not filopodia were dependent on an adhesive surface.</p><p>To further explore the role of adhesion in Arp2/3 complex recruitment to filopodia, we designed a micropatterned surface that contained both adhesive and non-adhesive areas. This had the advantage of activating outside-in signaling pathways while enabling us to examine how the cell interacted with non-adhesive areas. To visualise the pattern, fibronectin was labelled with the fluorophore Cy3 and we confirmed that MEFs showed normal spreading, Arp2/3 complex localisation and adhesion formation on a homogenous Cy3 fibronectin surface (data not shown). MEF cells were able to spread on both 5 and 10 &#x003bc;m stripes and the orientation of spreading was always in the direction of the striped pattern (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>)</p><p>Cells spread on these patterned surfaces frequently protruded filopodia into non-adhesive areas (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S9">9</xref>). Vinculin was absent from areas of filopodia that were extended over non-adhesive areas, whereas Arp2/3 complex was often present (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We concluded that the localisation of Arp2/3 complex to filopodia is independent of local adhesion to a fibronectin surface.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Arp2/3 complex localisation to filopodia is independent of adhesion</bold>.

While Arp2/3 complex is typically thought of as a lamellipodial protein, it has been observed in filopodia of <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>and <italic>Acanthamoeba </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and can crosslink actin filaments in addition to the much more well-characterised actin nucleation properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. There have been mixed reports about whether Arp2/3 complex localizes to mammalian cell filopodia. In B16F1 melanoma cells, Arp2/3 complex was reported to be excluded from filopodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], while a previous study stated that Arp2/3 complex was only excluded from most filopodia in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although Arp2/3 complex has been observed in filopodia, its function here has not been well defined, perhaps because it is a relatively minor component of filopodia and very prominent in lamellipodia. However, the presence of Arp2/3 complex in filopodia may have implications for our understanding of their dynamics.</p><p>Just as lamellipodial actin feeds into other actin structures such as cell junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], the actin network generated by Arp2/3 complex in filopodia may provide filaments of different orientations for filopodia dynamics or for assembly of other structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We have found that Arp2/3 complex is present in angled and clubbed filopodia, both situations where non-linear filaments could be present (unpublished data, S. A. Johnston, Ph.D. Thesis). Of course careful electron microscope studies would be needed to determine if branched networks could be formed in filopodia, but our preliminary results using critical point drying and platinum replica methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] show that lamellipodial networks do sometimes protrude from filopodia of MEF (unpublished data, S. A. Johnston, Ph.D. thesis). Importantly, the existence of stable branched networks even in lamellipodia has recently been called into question by one group, who propose that critical point drying methods of preparation for electron microscopy may promote branching of filaments[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Although lamellipodial protrusions from filopodia may have been observed previously, this is not widely discussed in the literature. Short actin filaments have been observed to occur in the tips of <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>filopodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and to be associated with the elongating "tip complex" of these filopodia. We did see Arp2/3 complex in the tips of clubbed filopodia, which may have correlated with the tip complex.</p><p>The formation of new adhesions is occurring during spreading and was an obvious possibility to explain the presence of Arp2/3 complex in filopodia. DeMali et al. showed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] that vinculin transiently associated with Arp2/3 complex during spreading and that this association might promote actin assembly at or near new adhesions. Most of the Arp2/3 complex we saw in filopodia did not co-localise with vinculin or with adhesion sites. However, we did frequently see Arp2/3 complex co-localisation with vinculin at bends and angled regions of filopodia (unpublished data, S. A. Johnston, Ph.D. Thesis). It is still possible that Arp2/3 complex is transiently recruited to new adhesions, as is also suggested by recent work demonstrating a connection with focal adhesion kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], but vinculin binding does not appear to be required for the recruitment of Arp2/3 complex to filopodia, nor does adhesion to substratum.</p><p>Arp2/3 complex in filopodia could be as a precursor to the lamellipodial expansion that is often seen in spreading cells, and which we observed with MEFs (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). In agreement with a model where Arp2/3 complex is recruited to nascent filopodia in order to promote spreading of cells and progression to lamellipodia, we found that Rac inhibition dramatically decreased localisation of Arp2/3 complex to filopodia. Arp2/3 complex in filopodia was distinguishable from localisation to persistent lamellipodia that have been shown to be sensitive to nocodazole treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and dependent on adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The localisation of Arp2/3 complex in filopodia is upstream of adhesion formation and receptor engagement although whether Arp2/3 complex is actively producing an actin network in this situation is unclear. However, we never observed a single spot of Arp2/3 complex in a filopodium progress to become a lamellipodial protrusion, so either this is a low-frequency event or an additional event needs to take place, such as coalescence of several Arp2/3-rich areas within a filopod for lamellipodial progression to occur.</p><p>Our initial results with fluorescently labelled actin monomers suggest that there are free barbed ends near the sites of Arp2/3 complex enrichment in filopodia. Recently it has been shown that Rac is crucial is for the stabilization of protrusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and perhaps the distinction between the characteristics of Arp2/3 complex in filopodia is due to its involvement in this stabilization.</p><p>Svitkina and colleagues have described a role for the filopodial protein mDia2 in lamellipodia assembly and a molecular connection between the Scar/WAVE complex protein Abi1 and mDia2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, they also propose crosstalk between filopodia and lamellipodia. While it is clear that full activity of Arp2/3 complex is not necessary for the generation of filopodia in all cells and conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], these structures can be interdependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In a 3-dimensional network, crawling cells likely have to change between filopodial and lamellipodial protrusions as well as navigating turns and bends more than on a glass coverslip, so it will be interesting to determine whether filopodia made in 3D also have lamellipodial elements.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that lamellipodial networks may exist in filopodia and that these may be important in the dynamics of filopodia or perhaps in transitions between lamellipodial and filopodial modes of protrusion. Our results also suggest that Arp2/3 complex networks do not necessarily only contribute to lamellipodia or remain branched in cells, in agreement with other recent work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) where derived from E9 embryos and immortalised in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].
