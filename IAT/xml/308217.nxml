This technique was used to isolate cDNAs encoding a recently described protein kinase as well as an unknown gene that contained a zinc finger. Several other known genes that contained a zinc finger domain and that were differentially-expressed were also isolated.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0188-a" xlink:role="2613"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0189-a" xlink:role="2614"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0190-a" xlink:role="2615"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0190-b" xlink:role="2615"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0191-a" xlink:role="2616"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0187.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2612"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0188.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2613"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0189.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2614"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0190.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2615"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0191.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2616"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2617"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00037-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2618"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
