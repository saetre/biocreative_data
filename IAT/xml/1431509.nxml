It consists of a catalytic (CNA) and a regulatory subunit (CNB) which form a heterodimer upon Ca<sup>2+ </sup>binding to CNB. The enzyme has been shown to play important roles in various cellular processes in lower and higher eukaryotes. In mammals these include T cell activation via dephosphorylation of the cytosolic component of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], cardiac development and hypertrophy, learning and memory, and axonal pathfinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In yeast calcineurin is involved in the regulation of ion homeostasis and cell cycle control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Whereas most organisms have at least two genes for the calcineurin subunits, the <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum </italic>genome contains single copy genes for CNA and CNB, whose expression changes during development of the organism. As in higher organisms CNB is required for high affinity binding of protein substrates by the holoenzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. CNA is highest in vegetative cells and after aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The coding mRNA for CNB is processed by an unorthodox mechanism starting during early development to give rise to a shorter isoform encoding a CNB protein with a truncated N terminus that does not contain the N myristoylation consensus site found in the full-length protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Several attempts to delete the single gene for CNA (<italic>canA</italic>) in <italic>D. discoideum </italic>by insertion of selectable markers or to reduce its expression by antisense-mRNA failed (U. Kessen and R.M., unpublished results). 30-fold overexpression of the single <italic>cnbA </italic>gene which encodes the regulatory B subunit resulted in moderately accelerated multicellular development with recombinant populations completing morphogenesis about 2&#x02013;3 hours earlier than wild type cells (F. Fouladi and B.W., unpublished observation). Pharmacological inhibition of <italic>D. discoideum </italic>CN using gossypol impaired growth and cellular signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Development of wild type cells treated with 25 &#x003bc;M gossypol was totally blocked for more than 24 hours. Studies using the classical inhibitors, Cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506, indicated that CN regulates Ca<sup>2+ </sup>stress-induced transcription activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase <italic>patA </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] as well as expression of the "calcium upregulated" (Cup) class of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In an in vitro differentiation assay CsA and FK506 strongly inhibited stalk cell formation in the wild-type and spore formation in a sporogenous <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These agents also reduced the expression of prestalk and prespore-specific transcripts, assigning a function for CN as a general activator of differentiation</p><p>During development <italic>D. discoideum </italic>cells aggregate in response to cAMP, form slugs and differentiate into two major cell types, prespore and prestalk cells. These cells organize in a spatial pattern with the prespore region localizing to the posterior and the organizer, prestalk region to the anterior of the slug. Development is completed by the formation of fruiting bodies consisting of a stalk of dead cells and the spore head. Several lines of evidence link the level of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+ </sup>(Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub>) to cell type differentiation. Cells in S and early G2 cell cycle phases, which show a tendency to become prestalk cells, have high intracellular calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. At the slug stage, a gradient of Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i </sub>along the anterior-posterior axis has been found which is inversely correlated with the amount of sequestered Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and the calcium-sequestering activity in high-capacity Ca<sup>2+ </sup>stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. High Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i </sub>has been shown to be necessary for induction of the prestalk-specific gene <italic>ecmB </italic>by the morphogen, differentiation-inducing factor (DIF), and a sustained increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i </sub>was proposed to be responsible for prestalk-specific gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This work also showed that the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i </sub>is brought about by DIF. It is unclear how DIF increases Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub>, and the mechanism by which Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i </sub>ultimately leads to activation of <italic>ecmB </italic>expression has remained elusive.</p><p>RNA interference-mediated gene silencing was recently established in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. RNAi-mediated silencing of gene expression is induced by double-stranded RNA and its processing to 23 mers which cause the degradation of endogenous target mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The technique appears to be well suited for the analysis of potentially essential genes in the haploid <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>genome since it can lead to different levels of silencing from almost wild type to maximally reduced levels in individual cell lines. This would allow to determine the repression level of a given gene that is just tolerable for cell survival.</p><p>We show here that a hairpin RNA construct targeted against <italic>cnbA </italic>effectively reduces the cellular CNB concentration. Recombinant cell lines showed retardation of multicellular development, culminating in fruiting bodies with short stalks and the formation of additional tips on the spore mass of developing fruiting bodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation of <italic>cnbA </italic>RNAi transgenic cell lines</title><p>It was previously shown that <italic>cnbA </italic>is a single-copy gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] localized on chromosome 1 of <italic>D. discoideum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Western blots with specific antibodies against <italic>D. discoideum </italic>CNB revealed various levels of reduction among individual cell lines (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In a number of cell lines (c.f., 01&#x02013;4 or 01&#x02013;5 in fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) CNB was reduced to barely detectable amounts, whereas others (c.f., 0&#x02013;14 in fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) showed only slightly reduced CNB expression. At later stages during development both CNB protein isoforms were detected (not shown) suggesting that processing of the residual <italic>cnbA </italic>mRNA is not affected by RNAi expression.

However, phenotypic alterations were much more prominent in cell lines with pronounced silencing of CNB. To characterize the phenotypic consequences of silencing of <italic>cnbA </italic>mRNA 10 independent transformants with drastically reduced expression of CNB were further analyzed. The phenotypes of all these transformants were very similar to cell line 01&#x02013;5 which is described in more detail below.</p><p>We first compared expression of <italic>cnbA </italic>mRNA in cell line 01&#x02013;5 and parental AX2 cells by Northern blotting. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows that the recombinant cell line had drastically reduced amounts of endogenous <italic>cnbA </italic>mRNA (0.7 kb). A strong signal corresponding to the size of the RNAi construct (1.2 kb) indicates massive expression of the transfected gene. Degradation of both RNAi and endogenous <italic>cnbA </italic>mRNA is indicated by the smear detected in the mRNA isolated from 01&#x02013;5 cells.</p><p>The growth rate of mutant 01&#x02013;5 in AX medium was very similar to that of wild type cells, with doubling times of about 9 hours. When these cells developed on non-nutrient agar aggregation was delayed by about 3 hours as compared to wild type cells. The mutant proceeded with normal kinetics through further development, however, 01&#x02013;5 populations formed longer, leaner slugs than populations of wild type cells (not shown). After termination of development stalks were significantly (ca. 50%) shorter than wild type fruiting bodies (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Comparison of mutant and wild type fruiting bodies did not indicate differences in the size of their spore heads. To analyze whether RNAi against <italic>cnbA </italic>indeed affected predominantly stalk size, we compared the numbers of fruiting bodies formed on SP agar in the wells of microtiter plates from 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells and counted the numbers of spores which could germinate from the mature fruiting bodies.

Some of these extra tips (c.f., fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D, E, F, H</xref>) are reminiscent of the thicker part of stalks near their base.

DIF-1 induces the expression of prestalk-specific genes via an increase in the intracellular free Ca<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Based on our results we speculate that the effects of increased Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i </sub>are mediated by CN. In analogy to the well-characterized role of CN in dephosphorylation of transcription factor complexes of the NFAT type we propose that calcineurin, in response to an increase in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, dephosphorylates a cytosolic component of a transcription complex, which is then translocated to the nucleus and activates &#x02013; in concert with nuclear components of the active complex &#x02013; the transcription of prestalk genes. This hypothesis is directly supported by our observation that RNAi mutant 01&#x02013;5 failed to properly induce expression of the prestalk-specific gene <italic>ecmB </italic>during development.</p><p>The phenotypic defects which we report here complement previous studies on the effects of mutations in the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>glycogen synthase kinase-3 homolog GskA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] which has been shown to promote posterior cell patterning and inhibit anterior cell differentiation [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]]. GskA is regulated through an intracellular protein tyrosine kinase/phosphatase pathway mediated by the cAMP receptors CAR1 and/or CAR3 and CAR4. GskA is activated by CAR1- and/or CAR3-mediated activation of the tyrosine kinase ZAK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and inactivated by CAR4-mediated activation of a protein tyrosine phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. GskA null cells show accelerated early development and form only stalk cells during morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Both the <italic>gskA </italic>null and the <italic>cnbA </italic>RNAi phenotypes are cell autonomous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; see above, fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>. The direct link between GskA and CN is supported by recent results that come from analysis of the NFAT pathway. In T cells phosphorylation of NFAT by GSK3 represses NFAT-dependent gene expression by inhibition of NFAT binding to DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Inhibition of re-export of NFAT to the cytosol when GSK3 is inactivated, leads to increased NFAT-dependent activation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Deletion of the <italic>Dictyostelium aarA </italic>gene, a homolog of mammalian &#x003b2;-catenin, leads to a closely similar breakdown of tip dominance and to formation of ectopic tips during late development as silencing of CNB. In both cases, the defect is non-cell autonomous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; see above, fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>. It has been shown that AarA plays a necessary role in the formation of adherence junctions at the neck of the rising stalk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. &#x003b2;-catenin is also a transcriptional co-activator in the metazoan canonical Wnt pathway. In the control of dorsoventral axis formation in <italic>Xenopus </italic>by extracellular signals, a CN-independent NFAT mutant inhibited anterior development of the primary axis, whereas a dominant negative NFAT mutation induced ectopic dorsal axis formation and the expression of target genes of the canonical Wnt pathway, suggesting that CN and NFAT are part of the noncanonical Wnt/Ca<sup>2+ </sup>pathway which leads to inhibition of the canonical Wnt pathway upstream of &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (for a Wnt/Ca<sup>2+ </sup>pathway overview see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]). It is therefore possible to propose a model for <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>tip dominance where a pathway similar to the canonical metazoan Wnt pathway is acting through CAR1/CAR3 to activate GskA, and a noncanonical "Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup>" pathway through CAR4 to activate CN via an intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signal. The postulated transcription factor target for CN in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>is so far unknown.</p><p>Calcineurin B is a homolog of members of the 4 EF hand calcium sensor protein family which include, for example, recoverin, the neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1), and the plant calcineurin B-like proteins [(CBLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]]. It has recently been demonstrated that N myristoylation, a common feature of CNB and the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>sensor protein family, increases the cooperativity of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>binding to NCS-1 and leads to larger conformational changes upon Ca<sup>2+ </sup>binding than in the nonmyristoylated protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. If Ca<sup>2+ </sup>sensing is indeed a major function of calcineurin B, the phenotypic defects observed in our <italic>cnbA </italic>RNAi mutants may be due to the failure to correctly sense the slow, sustained increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i </sub>from ca. 50 to ca. 150 nM during a period of about 8 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which was proposed to induce prestalk gene expression. Starting during early development <italic>D. discoideum </italic>cells express two CNB isoforms, one of them lacking the myristoylation consensus site. Further work has to show whether it is the myristoylated CNB isoform which plays a crucial role in the mediation of DIF effects on prestalk gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>Dictyostelium </italic>calcineurin B knock down mutants produced smaller stalk cells and as a consequence smaller stalks due to incomplete vacuolization of stalk cells. We propose that calcineurin mediates the effects of a differentiation-inducing factor (DIF)-elicited increase in free intracellular calcium in prestalk cells via the dephosphorylation of a cytosolic transcription complex component which activates the expression of prestalk genes. Culminating fruiting bodies formed ectopic tips on the spore heads which points to a link between calcineurin and the <italic>wnt </italic>pathway in the social amoebae.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Growth and development of <italic>Dictyostelium </italic><italic>discoideum</italic></title><p><italic>D. discoideum </italic>AX2 cells were grown at 22&#x000b0;C in AX medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].
