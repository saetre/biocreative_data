Training experiments using urine scent from mice differing only in the MHC complex, from MHC class I mutants or from knock-out mice lacking functional MHC class I molecules (&#x000df;2m-deficient), suggest that these behavioral effects are mediated by differences in MHC-dependent volatile components. In search for the physical basis of these behavioral studies, we have conducted a comparison of urinary volatiles in three sub-strains of C57BL/6 mice, a &#x000df;2m-deficient mutant lacking functional MHC class I expression and two unrelated inbred strains, using the technique of sorptive extraction with polydimethylsiloxan and subsequent analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. We show (i) that qualitative differences occur between different inbred strains but not in mice with the C57BL/6 background, (ii) that the individual variability in abundance in the same mouse strain is strongly component-dependent, (iii) that C57BL/6 sub-strains obtained from different provenance show a higher fraction of quantitative differences than a sub-strain and its &#x000df;2m-mutant obtained from the same source and (iv) that comparison of the spectra of &#x000df;2m mice and the corresponding wild type reveals no qualitative differences in close to 200 major and minor components and only minimal differences in a few substances from an ensemble of 69 selected for quantitative analysis. Our data suggest that odor is shaped by ontogenetic, environmental and genetic factors, and the gestalt of this scent may identify a mouse on the individual and population level; but, within the limits of the ensemble of components analysed, the results do not support the notion that functional MHC class I molecules influence the urinary volatile composition.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 1975 Lewis Thomas hypothesized that &#x0201c;genes governing mouse self-recognition by pheromones are associated with the Ir-1 locus, within the complex locus for H-2 antigens&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Thomas1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This idea gained support by the demonstration of selective mating between congenic lines of mice differing only in segments of chromosome 17 containing the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). On the basis of these findings the occurrence of MHC-dependent olfactory cues was postulated that enable mice to recognize one another as individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Yamazaki1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

It appeared that the MHC-encoded components critical for this recognition were the class I molecules because mice could differentiate between urine volatiles of wild type and either MHC class I mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Yamazaki3">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> or knockout strains deficient in the &#x000df;2m gene and therefore lacking the expression of the MHC class I heterodimers on the cell surface &#x0005b;6, reviewed in Refs. 7, 8&#x0005d;. Importantly, female mice, in which the vomeronasal organ had been surgically removed, could be trained to differentiate between urine volatiles of two MHC-congenic strains to the same extent and at the same rate as sham-operated mice, demonstrating that learning was achieved via recognition by the main olfactory organ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Wysocki1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In another approach, &#x0201c;habituation-dishabituation&#x0201d; experiments showed that rats and mice can discriminate urine from animals differing in MHC genes without training <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Brown1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Penn2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In these studies the mice could sniff at the urine and, therefore, either the main or the accessory olfactory organ or both could be involved in the recognition of MHC-dependent differences and the critical components could be volatile or non-volatile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Spehr1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, non-volatile peptides known to be MHC class I ligands were shown not only to bind to neurons in the main olfactory and vomeronasal organs but also, when added to urine, to confer specific behavioral responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Spehr1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Boehm1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the identification of these differences has been difficult. In an early study, Schwende et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Schwende1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> concluded that while there seemed to be no specific volatile products that could be related to genes in the MHC, significant quantitative differences in several secondary metabolites could be observed in females of different MHC haplotypes. Singer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Singer1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and Willse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Willse1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> compared the profile of components which could be extracted with diethyl ether from urine of males of two congenic mouse strains, and, while confirming the absence of qualitative differences, found that 9 of 32 and up to 80 of 370 components, respectively, differed significantly in abundance, including a variety of aliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic components as well as two putative pheromones. By comparing the urinary volatiles from strains sharing the same background but differing in the MHC with strains having the same MHC but differing in background or with H-2 heterozygotes two studies concluded that both MHC and background genes substantially influence the volatile profile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Eggert1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Willse2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, Novotny et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Novotny1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> recently suggested that MHC genes influence the amounts of testosteron-dependent pheromones, sulfur-containing compounds, and several carbonyl metabolites. Thus, while these studies agree that there are no MHC-dependent qualitative differences, there is no consensus concerning the type, number and abundance of components which differ quantitatively.</p><p>Recently, we characterized volatile components released from the body of C57BL/6 mice or from their urine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Rck1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, we compared the composition of urinary volatiles between inbred strains, sub-strains of an inbred strain and a mutant lacking functional MHC class I molecules. We find that strain differences in component abundance can be correlated to the provenance and genetic distance of the mice rather than the MHC. The consequences of these observations for the elucidation of the physical basis of MHC-dependent discrimination observed in several experimental models is discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6J mice (stock # 000664) and mice with a targeted mutation in the &#x000df;2-microglobulin gene (B6.129P2-<italic>B2m<sup>tm1Unc</sup></italic>J, stock # 002087) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Maine.

Mass spectra of the urine mixtures were recorded in the total ion mode for identification of components and for selection of substances for quantitative analysis.

The possible dependence on MHC class I-molecules was investigated by comparing C57BL/6J mice and a strain with a targeted mutation in the &#x000df;2m gene. This mutation causes deficient surface expression of MHC class I heterodimers although the larger &#x003b1; chains encoded in the MHC genetic locus are still synthesized (abbreviated B6J and &#x000df;2mJ, respectively). In order to study the influence of breeding conditions and genetic drift, we included two substrains of C57BL/6J (designated B6F and B6NCrl). These four strains carry the H2<sup>b</sup> haplotype.

Each spectrum was aligned to a reference spectrum representing the average of components detected in urine samples from all 45 mice. Comparisons of B6J, &#x000df;2mJ and B6F with the reference spectrum showed an excellent qualitative agreement in peak number and shape, i.e. there appeared to be no components that were characteristic for any of the three strains. Consequently, pair wise comparisons of the spectra for strains B6F, B6J and &#x000df;2mJ likewise revealed no obvious qualitative differences. Similar agreement was observed for components present in the rest of the chromatograms (not shown). We concluded that the three mouse strains showed no detectable qualitative differences in a total of about 180, mostly minor peaks detectable in the chromatograms.</p><p>We evaluated the GC/MS spectra for the presence of clearly defined peaks, which corresponded to 69 components (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000429-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000429.s003">Table S1</xref>).

Furthermore, most new components (18 from 27) eluted at late retention times suggesting that these were readily desorbed from polydimethylsiloxan stir bars but not from Tenax&#x02122; TA and hence had failed detection in the previous study. Therefore, the spectrum of components obtained with coated stir bars reflected the composition of urine scent as well or better than that acquired by the purge and trap procedure using Tenax&#x02122; TA. For example, the components commonly considered to be mouse pheromones (6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone, 2-heptanone, 2,3-dehydro-exo-brevicomin, 2-<italic>sec</italic>-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole and &#x000df;-farnesen) were reproducibly detected by both procedures.</p><p>While we noted no qualitative differences between strains B6J, &#x000df;2mJ and B6F), we observed qualitative or large quantitative differences when we compared B6NCrl, BALB/cCrl and DBA/2Crl mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000429-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Five components (GC/MS peaks # 15A, 34, 35, 55B and 62) were present in both B6NCrl and BALB/cCrl mice but absent in DBA/2Crl mice.

From the total ion mass spectrum of each peak we chose one or in some cases two characteristic fragments (cf. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000429.s003">Table S1</xref>) and then recorded the GC/MS spectra in the selected ion mode. This procedure improved the sensitivity of peak detection, reduced the background of the spectra and allowed their automatic evaluation. The results of a total of 50 spectra (15 urine samples each for B6J, &#x000df;2mJ and B6F mice and five controls from a urine mixture) are presented in Table S2. In an independent experiment the same number of spectra were obtained for samples from B6NCrl, BALB/cCrl and DBA/2Crl mice (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000429.s005">Table S3</xref>).</p><p>As noted previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Rck1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, for some components the abundance showed a very high, for others low variability within the groups of mice considered. Overall, the standard deviation of the mean for 15 measurements varied between 18 and 308&#x00025; and thus for essentially all components was much higher than the mean standard deviation in the reference samples (16&#x00025;). This variability implied that the odor bouquet differed even for individuals of the same strain. This conclusion was supported by the analysis of individual urine samples collected over 3 weeks from five B6NCrl mice (cf. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000429.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Comparison of these animals showed that many components occurred at closely the same relative abundance while others varied up to 10-fold. Overall, within the time frame investigated the individual odor differences were relatively stable.</p><p>The similarity (or distance) of the mouse strains with respect to the individual volatile concentration was evaluated by two-tailed t-tests for the means with Bonferroni correction for 69 components at p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.05. This procedure yielded for each pair wise comparison a set of components with significantly different concentration. Probably not all of these significant differences can be detected by a mouse. For example, as shown for octanol as a model compound, a 3-fold difference is just sufficient to be discriminated by mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Kelliher1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

Surprisingly, there were 19 (28&#x00025;) and 22 (32&#x00025;) components different between strains B6J vs. B6F and B6J vs. B6NCrl, respectively. Differences increased to 25 (36&#x00025;) and 33 (48&#x00025;) components, respectively, when B6J mice were compared to BALB/6Crl and DBA/2Crl mice. Therefore, in comparison to strain B6J the fraction of differences increased in the order &#x000df;2mJ&#x0003c;&#x0003c;B6F&#x0003c;B6NCrl&#x0003c;BALB/cCrl&#x0003c;DBA/2Crl (cf. upper section of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000429-t001">Table 1</xref> for ratios r&#x0003e;1).</p><p>Strains B6J and &#x000df;2mJ differed in 5 components, but only 2 thereof (r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2.25 for component #11 and r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2.14 for #39) differed by a factor more than 2-fold and none by more than 3-fold. Furthermore, these two compounds also differed between B6J and either B6NCrl (#39) or both B6F and B6NCrl (#11) indicating that these differences did not correlate to the &#x000df;2m mutation. In contrast, strains B6J as well as &#x000df;2mJ showed numerous components differing more than three- and some even 10-fold when compared to strains B6F or B6NCrl. Therefore, strains B6J and &#x000df;2mJ were much more similar to each other than to the B6-substrains, B6F and B6NCrl. As may be expected, a much larger number of components differing by higher r-values (from &#x0003e;3 to &#x0003e;100) was observed when the urine odor of the three inbred strains B6, BALB/c and DBA/2 was compared. In summary, evaluation of the magnitude of differences also showed the close similarity of the B6J wild type and its mutant as well as the increasing dissimilarity, when these strains are compared to the two B6 substrains or to the two other inbred strains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates that standardization of urinary volatile collection and analysis as well as an adequate sample size allows the reproducible detection of an ensemble of components. As can be expected, inbred mouse strains separated by nearly a century <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Klein1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> exhibit some qualitative or large quantitative differences. Of particular interest is the lack of 2-<italic>sec</italic>-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole in DBA/2 mice, which has been implicated as a pheromone in estrus induction, puberty acceleration, female attraction and inter-male aggression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Novotny2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. This component may alter the behavior of this mouse strain when added to urine.</p><p>The abundance of the urinary components can be discussed on two levels. First, some components vary widely between individuals from the same strain, implying that it is unlikely that two urine samples will have exactly the same scent. In addition, a large individual variability in the amount of certain volatiles was also observed in mouse body odor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Rck1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore possible that these differences enable a mouse to identify individuals of an inbred strain by the urine or body odor or both, analogues to the differentiation of the scent of monozygotic twins by bloodhounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Harvey1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, it appears that the fraction and extent of quantitative differences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000429-t001">Table 1</xref>) between urinary components reflects the relationship between the mouse strains with regard to genetic distance and environmental factors such as the commensal flora or the diet used by the suppliers for raising the animals before their delivery to the T&#x000fc;bingen laboratory. B6J and &#x000df;2mJ mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories, which enforce rigid breeding programs to limit genetic drift. Nevertheless, 7&#x00025; of the components were found to be significantly different in abundance, albeit at most by 2-3-fold. B6F and B6NCrl are sub-strains of B6J obtained from two other sources. The fraction of differences and the extent of these differences in comparison to strains B6J and &#x000df;2mJ strongly increased. As may be expected, differences increased even further when these strains were compared to BALB/cCrl and DBA/2Crl. The importance of environmental factors can be inferred from the observation that in comparison to strain DBA/2Crl, strains B6NCrl and BALB/cCrl mice, i.e. animals provided by the same supplier, show fewer significant differences, 23&#x00025; and 16&#x00025;, respectively, than B6J (48&#x00025;) and B6F mice (41&#x00025;, cf. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000429-t001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, quantitative differences appear to be due to subtle phenotypic and genotypic changes in the complex physiology of the mouse strains, which have been separated by inbreeding for many generations (compare Ref. 12 and the literature cited therein for divergence by random mutations and various phenotypic differences documented for congenic strains). All urinary components analyzed here are components produced by so far uncharacterized, minor metabolic pathways, which appear to be under relatively loose control causing considerable within- and between strain variability in abundance. In a comparison of two congenic C57BL/6-lines (haplotypes H-2<sup>b</sup> and H-2<sup>k</sup>) previous studies have reported quantitative differences in a different set of urinary components using a preparation technique that was biased towards the detection of less volatile solutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Singer1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Willse1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, variability in abundance appears to be characteristic for a large fraction of all urinary volatiles.</p><p>What are the consequences of these results for the concept that the MHC directly or indirectly influences the odor composition of mouse urine and is therefore important for recognition of individuality in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Thomas1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Yamaguchi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>? Considering the numerous quantitative differences observed for B6 sub-strains, we are reluctant to assign the few and small differences between B6J and &#x000df;2mJ mice to an influence of functional MHC class I expression. For the same reason, we would argue that differences in the quantity of urinary volatiles found between two C57BL/6-congenic lines, which were established decades ago and have since been propagated separately, cannot be interpreted readily as being dependent on genes in the MHC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Singer1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Willse1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The hypothesis that genes governing mouse-self recognition by pheromones are associated with the MHC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Thomas1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> was formulated at a time when only a few genes of this complex were known. Sequencing of the MHC has as yet not uncovered candidate genes for regulating the abundance of secondary metabolites.</p><p>How can our results be reconciled with studies invoking an influence of the MHC on urinary volatile composition? We propose that the quantitative differences in the bouquet of volatiles between closely related strains result in distinct activation patterns of <italic>c-fos</italic> mRNA expression in the main olfactory bulb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Schaefer1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> as well as of sensor arrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Montag1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. At present, these studies have not been directly related to analytical data on urine scent. In the Y-maze experiments, mice were trained to differentiate urinary volatiles from MHC-disparate donors (reviewed in Refs. 7 &#x00026; 8). Because these studies used urine samples from many individuals (see e.g. Ref. 4), the sensor mice must have learned to recognize the MHC-specific difference (or a combination of multiple differences) against the variable volatile profile from these individuals. This difference was then treated as an MHC-specific trait that could be successfully inherited to F<sub>2</sub>-segregants of two H-2 congenic strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Yamaguchi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Yamazaki5">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, of <italic>H-2<sup>b</sup></italic> wild type and <italic>H-2<sup>bm1</sup></italic> mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Yamazaki3">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> or of B6 and &#x000df;2m-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Bard1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. These segregation experiments provide the strongest argument for a specific influence of the MHC on the odor profile and, in principle, a similar segregation experiment could be performed for the odor profiles. However, the small differences in the abundance of urinary volatiles observed between B6J and &#x000df;2mJ mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000429-t001">Table 1</xref>) cannot be considered to be robust genetic traits. Therefore, we do not expect that an extension of the present investigation to F<sub>2</sub>-segregants would yield results which could be interpreted in terms of an MHC association. Since we have quantitatively analyzed only a fraction of the total number of volatiles present in the urine, one can argue that we have missed the critical components, which are controlled by and consequently would segregate with the MHC. While this remains a possibility, it should be noted that the agreement between the aligned GC/MS spectra between B6J and &#x000df;2mJ mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000429-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) is good even in regions not selected for the quantitative analysis. In summary, the behavioral experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Bard1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> and the compositional data can only be reconciled by postulating as yet undetected MHC-dependent differences in urinary trace volatiles, which a mouse can learn to differentiate after extensive training. It can be predicted that it would be very difficult to train mice to differentiate volatiles from urine mixtures, e.g. from groups of B6J vs. &#x000df;2mJ mice compared to B6J (group1) vs. B6J (group 2) and &#x000df;2mJ (group1) vs. &#x000df;2m (group2), as used in this paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000429-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The importance of using urine mixtures rather than samples from individual animals in behavioral experiments has been noted previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Penn1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Carroll1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The MHC has been proposed to influence the odor composition in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Wedekind1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Santos1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

As can be expected from an outbred population, the spectrum of volatiles varied widely in both quality and quantity. Based on the analysis of close to 400 components, each individual appeared to have a unique odor profile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000429-Penn3">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in humans as well as in mice the individual odor bouquet is a function of complex ontogenetic, genetic and environmental factors and a specific influence by the MHC remains to be defined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000429.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Kinetics of partitioning of urine components into polydimethylsiloxane-coated stir bars.
