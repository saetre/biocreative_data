Using a novel invasive glioma mouse model established by serial in vivo selection, we identified the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) as a critical regulator of glioma invasion. Through a series of functional, biochemical, and clinical studies, we found that p75<sup>NTR</sup> dramatically enhanced migration and invasion of genetically distinct glioma and frequently exhibited robust expression in highly invasive glioblastoma patient specimens. Moreover, we found that p75<sup>NTR</sup>-mediated invasion was neurotrophin dependent, resulting in the activation of downstream pathways and producing striking cytoskeletal changes of the invading cells. These results provide the first evidence for p75<sup>NTR</sup> as a major contributor to the highly invasive nature of malignant gliomas and identify a novel therapeutic target.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Gliomas are highly malignant and invasive tumors with tendrils that extend far from the primary tumor site, rendering conventional therapies ineffective and leading to an invariably poor prognosis.

A major barrier to effective malignant glioma treatment is their highly invasive nature; they extend tendrils of tumor several centimeters away from the main tumor mass, which render these tumors incurable by local therapies such as surgery or radiotherapy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Ninety-five percent of gliomas recur within 2.5 cm of the resection margin, which contains invasive cells that act as a &#x0201c;disease reservoir&#x0201d; and elude current treatments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Glioma cells do this by becoming distinct from their noninvasive counterparts. Specifically, they activate a number of coordinate cellular programs, which include those necessary for migration (e.g., motility) and invasion (e.g., extracellular matrix degradation) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; and also a number of pathways (e.g., reduced proliferation, marked resistance to apoptosis) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; which render the invasive cells highly resistant to conventional treatments. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying this invasive behavior is essential for the development of effective therapies.</p><p>Although in their infancy, attempts to identify genes involved in glioma invasion have used a number of techniques, including the isolation of invasive cells from human cell lines in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;, the use of organotypic brain slice cultures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, and the collection of tumor and invasive cells from frozen glioblastoma patient specimens using laser capture microdissection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Although each method has been successful in its own right, none of these models have been ideal or comprehensive for discovering the underlying mechanisms of invasion. New models or alternative strategies are needed. We have therefore undertaken the approach of serial in vivo selection to identify genes important for the invasive behavior of malignant glioma. Similar strategies have been used to effectively identify mechanisms underlying the metastatic behavior of both melanoma and breast tumors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Using this approach, we isolated highly invasive glioma cells from a relatively noninvasive human malignant glioma. Gene expression profiles comparing these two tumor cell populations identified the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) as an important and potent mediator of invasion in human glioma.</p><p>p75<sup>NTR</sup> is a transmembrane glycoprotein and a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily that was originally isolated as a nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor, but has since been shown to bind both the mature and precursor forms of the neurotrophin family of ligands (brain-derived neurotrophin factor &#x0005b;BDNF&#x0005d;, neurotrophin-3 &#x0005b;NT-3&#x0005d;, and neurotrophin-4/5 &#x0005b;NT-4/5&#x0005d;) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b014">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. In neurons, p75<sup>NTR</sup> is coexpressed with a second group of neurotrophin receptors, the tropomysin receptor kinases (Trks). It has become increasingly clear that the dogma in neuroscience that Trks mediate neuronal survival and p75<sup>NTR</sup> causes neuronal cell death is too narrow a view &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b019">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

Even though p75<sup>NTR</sup> does not contain any catalytic activity, it interacts with several proteins that help transmit signals required for its various functions. Neurotrophin engagement of p75<sup>NTR</sup> controls the activity of the small GTPase RhoA, providing a direct link from the receptor to modulating cellular architecture. As is the case for phenotypic responses, RhoA has been shown to be activated or inhibited depending on cellular context &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b036">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.

To generate an orthotopic model that more closely mimics the human disease and allows for the identification of molecular determinants of glioma invasion in a global and unbiased manner, we used an in vivo&#x02013;selection procedure to select for highly invasive human glioma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050212-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). We isolated highly invasive glioma cells from the noninvasive human malignant glioma cell line U87 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (U87GFP) and a neomycin resistance gene. Expression of these genes afforded us the ability to isolate the rare glioma cell that migrated away from the primary tumor site. These &#x0201c;invasive&#x0201d; cells were grown and expanded in tissue culture, and reintroduced into the brains of immunocompromised mice where they formed highly infiltrative tumors with poorly defined edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050212-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). These extremely invasive cells were found vast distances from the main tumor mass, with GFP-positive tumor cells readily identifiable in the contralateral hemisphere. In clear contrast, reimplantation of the noninvasive &#x0201c;tumor&#x0201d; cells led to the formation of large tumors with sharply demarcated edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050212-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Using this model, we identified gene expression differences between the noninvasive and highly invasive in vivo&#x02013;selected glioma cells. RNA extracted from tumor and invasive populations was used to prepare labeled cDNA that was hybridized to 14,000-gene human oligonucleotide microarrays (produced by the Southern Alberta Microarray Facility, University of Calgary). Genes up- or down-regulated in the invasive population were compared to the tumor population, and genes that showed consistent gene expression changes of 2-fold or greater are outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050212-g002">Figure 2</xref>A. To ensure the integrity of the microarray data, we chose seven arbitrary genes for validation, the expression of five of which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050212-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050212-g002">2</xref>C. Semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed the expression of all seven genes, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin-8 (IL-8), DZFKp434B204 (unknown hypothetical protein), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3), and p75<sup>NTR</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050212-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050212-g002">2</xref>C).

Importantly, we confirmed the up-regulation of p75<sup>NTR</sup> was not only at the mRNA level, but that a dramatic alteration in abundance of p75<sup>NTR</sup> was seen in the invading cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050212-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). A number of invasive lines were generated by serial in vivo selection and microarray analysis using a second independent U87 invasive line validated the presence of p75<sup>NTR</sup> by microarray that was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot (unpublished data). In addition, using the in vivo&#x02013;selection paradigm outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050212-g001">Figure 1</xref>, we isolated both tumor and invasive cells from a second human glioma cell line, U251N.

Signals from p75<sup>NTR</sup> can arise both in the absence and presence of ligand; however, these signals often evoke opposing biological responses. Because the outcome of both neurotrophin-dependent and neurotrophin-independent signaling was the same, we considered the possibility that the glioma cells were producing and secreting neurotrophin(s), thus activating an autocrine loop. We assessed the expression of several neurotrophins and found that BDNF was present in both the conditioned media and the cell lysate of all glioma cells tested (unpublished data). Furthermore, we found that the presence of p75<sup>NTR</sup> shifted the localization of BDNF from the conditioned media to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050212-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), supporting the notion of autocrine/paracrine activation of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptor.</p><p>To directly test the hypothesis that elevated expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> is necessary for neurotrophin-induced glioma migration and invasion, we surveyed a panel of human glioma cell lines for p75<sup>NTR</sup> protein expression.

A similar approach has been used to successfully assess the global gene expression profile of both melanoma and breast cancer metastasis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Using this strategy, we identified and verified genes that were up-regulated in the invading glioma cells. One of the most differentially expressed genes encodes the neurotrophin receptor p75<sup>NTR</sup> that is the focus of this study. We provide the first evidence both in vitro and in vivo that p75<sup>NTR</sup> is a major mediator of glioma migration and invasion.</p><p>In recent years, there has been a growing importance of the neurotrophin signaling axis in cancer. Specifically, there is increasing evidence that the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB, sometimes in conjunction with its primary ligand BDNF, is over-expressed in a variety of human cancers, ranging from neuroblastomas to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b051">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;. Here, we present data that the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75<sup>NTR</sup> is expressed in malignant glioma and is a major contributor to their highly invasive nature. Although a universal role for p75<sup>NTR</sup> in cancer has not been established, recent studies implicate p75<sup>NTR</sup> in the metastatic progression of melanoma, and specifically in those tumors that metastasize to the brain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Conversely, p75<sup>NTR</sup> expression has been linked to the progression of prostate cancer, but in this cancer, p75<sup>NTR</sup>, which is expressed in normal prostate epithelia, is lost upon transformation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. The divergence observed in the tumor progression of these two distinct tumors can likely be explained by the presence of Trk. In prostrate tumor cells, Trk expression is retained and mediates proliferation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas p75<sup>NTR</sup>-induced invasion in melanoma is independent of Trk expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus the recurring theme emerges that p75<sup>NTR</sup> function is cell-type specific (even in cancer) and must be independently determined for each cellular context. Here, we have shown that p75<sup>NTR</sup>-induced glioma invasion is also Trk independent with neither mRNA nor protein for the Trk receptors expressed by the invading glioma cells. Further supporting the Trk independence of p75<sup>NTR</sup>-mediated glioma invasion is the finding that treatment of the invasive cells with cleavage-resistant pro-NGF (which cannot bind Trk; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050212-sg002">Figure S2</xref>) also enhanced the migration of invading glioma cells.</p><p>Tumor cells can survive by means of an autostimulatory (autocrine) signaling loop, such as that mediated by TrkB and BDNF, or through a paracrine cross-communication with their environment. In brain metastatic melanoma, normal brain tissue adjacent to the melanoma displays increased neurotrophin expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;, making it tempting to speculate that the metastatic melanoma uses the neurotrophin-rich nervous system as a paracrine mediator of invasion. It has similarly not escaped our attention that the neurotrophin environment of the brain may provide an extremely advantageous milieu for an invading glioma cell. Our data show that the p75<sup>NTR</sup>-expressing glioma cells are ligand responsive and may therefore use neurotrophins available in the brain environment to their advantage. In addition, we show that the invasive nature of glioma cells expressing p75<sup>NTR</sup> is negated when these cells express mutant p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptors that no longer bind to neurotrophin.</p><p>The concept of p75<sup>NTR</sup> playing a role in migration is not unprecedented. Neural crest cells, the most extensively studied population of migrating cells in the nervous system, express p75<sup>NTR</sup> even before they commit to any cell differentiation lineage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, Anton et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d; showed that stimulation of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> by NGF allowed Schwann cells to migrate on peripheral nerves, and examination of p75<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed severe impairment of Schwann cell migration, with no response to NGF &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. More recently, the Hempstead laboratory &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d; has shown that activation of p75<sup>NTR</sup> with NGF or pro-NGF (the unprocessed, precursor form of NGF) caused migration of melanoma cells and increased expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> correlated with advanced stages and invasive potential of melanoma brain metastasis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. At present, the underlying mechanism of p75-induced migration of melanoma cells is not understood; however, p75<sup>NTR</sup> has been shown to interact with the actin cytoskeleton &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. The small GTPase RhoA is a downstream effector of p75<sup>NTR</sup> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. The capability of p75<sup>NTR</sup> to modulate the activity of RhoA provides a reasonable explanation as to how p75<sup>NTR</sup> regulation might result in changes in cellular architecture of glioma cells. We found that concomitant with increased glioma invasion, glioma cells expressing p75<sup>NTR</sup> showed reduced RhoA activity and striking actin rearrangement.</p><p>Previous molecular characterization has defined genetic changes between low-grade and high-grade glioma &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b061">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, molecular signatures of glioblastoma subtypes have been identified, including profiles of primary and secondary glioblastoma subgroups &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b068">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b070">70</xref>&#x0005d;. On the other hand, very little is known with respect to the transcriptional profiles of invading glioma cells. Studies have been performed using laser capture microdissection in patient specimens to collect the invasive cells and the cells from the main tumor mass. Although this approach has been used successfully to identify invasion-related genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, these experiments make the assumption that the invasive cells at the leading edge of the tumor have distinct profiles from the main tumor mass and that only tumor cells at the invading edge express genes important for migration and invasion. Yet, within the highly heterogeneous environment of a glioblastoma, in which there are many hypoxic and necrotic regions, it would be easy to envision that tumor cells experiencing oxidative stress would activate mechanisms enabling them to move to a more favorable environment. As such, some genes may not be identified using such an approach. Indeed, our data show that in addition to p75<sup>NTR</sup>-expressing glioma cells at the invasive edge of patient tumors, histological analysis identified p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive glioma cells in regions of the tumor not adjacent to normal brain parenchyma. An alternative explanation for the appearance of p75<sup>NTR</sup>-positive glioma cells is that p75<sup>NTR</sup> promotes survival of glioma cells in vivo, though we did not find that p75<sup>NTR</sup> conferred a survival advantage in vitro. Additionally, reports of &#x0201c;stem-like&#x0201d; cells in brain tumors suggest that brain tumors arise from the transformation of neural stem cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b071">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b073">73</xref>&#x0005d;, and when implanted into the brains of SCID mice, these cells form highly invasive tumors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050212-b075">75</xref>&#x0005d;.
