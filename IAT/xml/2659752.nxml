However, it is not known whether the TA modulates protein function. GDAP1 is a mitochondrial fission factor with two neighboring hydrophobic domains each flanked by basic amino acids (aa). Here we define GDAP1 as TA MOM protein. GDAP1 carries a single transmembrane domain (TMD) that is, together with the adjacent basic aa, critical for MOM targeting. The flanking N-terminal region containing the other hydrophobic domain is located in the cytoplasm. TMD sequence, length, and high hydrophobicity do not influence GDAP1 fission function if MOM targeting is maintained. The basic aa bordering the TMD in the cytoplasm, however, are required for both targeting of GDAP1 as part of the TA and GDAP1-mediated fission. Thus, this GDAP1 region contains critical overlapping motifs defining intracellular targeting by the TA concomitant with functional aspects.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that constantly fuse and fragment.

To evaluate the role of the cytosol-exposed region of GDAP1 on the integration, we used EGFP fused to HD1 and TMD together (EGFP-HD1-TMD; aa 291&#x02013;358), or the TMD alone (EGFP-TMD; aa 311&#x02013;358). Both constructs contain the flanking basic aa and the TMD C-terminal aa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005160-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Comparable to full-length GDAP1, the chimeric proteins integrated also efficiently (25&#x00025;&#x000b1;3&#x00025;) and co-sedimented with porin. Hence, the TMD (including its flanking basic aa and the C-terminus) is sufficient for membrane integration. To rule out that GDAP1 is only peripherally associated with membranes, we repeated the original integration assay but treated P1 with 1 M sodium chloride or 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 11) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005160-Niemann2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with membrane integration, GDAP1 could be sedimented again in the second centrifugation step. GDAP1 was only released into the supernatant upon treatment with detergent, comparable to the integral mitochondrial membrane protein porin, while cytochrome C was released into the supernatant upon treatment with carbonate or high salt. EGFP-HD1-TMD and EGFP-TMD behaved identical to the GDAP1 full-length protein in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005160-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The GDAP1-EGFP fusion protein can be co-sedimented with the mitochondrial-enriched fractions P1 and P2, but is released into the supernatant upon treatment with high salt or carbonate (Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005160.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). This supports the previous observation (Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005160.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) that the C-terminal EGFP-fusion interferes with the integration into the MOM. Finally, to confirm the GDAP1 membrane integration in our in vitro assay, we performed a proteinase K digest of membrane-integrated radiolabeled GDAP1-FLAG. Upon immuno-precipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody the full-length GDAP1-FLAG was detected in the control reaction without protease. In the presence of proteinase K we precipitated a proteinase K-resistant fragment of 5 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005160-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). This fragment represents the membrane-protected C-terminal region of GDAP1-FLAG confirming the proper integration of in vitro translated GDAP1-FLAG into membranes comparable to the integration shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005160-g001">Figure 1</xref>.

Our results define GDAP1 as a classical TA protein that spans the MOM once with its C-terminal TMD. The TMD and its bordering basic aa in the IMS are crucially involved in mitochondrial targeting and membrane insertion. Positively charged aa flanking the TMD on the cytosolic side control both mitochondrial targeting and the fission function of GDAP1.

Indeed, a five aa length extension of the TMD of GDAP1 leads to aberrant targeting of the extended protein to the ER. Third, the TA-domain of GDAP1 and its adjacent C-terminal sequences can be replaced by a heterologous TA-domain and the chimeric protein still maintains mitochondrial targeting. Fourth, like for other TA-proteins, GDAP1-targeting and integration into the membrane is impaired by large C-terminal tags like EGFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005160-Brambillasca1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to the clusters of basic residues surrounding the TMD of GDAP1, the basic residues K291 and R310, adjoining the more N-terminally located HD1, are not required for MOM targeting.

Similarly, HD1 deletion or scrambling of its aa sequence severely impair fission activity of the mutant GDAP1 proteins but without affecting mitochondrial localization. These experiments indicate a key role for HD1 in GDAP1 function without major involvement in mitochondrial targeting and GDAP1 insertion into the MOM.

Intriguingly, our results show that the cluster of basic aa N-terminally bordering the TMD is not only required for mitochondrial localization of GDAP1 but these aa are also of functional importance. Even individual aa of this cluster are concomitantly crucial for GDAP1-induced mitochondrial fission. These findings reveal an overlap of residues belonging to the targeting information of the TA-domain and the fission activity of GDAP1. We conclude that TA-domains in higher eukaryotes can, as shown here for GDAP1, not only serve as a targeting sequence but can also have crucial functional relevance for a mitochondrial dynamics factor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cloning and mutagenesis</title><p>The generation of GDAP1-, EGFP-GDAP1- and GDAP1-EGFP- expression constructs was described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005160-Niemann2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

To label mitochondria, cells were incubated with MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) prior to fixation according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were observed either with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped for epifluorescence and a Zeiss MRM camera or with a confocal inverted microscope (Zeiss LSM 520-NLO) using argon and helium-neon lasers. All images were imported into Photoshop CS (Adobe) for pseudo-coloring, merging, cropping and linear contrast adjustment. To determine the percentage of colocalization of the GDAP1 signal with the mitochondrial marker MitoTracker, we analyzed single plane confocal images using the IMARIS colocalization tool (Bitplane AG). To reduce background signals for the quantitative analysis, the thresholds for the colocalization studies were set at &#x0201c;30&#x0201d; for the green channel and &#x0201c;40&#x0201d; for the red channel as recommended by the software. 85&#x00025; of the GDAP1 signal colocalized with the MitoTracker signal. For better comparison, this value was set to 100&#x00025;.

(A) COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with either mtEGFP (a&#x02013;c), wt GDAP1 (d&#x02013;f), or the C-terminal EGFP-tagged construct GDAP1-EGFP (g&#x02013;i). Fifteen hours after start of transfection, cells were co-stained with MitoTracker to analyze mitochondrial localization. GDAP1-EGFP shows only partial mitochondrial localization. In addition, the expression of GDAP1-EGFP causes mitochondrial aggregation. (B) Upper panel: Cartoon of a cell before and after permeabilization of the cell membrane with low concentrations of digitonin showing the release of cytosolic proteins (a, a&#x02032;). Subsequent treatment with trypsin digests cytosol-exposed membrane-bound protein parts (a&#x02033;; yellow dots, cytosolic proteins; blue dots, cytosolic parts of MOM-attached proteins; green dots, proteins of the intermembrane space; red dots, proteins of the matrix). The used digitonin and trypsin concentrations do not affect the mitochondrial membrane integrity (Lorenz et al., Nat. Methods 3, 205&#x02013;210, 2006). Lower panel (b&#x02013;g): GDAP1-EGFP and mtDsRED expressing COS-7 cells were permeabilized with 50 &#x000b5;M digitonin and treated in parallel with 250 &#x000b5;M trypsin for the indicated time points. Images were taken after permeabilization and trypsin digest. The cytosolic GDAP1-EGFP signal is washed out early due to permeabilization of the cell (c). Only the GDAP1-EGFP associated with mitochondria remains detectable but is lost over time of the protease digest (b&#x02013;d). The mitochondrial targeted marker mtDsRED is not washed out or degraded by the protease (e&#x02013;g). These results indicate that GDAP1-EGFP partly associates with mitochondria but the long-extended C-terminus fails to translocate across the MOM.
