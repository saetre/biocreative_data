Depletion of &#x0201c;circulating&#x0201d; (Gr1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>(Ly6C<sup>lo</sup>)CX3CR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and &#x0201c;inflammatory&#x0201d; (Gr1<sup>hi</sup>/Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>/CCR2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) classical monocytes during infection abrogated the increase in microglia. C57BL/6 chimeras reconstituted with cFMS&#x02013;enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) bone marrow (BM) showed large numbers of peripherally derived (GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) microglia expressing GR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>(Ly6C<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) at day 7 p.i., suggesting that the inflammatory monocyte is a microglial precursor. This was confirmed by adoptive transfer of labeled BM (Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>/CD115<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) or circulating inflammatory monocytes that trafficked to the WNV-infected brain and expressed a microglial phenotype. CCL2 is a chemokine that is highly expressed during WNV infection and important in inflammatory monocyte trafficking. Neutralization of CCL2 not only reduced the number of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> microglia in the brain during WNV infection but prolonged the life of infected animals. Therefore, CCL2-dependent inflammatory monocyte migration is critical for increases in microglia during WNV infection and may also play a pathogenic role during WNV encephalitis.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: ANOVA, analysis of variance; BBB, blood-brain barrier; C-L, clodronate-loaded; CNS, central nervous system; D-L, Dil-labeled; H&#x00026;E, hematoxylin and eosin; IHC, immunohistochemistry; p.i., postinfection; WNV, West Nile virus.</p></fn><fn><p>D.R.

Microglia have been shown to proliferate in situ in several synthetic inflammatory models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). In contrast, it is suggested that microglia can differentiate from blood-derived precursors that migrate into the CNS; however, recent reports suggest that this can only occur after radiation-induced &#x0201c;preconditioning&#x0201d; of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Whether viral infection initiates events resulting in microglial recruitment from the periphery is unknown.</p><p>During embryonic development, microglia populate the CNS from myeloid lineage precursors in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Much is known about early monocyte lineage precursors, but the differentiation to downstream effector populations in the adult remain poorly defined. Geissman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) have described two major subsets in the peripheral blood, the &#x0201c;inflammatory&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;circulating&#x0201d; monocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Inflammatory monocytes express Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> (Gr1) and the chemokine receptor CCR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). CCR2 and one of its ligands, CCL2, are evidently important in both emigration of these monocytes from the BM and their immigration into inflamed tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Inflammatory monocytes migrate to the spleen and skin, where they can differentiate into macrophages and Langerhans cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Circulating monocytes, identified by their low expression of Ly6C in conjunction with CX<sub>3</sub>CR<sub>1</sub>, are thought to be important in replenishing tissue macrophages during homeostatic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have used West Nile virus (WNV) to investigate the in vivo trafficking and differentiation of monocyte/microglia during lethal encephalitis. Although it is clear from previous work that several elements of the systemic immune system work together during WNV infection to control viral growth and dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), it is also apparent that infiltrating CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> myeloid cells contribute to underlying immunopathology observed during WNV encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Although activated microglia have been observed during WNV infection of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), the contribution of microglia to immunopathology is unknown. Microglia are immune-competent cells of the CNS, comprising up to 20% of the total rodent glial population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Resting microglia usually exhibit a ramified dendritic morphology and express low levels of cell surface immune molecules. However, alterations in the microenvironment can result in rapid activation. Activated microglia acquire an amoeboid morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), develop an increase in phagocytic ability, exhibit enhanced migratory capacity within the brain, and increase their expression of cell surface glycoproteins including CD45 and MHC-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we show for the first time in nonirradiated mice that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes migrate in a CCL2-dependent fashion into the WNV-infected CNS, where they develop a microglial phenotype. Inhibition of microglial immigration seen after CCL2 neutralization correlated with enhanced survival of WNV-infected mice. Paradoxically, the titer of WNV in the CCL2-neutralized brains was similar to that observed in nontreated mice, indicating that pathogenesis is not directly related to viral load and implicating CCL2-mediated microglial migration in the pathogenesis of WNV encephalitis.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Microglia become activated and increase in number in response to WNV infection</title><p>Sections of brains from C57BL/6 mice infected intranasally with WNV were labeled with GS-lectin and WNV NS-1 antibody to determine the extent of microglial activation and cellular infection. In normal brains, resting microglia exhibit a ramified morphology and express few &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-galactose residues on their cell surface, making them difficult to detect by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with GS-lectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). However, upon activation, expression of &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-galactose on microglia increases and can be readily detected by IHC. Microglia showed prominent lectin staining in the outer layers of the olfactory bulb on day 3 postinfection (p.i.), corresponding to the appearance of NS-1 staining in this region of the brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Between days 3 and 7 p.i., the morphology of microglia changed. Early activated microglia displayed a dendritic morphology and stained intensely with GS-lectin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). However, with progression of infection, as evident by the spread of NS-1 immunoreactivity throughout the brain (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080421/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080421/DC1</ext-link>), microglia with enlarged cell bodies and retracted processes (stout morphology), as well as those with amoeboid morphology, including rod-shaped and round phagocytic forms, became evident (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>; Fig. S1). Rod-shaped microglia were found predominantly in clusters around neurons or near perivascular cuffs and resembled previously described perivascular microglia, also known as Mato cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Kinetics of microglial change during WNV infection.</bold> WNV NS-1 protein first appeared in the outermost layer of the olfactory bulb on day 3 p.i. (A, arrowheads). Early activated microglia, identified by lectin staining and dendritic morphology, were concurrently detected in the outermost layer on day 3 p.i. (B, arrowheads and enlarged inset of the arrowed box) but nowhere else in the brain. On days 6 and 7 p.i. (C and D), scattered activated microglia (arrows and enlarged inset of the arrowed box) exhibited both amoeboid and intermediate activated morphology in the olfactory bulb. In the brain parenchyma, lectin-positive cells with amoeboid morphology (arrows and enlarged insets of arrowed boxes) were observed surrounding the blood vessels on days 6 (E) and 7 (F) p.i. Bars, 100 &#x003bc;M. Flow cytometry of leukocytes isolated from the whole brain in mock infected (G) showed a predominant population of resting microglia with a classical CD45<sup>lo</sup> phenotype (R1). By day 7 p.i., significant numbers of activated microglia could be identified by their CD45<sup>int</sup> expression, as indicated by R2 (H). Analysis of the total microglial population for Ly6G (I) and Ly6C (J) expression showed increased Ly6C expression on activated microglia but no Ly6G expression on resting or activated microglia. Enumeration of total microglia at days 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7 p.i. showed a major increase between days 6 and 7 p.i. (K). Increased numbers of CD45<sup>int</sup> (activated) microglia could be detected as early as day 3 p.i. (K), with numbers increasing dramatically between days 5 and 7. These changes were temporally independent of decreases in CD45<sup>lo</sup> (resting) microglial numbers, which declined from day 3 p.i. onwards. Data shown are means &#x000b1; SD and are representative of three experiments with at least three mice per group. &#x0002a;&#x0002a;&#x0002a;, P &#x0003c; 0.001, comparing day-7 p.i.

As such, many studies have failed to distinguish correctly between microglia and macrophages. In this study, we used the positive expression of CD11b in conjunction with the differential expression of CD45 antigen on the cell surface using flow cytometry, as originally described by Sedgwick et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). In this way, resting microglia can be differentiated from activated microglia, as well as from macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Ramified or resting microglia express a CD45<sup>lo</sup> phenotype, increasing their cell surface expression to an intermediate (int) level upon activation. Importantly, activated CD45<sup>int</sup> microglia express a lower level of CD45 than macrophages in the CNS, enabling these two cell types to be differentiated from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>).</p><p>As expected, the expression of CD45 on leukocytes isolated either from mock-infected mouse brains or at day 0 p.i. was uniformly low (resting microglia [references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>]; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref> and not depicted). By day 7 p.i., brains infected with WNV displayed a heterogenous CD45 versus CD11b profile. Relatively few CD45<sup>lo</sup> microglia were present, whereas a CD45<sup>int</sup> (activated microglia) population was present and could be distinguished from a significant population of CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/CD45<sup>hi</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>). The increase in CD45 expression on microglia is indicative of activation of these cells. Analysis of Ly6G and Ly6C expression on these resting and activated microglia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, I and J</xref>) showed a significant increase in Ly6C expression on CD45<sup>int</sup> microglia. The absence of Ly6G expression confirms that these cells are not granulocytes.</p><p>Enumeration of microglia by flow cytometry showed that WNV infection resulted in an increase in the absolute number of CD45<sup>int</sup> microglia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, H and K</xref>). Overall microglial cell numbers (CD45<sup>lo&#x0002b;int</sup>) were not statistically different until day 7 p.i. By day 7 p.i., the total numbers of microglia increased by three- to fourfold (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 K</xref>). The differential contributions of resting and activated microglia are also shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 K</xref>. CD45<sup>int</sup> cells, virtually absent on day 0 p.i., were found in low numbers on day 3 p.i., correlating with the increase in lectin labeling by IHC. Numbers of CD45<sup>int</sup> microglia had increased significantly by day 7 p.i. In contrast, numbers of CD45<sup>lo</sup> microglia had significantly decreased at day 6 compared with day 3 p.i. and were significantly lower than CD45<sup>int</sup> microglial numbers at day 7 p.i. Because numbers of total microglia at day 6 p.i. were not significantly different from those of the earlier time points, this suggests that resting microglia are increasing their CD45 expression (as previously described); however, the significant increase in overall microglial numbers in the brain by day 7 in WNV infection argues that there is either in situ microglial proliferation or external recruitment.</p></sec><sec><title>Microglia do not proliferate significantly in situ after WNV infection</title><p>As mentioned, several stimuli may induce microglial proliferation, which is measurable by nuclear BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). However, in some of these studies, mice were exposed to BrdU for several days. This makes it impossible to exclude the possibility that BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> microglia in these models arose from precursor cells that had proliferated in peripheral sites, such as the BM, and subsequently migrated to the brain. Therefore, groups of WNV-infected mice were pulsed i.v. with BrdU for 3 h on either day 6 or 7 p.i., when maximal increases in microglia were occurring, and killed immediately after the pulse period.</p><p>In WNV-infected mice on either day 6 or 7 p.i., the frequency of BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells was low. Of the total BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells counted in brain sections from infected mice, &#x0003e;70% were localized within perivascular cuffs on both days 6 and 7 p.i., with very few observed in the brain parenchyma (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A, B, and D</xref>). Labeling in day-7 p.i. WNV-infected mice not treated with BrdU (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>) or in BrdU-treated mock-infected mice (not depicted) showed virtually no positively labeled cells in any areas of the brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). This was further supported by flow-cytometric analysis, which showed that &#x0223c;1% of microglia in WNV infection were BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> at day 7 p.i. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>; and Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080421/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080421/DC1</ext-link>). The combination of the very low frequency of BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> microglia in WNV-infected mice, their predominantly perivascular location during the period of greatest increase in activated microglia, and the relatively small reduction in absolute numbers of resting microglia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 K</xref>) makes it unlikely that in situ proliferation can account for the large numbers of activated microglia seen at day 7 p.i.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>There is little cellular proliferation and negligible BBB disruption during WNV encephalitis.</bold> Mice were treated with BrdU for 3 h before sacrifice. Routine IHC for BrdU showed that BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells localized predominantly to the perivascular cuff on days 6 (A) and 7 (B) p.i. This was not seen in mock-infected mice or mock BrdU-treated WNV-infected mice (C). Enumeration of BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells on histological sections showed that &#x0003e;70% of all BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were perivascularly localized (D). The percentage of proliferating microglia was also determined by flow cytometry (E and F). Approximately 1% of microglia in WNV-infected and mock-infected mice were seen to be BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (E and F). To test the status of the BBB, fibrinogen IHC was performed on 10 WNV-infected mice and 5 mock-infected mice. Fibrinogen was not detected in any mock-infected mice at day 7 p.i. (0/5; G&#x02013;I). Furthermore, 7/10 WNV-infected mice also failed to exhibit any evidence of fibrinogen leakage (J&#x02013;L). In the three mice where fibrinogen labeling was detected, staining was scant and limited to the luminal surface of vessels (M&#x02013;O, 20&#x000d7;; P&#x02013;R, 100&#x000d7; images of M&#x02013;O).

We investigated the status of the BBB by fibrinogen IHC in the WNV-infected brain at the peak of disease (day 7 p.i.). The presence of fibrinogen has previously been described to detect microvascular leakage in the brain during several distinct neuroinflammatory models and on postmortem brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). Although all mice infected with WNV had severe leukocyte infiltration and perivascular cuffing, 70% of infected mice (7/10) displayed no detectable fibrinogen immunoreactivity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, J&#x02013;L</xref>), whereas fibrinogen staining in the remaining mice was extremely scant and limited to the luminal side of the endothelium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, M&#x02013;R</xref>). In addition, administration of Evans blue, 1 h before sacrifice on day 7 p.i., showed that BBB breakdown was similarly sporadic, with two out of six mice showing some Evans blue leakage into the brain (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080421/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080421/DC1</ext-link>).

To determine whether blood-derived monocytes are microglial precursors during WNV infection, we depleted blood monocytes with clodronate-loaded (C-L) liposomes. It has previously been shown that liposomes do not deplete macrophages in the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Although perivascular cuffs were evidently resistant to C-L liposome depletion in WNV-infected mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A&#x02013;L</xref>), we additionally used Dil-labeled (D-L) liposomes to further confirm visually that liposomes do not have access to the CNS during WNV infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, M&#x02013;X</xref> and top right insets). After injection, D-L liposomes were abundantly localized to the splenic marginal zones in both infected and mock-infected mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, M&#x02013;T</xref>). In contrast, no D-L liposomes were found in the brains of either day-7 WNV-infected mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, U&#x02013;X</xref>) or mock-infected mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 X</xref>, bottom left inset), confirming that liposomes do not cross the BBB. This further supports the data in the previous section, indicating that little or no BBB breakdown occurs in this model. Overall, these data support previously published reports and indicate that this method of depletion primarily affects peripheral monocyte populations, especially the inflammatory monocyte compartment (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080421/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080421/DC1</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>C-L liposomes do not enter the WNV-infected CNS.</bold> Liposomes loaded with clodronate were injected i.v. at day 7 p.i. and, 6 h later, mice were killed. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining of brain sections showed no perivascular cuffing in mock-infected animals (A and B). In contrast, distinct perivascular cuffs were observed in the WNV-infected C-L liposome&#x02013;treated group (E and F) and the WNV-infected PBS liposome-treated group (I and J). To confirm that the cells within these cuffs were of myeloid lineage, we stained sections, consecutive to those stained with H&#x00026;E, with lectin. Lectin staining in brain sections from mock-infected mice confirmed the absence of perivascular cuffing (C and D). In contrast, most of the cells within the perivascular cuff were lectin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in both the WNV-infected C-L liposome&#x02013;treated (G and H) and the PBS liposome-treated (K and L) groups. To further ensure that C-L liposomes used to deplete circulating monocytes did not enter the brain, we injected D-L liposomes at day 7 p.i.

This was not attributable to irradiation because nonirradiated WNV-infected mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, D&#x02013;G</xref>) also showed a reduction of up to 50% of total microglial numbers (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 G</xref>). This reduction was mostly accounted for by the reduction of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> microglia to &#x0223c;20% of the levels seen in control isotype antibody-treated mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 G</xref>).</p><p>This was further reflected in chimeric mice by the analysis of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes in the blood and BM, using the gating strategy illustrated (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, A&#x02013;C</xref>). As expected, in the BM, significantly more Gr1<sup>hi</sup> cells were retained in the CCL2-neutralized compared with the isotype antibody&#x02013;treated mice, whereas Gr1<sup>lo</sup> cells were not statistically different between these groups (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 D</xref>, right), confirming previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). However, CCL2 neutralization significantly increased the GR1<sup>hi</sup> cell numbers in the blood but had little effect on the GR1<sup>lo</sup> monocyte numbers (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 D</xref>, left). Thus, Gr1<sup>hi</sup> cells are evidently inhibited from immigrating into the brain in CCL2-neutralized WNV-infected mice, both at the level of the BBB and during egress from the BM. In contrast, over this short period of time (12 h), no changes were observed in blood and BM monocyte compartments after CCL2 neutralization of mock-infected mice (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080421/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080421/DC1</ext-link>).

Importantly, these data also discount a role for these cells in dissemination of WNV to the brain in this model.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The role of monocyte trafficking as a mechanism for microglial cell replenishment has been debated for some time. This has been fueled by the inability to identify microglia from other macrophage populations found in diseased brains. Using several methods, we have highlighted a critical role for peripheral Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes and the chemokine receptor ligand CCL2 in the ontogeny of microglia during fatal WNV infection of the brain.</p><p>Although it is often argued that microglial proliferation is the mechanism behind increased microglial cell numbers seen during CNS inflammation, the low level of proliferation observed during WNV infection in conjunction with the ability of peripheral depletion of both classical and circulating monocytes to significantly reduce the numbers of microglial cells in WNV-infected brains at day 7 p.i. suggest that the recruitment of a peripheral microglial precursor plays an important role in WNV encephalitis.</p><p>The peripheral blood contains two monocyte subsets, the inflammatory and circulating monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). Inflammatory monocytes are distinguished from circulating monocytes by their differential expression of the Ly6C portion of the Gr1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). The similar expression of Ly6C on several CD45<sup>int</sup> microglia isolated from the WNV-infected brain implicates inflammatory monocytes as a microglial precursor pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>).</p><p>BM chimeras have been successfully used to monitor microglial behavior in several disease models and allow for the differentiation of resident and immigrant microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). However, these studies relied on the expression of &#x003b2;-actin in donor BM in conjunction with IHC directed against antigens such as CD11b and IBA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). As these antigens are expressed equally in macrophages and microglia, definitive identification of microglia and distinction from macrophages during inflammation is impossible. In the present study, BM from mice expressing EGFP on the cFMS promoter (CD115) were used as donors for chimeras. In conjunction with flow cytometry staining for CD45 antigen, this allowed us not only to delineate between resident (GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and immigrating (GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) myeloid cells but also definitively to distinguish between CD45<sup>hi</sup> macrophages and CD45<sup>lo/int</sup> microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). Infected cFMS-EGFP chimeras displayed widespread leukocyte recruitment at day 7 p.i. with numerous GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells displaying microglial morphology. Microglial cell recruitment from the periphery was confirmed by the abundance of CD45<sup>int</sup> CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> microglia isolated from day 7 p.i. cFMS-EGFP chimeras by flow cytometry. Furthermore, we found that most of these microglia expressed Gr1 at similar levels to those seen on circulating inflammatory monocytes, whereas a large majority of resident (GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) microglia did not.</p><p>It has been shown that irradiation of the CNS may alter patterns of monocyte trafficking into the brain in synthetic models of CNS inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Therefore, ability of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes to traffic to the WNV-infected CNS in nonirradiated mice was confirmed using two different tracking techniques. First, we showed that adoptively transferred Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> BM-derived monocytes trafficked preferentially to the WNV-infected CNS, compared with Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> BM-derived monocytes. Although it may be argued that the use of BM-derived monocytes rather than blood-derived monocytes may skew the interpretation of our results, it is important to note that the outcome of the experiment further supports the role of inflammatory monocytes as microglial precursors. This is because Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes also act as precursors for circulating monocytes, in which case they down-regulate Ly6C as they circulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we stably labeled Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> inflammatory monocytes using a previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). We found during WNV encephalitis that FITC bead&#x02013;labeled monocytes trafficked into the WNV-infected brain and developed a microglial phenotype, as determined by the expression of CD45, MHC-II, and CD86. Therefore, these data not only clearly show that inflammatory monocytes, rather than circulating monocytes, act as microglial precursors during WNV encephalitis but that inflammatory monocyte migration into the CNS does not require radiation preconditioning or obvious BBB disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Although our data conflict with previous reports showing that irradiation plays a critical role in the migration of monocyte-derived microglia, other studies suggest that irradiation does not cause any pathological changes in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). Furthermore, the employment of head protection during irradiation not only protects the CNS from irradiation but also the large volume of blood within the brain, as well as the BM within the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>). Although it remains to be seen what role these elements play in trafficking of monocytes into the brain, the findings outlined here in nonirradiated mice indicate that inflammatory monocyte trafficking is an event triggered by viral encephalitis, a scenario that has not previously been explored in this context.</p><p>Finally, similar increases in microglia are observed during WNV infection in mice devoid of the fractalkine receptor CX<sub>3</sub>CR<sub>1</sub> (unpublished data), which further implicates inflammatory monocytes as microglial precursors. However, as CX<sub>3</sub>CR<sub>1</sub> is expressed constitutively by resident microglia in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>), further investigation into the relationship between microglia and CX<sub>3</sub>CR<sub>1</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-circulating monocytes is needed.</p><p>The trafficking of inflammatory monocytes has been linked to the expression of CCR2 and production of CCL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). WNV infection of the CNS resulted in significant amounts of CCL2 production. Neutralization of CCL2 resulted in a massive reduction of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> microglia in WNV-infected brains, clearly showing that the migration of inflammatory monocytes into the CNS is directed in part by the CCL2-CCR2 axis. However, the small number of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells that are still found to penetrate the WNV-infected brain after CCL2 neutralization suggests that the other CCR2 ligands, CCL7 and CCL12, may also play a role in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>Investigation into the effects of CCL2 neutralization during WNV encephalitis on BM and circulating monocyte populations showed that CCL2 neutralization resulted in the retention of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes both in the BM and circulating blood. This suggests, as shown previously in peripheral nonviral models, that CCL2 acts both at the level of BM egress and also at the BBB interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). It appears that the single-pulse antibody-mediated systemic reduction of the very high levels of CCL2, in the face of the high throughput of monocytes from the BM to the brain at this time point, may reduce immigration of monocytes into the brain before the effect of BM egress is apparent, causing an increase in blood monocyte numbers, which is in contrast to the effect of genetic absence of CCL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).</p><p>The infiltration of CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> myeloid cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of WNV disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). This has been argued to be because of infected infiltrating cells acting in a Trojan horse manner, enabling WNV entry from the periphery into the brain in association with breakdown of the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>). However, more recently it has been shown that WNV entry into the CNS is mediated via axonal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>), and integrity of the BBB does not necessarily predict disease outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). In our model of intranasal WNV infection, infectious virus can be isolated from the brain several days (day 3 p.i) before monocyte infiltration occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>), which is consistent with the expression of CCL2 by infected neurons attracting monocytes into the brain from the bloodstream. Therefore, the observation that CCL2 neutralization prolongs the survival of infected mice, although apparently having no effect on viral titer, suggests that inflammatory monocyte-derived microglia are likely to play a pathogenic role in WNV encephalitis, which is not simply explained by their possible role in viral dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>).</p><p>It could be argued that the intranasal model of WNV infection is irrelevant in not mimicking natural infection. However, in all the published models of peripheral inoculation, the significant peripheral immune activation makes it impossible to separate the contribution of the systemic immune response to brain pathology that leads to death from the direct contribution of systemic immune response to death, independently of brain involvement. This is an important distinction that needs to inform interventional approaches to disease. The necessity of distinguishing experimentally between pathological events in the periphery and those in the brain has directed our development of this model. Furthermore, this distinction is likely to explain why macrophage deletion in peripheral inoculation results in enhanced mortality, whereas in our model it increases survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>).</p><p>The exact role of microglia in immune-mediated pathology during WNV infection requires further investigation. Although it is likely that microglia secrete numerous proinflammatory cytokines, because we have shown the importance of glutamate excitotoxicity during WNV infection, we suggest that pathogenic functions of microglia may reside in differential roles of immigrant and resident microglia in regulating neuronal function. Although much work is required to prove this, when considering the exclusively neuronal localization of WNV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>) and the importance of microglia in regulating the neurological environment, it is not unreasonable to speculate that inflammatory monocyte-derived microglia may play a pathogenic role in this phenomenon. Our data cannot definitively rule out an important role for macrophages (that are also likely to be derived from inflammatory monocytes) or CCR2-expressing T cells in the pathogenesis of WNV encephalitis. However, work conducted by several independent groups suggests that macrophages and T cells, recruited in a CCR5-dependent manner, are important in viral clearance and do not drive immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first study to show that microglia are derived from inflammatory monocytes using CCL2 during a fatal model of flaviviral encephalitis. These exogenously derived microglia appear to bolster the endogenous microglial population. This CCL2-dependent migration appears to play a role in the pathogenesis of disease, as CCL2 neutralization prolonged the life of infected mice. The role of infiltrating inflammatory monocytes in mediating immunopathology during WNV encephalitis requires further investigation; however, their peripheral location before migration to the brain suggests that modulating these cells may serve as a novel therapy, not only during encephalitic disease but during other CNS disorders also.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Virus propagation.</title><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>), WNV (Sarafend) was derived from the brains of neonatal mice, which were used to infect confluent vero cell monolayers, at a multiplicity of infection of 5 PFU per cell.
