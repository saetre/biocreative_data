As in PD, abnormal dopamine levels in the aged nigrostriatal projection accompanied the reduced movements. Possibly in line with the PARK6 syndrome but in contrast to sporadic PD, a reduced lifespan, dysfunction of brainstem and sympathetic nerves, visible aggregates of &#x003b1;-synuclein within Lewy bodies or nigrostriatal neurodegeneration were not present in aged PINK1-deficient mice. However, we demonstrate PINK1 mutant mice to exhibit a progressive reduction in mitochondrial preprotein import correlating with defects of core mitochondrial functions like ATP-generation and respiration. In contrast to the strong effect of PINK1 on mitochondrial dynamics in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and in spite of reduced expression of fission factor <italic>Mtp18</italic>, we show reduced fission and increased aggregation of mitochondria only under stress in PINK1-deficient mouse neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Thus, aging <italic>Pink1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice show increasing mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in impaired neural activity similar to PD, in absence of overt neuronal death.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is diagnosed mostly in elderly people by clinical criteria, based on a typical progressive reduction of their spontaneous movement activity in spite of preserved strength and coordination. The clinical deficits reflect progressive neurodegeneration, with initial unspecific symptoms due to pathology in the peripheral autonomic nervous system and in brainstem structures such as the dorsal motor vagal nucleus and the noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons, and with a later typical movement deficit due to pathology of the dopaminergic neurons projecting from the midbrain substantia nigra to the striatum. Upon autopsy, the diagnostic hallmark of PD is the presence of cytosolic protein aggregates containing &#x003b1;-synuclein within the affected neurons (Lewy bodies). Damage by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction is documented for affected brain areas, but the molecular events underlying the pathogenesis are unknown. Several neurotoxins and disease genes may cause variants of PD differing in age of onset, manifestations and prognosis, but a common pathway has remained elusive and a routine laboratory diagnosis cannot yet be provided to patients.</p><p>A clear genetic link between mitochondria and PD was defined by our identification of loss-of-function mutations in the mitochondrial protein PINK1 as the cause of autosomal recessive early-onset PARK6-linked Parkinsonism, a variant of PD with particularly early onset and mild progression that affects the autonomic and cognitive nervous system less than sporadic PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005777-Valente1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005777-Bentivoglio1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

It remained unclear, however, whether essential mitochondrial functions such as preprotein import and fission/fusion are maintained in the mice, whether the mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction progress with age to impair movement and behaviour and whether a neurodegenerative process with &#x003b1;-synuclein aggregation is initiated. Since PARK6 is a rare PD variant and patient brain autopsies are still unavailable, the pathological features of PARK6 tissue remain undefined.</p><p>To further elucidate the physiological role of PINK1 in mammalian tissue and to gain insight in the disease mechanisms of PARK6, we generated a PINK1 deficient mouse and assessed degrees of mitochondrial dysfunction at old age and the consequences for growth, motor performance, neuronal activity and aggregation/degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation of PINK1 deficient mice</title><p>The pathogenic G309D-PINK1 mutation of our PARK6 patients was inserted into the orthologous mouse locus, using a neomycin (<italic>Neo</italic>) selection marker, flanked by loxP sites, engineered in intron V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005777-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The targeting vector was designed to allow a substitution of the G309D mutation, with minimal disruption of the <italic>Pink1</italic> gene. Homologous recombination in embryonal stem cells was demonstrated by Southern blotting with an outside probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005777-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) and presence of the mutation in tail DNA by PCR amplification and restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005777-g001">Fig 1C</xref>). However, Northern blots with a probe covering <italic>Pink1</italic> exons III to VI demonstrated no full-length <italic>Pink1</italic> expression in the mice carrying this allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005777-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>), suggesting interference with gene expression by the presence of <italic>Neo</italic>. The expression levels of the mutant <italic>Pink1</italic> mRNA were reduced by a factor of 14 when analyzed by the Affymetrix transcriptome microarray and by a factor of 35 in quantitative real time RT-PCR (qPCR). To assess whether the intense smaller band detected by Northern blot represents a <italic>Pink1</italic> isoform, qPCR analysis of <italic>Pink1</italic> mRNA sequences on both sides of the <italic>Neo</italic> insertion site were performed and showed a 97&#x00025; reduction in homozygous mutant brain tissue in both cases, indicating that the smaller band in Northern is due to unspecific cross-hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005777-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Saturation reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR of each splicing boundary in brain and liver mRNA specifically detected normally spliced amplicons in wildtype (wt) and heterozygous (ht), but in homozygous tissues (hm) a smear of abnormally large amplification products was found for the exon 5&#x02013;6 boundary suggesting the presence of intron 5 including the <italic>Neo</italic> selection marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005777-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). Additional saturation RT-PCR experiments confirmed the presence of <italic>Pink1</italic> intron 5 and <italic>Neo</italic> sequences in the residual <italic>Pink1</italic> mRNA and demonstrated the existence of smears of abnormally sized amplification fragments in homozygous tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005777-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>), suggesting that a <italic>Pink1</italic> mRNA with excessive size is unstable and degraded to about 3&#x00025; residual expression levels. Endogenous PINK1 protein cannot be detected reliably, probably due to very low expression levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005777-Zhou1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Attempts to concentrate endogenous PINK1 protein through degradation inhibition and immunoprecipitation were promising in HEK293 but inconclusive in tissues, because the antibodies cross-reacted with more abundant proteins. Thus, a demonstration of the PINK1 protein deficiency was not possible. Since a loss-of-function of PINK1 is the cause of PARK6, these mice with a 97&#x00025; knock-down of <italic>Pink1</italic> transcript and a loss-of-function mutation in the remaining mRNA represent a useful disease model. Their quality is similar to the previously reported <italic>Pink1</italic> knock-out mice generated by germline deletion of exons 4&#x02013;7 resulting in an abnormally sized transcript which is probably degraded since no expression was detectable in Northern blots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005777-Kitada1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The other published <italic>Pink1</italic> knock-out mouse was generated by deletion from exon 2 to 5 and is predicted to produce an abnormally sized and unstable <italic>Pink1</italic> transcript, but no Northern or qPCR data are available and its sole expression characterization was through Western blotting in spite of the known problems to detect the endogenous PINK1 protein in tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005777-WoodKaczmar1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Although residual amounts of abnormally spliced <italic>Pink1</italic> transcript would exist in all these <italic>Pink1</italic> mutant mouse lines and it could be speculated that residual amounts of PINK1 protein with abnormal 3&#x02032; sequences are relevant, it is highly probable that mouse phenotypes would result from the engineered deficiency rather than from sequence abnormalities of residual PINK1.</p><fig id="pone-0005777-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005777.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Generation and characterization of the <italic>Pink1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse.</title><p>(A) Schematic drawing of the targeting strategy.

Although there is an ongoing debate which assays are best to quantify these alterations, we made an effort to assess the functional consequences of PINK1 deficiency for both motor and non-motor nervous system deficits as well as growth and survival of the whole organism, using homozygous mutant and wildtype cohorts in pure 129/SvEv background, both derived from the founding heterozygous animals.</p><p>Already at 1 year of age, the body weight of <italic>Pink1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed a significant reduction in average weight of up to 19&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005777-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), a finding which may reflect impaired bioenergetics and mitochondrial dysfunction. This weight reduction occurred although the animals were unlimited in their movement range and certainly able to reach the food, although formal assessment of food intake and metabolism was not performed. A significant reduction of locomotor activity was not demonstrable until the age of 16 months, possibly because wildtype mice from the 129/SvEv strain are known for low motor activity. Impairment of spontaneous movement became significant for several parameters in open field analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005777-g002">Fig. 2B&#x02013;F</xref>) of 16 animals of the first homozygous generation. The measures for total distance (TOTDIST), horizontal activity (HACTV), movement time (MOVTIME), stereotypy count (STRCNT) and center distance (CTRDIST) were all decreased by about 30&#x00025; (p&#x0003c;0.05), while measures for strength (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005777.s002">Fig. S1</xref>), coordination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005777.s003">Fig. S2</xref>) and anxiety (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005777.s004">Fig. S3</xref>) remained normal.

At ages 9 and 22&#x02013;24 months, a significant reduction of dopamine content was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005777-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

To determine whether the onset of neurodegeneration underlies this dopamine deficit at advanced ages, we performed a systematic histological evaluation of neuron populations through Nissl staining, of myelinated fibre tracts through Kl&#x000fc;ver-Barrera counterstaining, and of astrogliosis through GFAP immunohistochemistry in sections from the lower brainstem to the frontal cortex taken at regular intervals. In agreement with the behaviour tests excluding ataxia, peripheral paralysis, autonomic and acoustic dysfunction, no obvious structural pathology was found in the cerebellum, the brainstem and the cerebrum at large. In view of the preferential susceptibility of nerve cells and nerve terminals of the dopaminergic pathway from the substantia nigra (SN) to the striatum to the disease process of PD and to mitochondrial complex I toxins such as MPTP and rotenone, we focussed on a thorough quantification of this projection with morphological and biochemical criteria. After specific detection of these cells with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry in brain tissue at age 18 months, the neuronal cell bodies were counted by unbiased stereology in 30 serial sections covering the whole SN. No loss of dopaminergic neurons was apparent in the PINK1 deficient tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005777-g004">Fig. 4A&#x02013;C</xref>). Furthermore, no reduction in the optical density of TH-positive nerve terminals in the striatum could be documented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005777-g004">Fig. 4D&#x02013;F</xref>).

Here, for the first time we report a phenotype of motor impairment at old age with characteristics similar to PD, together with evidence of dopaminergic synapse dysfunction and prominent mitochondrial dysfunction, which is detectable early under stress through impaired fission and appears also in tissues unaffected by PD such as liver, but which worsens with increasing age just like the motor deficit and includes a prominent deficit of preprotein import. Related mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction are likely also important in the more frequent sporadic form of PD in elderly people, since an increased frequency of somatic mitochondrial DNA deletions was recently observed in midbrain tissue of such patients, with consequent respiratory chain deficiency and probably oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005777-Bender1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>PINK1 deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction</title><p>Mitochondria are important mediators of neural function and synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005777-Mattson1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, our investigation of liver tissue revealed a mitochondrial import defect, which primarily affected preproteins targeted to the matrix compartment, indicating that the reduction of translocation efficiency was not solely caused by a reduced inner membrane potential. Due to the basic relevance of preprotein import for mitochondrial biogenesis, the observed defects could significantly contribute to the respiration deficiencies in PINK1 mutant mitochondria. Although the chain of events leading to this respiration deficit is currently not understood, the findings constitute a robust assay for the progressive pathology induced by PINK1 deficiency. While all data agree that PINK1 exerts an important, but possibly secondary effect on mitochondrial bioenergetics, the function of PINK1 for mitochondrial dynamics, fragmentation and degradation appears less prominent in mouse tissue. In PINK1 deficient <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, several independent groups reported clear-cut pathology of mitochondrial cristae and elongation of mitochondrial networks as evidence for a PINK1 role in fission dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005777-Deng1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005777-Yang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005777-Poole1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

MTP18 was recently described as a transcriptionally regulated target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signalling that is localized within mitochondrial membranes and is thought to provide the limiting step during the fission process of the inner membrane, in parallel to the action of FIS1 at the outer membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005777-Tondera1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005777-Tondera2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. While our data indicate mitochondria of PINK1 deficient mice to have normal morphology and mass in aged brain, they did show enhanced perinuclear aggregation after proteasomal stress, suggesting that PINK1 plays a role in mitochondrial fission and/or autophagic degradation (mitophagy). In PINK1-deficient mouse brain tissue under physiological conditions, this function can apparently be compensated by downstream components of the same pathway, while very recent data showed a stable <italic>Pink1</italic> knock-down in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell culture to induce mitochondrial fragmentation and autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005777-Dagda1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

In accordance with this hypothesis, the loss of PINK1 would become noticeable under stress through a failed activation of mitophagy, resulting in the observed perinuclear accumulation of mitochondria.

Our data that PINK1 deficiency becomes more evident under cell stress might explain the elevated susceptibility of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons in PINK1-linked Parkinsonism, since these neurons are known for high levels of oxidative stress from dopamine metabolism. Apparently, mitochondrial dysfunction is present in all tissues with PINK1 deficiency, while additional stress factors explain the tissue specific pattern of neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>PINK1 deficiency and presynaptic dysfunction</title><p>Function in dependence on ATP levels and on membrane potential characterizes mitochondria as well as presynaptic vesicles, where dopamine is imported and stored until exocytotic release.

This phenotype is very reminiscent of PD: the progressive reduction of spontaneous movements despite preserved strength and coordination, as well as its manifestation at adult age. In addition, some of the pathophysiological features of PD were also found in PINK1-deficient mice: (i) the reduced dopamine content of the striatum; (ii) the altered expression of &#x003b1;-synuclein mRNA; (iii) a mitochondrial dysfunction that is bound to result in the enhanced oxidative stress susceptibility previously published for <italic>Pink1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005777-Gautier1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However, several non-motor signs of early sporadic PD as well as features present in the final stage autopsy tissue such as nigral cell loss and Lewy bodies were not detectable in these mice even after 18 months. Thus, mouse dopaminergic neurons seem to be less susceptible to cell death induced by PINK1-deficiency, when compared with human dopaminergic neurons where PINK1 deficiency was reported to elicit age-related reduction of viability in a cell culture model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005777-WoodKaczmar1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Since PARK6 is a rare variant of PD and autopsy nervous tissue from PARK6 patients has not yet become available, the degree of nigral cell loss and Lewy pathology remains unclear for PARK6-linked PD.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that PINK1 deficiency in mammalian tissue leads to progressive impairment of preprotein import into mitochondria and altered fission-fusion balance under stress, an early phenotype of mitochondrial dysfunction which may well underlie the impaired bioenergetics observed in aged brain tissue. Although neurodegeneration is not detectable within the lifespan of mice and survival remains unchanged, the alteration of dopamine, &#x003b1;-synuclein levels and the novel observation of impaired spontaneous locomotion at old age suggest an accompanying presynaptic pathology which might model early stages of PD.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of <italic>Pink1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice</title><p>A mouse genomic bacterial artificial chromosome library constructed from strain 129/SvEv was screened using a cDNA <italic>Pink1</italic> probe.
