The incorporation of the histone H3&#x000a0;variant CENP-A (also known as CenH3, <italic>Drosophila</italic> CID, <italic>C. elegans</italic> HCP-3, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Cse4, and <italic>S. pombe</italic> Cnp1) in place of normal H3 is critical for the kinetochore assembly at centromeres. This unusual subkinetochore chromatin is assembled only at active centromeres (reviewed in <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cleveland et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Although CENP-A and kinetochores tend to be associated with specific sequences residing at centromeres, it is generally accepted that CENP-A chromatin assembly is epigenetically regulated (<xref rid="bib24 bib48 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Karpen and Allshire, 1997; Sullivan et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Sullivan, 2001</xref>). Most compelling is the finding that kinetochore proteins can assemble on noncentromeric DNA and form neocentromeres at novel sites spontaneously or when CENP-A levels are artificially elevated. Once established at these new sites, mechanisms must exist to recognize this CENP-A and allow it to be renewed and propagated during cell division. In addition, nascent CENP-A must normally be directed to sites of existing CENP-A chromatin for assembly into chromatin and be prevented from assembling into non-centromeric loci.</p><p>Pulse-chase experiments in human cells indicate that CENP-A is incorporated at centromeres in telophase-G1 so that new CENP-A is deposited following centromere segregation (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jansen et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with this, during the rapid divisions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, new CENP-A accumulates at centromeres in anaphase (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Schuh et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). It seems likely that canonical histone H3 is first deposited during S phase and subsequently replaced or that nucleosomal gaps are created and then filled (<xref rid="bib18 bib42 bib47" ref-type="bibr">Furuyama et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Shelby et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Sullivan and Karpen, 2001</xref>). However, little is known about the components that direct assembly of new CENP-A at centromeres in telophase-G1. In fission yeast, CENP-A is incorporated at centromeres during S&#x000a0;phase and G2 (<xref rid="bib14 bib50 bib51" ref-type="bibr">Dunleavy et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Takahashi et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Takayama et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>); however, proteins required for CENP-A incorporation associate with centromeres in late anaphase but&#x000a0;are released in early mitosis (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Thus, anaphase/telophase appears to be a key point in the cell cycle for regulating and permitting CENP-A deposition.</p><p>The histone-binding protein RbAp46/48 is known to participate in a number of histone transactions and has been reported to copurify with <italic>Drosophila</italic> CENP-A and promote CENP-A chromatin assembly in&#x000a0;vitro. In fission yeast cells the RpAp48 protein (Mis16) is concentrated at centromeres but dissociates briefly in early mitosis and reappears in anaphase (<xref rid="bib18 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Furuyama et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Hayashi et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). The RbAp46/48 histone-binding proteins associate with the Mis18 complex, which is also involved in CENP-A deposition. The human complex consists of Mis18&#x003b1;, Mis18&#x003b2;, and Mis18BP1 (also known as KNL2 [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Maddox et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>]); all three proteins accumulate at human centromeres in a codependent manner between telophase and G1 and are required for the deposition of newly synthesized CENP-A. Fission yeast Mis16 and Mis18 physically interact and depend on each other for their localization at centromeres (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Like Mis16, Mis18 transiently leaves centromeres from early mitosis until anaphase, when it again localizes to centromeres.</p><p>It has been proposed that Mis18 and associated proteins may&#x000a0;prime the centromere (following the successful completion of metaphase/anaphase) and thus permit the incorporation of CENP-A in subsequent cell-cycle stages (<xref rid="bib16 bib23 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Jansen et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Maddox et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). However, although RbAp46/48 associate with <italic>Drosophila</italic> CENP-A, no association of CENP-A with Mis16/RbAp46/48 or Mis18 has been reported in other systems. Thus, the connection between the Mis18 complex and CENP-A incorporation remains unexplained.</p><p>Critical residues in the histone fold domain of CENP-A differ from canonical H3 and define the CATD domain required to target CENP-A to centromeres (<xref rid="bib6 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Black et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Sullivan et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>). Comparative affinity purification of CENP-A versus H3.3 mononucleosomes has allowed the identification of proteins that specifically associate with CENP-A nucleosomes including both subunits of FACT, a histone chaperone involved in nucleosome disassembly and reassembly (<xref rid="bib15 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Foltz et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Obuse et&#x000a0;al., 2004b</xref>). In addition, the CENP-A-nucleosome-associated complex and more distal components have been identified (<xref rid="bib15 bib32 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Foltz et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Obuse et&#x000a0;al., 2004a; Okada et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). However, the role of these proteins in CENP-A deposition has not been explored in detail. Thus, although many CENP-A-interacting proteins are known, our knowledge of the specific chaperones required to mediate the CENP-A chromatin assembly is surprisingly sparse.</p><p>We previously identified Sim3 in fission yeast, a homolog of the histone-binding protein NASP/N1-N2, which associates with CENP-A and is required for its efficient deposition at centromeres (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dunleavy et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). However, Sim3 is distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, suggesting that its role is to escort CENP-A to centromeres and hand it over to centromere-associated incorporation factors. The Mis18 complex is clearly a good candidate for this function, but a specific centromere-associated receptor for CENP-A has not been identified in organisms with regional, epigenetically regulated centromeres.</p><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> centromeres are streamlined so that 125 bp of DNA is wrapped around a single CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup> nucleosome and is sufficient to specify centromere function. In contrast, in fission yeast CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> associates with a central domain of &#x0223c;12 kb flanked by heterochromatin on both sides (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Pidoux and Allshire, 2004</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> the Scm3<sup>Sc</sup> protein is required for centromere association of CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup> (<xref rid="bib8 bib30 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Camahort et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Mizuguchi et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Stoler et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>) and has been proposed to form part of an unusual centromeric nucleosome with Scm3, perhaps forming a stable hexameric complex with a Cse4-H4 tetramer (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mizuguchi et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). It is not known if such Scm3 nucleosomes, devoid of H2A-H2B, are a general feature of centromeric chromatin in other organisms. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Scm3 associates with Ndc10, a component of the CBF3 DNA-binding complex that binds the 15 bp CDEIII centromere element and is absolutely required to specify centromere function. Thus, it is possible that the function of Scm3, its connections with CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup>, and the nature of the CENP-A nucleosomes differs&#x000a0;between organisms.</p><p>Here we identify and characterize the Scm3 protein of fission yeast. Our analyses indicate that <italic>S. pombe</italic> Scm3 (Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>) is a centromere-associated protein that binds CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> and is required to maintain the integrity of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> chromatin. Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> is released from chromatin independently of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup>. Furthermore Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>, like Mis16 and Mis18, dissociates from centromeres between early mitosis and anaphase. Reciprocal to this, Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> remains associated with centromeres in CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> mutants, where CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> is lost from centromeres and replaced with H3. Thus, Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> is unlikely to be an integral component of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> nucleosomes, since its association with chromatin is uncoupled from CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup>. We propose that Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> acts to receive CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> at centromeres and, in cooperation with Mis16 and Mis18, mediates its incorporation into nucleosomes in place of H3.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title><italic>sim1</italic> Mutants Are Defective in Kinetochore Integrity Due to Lesions in the Gene Encoding the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Scm3 Ortholog</title><p>Fission yeast has three centromeres of 40, 65, and 110 kb, each composed of two distinct chromatin domains (reviewed in <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Pidoux and Allshire, 2004</xref>). The outer repeats are coated in heterochromatin, whereas nucleosomes composed of the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A (CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup>: Cnp1 in <italic>S.&#x000a0;pombe</italic>) occupy the central domain chromatin and comprise subkinetochore chromatin (<xref rid="bib36 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Partridge et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Takahashi et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). Transcriptional silencing is imposed on marker genes inserted within either domain (<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr">Allshire et&#x000a0;al., 1994, 1995</xref>). Wild-type strains harboring the <italic>arg3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene in the central core (<italic>cnt1:arg3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) of centromere 1 grow slowly on plates without arginine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A), indicating that the <italic>arg3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene is silenced. Mutants that alleviate silencing of marker genes inserted into the central core region have facilitated identification of kinetochore proteins and factors required for assembly of subkinetochore chromatin (<xref rid="bib14 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Dunleavy et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Pidoux et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). The three <italic>sim1</italic> alleles isolated in this screen specifically alleviate (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Pidoux et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>; data not shown) silencing within the central domain subkinetochore chromatin. <italic>sim1</italic> mutants are temperature sensitive for growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). As in other mutants affecting kinetochore integrity, the smeared micrococcal nuclease digestion pattern of the central domain is disrupted in <italic>sim1</italic> mutants (see <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref> available online). Cytological analyses of <italic>sim1</italic> mutants indicate that they have dramatic chromosome segregation defects such as chromosome nondisjunction, aberrant anaphase with lagging chromosomes, and overcondensed chromatin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S2</xref>). The <italic>sim1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene was identified by complementation of the <italic>sim1</italic> mutant phenotypes with a plasmid-borne genomic library. Complementing plasmids contained the ORF SPAPB1A10.02 and sequencing from genomic DNA of the PCR-amplified ORF identified S281L, L73F, and L56F missense mutations in <italic>sim1-15</italic>, <italic>sim1-106</italic>, and <italic>sim1-139</italic>, respectively. Database searches and alignments revealed that the Sim1 protein shares similarity with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Scm3 and related fungal proteins as reported (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Aravind et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). The L73F and L56F mutations lie in conserved residues within the region of Scm3<sup>Sc</sup> that binds CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C). Deletion of the gene encoding this Scm3-like protein (henceforth referred to as the <italic>scm3</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene; <italic>scm3-15</italic>, <italic>scm3-106</italic>, and <italic>scm3-139</italic> alleles; and Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> protein) in diploids followed by tetrad dissection indicate that it is essential for viability (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Scm3 Is Required for Incorporation of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> into Central Core Chromatin</title><p>The phenotypes of <italic>scm3</italic> mutants are suggestive of defective CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> chromatin integrity as previously seen in <italic>cnp1</italic>, <italic>sim3</italic>, and <italic>sim4</italic> mutants (<xref rid="bib10 bib14 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Castillo et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Dunleavy et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Pidoux et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). We therefore examined whether CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> incorporation at centromeres is affected in <italic>scm3</italic> mutants. Following growth at 36&#x000b0;C, wild-type, <italic>scm3-15</italic>, <italic>scm3-106</italic>, and <italic>scm3-139</italic> cells were stained with anti-CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> and anti-Sad1 (a spindle pole body [SPB] protein [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hagan and Yanagida, 1995</xref>]). In G2, centromeres gather at the SPB on the nuclear periphery (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Funabiki et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>), forming a characteristic single spot of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup>. In wild-type cells, CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> is detected as a single dot but is undetectable when Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> function is compromised in <italic>scm3</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D).</p><p>Consistent with this, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) shows that the level of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> in subkinetochore chromatin (<italic>cnt1</italic>) is dramatically reduced in <italic>scm3-15</italic>, <italic>scm3-106</italic>, and <italic>scm3-139</italic> cells relative to wild-type cells at 36&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>E). In wild-type cells the central domain is underrepresented in anti-histone H3 ChIP, and the level of H3 is increased in cells with reduced CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> at centromeres (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Castillo et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). In keeping with this, a reciprocal increase in the levels of H3 associated with the central core region is observed in <italic>scm3-106</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>F).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> Associates with Centromeres in a Cell-Cycle-Dependent Manner</title><p>The deposition of CENP-A could be influenced by many factors, including changes in the relative levels of histones, histone posttranslation modifications, nuclear import, defects in histone chaperones, or chromatin assembly factors. However, a protein that is required for CENP-A deposition, resides specifically at centromeres, and physically interacts with CENP-A is likely to&#x000a0;play a direct and specific role in the assembly of CENP-A nucleosomes.</p><p>To examine the localization of Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>, the endogenous gene was fused with GFP. Our initial analyses indicated that Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>-GFP colocalizes with CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> during interphase, but in contrast to CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> it appears to dissociate from centromeres at the onset of mitosis and to reassociate in telophase (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>). Single kinetochore signals are clearly seen for CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> during mitosis, whereas no signal is observed for Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>. Similar localization patterns were seen upon costaining with anti-Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> antibodies (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>). To pinpoint more precisely the timing of Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> departure/arrival at centromeres, wild-type cells expressing Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>-GFP were stained with anti-Cdc11 antibodies to decorate SPBs (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Krapp et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>) and anti-GFP to detect Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>. Pole-to-pole separation allows the stages of mitosis to be determined; Scm3-GFP is at centromeres in G2 but dissociates just after spindle formation (SPB separation) and reassociates following sister-chromatid segregation to the poles, in mid-late anaphase B (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A). This temporal pattern of localization is reminiscent of that described previously for Mis16 and Mis18 (<xref rid="bib16 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Hayashi et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Examination of cells expressing Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>-GFP and Mis16-myc revealed that they colocalize at centromeres and that their relative timing of reassociation in mitosis is similar (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B). This and previous analyses (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>) suggest that dissociation of Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>, Mis16, and Mis18 from centromeres is coincident with spindle formation in early mitosis and that they reassemble at centromeres in mid-anaphase B after chromosome disjunction. Thus, Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>, Mis16, and Mis18 may function together. This dynamic behavior contrasts with that of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup>, which remains at centromeres throughout mitosis (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>) (<xref rid="bib49 bib51" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Takayama et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The association of Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>-GFP with centromeres was also analyzed by ChIP with anti-GFP antibodies. Like CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup>, Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>-GFP is enriched in the central domain (<italic>cnt1</italic>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C) but not in the centromeric outer repeats.

Taken together, our analyses suggest that Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> might act to assemble CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> into subkinetochore chromatin at these regional centromeres, but it is unlikely to be an integral component of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> nucleosomes themselves in fission yeast.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Scm3 Localization Requires Sim4, Mis6, Mis16, and Mis18, but Not CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup></title><p>As Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>, Mis16, and Mis18 display highly similar temporal localization during the cell cycle, we investigated dependency relationships between these proteins.

This indicates that the maintenance of Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> at centromeres is independent of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup>-containing chromatin but that its localization is dependent on other kinetochore proteins (Sim4 and Mis6) known to affect the maintenance of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> at centromeres.

In restrictive conditions, <italic>scm3</italic> mutants have dramatically reduced CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> levels at centromeres, and a concomitant increase in H3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). This phenotype is consistent with a role for Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> in either assembly or maintenance of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> at centromeres. In support of a role in CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> assembly, analyses indicate that Scm3 is required for incorporation of newly synthesized CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S11</xref>), although this could also be interpreted as ineffective retention of new CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> once assembled. Sim3 (a&#x000a0;NASP/N1-N2 ortholog) is a soluble nucleoplasmic protein that associates with CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> and may escort CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> to centromeres (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Dunleavy et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, we have shown that Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> is a centromere component residing in the subkinetochore central domain. Unlike the majority of centromere proteins in fission yeast that remain centromere associated throughout the cell cycle, Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> dissociates from the centromere upon entry into mitosis and returns in late anaphase. Consistent with this, the accompanying paper demonstrates that Scm3 is absent from central core chromatin in mitotically blocked cells (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Williams et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref> [this issue of <italic>Molecular Cell</italic>]). Thus, Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> displays the same cell-cycle-dependent pattern of localization as Mis16 and Mis18. Human Mis18 and Mis18BP/KNL2 proteins also associate with centromeres in telophase/early G1 and precede CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> deposition upon mitotic exit (<xref rid="bib16 bib23 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Jansen et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Maddox et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>).

However, none of these proteins have been found to associate with CENP-A.</p><p>We have shown that Mis16 and Mis18 are required for Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> association with centromeres. Conversely, Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> is not required for localization of Mis16 and Mis18. In addition, Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> can associate with both CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> and Mis18, and the accompanying paper reports a 2-hybrid interaction between Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> and Mis16 (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Williams et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Thus, genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> could be the link between Mis16/Mis18 and CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> and its deposition.</p><p>Proteins of the Mis6 complex are dependent on Mis16 and Mis18 for centromere association (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>), even though Mis6 complex proteins are located at the centromere throughout the cell cycle. One interpretation is that Mis16 and Mis18 are required for their recruitment but not retention at the centromere, and thus Mis16 and Mis18 are released in mitosis without affecting Mis6, Sim4, or other components. Both <italic>mis6</italic> and <italic>sim4</italic> mutants display a dramatic decrease in CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> levels at centromeres. Proteins of the orthologous CENP-H/I complex in vertebrate cells have also been shown to affect localization of CENP-A (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Okada et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). We find that Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> localization is dependent on both Mis6 and Sim4. Our observations suggest that Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> (in conjunction with other proteins such as Mis16 and Mis18) is the mediator of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> deposition and the protein through which the CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup>-depletion phenotypes of <italic>mis16</italic>, <italic>mis18</italic>, <italic>sim4</italic>, and <italic>mis6</italic> mutants are expressed. The defect in Scm3 mutants is not due to an&#x000a0;inability to localize&#x02014;they remain at centromeres while CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> is delocalized&#x02014;suggesting that they are defective in the interaction with, or deposition of, CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup>. Among Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>, Mis16, and Mis18, only Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> has been found to bind CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup>; it is a good candidate for being a centromere-associated receptor or assembly factor for incoming CENP-A. Our data point to a model in which Mis16 and Mis18 are required to recruit Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>, which acts as a receptor for CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> and ensures its deposition at centromeres (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>D).</p><p>The fact that histone H3 levels increase at centromeres in cells with impaired Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> function suggests that it is required for the replacement of histone H3 with CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup>. This may occur coincident with centromere replication or in G2 (<xref rid="bib10 bib51" ref-type="bibr">Castillo et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Takayama et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). At <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> centromeres, H2A and H2B have been found to be diminished, and in&#x000a0;vitro Scm3<sup>Sc</sup> can cause the release of H2A and H2B from preformed CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup> octamers to form a stable 1:1:1 hexameric complex with CENP-A and H4. Thus, it has been proposed that Scm3<sup>Sc</sup> participates in the formation of a unique type of CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup> nucleosome at <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> centromeres and that similar irregular CENP-A nucleosomes might play a pivotal role at regional centromeres (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mizuguchi et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Our and other analyses indicate that CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> is enriched within the central domain (&#x0223c;12 kb) at fission yeast centromeres (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). Reciprocally, H3 is underrepresented (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Castillo et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Our ChIP analysis suggests that H2B is similarly reduced (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref>), and in agreement, the accompanying paper shows that H2A and H2B as well as H3 are highly diminished in the central core domain, and that this is dependent on Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> function (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Williams et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). These observations are consistent with the interpretation that CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> nucleosomes lack H2A-H2B, although it is also possible that the lower apparent enrichment might instead reflect a less stable association of H2A-H2B dimers with CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> nucleosomes compared to canonical H3 nucleosomes (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Henikoff, 2008</xref>). From what is known about the process of nucleosome disassembly and reassembly, it is likely that the replacement of H3 with CENP-A may initiate with the release of H2A-H2B to allow access and removal of H3 (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Tyler, 2007</xref>). At <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> centromeres, H3 was found to increase at centromeres in the absence of Scm3<sup>Sc</sup> (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Camahort et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; although this was not detected by others, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mizuguchi et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that Scm3<sup>Sc</sup> may aid replacement of H3 with CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup>. It is possible that the mechanism by which Scm3<sup>Sc</sup>, in cooperation with Ndc10, promotes CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup> assembly at <italic>S.&#x000a0;cerevisiae</italic> centromeres operates to effectively trap a CENP-A<sup>Cse4</sup>-H4 tetrameric intermediate in the process of remodeling an H3-containing octamer and it is this that remains associated with Scm3<sup>Sc</sup> and tethered to centromere DNA via Ndc10. In other organisms such as fission yeast with regional centromeres, the process may remain dynamic, allowing some H2A-H2B reassociation following deposition of CENP-A in place of H3. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human cells, most CENP-A nucleosomes have been reported to contain CENP-A, H4, H2A, and H2B, which may be octamers or tetrameric hemisomes (<xref rid="bib7 bib13 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Blower et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Dalal et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Foltz et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Scm3-like proteins can be readily identified in fungi, but it has not been possible to recognize orthologs in more complex eukaryotes (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Aravind et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Since centromeric DNA and the CENP-A variant itself are rapidly evolving, it is conceivable that Scm3-related proteins exist in metazoans but are not currently recognizable. The identification of proteins occupying the same functional niche may eventually resolve this. Our analyses indicate that Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> is unlikely to be part of an unusual CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> nucleosome in fission yeast, as CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> behavior can be uncoupled from that of Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>: first, Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> is released at mitosis, whereas CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> remains centromere associated; second, Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> remains chromatin associated under conditions that release nucleosome particles and solubilize most CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup>; third, CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> is lost from centromeres in <italic>scm3</italic> mutants but the mutant Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> protein remains centromere associated; and fourth, in the CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> mutant <italic>cnp1-1</italic>, where centromeres are rendered nonfunctional, most CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> is lost but Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> remains at centromeres.</p><p>Fission yeast Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> clearly behaves differently from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Scm3 in that its association with centromeres is cell cycle dependent. It seems reasonable to propose that a Mis16-Mis18-Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> complex is formed at fission yeast centromeres and this facilitates the deposition of CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup>. Fission yeast CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> has been shown to be deposited during S and G2 stages of the cell cycle (<xref rid="bib14 bib51" ref-type="bibr">Dunleavy et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Takayama et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>), raising the issue of why the Mis16,&#x000a0;Mis18, and Scm3 proteins are released from centromeres between early mitosis and anaphase B. Several putative CDK phosphorylation sites are present in the Mis16, Mis18, and Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> proteins. It is possible that, when CDK levels are high upon entry into mitosis, Mis16, Mis18, or Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> become phosphorylated and this simply leads to their dissociation; dephosphorylation following anaphase would allow them to rebind. Indeed, we have found that at least serine 127 of Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> is phosphorylated at a putative CDK site, although it is not known if this modification is cell cycle regulated or that it regulates Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> localization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C and <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">S12</xref>). The dissociation/reassociation of Mis16, Mis18, and Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> might represent a key regulatory event in the cell cycle; the successful segregation of sister centromeres to opposite poles in anaphase might be a signal that subsequently permits the rebinding of Mis16, Mis18, and Scm3<sup>Sp</sup>. This could act to link CENP-A replenishment at a particular centromere to the performance of that kinetochore in mitosis (<xref rid="bib1 bib9 bib29" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002; Carroll and Straight, 2006; Mellone and Allshire, 2003</xref>).

Thus, there is currently no evidence that a marking system operates during mitosis to permit CENP-A deposition at centromeres that have functioned correctly in terms of achieving&#x000a0;a bioriented state and segregating accurately.</p><p>It is conceivable that the cell-cycle-regulated localization of Mis16, Mis18, and Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> may just be a passive reflection of other events that alter&#x000a0;kinetochore configuration upon chromosome condensation in mitosis to accommodate other proteins involved in making and monitoring microtubule attachments. However, the regulation of Mis18 and associated proteins during the cell cycle is conserved. In human cells, the orthologs Mis18 (Mis18&#x003b1; and Mis18&#x003b2;) and the associated Mis18BP/KNL2 proteins only associate with centromeres for a brief period between telophase and mid-G1 (<xref rid="bib16 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Fujita et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Maddox et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the deposition of CENP-A is normally only observed in this same window of the cell cycle, immediately after mitotic exit in early G1 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Jansen et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Since hMis18&#x003b1;, hMis18&#x003b2;, and Mis18BP are critical for CENP-A deposition, this suggests that the recruitment of these Mis18 proteins is required for the incorporation of CENP-A into subkinetochore chromatin.</p><p>In fission yeast, Mis16, Mis18, and Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> associate with centromeres from anaphase B through S phase and G2 but are released in early mitosis. CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> is incorporated at fission yeast centromeres in S phase and G2 phases of the cell cycle (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Takayama et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Although it appears that the timing of CENP-A deposition differs between fission yeast and metazoa, in a normal fission yeast cell cycle, G1 is extremely short, with G1 and S phases occurring rapidly upon exit from mitosis (at the time of cytokinesis), meaning that CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> deposition also closely follows mitosis in fission yeast. The return of Scm3 to centromeres in late mitosis may be necessary and permissive for CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> assembly, but association of another factor or a modification later in the cell cycle may additionally be required for it to actually happen. Regardless of the specifics of timing in different systems, recruitment of Mis18 and associated proteins such as Scm3<sup>Sp</sup> or hMis18BP appears to be a key conserved step in mediating CENP-A deposition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Cell Growth and Manipulation</title><p>Standard genetic and molecular techniques were followed.
