In mammals, some have speculated that any health benefits derived from manipulating these same pathways might be offset by increased cancer risk on account of their propensity to boost cell survival. The Sir2/SIRT1 family of NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent deacetylases is proposed to underlie the health benefits of calorie restriction (CR), a diet that broadly suppresses cancer in mammals. Here we show that CR induces a two-fold increase SIRT1 expression in the intestine of rodents and that ectopic induction of SIRT1 in a &#x003b2;-catenin-driven mouse model of colon cancer significantly reduces tumor formation, proliferation, and animal morbidity in the absence of CR. We show that SIRT1 deacetylates &#x003b2;-catenin and suppresses its ability to activate transcription and drive cell proliferation. Moreover, SIRT1 promotes cytoplasmic localization of the otherwise nuclear-localized oncogenic form of &#x003b2;-catenin. Consistent with this, a significant inverse correlation was found between the presence of nuclear SIRT1 and the oncogenic form of &#x003b2;&#x02212;catenin in 81 human colon tumor specimens analyzed. Taken together, these observations show that SIRT1 suppresses intestinal tumor formation <italic>in vivo</italic> and raise the prospect that therapies targeting SIRT1 may be of clinical use in &#x003b2;&#x02212;catenin-driven malignancies.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer is the second leading cause of age-related mortality in humans.

We found that p300 acetylated &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002020-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) and potentiated its transcriptional activity, as has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002020-Simcha1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002020-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). The addition of SIRT1, however, abolished the acetylated form of &#x003b2;-catenin and significantly diminished &#x003b2;-catenin activity when it was co-transfected with p300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002020-g004">Fig. 4D, E</xref>). Conversely, treating cells with the SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002020-Bitterman1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> or suppressing SIRT1 with a retroviral shRNA vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002020-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>) increased luciferase reporter activity. These data show that SIRT1 promotes the deacetylation of &#x003b2;-catenin, thereby reducing its ability to act as a trans-activator.</p><p>The constitutive presence of &#x003b2;-catenin in the nucleus is associated with its oncogenic function and clinically with a poor patient prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002020-Camp1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. To test whether SIRT1 might repress &#x003b2;-catenin by altering its localization, immunofluorescence was performed on cells transfected with shRNA or overexpression constructs for SIRT1. Suppression of SIRT1 in the DLD1 colon cancer cells increased the amount of nuclear &#x003b2;&#x02212;catenin while overexpression of SIRT1 in the same cell line led to a dramatic reduction in the nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002020-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>).</p><p>To analyze the clinical relevance of our findings, we analyzed SIRT1 and &#x003b2;-catenin subcellular expression in a tissue microarray containing 81 human colon cancer samples. We found that a subset of colon cancers express SIRT1 in the nucleus (47/81 cases; 58&#x00025;). When &#x003b2;-catenin expression was scored in these same colon cancers, a highly significant inverse correlation between the level of SIRT1 expression and nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin localization became apparent (p&#x02264;0.003, odds ratio 0.24 with 95&#x00025; confidence interval 0.093&#x02013;0.63) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002020-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref>).

We observed that SIRT1 expression in the normal intestine occurs specifically in the enterocytes, the precursor cells that undergo neoplastic transformation in colon cancers and that SIRT1 is upregulated in rodent intestines in response to CR. We show that overexpression of SIRT1 reduces proliferation in colon cancer cell lines and that overexpressing SIRT1 in the enterocytes of APC<sup>min/&#x0002b;</sup> animals mimics the tumor suppressive effects of CR on this colon cancer model. These observations are consistent with a recent <italic>in vitro</italic> study that implicates SIRT1 as a nutrient sensitive growth suppressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002020-Narala1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. While SIRT1 is expressed in our transgenic mice at higher levels than seen in the intestines of CR treated rodents (7 fold (SIRT1) versus 2 fold (CR)), this level of overexpression is, nonetheless, consistent with findings that SIRT1 can be physiologically upregulated 5&#x02013;10 fold <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002020-Alcendor1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the tumor suppressive effects mediated by SIRT1 eclipse those seen by CR (70&#x00025; reduction (SIRT1) versus 40&#x00025; reduction (CR)) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002020-Mai1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> we cannot exclude the possibility that SIRT1 also inhibits tumor growth by a CR-independent mechanism. Nevertheless, our data provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that overexpression of SIRT1 at physiologically relevant levels, can suppress tumor formation and growth.</p><p>In this study, we also present evidence that SIRT1 interacts with and suppresses &#x003b2;-catenin, the transcription factor that drives tumors in the APC<sup>min/&#x0002b;</sup> model and a variety of human tumors. We find that SIRT1 overexpression inhibits the growth of colon cancer cells dependent on &#x003b2;-catenin activity, suppresses the localization of &#x003b2;-catenin to the nucleus, and significantly attenuates its ability to activate transcription. These effects were not observed in the SIRT1-HY mutant demonstrating that SIRT1 deacetylase activity is required, and raising the possibility that SIRT1 directly targeted &#x003b2;-catenin for deacetylation.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that &#x003b2;-catenin is acetylated by p300/CBP and the acetylated form of the protein has increased transcriptional activity. This finding implies that the putative deacetylase that counteract p300/CBP would be useful as a cancer therapeutic target <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002020-Xu1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we identify SIRT1 as a deacetylase that antagonizes p300/CBP and deacetylates &#x003b2;-catenin, thus slowing cellular proliferation and tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Together, our data sheds light on the ability of SIRT1 to inhibit &#x003b2;-catenin activity and provides mechanistic insight into the anti-tumorigenic effects of SIRT1 in a well characterized colon cancer model. Given that SIRT1 was discovered as a homolog of a longevity gene, it is interesting to note the growing evidence for a link between Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling and age-associated diseases. &#x003b2;-catenin has been linked to other age-associated malignancies such as melanoma, multiple myeloma, and prostate cancer. There is also the recent discovery that upregulation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling accelerates aging in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002020-Brack1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002020-Liu1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it will be worth investigating whether SIRT1 can provide protection against other age-associated diseases on account of its ability to suppress Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling.</p><p>In summary, using biochemistry, mouse genetics, and clinical tumor specimens we have found that SIRT1, a diet-responsive gene, is a regulator of &#x003b2;-catenin and has a tumor suppressive function. We conclude that mammalian longevity genes with anti-apoptotic functions, surprisingly do not necessarily lead to increased tumorigenesis. In fact, we find the opposite is likely the case for SIRT1. These studies begin to answer an important biological question regarding the function of a key longevity gene in cancer development and growth and suggest a previously unidentified therapeutic potential for SIRT1 activators in cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Rodents</title><p>A Cre-inducible SIRT1 expression construct was generated in which a <italic>loxP</italic> flanked transcriptional STOP element was inserted between a CAGGS promoter and the SIRT1 cDNA.
