RT-PCR/3&#x02032; RACE was used to identify the endogenous gene expressed as a GFP-fusion transcript. SGNP is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleolus and defines a non-nucleolar compartment containing 5.8S rRNA, a component of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Under oxidative stress, SGNP nucleolar localization decreases and it rapidly co-localizes with stress granules. The decrease in nucleolar SGNP following oxidative stress was accompanied by a large increase in nucleolar 5.8S rRNA. Knockdown of SGNP with shRNA increased global mRNA translation but induced growth arrest and cell death.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results suggest that SGNP is an essential gene that may be involved in ribosomal biogenesis and translational control in response to oxidative stress.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Translation of &#x0201c;housekeeping&#x0201d; transcripts can be globally repressed following oxidative stress by the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003716-Mangel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In an attempt to discover factors that might confer increased cell survival following transplantation, we initiated a genetic screen for insertional mutations that conferred resistance to oxidative stress in human myoblasts. We here report the identification of a new protein, named SGNP (Stress Granule and Nucleolar Protein). SGNP is an essential gene where efficient mRNA knockdown leads to growth arrest and cell death. It localizes to both the nucleolus and cytoplasm. In addition to the nucleolus, in a small percentage of cells it can be found surrounding a previously undescribed nuclear structure that is highly enriched for 5.8S ribosomal RNA. Following exposure to sodium arsenite, SGNP nucleolar staining becomes highly reduced and the cytoplasmic staining becomes restricted to stress granules. Its association with both the nucleolus and nuclear 5.8S-enriched structures and stress granules in the cytoplasm suggests that SGNP is an essential gene involved in ribosomal processing and translational control.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation of an oxidative stress-resistant clone</title><p>In an effort to identify genes that could contribute to the increased survival of cells following transplantation, we used a retroviral gene trap approach to screen immortalized human skeletal myoblasts (LHCNM2) for insertions that lead to resistance to the oxidizing agent sodium arsenite.

The most interesting insertion identified SGNP, a gene that appears to be involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism. Its most obvious relationship to oxidative stress involved its localization to stress granules.</p><p>In addition to stress granules, SGNP is concentrated in the nucleolus and an unknown structure we call the paranucleolus. This structure was seen in only a small fraction of interphase nuclei, lacked the nucleolar protein B23, and was strongly enriched in 5.8S RNA. Intriguingly, there were SGNP-positive connections between the paranucleolus and the nuclear envelope, suggesting the possibility of an involvement with nuclear export.</p><p>More than 150 trans-acting non-ribosomal proteins that contribute to ribosomal processing have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003716-Zemp1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Pre-rRNA processing of the pre-60S ribosomal subunit is completed in the nucleus before the pre-60S ribosome containing the mature 28S, 5.8S and 5S rRNAs is exported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003716-Nissan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Processing of the immediate precursor to the mature 5.8S rRNA occurs in a nuclear exosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003716-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, but a corresponding morphologically identifiable structure has, to our knowledge, not yet been identified. The paranucleolus is a candidate for this function.</p><p>The nucleolar localization of SGNP is greatly diminished within 1 hour of treatment with 0.5 mM sodium arsenite while the abundance of nucleolar 5.8S RNA greatly increased. This inverse relationship is consistent with the hypothesis that SGNP might be involved in the processing or export of 5.8S rRNA.</p><p>In addition to a variety of specific RNA-binding proteins, SGs contain 40S but not 60S ribosomal subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003716-Kedersha1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the 5.8S rRNA is part of the 60S large ribosomal subunit, the localization of SGNP to SGs cannot be explained by its potential involvement in 5.8S processing. Our results suggest that SGNP is also a component of the cellular apparatus governing mRNA translation and cellular stress responses. Knockdown of SGNP expression resulted in an increased protein synthesis rather than the decreased protein synthesis normally seen in cells subjected to stress. Knockout of another SG component, TIA-1, has also been shown to produce an elevated level of translation of mRNAs containing the TIA-1 binding motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003716-LopezdeSilanes1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether SGNP regulates protein synthesis by similar or different mechanisms remains to be determined.</p><p>The detailed mechanisms by which SGNP influences RNA processing/export/translation awaits further investigation. However, its essential nature and its role in stress responses suggest that its study will contribute significantly to our understanding of these important processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Retroviral gene&#x02013;trap vectors</title><p>The gene trap vector pTRAP-GFP contains the splice acceptor and donor sites from the myosin heavy chain II gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003716-Hodges1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003716-Morin1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> fused to the 6His-ATG-eGFP cDNA with an ATG translational start site and no stop codons.
