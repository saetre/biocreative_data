This RNA unfolding activity is beneficial when resolving misfolded RNA conformations, but could be detrimental to RNAs with low thermodynamic stability. In order to test this idea, we constructed various RNAs with different structural stabilities derived from the thymidylate synthase (<italic>td</italic>) group I intron and measured the effect of StpA, an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> protein with RNA chaperone activity, on their splicing activity <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. While StpA promotes splicing of the wild-type <italic>td</italic> intron and of mutants with wild-type-like stability, splicing of mutants with a lower structural stability is reduced in the presence of StpA. In contrast, splicing of an intron mutant, which is not destabilized but which displays a reduced population of correctly folded RNAs, is promoted by StpA. The sensitivity of an RNA towards StpA correlates with its structural stability. By lowering the temperature to 25&#x000b0;C, a temperature at which the structure of these mutants becomes more stable, StpA is again able to stimulate splicing. These observations clearly suggest that the structural stability of an RNA determines whether the RNA chaperone activity of StpA is beneficial to folding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA molecules are synthesized as single-stranded coils and, with the exception of coding sequences, they have to fold into defined 3D structures in order to reach their functional states. The formation of alternative, non-native structures is very frequent due to the abundance of intramolecular sequence complementarities and results in structural promiscuity. The longevity of alternative, non-productive RNA structures significantly slows down folding of RNA molecules to the native state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). As a consequence, it has been postulated that RNA folding requires the aid of proteins or of other molecules with chaperoning activity [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>)].</p><p>Two types of proteins have been observed to promote RNA folding. Proteins with RNA chaperone activity are thought to interact rather non-specifically with RNA thereby accelerating RNA folding by resolving mispaired structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). They comprise a very diverse group of proteins, which have been identified by a variety of functional assays. They have initially been referred to as nucleic acid helix destabilizing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). RNA chaperone activity has been observed for the ribosomal protein, S12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), the HIV nucleocapsid protein, NCp7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), the RNA binding protein, hnRNP A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), the nucleoid associated transcriptional regulators of <italic>E.coli</italic> StpA and H-NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), <italic>E.coli</italic> protein, Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), several proteins of the large ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) and the <italic>E.coli</italic> cold shock proteins, CspA and CspE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), to mention the best studied examples.</p><p>On the other hand, there are proteins that bind specifically to a defined RNA molecule, recognizing features of its sequence or tertiary structure and leading to structural stabilization. A well-studied example of this type of protein is the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase Cyt-18 from <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, which stabilizes the structure of several group I introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Recently, a novel type of activity has been demonstrated to accelerate folding of group I introns. The DEAD box helicase Cyt-19 is recruited to the group I intron via the Cyt-18 protein and after binding, this helicase promotes splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>).</p><p>Heat shocks are detrimental to protein folding, but have probably no deleterious effect on RNA structure or folding, which renature rapidly and efficiently after heating. However, low temperatures are detrimental to RNA folding because the longevity of kinetic folding traps increasingly becomes a problem. Interestingly, the cold shock protein CspA from <italic>E.coli</italic> has been shown to exert RNA chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), suggesting that this activity is of particular importance at low temperatures. RNA folding has mainly been studied <italic>in vitro</italic> and it remains to be demonstrated to which extent RNAs misfold within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>).</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that the RNA chaperone activity observed <italic>in vitro</italic> is also detectable <italic>in vivo</italic>. We made use of the dependence of the <italic>thymidylate synthase</italic> (<italic>td</italic>) pre-mRNA on translation for efficient folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). In the absence of translation, folding of the pre-mRNA is promoted by the <italic>E.coli</italic> protein StpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). StpA promotes folding of the intron RNA by loosening tertiary structure elements which renders them more accessible to the methylating agent dimethyl sulfate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). We further observed that a mutant intron with a destabilized tertiary structure was sensitive to StpA. This raised the question of whether proteins with RNA chaperone activity have different impacts on RNA folding and whether the effects depend on the structural stability of the RNA molecule. In order to address these questions, we constructed a series of group I intron variants with different structural stabilities and tested the impact of StpA on their splicing activity. We further tested the effect of StpA at 25&#x000b0;C, a temperature at which the RNA structures are more stable, and as a consequence kinetic traps are also more persistent. Since in <italic>in vivo</italic> assays, the observed effects can be indirect, we also measured the effect of StpA on a destabilized intron mutant <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids, media and strains</title><p>All <italic>td</italic> mutant constructs were generated using the vector pTZ18U/<italic>td</italic>P6&#x00394;2 as a template for mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>).

Stems P3 and P7 form the tertiary structure, as they constitute long-range base paired elements, which fold late and are referred to as pseudoknots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Other important 3D structural elements, responsible for the formation of the overall tertiary structure, are the base triple interactions formed between stem P6 and joining region J3/4 or stem P4 and joining region J6/7, respectively. Peripheral long-range interactions occur between loops and stems (P5&#x02013;L9, L2&#x02013;P8) or loops and loops (L7.2&#x02013;L9.2). It has been suggested that the internal loop E motif located between stems P7.1 and P7.2 assists in orienting stems P7 and P3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Mutations introduced into the <italic>td</italic> intron in order to disturb these tertiary structure elements are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, their <italic>in vivo</italic> splicing activities were measured using a primer extension assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and they are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. The structural stabilities of the individual mutants were determined via UV melting and are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. It was previously shown that, in general, the thermodynamic stability of intron mutants measured <italic>in vitro</italic> correlates well with their <italic>in vivo</italic> splicing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>).</p><p>We introduced mutations into the base triples between stem P6 and joining region J3/4 (C865U) and between stem P4 and J6/7 (C49U). These base triples are crucial for the correct orientation of the major folding domains P4&#x02013;P6 and P3&#x02013;P8. The mutations were chosen in such a way that GC pairs were altered to GU pairs in order to avoid disruption of stems P6 and P4. The activity of these mutants is reduced to &#x0223c;24 and 22% splicing, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>In stem P3 we introduced one mutation on either side of the helix, destabilizing the element to various extents. In the <italic>td</italic>A42G mutant, an AU pair is altered to a GU pair, affecting splicing only marginally. The <italic>td</italic>U912C mutation, however, results in an AC mismatch in P3 and reduces the splicing activity to 25%. The compensatory mutation <italic>td</italic>A42G/U912C stabilizes P3 and restores wild-type splicing levels.</p><p>Mutations that disrupt stem P7 are more detrimental to splicing than mutations disturbing the base triples or disrupting stem P3, showing &#x0003c;10% splicing activity. The C870A mutation was used because it has an alternative pairing option with U947.

The same holds true for the analogous mutant <italic>td</italic>C49U, which weakens an equivalent interaction between stem P4 and joining region J6/7, suggesting that both base triple interactions contribute equally to the structure of the intron and that the StpA sensitivity is not limited to the <italic>td</italic>C865U mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Nucleotide changes which weaken stems P3 and P7 result in <italic>td</italic> mutants, whose splicing activity is also reduced in the presence of StpA. This sensitivity correlates with the structural stability of the mutants as determined by UV melting experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). For example, the <italic>td</italic>U912C mutant in P3, whose melting temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) is 14&#x000b0;C lower than that of wt, shows a splicing activity of &#x0223c;25%, which is reduced more than 2-fold in the presence of StpA. The <italic>td</italic>A42G mutant, which is only slightly affected in splicing and whose <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> is 53.5&#x000b0;C compared to the wild-type's <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 55.6&#x000b0;C, is only weakly sensitive to StpA. The <italic>td</italic>A42G/U912C double mutant displays wild-type activity and is not sensitive to StpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Mutations disrupting P7 have a strong effect on splicing and they are also highly sensitive to StpA. The splicing activity of the <italic>td</italic>C873U mutant is reduced 3-fold and the <italic>td</italic>C870A mutant is reduced from 31 to 23% in the presence of StpA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Mutants with weakened long-range tertiary interactions, <italic>td</italic>G24A, <italic>td</italic>U899C and <italic>td</italic>G960A, do not display sensitivity to StpA, probably because the loss of a single long-range pairing does not considerably destabilize the tertiary structure. These mutants are also not efficiently rescued by Cyt-18 suggesting that the lost interaction cannot be compensated for by the binding of Cyt-18. These long-range interactions have previously been shown to exert cooperative effects on the structural stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), and these regions are not part of the primary Cyt-18 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>).</p><p>Most interesting is the observation that the only mutant that is stimulated by StpA is the <italic>td</italic>G905A mutant in the loop E motif, which joins stems P7.1 and P7.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The loop E motif is often found in complex RNA structures and is thought to be involved in the higher order structural organization of domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). In the <italic>td</italic> intron, the loop E motif contacts stem P7 and is responsible for a late step in the folding pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> shows the first derivative of the UV melting profile of the loop E motif mutant compared to those of the wild-type and the base triple mutant <italic>td</italic>C865U. The wild-type <italic>td</italic> intron displays two melting transitions, a low temperature transition at 56.2&#x000b0;C corresponding to the melting of the tertiary structure and a high temperature transition corresponding to the melting of the secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). The melting transition of the tertiary structure in the <italic>td</italic>G905A mutant is at 53.2&#x000b0;C, almost as stable as the wild type, but the reduced height of the peak is indicative of a lower population of correctly folded molecules. This suggests that the structural phenotype of the <italic>td</italic>G905A mutant might be a folding defect rather than a structural destabilization (C. Waldsich and R. Schroeder, unpublished work). In contrast, the <italic>td</italic>C865U mutant displays a profile characteristic of molecules with destabilized structures, because the tertiary structure already melts between 35 and 40&#x000b0;C. A small peak is detectable at 56&#x000b0;C, which has not been assigned to a specific structural transition.</p><p>When comparing the effect of StpA on the splicing activity of different mutant <italic>td</italic> introns, it is clear that the structural stability of the mutants determines whether the RNA chaperone activities aid or impede the folding process. The sensitivity towards StpA correlates well with changes in <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>, thus with the structural destabilization. Splicing of mutants with strongly destabilized tertiary structures is further reduced in the presence of StpA, whereas splicing of the wild-type and mutant introns with stable structures is inert or further promoted by StpA.</p></sec><sec><title>StpA promotes splicing of destabilized mutants at 25&#x000b0;C</title><p>The wild-type intron construct splices to &#x0223c;70% at optimal conditions when expressed from a plasmid and is further stimulated by the presence of StpA to &#x0223c;80%. We rationalized that by lowering the temperature, folding might be slower due to the structural stabilization of non-productive intermediates and that proteins with RNA chaperone activity might be of increasing importance for RNA folding in the cold. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows the splicing activity of a wild-type <italic>td</italic> construct at 37 and 25&#x000b0;C. The drop in temperature has a strong effect on the splicing activity, which decreases from 77 to 32%. This reduction might be due to a decrease in the folding rate and to a slowing down of the chemical step. We asked whether StpA improves wild-type <italic>td</italic> splicing at 25&#x000b0;C. For this purpose we co-expressed the <italic>td</italic> gene with StpA at 25 and 37&#x000b0;C. StpA was indeed able to promote splicing of the wild-type <italic>td</italic> intron at 25&#x000b0;C, suggesting that RNA chaperones can counteract RNA misfolding at low temperatures.</p><p>Given that the structural stability determines whether an RNA chaperone is beneficial or detrimental to folding, we rationalized that by lowering the temperature and thereby stabilizing the RNA structure, the RNA chaperone activity of StpA could become more beneficial and less detrimental to structurally compromised intron mutants. In order to test this idea, we measured the effect of StpA on the splicing activity of two structurally destabilized mutants, <italic>td</italic>C865U in stem P6 and <italic>td</italic>U912C in stem P3 at 25&#x000b0;C. Both mutants are highly sensitive to the presence of StpA at 37&#x000b0;C. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows that the splicing activity of these mutants is very low at 25&#x000b0;C and that StpA indeed promotes rather than decrease splicing as it does at 37&#x000b0;C. These results provide further evidence that the structural stability of the RNA influences the effect of StpA on folding.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> splicing of the C865U mutant is sensitive to an StpA mutant with increased RNA chaperone activity</title><p>All the above effects of StpA on the various <italic>td</italic> intron mutants were measured <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>In vivo</italic> effects can be indirect and caused by other factors, which might be influenced by StpA. In order to ensure that the effects we observed are really due to the RNA chaperone activity of StpA, we tested its effect on the wild-type and the C865U mutant <italic>in vitro</italic>. A <italic>cis</italic>-splicing assay was used that was established to enable quantitative assessment of RNA chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). For this purpose a pre-RNA construct was used, which is highly impaired in folding. This construct contains 27 nt of exon 1 and only 2 nt of exon 2. When incubated for 1 min at 95&#x000b0;C and with subsequent folding at 37&#x000b0;C in the presence of 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, only 40&#x02013;50% of the population of RNA molecules reach their native structure and splice rapidly with a <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> of 0.2 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. 50&#x02013;60% of the population fold slowly displaying a <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> of 0.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Addition of StpA to this reaction promotes folding of the wild type such that 60% reach the native state and splice with a <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> of 0.4 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The <italic>td</italic>C865U mutant in the short exon context, splices similarly to the wild type under these conditions, but is less stimulated by StpA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). We also used a variant of StpA, which contains a point mutation in the nucleic acid binding domain, StpA-G126V, which has a higher RNA chaperone activity than wild-type StpA (O. Mayer, R. Grossberger and R. Schroeder, manuscript in preparation). While this StpA variant strongly stimulates splicing of the wild-type <italic>td</italic> intron, it has a slightly negative effect on splicing of the <italic>td</italic>C865U mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). As mentioned before, the <italic>td</italic>C865U mutant has a reduced structural stability. These results confirm our <italic>in vivo</italic> observations and clearly demonstrate that the effect we observe <italic>in vivo</italic> is reproducible <italic>in vitro</italic> and that RNA molecules with reduced structural stability are inhibited in their folding process by the RNA chaperone activity of StpA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Splicing of the <italic>td</italic> group I intron requires folding of the pre-mRNA into its native tertiary structure. The ribosome promotes folding of the pre-mRNA by resolving non-productive exon&#x02013;intron interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). In the absence of translation, folding can alternatively be aided by the group I intron specific splicing factor Cyt-18, or by StpA, a protein that exerts RNA chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). However, the two proteins assist intron folding in opposite ways. While Cyt-18 recognizes and binds the intron RNA specifically, thereby stabilizing its structure, StpA unfolds the intron RNA giving it another chance to fold correctly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). The RNA unfolding activity of StpA is beneficial when resolving misfolded RNA conformations but could be detrimental to RNAs with compromised structural stability. We addressed this question by measuring the influence of StpA on the splicing activity of a series of mutant <italic>td</italic> introns with a reduced structural stability. We had previously observed that StpA increased the accessibility of bases involved in tertiary interactions, but not of those involved in secondary structure elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). Since the tertiary structure interactions of the <italic>td</italic> intron contribute to the overall stability of an RNA molecule and are less stable than secondary structure elements, we hypothesized that the structural stability of the target RNA dictates whether the RNA chaperone activity of StpA is beneficial or detrimental to RNA folding and in turn to splicing. Therefore we disrupted or destabilized tertiary interactions and analyzed the extent to which StpA affected the splicing activity of these mutants.</p><sec><title>Correlation between structural stability and sensitivity towards StpA</title><p>Splicing of mutant introns, which are structurally destabilized, is sensitive to StpA. Importantly, there is a correlation between the extent to which structural stability is reduced and the extent to which StpA affects the splicing activity. For example, changing an AU to a GU base pair in stem P3 results in a very low sensitivity towards StpA, whereas introducing an AC mismatch at the same position displays a high sensitivity. A GC pair at this position, however, does not induce sensitivity. We conclude from these results that when stem P3 is only slightly destabilized, the RNA chaperone activity of StpA unfolds P3 only to some extent. However, upon destabilizing stem P3 by a mismatch, StpA further unfolds P3 and as a consequence further reduces splicing. Similar effects were observed for highly destabilized mutants with the exception of those that have weakened peripheral tertiary long-range interactions. In these mutants a single tertiary interaction is altered without significantly destabilizing the entire intron structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>).</p><p>Notably, we are measuring the splicing activity of the intron RNA and are deducing effects on RNA folding from changes in the activity. We are confident that this is an acceptable approach because the chemical step is much faster than folding, which is rate-limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Furthermore, we had previously observed that for the <italic>td</italic> group I intron, <italic>in vivo</italic> splicing activity correlates well with structural stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Since we measure activity and do not determine the folding state, we cannot distinguish between kinetic and thermodynamic effects of StpA on the intron RNA. StpA might equally well resolve P3 in all constructs, but since folding and, as a consequence, splicing are slowed down in the structurally destabilized mutants, the RNA chaperone activity might in those cases be faster than the splicing activity. Also, <italic>in vitro</italic> the unfolding activity of StpA on the wild-type intron RNA is slower than the chemical step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). We further confirmed our <italic>in vivo</italic> observations by an <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing assay. At the reaction conditions (5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>) used, the <italic>td</italic>C865U mutant splices as well as the wild type, because the increased magnesium rescues splicing activity. The wild-type StpA protein can still promote folding of this intron mutant, although less efficiently. The sensitivity towards the RNA chaperone activity is only observed when a variant of StpA is used which has a stronger RNA chaperone activity. We suggest that this is due to the different ionic conditions required for efficient <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing. These results nevertheless clearly demonstrate that the RNA chaperone activity of proteins can be detrimental to folding of RNAs with reduced structural stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Misfolded molecules are rescued by StpA</title><p>In contrast to all structurally destabilized mutants, splicing of the <italic>td</italic>G905A mutant which represents an alteration in the loop E motif that joins stems P7.1 and P7.2, is stimulated by StpA. We propose that perturbation of the loop E motif facilitates misfolding of the intron core without destabilizing structural elements. StpA can then assist in folding by resolving misfolded structures and enabling the molecules to fold correctly. This is also consistent with the view that the loop E motif serves as a structural scaffold for folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). These results are also in agreement with our previous observations that mutants containing non-sense codons in the upstream exon, which prevent the ribosome from translating the pre-mRNA and resolving non-productive exon&#x02013;intron interactions, are impaired in splicing but, like the loop E motif mutant, rescued by StpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we showed that splicing of the wild-type <italic>td</italic> intron is inefficient at 25&#x000b0;C and that StpA also promotes splicing <italic>in vivo</italic> in the cold. The potential of StpA to rescue folding and therefore splicing at low temperatures might reflect an important functional aspect of RNA chaperones in general and supports the hypothesis that RNA chaperones could be of particular biological significance for the RNA metabolism in organisms subjected to temperature drops. These findings demonstrate that at low temperatures the RNA folding problem is of increasing significance requiring efficient RNA chaperone activity. This aspect of RNA folding needs investigation and might help clarify the general task of proteins with RNA chaperone activity.</p><p>Altogether, our data demonstrate that StpA acts by destabilizing structural elements of the intron RNA, which are partially open or not compactly folded both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. StpA and probably many other proteins with RNA chaperone activity might play a significant role in the folding of RNA molecules in the cell by acting as quality control agents for RNA conformation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank N.
