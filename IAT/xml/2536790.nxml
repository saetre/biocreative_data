We now report that <italic>H. pylori</italic> stimulates the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and its receptor (uPAR) in gastric epithelial cells and the consequences for epithelial cell proliferation. Real-time PCR of biopsies from gastric corpus, but not antrum, showed significantly increased PAI-1, uPA, and uPAR in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients. Transfection of primary human gastric epithelial cells with uPA, PAI-1, or uPAR promoters in luciferase reporter constructs revealed expression of all three in H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>ATPase- and vesicular monoamine transporter 2-expressing cells; uPA was also expressed in pepsinogen- and uPAR-containing trefoil peptide-1-expressing cells. In each case expression was increased in response to <italic>H. pylori</italic> and for uPA, but not PAI-1 or uPAR, required the virulence factor CagE. <italic>H. pylori</italic> also stimulated soluble and cell surface-bound uPA activity, and both were further increased by PAI-1 knockdown, consistent with PAI-1 inhibition of endogenous uPA. <italic>H. pylori</italic> stimulated epithelial cell proliferation, which was inhibited by uPA immunoneutralization and uPAR knockdown; exogenous uPA also stimulated proliferation that was further increased after PAI-1 knockdown. The proliferative effects of uPA were inhibited by immunoneutralization of the EGF receptor and of heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) by the mutant diphtheria toxin CRM197 and an EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. <italic>H. pylori</italic> induction of uPA therefore leads to epithelial proliferation through activation of HB-EGF and is normally inhibited by concomitant induction of PAI-1; treatments directed at inhibition of uPA may slow the progression to gastric cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>gastric cancer</kwd><kwd>primary gastric epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>cagE</kwd><kwd>HB-EGF</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.

These changes may lead eventually to gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>). Environmental and bacterial factors are both recognized to influence the progression of these changes with chronic infection. In addition, host factors that influence epithelial responses to infection have been identified including genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>), altered expression, and secretion of hormones, e.g., gastrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>), growth factors such as heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>), cytokines including IL-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>), and extracellular proteases such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>). Although considerable progress has been made in recent years, the interactions between these systems are still poorly understood.</p><p>In many different tissues, the responses to infection and injury include induction of members of the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). The key components of this system are uPA itself, which mediates the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, its receptor (uPAR), which localizes uPA on the cell surface, and several plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1, -2, and -3). Stimulation of uPA/plasmin is implicated in fibrinolysis, degradation of extracellular matrix, activation of other proteases including multiple MMPs, and modulation of cell-matrix interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>). In addition to inhibition of uPA, both PAI-1 and PAI-2 are recognized to have uPA-independent actions. In the case of PAI-1, these are thought, at least in part, to be a consequence of binding to vitronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). Moreover, although PAI-2 is a secreted protein, its signal sequence is relatively weak and there is a substantial pool of intracellular PAI-2 that is thought to play a role in inhibiting apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>); the biology of PAI-3 is not well understood. Until recently the role of this system in gastric physiology and pathophysiology was relatively unknown.</p><p>Recently, we reported increased expression of PAI-2 in the gastric epithelium in patients infected with <italic>H. pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>). Previous studies have contributed to the view that uPA, PAI-1, and uPAR are all associated with an adverse outcome in gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>), as well as other tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>). However, the roles of these proteins in response to <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in the normal epithelium are unknown. In the present study, we therefore asked whether there is <italic>H. pylori</italic> stimulation of uPA, uPAR, or PAI-1 in human gastric epithelial cells; we report here that there is and that induction is linked to a proliferative response to infection.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Plasmids, drugs.</title><p>PAI-1 antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) and control scrambled oligonucleotides (CSO) were obtained from Biognostik (Gottingham, Germany).

In untransfected cells, there was expression of wild-type uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 in subsets of parietal cells (identified by H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>ATPase staining), chief cells (identified by pepsinogen staining), enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) cells (identified by chromogranin staining), and mucus cells (identified by TFF-1 staining) (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>E</italic>). Generally, around 25&#x02013;30&#x00025; of parietal, chief, or ECL cells expressed uPA, uPAR, or PAI-1; however, PAI-1 was expressed in a relatively high proportion of ECL cells, and uPA was expressed in less than 10&#x00025; of chief cells (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>E</italic></xref>). uPA, uPAR, or PAI-1 were expressed in less than 15&#x00025; of mucus cells (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>E</italic></xref>). In cells transfected with luciferase promoter-reporter vectors, dual labeling immunofluorescence using antibodies to luciferase and to markers of parietal and ECL cells indicated that expression of the constructs was predominantly targeted to these cells.

A role for uPAR in the response was indicated by the observation that knockdown of uPAR with siRNA significantly inhibited <italic>H. pylori</italic>-induced proliferation (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>). Immunohistochemistry confirmed that siRNA treatment significantly decreased the number of uPAR-expressing cells in cultured gastric glands (control, 9.1 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x00025; of positive cells; uPAR knockdown, 3.0 &#x000b1; 0.4&#x00025;), whereas PAI-1 expression was not altered (8.4 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x00025; vs. 8.8 &#x000b1; 0.4&#x00025;). Consistent with these observations, the increased BrdU incorporation in response to exogenous uPA was also decreased by uPAR knockdown (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). The specificity of the latter effect is indicated by the fact that there was no decrease in BrdU incorporation after uPAR knockdown in response to an exogenous EGF receptor (EGF-R) ligand (EGF, 50 ng/ml) compared with control (EGF alone, 2.14 &#x000b1; 0.05-fold increase in BrdU incorporation over control; EGF and uPAR knockdown, 2.36 &#x000b1; 0.03-fold).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>uPA increases epithelial cell proliferation via metalloproteinase release of HB-EGF.</title><p>Since there was increased BrdU incorporation in response to exogenous EGF, we asked whether the proliferative response to uPA was linked to activation of the EGF pathway. Neutralizing antibody against EGF-R significantly reduced BrdU incorporation induced by uPA, and so too did the EGF-R tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG1478 (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>). Moreover, neutralizing antibody to HB-EGF inhibited BrdU incorporation in response to uPA (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>B</italic></xref>), and, in agreement with the idea that HB-EGF mediated responses to uPA, the mutant diphtheria toxin CRM197 also reduced uPA-mediated BrdU incorporation (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>B</italic></xref>). Interestingly, however, responses to uPA were not influenced by neutralization of other EGF-R ligands such as amphiregulin and TGF-&#x003b1; that are known to be expressed in gastric mucosa (uPA, 1.90 &#x000b1; 0.12-fold increase over control; uPA and amphiregulin immunoneutralization, 1.74 &#x000b1; 0.15-fold over control; uPA and TGF-&#x003b1; immunoneutralization, 2.10 &#x000b1; 0.15-fold over control). Since it is known that HB-EGF is released by metalloproteinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>), we examined the effect of a broad spectrum inhibitor, GM6001, and two tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP-1 and TIMP-3) on proliferative response to uPA. At a concentration of 100 nM, TIMP-1 inhibited BrdU incorporation by 21 &#x000b1; 5&#x00025; and TIMP-3 inhibited by 69 &#x000b1; 10&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), whereas GM6001 inhibited uPA responses by 70 &#x000b1; 12&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present data show that <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection of the human gastric corpus is associated with increased expression of uPA, its receptor uPAR, and its inhibitor PAI-1. It seems probable that separate mechanisms are associated with increased expression of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1. Thus within the epithelium, both parietal and ECL cells have the capacity to increase uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 expression in response to <italic>H. pylori</italic>, whereas chief cells can also express uPA, and mucus cells may express uPAR. Moreover, the CagE virulence factor is required for uPA responses to <italic>H. pylori</italic> but not PAI-1 or uPAR. A role for uPA and uPAR in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-stimulated cell proliferation was identified through mechanisms that required HB-EGF and EGF-R activation and were at least partly held in check by PAI-1. The data implicate activation of uPA in the preneoplastic hyperproliferative condition that is associated with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. Control of uPA activity may therefore present a new target in arresting <italic>H. pylori</italic>-stimulated progression to cancer.</p><p>Previous work has established that uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 are increased in gastric cancer and in chronic atrophic gastritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>); moreover, increased expression in cancer is associated with an adverse outcome. There is expression of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 in both stromal and tumor cells, and it is generally thought that the expression of these proteins is associated with progression of the disease through increased cell invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. In the case of uPA, binding to uPAR generates a focal point of proteolytic activity that facilitates cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>). In addition to inhibition of uPA through accelerated internalization of the uPA/uPAR complex, PAI-1 also exhibits uPA-independent actions. Specifically, by binding vitronectin it increases cell dissociation from extracellular matrix and accelerates invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). It has been suggested that the latter effects account for the association of increased PAI-1 in gastric and other cancers with adverse outcomes, which is sometimes referred to as &#x0201c;paradoxical&#x0201d; given that uPA is also associated with disease progression. In spite of the work on uPA and PAI-1 in gastric cancer, little attention has been given to how this system responds to <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and how it might be implicated in the tissue remodeling that characterizes the preneoplastic condition.</p><p>We previously showed that PAI-2 was increased in gastric epithelial cells in response to <italic>H. pylori</italic> via activation of NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>). A pool of PAI-2 is retained within cells and is associated with inhibition of apoptosis, whereas some is secreted and has been shown to be involved in inhibition of invasion of a cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>). The present data now make it clear that infection with <italic>H. pylori</italic> also induces the main members of the system, uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 in primary, untransformed, gastric epithelial cells; there was no evidence that a third inhibitor, PAI-3, was changed with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, and we did not study this further. Previous work using microarrays to identify <italic>H. pylori</italic>-regulated genes demonstrated increased uPA in gastric cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>), and there has been work using gastric cancer cell lines that indicates <italic>H. pylori</italic> stimulation of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>). However, given the nature of cancer cell lines, it remained uncertain how these observations related to expression of members of the uPA system in primary gastric epithelial cells. Our data show that with infection there is the capacity to increase uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 expression in two cell types associated with the gastric corpus, namely the acid-secreting parietal cell and the histamine-releasing enterochromaffin-like cell; the restriction of both cell types to the gastric corpus is consistent with the observation that there was no difference in expression of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 in the antral region of the stomach (where these cell types are absent). In contrast, PAI-2 is prominently expressed in mucin- and pepsinogen-expressing cells and is only occasionally found in parietal or ECL cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>); it is also increased in the antrum in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients (S. Kenny and A. Varro, unpublished observations). Interestingly, only subsets of the major differentiated gastric epithelial cell types expressed uPA, uPAR, or PAI-1; the basis of this requires further work because the different subsets might, for example, vary in terms of age. It is clear that promoters of the length we used in the luciferase reporter vectors do not precisely mimic the patterns of expression of the wild-type gene, indicating that information outside these sequences is required for faithful cell-restricted expression. Even so, at a qualitative level the general patterns of expression of the wild-type proteins and the promoter-reporter vectors were similar. Importantly, the increased abundance of uPA transcripts in response to <italic>H. pylori</italic> was associated with increased enzyme activity in normal gastric epithelial cells that was enhanced still further by blocking PAI-1 expression compatible with a dynamic equilibrium between enzyme and its inhibitor, and with the idea that the changes in transcript abundance were functionally relevant.</p><p><italic>H. pylori</italic> increases plasma gastrin concentrations, and parietal and ECL cells express the CCK-2 receptor at which gastrin acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). However, increased abundance of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 transcripts was found in patients infected with <italic>H. pylori</italic> with plasma gastrin concentrations in the normal range, and <italic>H. pylori</italic> stimulation of promoter-reporter constructs occurred in epithelial cells in vitro (in the absence of gastrin) so that the effects of <italic>H. pylori</italic> are not secondary to increased gastrin. Although stimulation of uPAR and PAI-1 was independent of the pathogenicity island, we found that a <italic>cagE</italic> isogenic mutant was defective in uPA induction. Disruption of <italic>cagE</italic> means that <italic>H. pylori</italic> cannot make a functional type IV secretory apparatus. This has two effects: first, it blocks Nod1-NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, and second, it blocks delivery of CagA into epithelial cells and the signaling consequent on this. Since disruption of <italic>cagA</italic> had no effect on uPA induction, it is likely that the deficit seen in the <italic>cagE</italic> mutant is due to lack of stimulation of Nod1-NF-&#x003ba;B. This is compatible with the already described role of NF-&#x003ba;B in regulation of uPA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>). It is worth noting that, in MKN-45 and KATO III cell lines, <italic>H. pylori</italic> stimulation of uPA expression was reported to be abolished by mutation of CagA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>); differences between cancer cell lines and primary, untransformed, cells used in the present study may well account for this difference.</p><p>The data link <italic>H. pylori</italic> induction of uPA to one of the key characteristics of preneoplastic, <italic>H. pylori</italic>-infected epithelium, namely increased cell proliferation. Previous work has shown that <italic>H. pylori</italic> stimulates proliferation and that this includes transactivation of the EGF receptor and stimulation of HB-EGF cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>). We demonstrate that the proliferative response of normal human gastric epithelial cells to uPA is mediated by EGF-R. It is possible that there are interactions between ligand-bound uPAR and EGF-R that result in proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). However, the cells expressing uPAR in gastric glands (mainly parietal and ECL cells) are distinct from the proliferating cells, and, instead, the data suggest that uPA stimulates proliferation via the release of an EGF-R ligand, HB-EGF. This system is therefore distinct from prostatic DU-145 cells in which uPA-stimulated invasion is mediated by HB-EGF in an autocrine mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). Other ligands of EGF-R produced in the gastric epithelium include amphiregulin and TGF-&#x003b1;; however, in contrast to HB-EGF, immunoneutralization of amphiregulin and TGF-&#x003b1; did not inhibit the proliferative responses to uPA. It is known that HB-EGF is cleaved from its cell-bound precursor via proteases that include TNF-&#x003b1;-converting enzyme (ADAM-17) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>), MMP-3 and MMP-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>), and matrilysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). There is also a considerable body of evidence indicating that in different systems there are cascades of proteolytic activation involving uPA, plasmin, and MMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>). The data show GM6001, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3 inhibit the action of uPA, consistent with a role for metalloproteinases downstream of uPA although the precise sequence of events by which uPA activates HB-EGF remains to be determined. In this context, it is worth noting, however, that, although uPA activates MMPs and MMPs are known to be increased with <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, the localization of MMPs in the gastrointestinal mucosa is for the most part subepithelial. Within the normal gastric epithelium, MMP-7 is the predominant representative of this group, and we have already shown that this does not stimulate proliferation in cultured gastric glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>).</p><p>The well-established association of uPA with pericellular proteolysis in tissue damage and repair raises the prospect that induction of the system in <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection is part of a host response mechanism relevant to the tissue remodeling characteristic of this infection. Previous work has established a variety of different ways that bacteria interact with the uPA system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). In the case of <italic>H. pylori,</italic> two plasminogen-binding proteins have been identified that are proposed to coat the organism, and, with the subsequent activation of bound plasminogen to plasmin, these proteins are thought to increase virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). The present data suggest a further role for this system in stimulation of cell proliferation. With prolonged infection, we suggest that the increased proliferation favors the acquisition of mutations leading to cancer. The present data therefore raise the possibility that inhibition of uPA might be therapeutically useful in those patients at risk of progression from gastric atrophy to cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>GRANTS</title><p>This work was supported by Medical Research Council, The Wellcome Trust, and Wolfson Foundation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Mrs. Debbie Sales for culturing <italic>H. pylori</italic>, Mr. Andy Dodson for technical help with the immunohistochemistry, and Dr. Fiona Campbell for help with the interpretation of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 staining.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><name><surname>Andreasen</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name>, Egelund R, Petersen HH.
