ORC is composed of six subunits (Orc1p-6p) that are essential for viability. Its central role is in the initiation of DNA replication, serving as a scaffold for the recruitment of critical initiator proteins such as Cdc6p and Mcm2p-7p that assemble into a pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) in G1 phase (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). An important determinant of origin firing in S-phase is the binding of key initiation factors such as Cdc45p to autonomous replicating sequences (<italic>ARS</italic>s) just prior to origin firing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and melting of the duplex DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Whereas ORC remains bound to <italic>ARS </italic>sequences throughout S phase, Cdc45p and other initiation factors such as the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex become associated with the advancing replication fork [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition to its well characterized function in mediating the initiation of DNA replication, ORC also contributes to the formation of silent chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Moreover, in human cells, additional functions have been reported for ORC subunits in sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome segregation, and cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Activation of each of the estimated 400 individual origins in the yeast genome occurs at different times in S-phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The timing and efficiency of origin activation also appears to be dependent on the chromosomal context of a given origin (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]). For instance, in yeast, the repressive heterochromatin structure found near telomeres confers late replication timing to origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] Implicating chromatin structure directly in the regulation of DNA replication, the activity of ORC-occupied origins in yeast depends on the nearby orderly positioning of nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], This suggests that the local chromatin structure adjacent to <italic>ARSs</italic>, and by inference the proper positioning of nucleosomes and/or the modification states of histones affects origin activation.</p><p>Acetylation and deacetylation of the core histones is an important mechanism by which chromatin structure regulates DNA-dependent processes. Most histone acetyltransferases (HATs) identified in yeast to date are components of nuclear multi-subunit protein complexes that remodel chromatin structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These include Esa1p, Sas2p and Sas3p, which are members of the highly conserved MYST (MOZ, YBF2/Sas3, Sas2, and Tip60) family, and Gcn5p, Elp3p, and Hpa2p, which are members of the GNAT (Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase) superfamily. Although these HAT complexes, and histone deacetylases (HDACs), control gene expression through modulation of the transcriptional machinery (i.e. promoter usage), increasing evidence suggests that one or more of these complexes may have analogous roles in chromatin remodeling during DNA replication and DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In yeast, deletion of the highly conserved yeast HDAC <italic>RPD3</italic>, which normally deacetylates histones H3 and H4, results in premature origin firing and advanced entry into S-phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Conversely, artificial tethering of the HAT Gcn5p, which preferentially acetylates nucleosome-bound histone H3, results in earlier origin activation of the late origin <italic>ARS1412 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Another HDAC, Sir2p, which mediates transcriptional silencing in yeast, has also been implicated in the regulation of pre-RC formation and origin activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila </italic>follicle cells, the patterns of histone acetylation correlate closely with origin activity and ORC binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. While artificial tethering of the HDAC Rpd3p near to an origin results in reduced firing, recruitment of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>MYST-related HAT Chameau stimulates origin activity. These results imply that regulated acetylation of histone tails likely plays a direct role in regulating origins in eukaryotes. Intriguingly, a human member of the MYST family of HATs, Hbo1p, physically interacts with ORC in tissue culture cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], suggesting a plausible role for ORC in directing histone acetylation of nucleosomes adjacent to origin DNA.</p><p>One of the first discovered yeast HATs, Hat1p, has been linked to histone deposition, nucleosome formation and chromatin assembly during ongoing DNA replication and DNA repair, rather than to a more common function in the regulation of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Hat1p was originally identified as a cytoplasmic enzyme that acetylates free, but not chromatin-bound, histone H4 specifically on lysine residues 5 and 12 (K5/12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This pattern of N-terminal acetylation is thought to facilitate the assembly of newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 into chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and appears to be evolutionarily conserved, as homologs exhibiting similar target specificity <italic>in vitro </italic>have been detected in other eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Recently, Hat1p was identified as the catalytic core component of a trimeric nuclear complex with two tightly associated co-factors, namely Hat2p and Hif1p (Hat1p-interacting factor 1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]). Hat2p, a homolog of the human retinoblastoma binding protein Rba48p, acts as adaptor for high affinity binding of Hat1p to histone H4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], whereas Hif1p is a histone chaperone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Hif1p is detected exclusively in nuclei, and may accompany newly modified H3&#x02013;H4 tetramers to facilitate incorporation into nascent chromatin during DNA synthesis. Yeast strains deficient in either <italic>HAT1 </italic>or <italic>HAT2 </italic>exhibit no obvious growth deficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, gene silencing at telomeres is reduced when <italic>hat1&#x00394; </italic>or <italic>hat2&#x00394; </italic>null alleles are combined with substitution mutations blocking acetylation of the amino terminal tail of histone H3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This combinatorial effect is phenocopied by combining the same H3 alleles with a lysine 12 to arginine mutation in histone H4 that prevents acetylation, consistent with the known target specificity of Hat1p/Hat2p. Moreover, <italic>hat1&#x00394; </italic>in combination with N-terminal lysine substitution alleles in histone H3 confers hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Similar phenotypes are recapitulated with deletions in the <italic>HIF1 </italic>gene in combination with H3 tail mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Collectively, these data point to the overlapping of acetylation of the N-terminal tail of histone H3 and Hat1p-mediated acetylation of histone H4 in chromosome dynamics.</p><p>In extensive synthetic lethal screens that were undertaken to search for novel candidate proteins with potential roles in DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], an unexpected genetic interaction between ORC and the <italic>HAT1 </italic>and <italic>HAT2 </italic>genes was uncovered. Here, we describe the identification of a novel Hat1p/Hat2p sub-complex, which is stably bound to ORC, but which lacks Hif1p and is therefore distinct from the Hat1p/Hat2p-Hif1p chromatin assembly complex. Molecular genetic and biochemical studies further indicate functional relationships among Hat1p/Hat2p, ORC, the acetylation of both histones H3/H4, and DNA replication. Collectively, our results suggest a previously overlooked role for a specific conserved HAT in DNA replication in addition to its defined role in chromatin assembly, and point towards partly redundant histone acetylation activities in the control of origin firing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Physical interaction of ORC with Hat1p and Hat2p</title><p>To search for additional proteins that interact with Hat1p, we used the tandem affinity purification (TAP) technique, which has proven to be an effective method for detecting protein complexes in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. TAP-tagged versions of Hat1p were purified 10<sup>6</sup>-fold to virtual homogeneity from soluble cell extracts derived from large-scale log-phase cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. As expected, Hat1p co-purified with Hat2p and Hif1p (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In addition, and unexpectedly, we detected each of the six subunits of ORC in independent purifications of TAP-tagged Hat1p. The association of ORC was sub-stoichiometric relative to Hat1p, Hat2p and Hif1p, but reproducible and highly specific in that ORC was detected in only a few other successful purifications of over 2500 different yeast proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Physical interaction of ORC with the Hat1p/Hat2p complex</bold>.

In addition to all known subunits of the ORC complex, Hat1p and Hat2p were often detected, albeit again sub-stoichiometrically and not easily visible by silver stain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,B</xref>). We independently tested the ORC-Hat1p interaction by immunoprecipitation of an endogenously myc-tagged version of Hat1p using a monoclonal antibody specific for Orc3p (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation with this antibody led to the detection of myc-tagged Hat1p as seen with myc-tagged Orc5p (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), whereas these proteins were not detected in immunoprecipitations with an anti-GFP control antibody. When we tested for the association of Hat2p and Hif1p with ORC using an ORC3-specific antibody, we found that ORC interacts with Hat2p but not Hif1p (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Importantly, co-immunoprecipitation of Hat1p with ORC was also observed when precipitated proteins were treated with the DNA-degrading enzyme benzonase (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The constitutive association of Hat1p/Hat2p with ORC</bold>.

Notably, Hat1p was observed in sub-stoichiometric amounts when Hif1-TAP was purified whereas the Hat2p/Hif1p association was unaffected by <italic>HAT1 </italic>deletion. Given that the association of Hat1p/Hat2p with ORC was only weakly visible by SDS-PAGE/silver staining gel, concentrated purification products were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against the Orc2p, Orc3p, and Orc5p subunits (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Upon repeated purification of Hif1-TAP, the Hat2p and Hat1p subunits were identified, but ORC was conspicuously absent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C,D</xref>). Importantly, we also found that ORC remains associated with Hat1p/Hat2p even in a strain where <italic>HIF1 </italic>is deleted, whereas loss of Hat2p leads to disintegration of the entire complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Collectively, our analysis confirms a specific, and previously overlooked, physical interaction between ORC and a Hat1p/Hat2p sub-complex that is distinct from the established nuclear Hat1p/Hat2p-Hif1p.</p><p>To assess the enzymatic functions of the purified complexes, we assayed the transfer of <sup>14</sup>C-labeled acetyl-CoA by the Hat1p sub-complexes onto purified core histones from chicken erythrocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). In agreement with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], we found that histone acetyltransferase activity by Hat1p was enhanced approximately 10-fold in the presence of Hat2p. Substrate specificity and activity on histones, however, seemed not to be altered by the presence of Hif1p and ORC. When we tested for the <italic>in vivo </italic>association of Lys12-acetylated histone H4 by Western blot, we found that it is largely dependent on intact Hat1p complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). The absence of Hat1p or Hat2p leads to a complete loss of acetylated histone H4 from the residual complex components, implying both of these factors in the interaction with acetylated H4.</p><p>Considering the role of ORC in the formation of the pre-RC during G1 phase, we next examined if the association of Hat1p with ORC was cell-cycle dependent. We performed co-immunoprecipitations using whole cell extracts prepared from yeast cultures arrested either in G1 phase with &#x003b1;-factor, in S-phase with hydroxyurea, or in G2/M with nocodazole, as well as from cells synchronously released into S-phase after an &#x003b1;-factor imposed G1 block (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Surprisingly, a comparable level of myc-Hat1p co-precipitated with ORC throughout these cellular treatments, suggesting that Hat1p, and by inference the Hat1p/Hat2p sub-complex, remained stably associated with ORC throughout the cell cycle. Consistent with this finding, large-scale purifications and mass spectrometric analysis of TAP-tagged Orc2p from &#x003b1;-factor arrested cells confirmed the association of Hat1p/Hat2p with ORC in the G1 phase (data not shown). By contrast, we failed to detect components of the pre-RC (such as Cdc6p) under these same purification conditions (BS, unpublished observations). The pre-RC could be readily disrupted, whereas the Hat1p/Hat2p-ORC interaction may be physically more robust under the chosen experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic interaction between <italic>orc-ts </italic>and <italic>hat&#x00394;/hat2&#x00394; </italic>mutants</title><p>Previously, genome-scale screens using the synthetic genetic array (SGA) methodology were performed to identify novel functional partners of ORC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

Deletions of either <italic>HAT1 </italic>or <italic>HAT2 </italic>markedly reduced the growth rate of <italic>orc5-1 </italic>mutant cells at the semi-permissive temperature of 31&#x000b0;C. The double mutants formed small, slower growing colonies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the reduced colony size of the double mutants was caused by a delay in germination, the synthetic growth defect of <italic>orc5-1 hat1&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>orc5-1 hat2&#x00394; </italic>mutants was further confirmed by a serial dilution assay of mitotically dividing cells. While the double mutants were fully viable at 23&#x000b0;C, a loss of viability was observed at 31&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), which is the maximal permissive temperature for the <italic>orc5-1 </italic>allele. Combination of <italic>orc2-1 </italic>or <italic>orc1-161 </italic>with either <italic>hat1&#x00394; </italic>or <italic>hat2&#x00394; </italic>also reduced growth at the maximum permissive temperatures of 26&#x000b0;C and 28&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C,D</xref>). The <italic>hat2&#x00394; </italic>mutation caused a slightly greater slow-growth phenotype than <italic>hat1&#x00394; </italic>when combined with either the <italic>orc2-1 </italic>and <italic>orc5-1 </italic>alleles. The reason for this subtle distinction is presently unclear, but could be an indication of redundant HAT activities. However, no further reduction of viability was observed in <italic>orc5-1 hat1&#x00394;hat2&#x00394; </italic>triple mutants, consistent with a virtually complete functional (i.e. epistatic) overlap between Hat1p (catalytic core) and Hat2p (histone targeting co-factor). By contrast, deletion of <italic>HIF1 </italic>did not lead to a reduction of the permissive temperature for <italic>orc5-1 </italic>mutations (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), pointing again to the absence of a functional interaction between Hif1p and ORC. As synthetic genetic interactions with conditionally lethal mutations are often indicative of a shared or overlapping biological function, these data suggest that Hat1p/Hat2p likely shares a function with ORC, presumably in DNA replication, separate from its function with Hif1p in chromatin assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, we observed only a very subtle reduction of colony size when <italic>hat1 </italic>was combined with the replication defective mutant <italic>mcm2-1 </italic>(Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), while virtually no interaction was detectable between <italic>hat1 </italic>or <italic>hat2 </italic>null alleles in combination with <italic>ts</italic>-alleles in other essential initiation factors examined (e.g. <italic>cdc7-1 </italic>or <italic>cdc6-1</italic>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and data not shown).

(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Peak <italic>ARS </italic>binding of Hat1p coincided with that of Cdc45p, and by inference with origin activation, and was followed by diminished binding at later timepoints, concurrent with the completion of initiation. An increase of immunoprecipitate was detected at the <italic>R11 </italic>control sequence with a lag relative to <italic>ARS305</italic>. An enrichment of Hat1p during S-phase, similar to that of Cdc45p, was also evident with <italic>ARS1 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The association of Hat1p-TAP with the late firing <italic>ARS1412 </italic>was virtually indistinguishable from the binding to <italic>R11</italic>, consistent with late activation and replication timing of this origin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Thus, our data indicate that Hat1p becomes associated with origins of replication around the time of origin firing and later with non-origin sequences, such as Cdc45p, suggesting that Hat1p also associates with advancing replication forks. No recruitment of Hat1p to <italic>ARS1 </italic>and <italic>R11 </italic>was observed when DNA replication was compromised by shifting the <italic>orc2-1 </italic>allele to the restrictive temperature (36&#x000b0;C). However, association with <italic>ARS1 </italic>is similarly abolished or lowered by the <italic>cdc7-1 </italic>mutation at restrictive (36&#x000b0;C) and at permissive (23&#x000b0;C) temperature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). As <italic>cdc7-1 </italic>did not show a genetic interaction with <italic>hat1&#x00394;</italic>, the recruitment of Hat1p depends on DNA replication in general but not specifically on intact ORC. Importantly, the dynamic recruitment of Hat1p to origins during S-phase contrasts also with the constitutive association of Hat1p/Hat2p with ORC as seen by co-immunoprecipitation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Hence, the discrepancies in our data can at least partly be explained by the existence of two separate complexes, Hat1p/Hat2p-ORC and the previously reported Hat1/Hat2-Hif1p. The S-phase specific recruitment of Hat1p could reflect the documented role in chromatin assembly during fork progression mediated by the Hif1p-containing complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>A replication defect in the absence of Hat1p may be expected in case Hat1p/Hat2p-ORC contributes to the function of an origin.

The absence of a direct role of Hat1p in the efficiency and timing of these origins could be explained by the possibility that Hat1p/Hat2p does not interact with ORC at these origins and that the S-phase recruitment of Hat1p is solely mediated by Hat1p/Hat2p-Hif1p. However, crosstalk between the two complexes may also occur and other plausible explanations for these observations cannot be dismissed (see Discussion).</p><p>Is it possible that Hat1p/Hat2p-ORC highlights a distinct function of ORC that is different from its role in DNA replication? A pertinent function in chromosome metabolism may be related to the role of ORC in transcriptional silencing that is genetically separable from its role in DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The N-terminal portion of Orc1p is nonessential and therefore dispensable for DNA replication, but is required for the ORC silencing function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. This defect can be functionally substituted by the N-terminus of Sir3p, which shares sequence similarity with the Orc1p N-terminus. However, we observed that myc-tagged Hat1p still co-precipitated with ORC in a strain bearing a N-terminal truncation of Orc1p or the N-terminus of Sir3 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>).

Using a plasmid shuffle assay, we generated various combinations of N-terminal lysine substitution mutations in histones H3 in the <italic>orc5-1 </italic>and <italic>orc5-1 hat1&#x00394; </italic>mutant backgrounds bearing an <italic>ADE2</italic>-marked wild-type histone construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). The ability of the strains to tolerate the mutant histone derivatives was then scored visually based on the rate of loss of the <italic>ADE2 </italic>marked plasmid (sectoring) when no selection was applied. While a control <italic>TRP1</italic>-marked wild-type histone H3 plasmid readily supported growth in <italic>orc5-1 </italic>and <italic>orc5-1 hat1&#x00394; </italic>strains, a histone H3 multi-point mutant lacking acetylatable N-terminal lysines (K9, 14, 18, 23, 27R) conferred a severe loss of viability as indicated by the exclusively white colony color (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Likewise, <italic>orc5-1 </italic>H3 (K9, 14, 18, 23, 27R) mutants were completely inviable when shifted at 30&#x000b0;C (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). Interestingly, mutations of lysine residues 14 and 23 in histone H3 enhanced the growth defects of <italic>orc5-1</italic>, and were incompatible with <italic>orc5-1 hat1&#x00394; </italic>double mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the functional overlap between H3 acetylation and Hat1p-mediated acetylation of H4 likely extends to the ORC-dependent process.</p><p>We next examined if <italic>hat1&#x00394; </italic>combined with a non-acetylatable histone H3 mutant tail leads to a plasmid loss phenotype. Plasmid loss rates were measured in wild-type and <italic>hat1&#x00394; </italic>strains using both a plasmid bearing the late replicating telomeric origin <italic>ARS120 </italic>(YCp120) or the early replicating origin <italic>ARSH4 </italic>(pRS316) in combination with either wild-type histone H3 or one of two multi-point mutants H3 (K9, 14, 18, 23, 27R) and H3 (K14, 23R). Elevated loss rates were observed for both plasmids in strains expressing a fully non-acetylatable H3 variant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>), a situation that compromised growth of the cells (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>). However, no additional or synergistic defect was detected when the histone mutants were further combined with the <italic>hat1&#x00394; </italic>mutation. Although this experiment did not establish a replication function for Hat1p at these two origins, it nevertheless showed that plasmid loss occurs below a threshold level of core histone acetylation. While this effect may be an indirect consequence of the histone H3 mutations on transcription or other pathways, it is also consistent with the view that multiple HAT activities converge to maintain genomic integrity.</p><p>The functional connection between ORC and histone H4 acetylation was further corroborated by examining the acetyltransferase activity of affinity purified ORC towards histone H4 <italic>in vitro </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Comparison of the relative activity of <italic>ORC5-TAP </italic>purified from a wild-type strain with that obtained from a <italic>hat1&#x00394; </italic>mutant demonstrated that nearly all histone H4 HAT activity (&#x0003e; 90%) was dependent on Hat1p (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A,B</xref>). Nevertheless, the residual H4 and some possible H3 acetylation in the absence of Hat1p suggests that at least one alternate HAT associates with ORC, albeit more weakly. Thus, whereas the H4-specific HAT activity by Hat1p associated with ORC established a direct connection between ORC function and histone acetylation, additional evidence also suggested the existence of one or more partly redundant, yet unidentified, HAT enzymes that seemingly function in conjunction with ORC.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>ORC-associated histone acetylation</bold>.

Rather, it was first detected as a cytoplasmic B-type enzyme specific for free, but not nucleosome-bound, histone H4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and, to a lesser extent, histone H2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], suggesting a major role in the basal acetylation of newly synthesized histones. However, Hat1p is now known to be the core component of a nuclear localized protein complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], together with the cofactors Hat2p and Hif1p. Hat1p-mediated acetylation of K5,12 on histone H4, an epigenetic mark which precedes DNA replication and which is rapidly removed after incorporation into DNA, is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Recently, the Hat1p/Hat2p-Hif1p complex was shown to be recruited to DNA double strand breaks, concomitantly with Rad52p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], suggesting that Hat1p is responsible for histone modifications during DNA repair, thus explaining the phenotypes observed earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In this study, we establish that a dynamic recruitment of Hat1p also occurs on chromatin in S-phase. The Hat1p association with origin DNA is analogous to that observed previously with a well established initiation cofactor, Cdc45p, which also advances with replication forks after recruitment to and release from an activated origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This implies that a nuclear Hat1p sub-complex, possibly containing Hif1p in addition to Hat2p, follows the advancing replication fork, consistent with a role in chromatin assembly during ongoing DNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>In addition to histone maturation in the cytoplasm and nucleosome assembly in the nucleus, our data now suggests an additional role for Hat1p through a direct interaction with ORC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) that is distinct from its role as a subunit in the Hif1p-dependent chromatin assembly complex. The previously described roles of Hat1p and Hat2p in telomeric gene silencing and double-strand break-repair involved also the Hif1p chromatin assembly factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Like the association of ORC subunits with chromatin, the interaction of ORC with Hat1p is constitutive during the cell cycle. Based on the cumulative evidence gathered so far, we presume that Hat1p and Hat2p may enhance ORC function by contributing either to the overall efficiency of origin usage or through alteration of the chromatin structure of a specific subset of origins, most likely through acetylation of lysine residues 5 and 12 on histone H4. Although we have not identified the exact mechanism involved, the description of a Hat1p/Hat2p-ORC complex is consistent with an emerging expansive view of histone modifications as critical determinants of DNA metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Considering that ORC function has been studied extensively both in yeast and metazoa, it is perhaps somewhat surprising that the ORC-HAT interaction was not detected before. Most likely, this may be due to limitations of the more traditional biochemical procedures that were used for the purification of ORC and Hat1p. The affinity purification procedure used in this study differs from an analogous method reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] in that the ion buffer concentrations were lower, preserving the stability of many larger assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In purifications of ORC-TAP, the association of Hat1p was consistently sub-stoichiometric, suggesting that most ORC is not bound to Hat1p/Hat2p. Conversely, ORC is also clearly less abundant than Hat1p/Hat2p, implying that more of Hat1p is associated with Hif1p than with ORC. Is it possible that the interaction of the Hat1p/Hat2p sub-complex with ORC occurs preferentially with ORC molecules that are not bound to genomic <italic>ARS </italic>sequences but rather free in the nucleus or perhaps even in the cytoplasm? Indeed, as ORC molecules were found in approximately 10-fold excess over origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], one might suggest an overabundance of non-DNA bound ORC in the cell. However, biochemical fractionation experiments in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>have clearly demonstrated that ORC, in contrast to the MCM complex, is constitutively chromatin-bound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Therefore, we rather expect that Hat1p/Hat2p-ORC localizes to the nucleus and is probably associated with chromatin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>The current view on the different associations of Hat1p within the cell</bold>. In addition to the cytoplasmic Hat1p/Hat2p complex, the Hat1p/Hat2p-Hif1p chromatin assembly complex is recruited to chromatin during S-phase. A minor fraction of Hat1p/Hat2p is constitutively associated with ORC and presumably chromatin-bound. Additional H3-specific acetylation and additional substrates for Hat1p are possible.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1741-7007-5-38-9"/></fig><p>How could histone H4 acetylation by Hat1p modify ORC and replication origins? Hat1p-mediated acetylation of histone H4 could facilitate the recruitment of additional replication initiation cofactors, such as Cdc45p or the MCM complex, or stimulate the intrinsic ATPase activity of one or more of the ORC subunits, resulting in more extensive remodeling of the chromatin structure at origins. Conversely, ORC-binding could alter the specificity of Hat1p to modify substrates different from free histone H4. Alteration of acetylation specificity by additional acetyltransferase subunits has been shown for the Gcn5p acetyltransferase, which requires additional subunits of the SAGA and Ada2/3 complexes to acetylate nucleosomal substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Although we detected no acetylation of nucleosomal substrates by Hat1p/Hat2p-ORC so far (data not shown), Hat1p at origins could acetylate nucleosomes that are transiently unfolded or histones that are exposed in some other way at the onset of DNA replication. Given the numerous reports for non-histone substrates for different acetyltransferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], it is also tempting to speculate that Hat1p mediates acetylation of core DNA replication factors.</p><p>How can the <italic>orc5-1 hat1 </italic>double mutant phenotypes and the existence of the Hat1p/Hat2p-ORC complex be reconciled with the apparent absence of a direct effect on initiation of DNA replication at the origins that analyzed so far? First, it is formally possible that there are, indeed, real, but subtle defects in the efficiency and timing at chromosomal origins that are difficult to detect by current methodologies. Second, although the Hat1/2p-ORC interaction is clearly separable from the previously documented Hif1p-dependent chromatin assembly complex, it is possible that the <italic>orc5-1 hat1 </italic>phenotype is caused by an indirect problem in chromatin-assembly without affecting replication per se. Such a defect may not necessarily be restricted to origins, and may occur at neighboring sequences. For example, while ORC could recruit Hat1p/Hat2p, the subsequent association with Hif1p could facilitate chromatin assembly at the replication fork. Right now, our data are not sufficient to prove or disprove such a possibility. As a third possibility, it could also be that a constitutive association between Hat1p/Hat2p and ORC occurs only at a subset of origins not examined in this study. This scenario would be reminiscent of the previously reported interaction of ORC with Sum1p, a repressor of mid-sporulation genes. Similar to <italic>hat1&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>hat2&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>sum1&#x00394; </italic>null mutations also reduce the restrictive temperature of <italic>orc-ts </italic>mutations, while having no obvious viability defect on their own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Sum1p and ORC also physically interact and, importantly, the chromosomal binding sites of Sum1p show overlap with a subset of replication origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Indeed, Sum1p specifically promoted the activity of the origins to which it was bound. In contrast to Sum1p, however, constitutive binding sites for Hat1p/Hat2p at or near origins would need to be established by more extensive chromatin localization experiments. Nevertheless, the example of the Sum1p-ORC interaction supports the view that different <italic>ARSs </italic>have distinctly different requirements for optimal ORC function, perhaps reflecting different chromatin contexts surrounding these origins. According to this view, Hat1p as a means of modulating local chromatin organization may be just one mechanism among multiple redundant pathways that dictate initiation timing and efficiency at particular origins. Fourth, it is plausible that the Hat1p/Hat2-ORC interaction manifests itself as an alternate function of ORC that is independent from DNA replication. The most obvious candidate for this could be the established transcriptional silencing function of ORC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. However, the fact that association of Hat1p with ORC persists when the N-terminal silencing domain of Orc1p is deleted (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>) argues against a connection to the silencing function of ORC. Furthermore, ORC has recently been shown to be involved in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, we could not detect defects on sister chromatid cohesion in <italic>hat1&#x00394; </italic>strains (data not shown). While we cannot formally exclude that potential cohesion effects may be very subtle and localized and therefore escape detection, the absence of phenotypes (i.e. plasmid loss, cell-cycle progression) does not support a direct involvement of Hat1p in sister chromatid cohesion either. If constitutive binding sites for Hat1p/Hat2p at origins were identified, a localized role of Hat1p in sister chromatid cohesion may be revealed as well.</p><p>The presence of some residual HAT activities associated with ORC in the absence of Hat1p is highly suggestive of potential overlapping functions of HATs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Genetic evidence supports that Hat1p is not the only relevant HAT enzyme with respect to DNA replication. An initial strong candidate for a functionally overlapping <italic>HAT </italic>was Esa1p, which is an essential subunit of the NuA4 complex that specifically acetylates histone H4 and which is responsible for the bulk of histone H4 acetylation in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Esa1p has been found to regulate the G1 to S-phase transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Moreover, a genetic link of NuA4 components with <italic>HAT2 </italic>has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. As metazoan replication origins are less well defined than their yeast counterparts, being more flexible and changing during development, the contribution to epigenetic factors, including histone acetylation, on proper origin activity may be more pronounced in these organisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Physical and genetic interaction data revealed that the yeast B-type histone acetyltransferase Hat1p/Hat2p forms a distinct sub-complex with ORC, providing a potential link between histone acetylation and DNA replication. The evidence presented in this work suggests that this function of Hat1p/Hat2p is distinct from Hif1p-mediated chromatin assembly. As both the B-type histone aceyltransferase and ORC are evolutionary well conserved, we expect that our findings could also be relevant for future investigations in higher eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains</title><p>Strains used for genetic analysis, TAP-tag, and chromatin immunoprecipitation are listed in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>.

After RNase, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C in 0.2 ml of 5 mg/ml Pepsin solution and then stored in 1 &#x000d7; PBS. Diluted cells were stained in 1 ml 1 &#x000d7; PBS containing 1 &#x000d7; SYTOX for 1 h, and DNA content was determined with a Becton Dickinson FACScan) or a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). A total of 10000 cells were counted per sample. Alternatively, staining was also performed in 16 &#x003bc;g/ml propidium iodide.</p><p>For cell-cycle dependent loss of viability assays, cells were either arrested in G1-phase with 5 &#x003bc;g/ml &#x003b1;-factor or in S-phase with 200 mM hydroxyurea at 23&#x000b0;C for 2.5 h and then shifted for 3 h at 36&#x000b0;C. When cells were kept in G1, an additional 5 &#x003bc;g/ml &#x003b1;-factor was added. Dilutions of 1/1000 were plated on YPD plates and the fraction of viable microcolonies from total plated cells was analyzed after 1 or 2 days at 23&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmid loss and analysis of replicative intermediates</title><p>Calculation of plasmid loss rate has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].
