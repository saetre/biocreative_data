The present study is aimed to explore this point comparing 55 healthy subjects, 71 monoclonal gammopaties of uncertain significance (MGUS) and 77 overt MM patients.

MM demonstrate a progressive, usually fatal, course with traditional treatments, generally producing only temporary remissions. A 5-year survival for MM patients is about 25% with less than 5% alive subjects after 10 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Among innovative treatments, antiangiogenic therapy seems to represent a promising approach, whose rationale is based on tumour growth inhibition by starving cancer cells of vital nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Recent evidences indicate that angiogenic processes are increased and are fundamental not only in solid tumours but also in hematologic diseases, including MM, as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Scarce angiogenic activities have been found in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) as compared to the overt malignant forms, where marrow neoangiogenesis parallels tumour progression and correlates with poor prognosis, suggesting an angiogenesis-dependent regulation of disease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Neoangiogenesis is under the control of various cytokines, that are expressed by neoplastic plasma cells, so that their involvement in MM pathophysiology has been strongly supported by different reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These modulators include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), that have been extensively investigated in biological samples derived from MM patients. However, data concerning their potential prognostic power as well as their reciprocal interactions are still conflicting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and remain to be better elucidated.</p><p>VEGF is a major regulator of tumour-associated angiogenesis exhibiting various biological activities, including regulation of embryonic stem cell development and local generation of inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. VEGF gene encodes for at least five isoforms which are anchored to the extracellular matrix through the heparin-binding domains. They are mitogenic to vascular endothelial cells and induce vascular permeabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. VEGF expression is regulated by several factors including interleukins (IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-10), fibroblast growth factor (FGF-4) and insulin-like growth factor1(IGF-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>bFGF is an 18 to 24 kD polypeptide, mainly produced by cells of mesenchymal origin, which shares a key role of mediator of angiogenesis with VEGF in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This molecule is normally bound to heparin and heparan sulphate proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix, particularly in the basement membranes, around vessels and stromal cells. It binds to a family of four distinct, high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFR-1&#x02013;4) and stimulates endothelial cell proliferation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>IGF-I is a mitogen and anti-apoptotic cytokine/growth factor/hormone produced by several types of cells (fibroblasts, hepatocytes, chondroblasts ..) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Its potential role as a growth factor for myeloma cells has been deeply analyzed and data of Ge NL et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] suggest that IGF-I significantly contributes to the expansion of MM cells in vivo by activation of two distinct pathways: Akt/Bad and MAPK kinase. Moreover, it has been suggested that circulating levels of IGF-I and its inhibitory binding proteins (IGF-BP 1&#x02013;6) may be associated with an increasing risk of common cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The main circulating component of IGF-I is released by the liver under GH control, while locally, different regulatory mechanisms have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Free IGF-I (molecules unbound to IGF-BPs) acts through a specific high-affinity IGF-I receptor, but also insulin receptor and IGF-II receptor may be used although with lower affinities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Recent data from the literature seem to support the idea of a functional link existing between the induction of angiogenesis-mediated growth factor expression and gene alterations in tumour development. In particular, c-myc deregulation by PDGF-BB has been demonstrated either in normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] or in tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Moreover, the existence of a relationship between activation of ras oncogenes and regulation of the VEGF/VPF expression has been demonstrated in experimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and clinical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] studies. In this regard, there are several reasons supporting the fact that <italic>ras </italic>gene represents an interesting case for studying the impact of cancer-associated genetic mutations and tumour angiogenesis. In fact, activated <italic>ras </italic>is capable of triggering several crucial signalling cascades, so altering the expression of some members of <italic>ras</italic>-responsive genes, many of which could be relevant for triggering or contributing to tumour angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Although the mechanisms governing the expression of angiogenic cytokines in tumour cell by dominantly acting oncogenes is largely unknown, the regulatory effect of oncogenes on angiogenic mediators has some potentially important therapeutic consequences and needs to be better investigated, especially on hematologic malignancies.</p><p>Aim of the present study was to evaluate the serum levels of a panel of three cytokines, such as IGF-I plus two angiogenic factors such as VEGF and bFGF in 148 patients with plasma cell dyscrasias. Seventy-one out of the total were patients affected by MGUS and 77 were patients with MM, these latter receiving treatment with conventional chemotherapy (Melphalan/Prednisone). These two groups of patients were compared with 55 controls represented by healthy human blood donors. In addition, we tried to determine whether the serum levels of these cytokines combined with the K-<italic>ras </italic>gene alterations might allow to select groups of patients with different responsiveness to chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and Controls</title><p>One hundred and forty-eight patients affected with plasmacell dyscrasia were consecutively admitted to the Regina Elena Cancer Institute of Rome and entered this study. Fifty-five healthy blood donors were used as controls. None of them showed any abnormalities concerning basic laboratory tests and no detectable infection was observed. Either patients or healthy blood donors were admitted after giving informed consent.</p><p>The patient groups, whose main clinical features are reported in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, included 71 monoclonal gammapathies of undetermined significance (MGUS) and 77 multiple myeloma (MM) diagnosed and staged according to Durie &#x00026; Salmon criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. MM patients were classified as stage I or II when analysed at the onset of the disease and were treated with conventional therapeutic regimens including melphalan (0.25 mg/Kg body weight/day) and prednisone (2 mg/Kg body weight) for 4 consecutive days. The course was repeated at every 6<sup>th </sup>week until tumour progression). The response was defined as minor response when the serum M-protein had decreased by &#x0003e; 25% but &#x0003c; 50% or the urinary BJ had decreased by &#x0003e;50% but not to &#x0003c; 0.2 g in 24 h. The non response group was defined by serum M-protein levels that had decreased to &#x0003c; 25% or by urine BJ protein levels that had decreased to &#x0003c; 50% of initial levels.

He showed a minor response to treatment for a least 15 months, with a 26% fall in serum M-protein concentration and a concomitant slight reduction of IGF-I amounts. Then new cycles of therapy were administered because of tumour progression.

Several authors tried to explain how angiogenic cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] may work influencing the MM cells; consequently, in the recent years, the presence and quantity of several angiogenic factors, their inducers and their signalling mediators have been documented in an effort to explore the possibility to use them as diagnostic, monitoring or prognostic markers of disease evolution and therapy sensitivity.</p><p>Despite this bulk of information, clear indications have not been completely gained and some different contrasting results have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In general, angiogenic mediators (VEGF, basic FGF, TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha) have been found to be increased in MM patients and often significantly correlated each to the others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Sometimes, they were also stage related, although not all the reports were consistent in this field. Angiogenic factors also show different behaviours under treatment. Interestingly, while conventional therapy (melphalan plus prednisolone) reduced the serum concentrations of these factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], an anti-angiogenic therapy based on thalidomide plus dexamethasone was accompanied by increase of the same factors in the responder subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Another molecule involved in MM biology is IGF-I, a mediator with cytokine (locally)/hormone (in the general circulation) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], known to be a growth promoter for several tumours, including MM, acting through its anti-apoptotic/proliferative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] effects and interaction with angiogenic factors, such as the anti-proliferative TGF-beta1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Surprisingly, serum data regarding IGF-I and MM are very scarce and partially contrasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] although IGF-I is suspected to be able to transform MGUS in MM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Previous data on B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia have found a clear reduction of IGF-I in sera as compared with controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], even though the studies were initially expected to exibit increased concentrations, due to the tumourigenic activity of IGF-I. This is not so surprising in that the IGF-I determinations were obtained from sera of subjects already affected with MM.</p><p>It is known that all cancers, including MM, possess a more or less strong inflammatory component (in particular the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha are produced by myeloma cells) and that inflammation is associated with reduced IGF-I synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Data from literature showed that IGF-I molecules may be modulated by SOCS genes, after their activation by proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>The present study clearly shows that the serum IGF-I concentrations significantly decreased from healthy blood donors to MGUS and to MM patients, a finding not previously described. This result was also independent of age (significantly lower in controls) and sex, as confirmed by multivariate regression analysis, both in all subjects and when only IgG MM patients were considered (data not shown). A similar analysis, obtained separately in male or female patients, confirmed our findings (data not shown), indicating that gender was not the cause of the differences previously described. These findings open the possibility that IGF-I molecule might be further studied as a monitoring marker to follow the patients over time by specific trials.</p><p>A previous study by Standal and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], failed to observe significant differences between MM and controls. Such divergence may depend on some patient characteristics. For example, Standal selected only patients with 69% of advanced tumour stages (III), while our patients were prevalently of tumour stages I and II. As previously mentioned, chronic B cell leukaemia showed data similar to those reported in our paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Opposite to IGF-I was the behaviour of VEGF and bFGF, whose concentrations were increased in MM sera as compared with control samples. VEGF and b-FGF serum concentrations were highly correlated (P = 0.002), confirming the results previously published by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Another variable considered in this study was the K-<italic>ras </italic>gene whose mutation was significantly associated with the malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], while no significant difference was observed between controls and MGUS. K-<italic>ras </italic>gene alteration has previously been associated with the modulation of different biological agents, including IGF-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. As reported for solid tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], we found significant increases of serum bFGF concentrations in MM patients eliciting K-<italic>ras </italic>gene activation. Moreover, the same K12-<italic>ras </italic>mutation was significantly associated with increased resistance to the therapy (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). A trend in lower serum bFGF levels was observed when responders MM patients were compared with the non responder ones. When K12-<italic>ras </italic>mutation and the levels of the 3 cytokines under or above cut offs were combined, no significant differences were found in the different subgroups (data not shown). Therefore, therapy effect was only dependent on K-<italic>ras </italic>mutation and not on cytokine levels.</p><p>Considering the results of the present study, we tried to evaluate the possibility that IGF-I might be used as monitoring marker. Therefore, we show two representative examples of MM patients followed during subsequent courses of therapy and whose disease behaviour was related to the monoclonal component concentrate on and serum IGF-I levels over time.</p><p>These results show that, generally, serum IGF-I concentrations behave similarly to the monoclonal component. Some of the divergences observed may be explained by the fact that various eveniences may influence the serum IGF-I levels: age and gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], inflammatory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], other concomitant diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], endocrine diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], drug administration and liver toxicity. Furthermore, melphalan therapy, which is hepatotoxic and therefore should reduce IGF-I synthesis, has been reported to increase IGF-I molecules after the 4<sup>th </sup>course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], possibly when it was effective in restoring the peripheral blood IGF-I amounts. It is also possible to speculate that the cytotoxic effect of therapy should release a great amount of endocellular molecules from necrotic cells with induction of inflammatory processes and IGF-I drop.</p><p>In conclusion, as previously reported for other neoplastic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], serum IGF-I concentrations are clearly reduced in case of open disease. Therefore, a clinical use of serum determinations of this molecule should be made very carefully since this substance does not show a clear specificity for MM. A possible role of IGF-I as putative monitoring marker of malignant disease seems to emerge by our study, even though specific clinical trials need to be planned and the possible interference of other factors in serum determinations should be considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All contributing authors declare that no actual or potential conflicts of interest do exist.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CG and FA conceived of the study, discussed the results and wrote the manuscript.
