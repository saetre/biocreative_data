The thermal melting curve, recorded at 280 nm in a UV-visible spectrophotometer, showed that p53 started to melt at &#x0223c;35&#x000b0;C whereas NTD125 did not exhibit distinct melting pattern of folded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>). Far-UV-CD spectra of NTD125 also showed that it is natively unfolded and secondary structure analysis predicted that it predominantly contained &#x003b2;-sheets (61.3&#x00025;) and random coil (36.9&#x00025;) at 25&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). Although NTD125 possessed some residual secondary structure as its conformational change at higher temperature (90&#x000b0;C) was reversible on cooling it down to 25&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>). These results confirmed the thermostable nature of NTD125. Earlier studies with amino-terminus domain containing 1-99 aa residues also showed NTD as natively unstructured at physiological conditions and thermostable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007159-Dawson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007159-Bell1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Far-UV-CD spectra analysis (range 260&#x02013;195 nm) was further utilized to check interaction between NTD125 and p53. The spectrum of mixture of both proteins was significantly different from the theoretical sum of individual spectra of NTD125 and p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>). It is widely reported in literature that if two proteins do not interact with each other, no structural change would result so the theoretical and experimental spectra would be identical. However, if the two proteins do interact substantially, conformational change in their structure would be detected and in this case, theoretical and experimental spectra would be substantially different. As it was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>, when p53 and NTD125 were combined at different temperatures, they interacted to produce evidence of a structural change. The same figure also presented individual spectra of p53 and NTD125. As significant structural changes had occurred due to probable interaction between these two peptides, we noticed the difference between spectra of mixtures and the theoretical sum of individual spectra. This observation led us to conclude that there was physical interaction between NTD125 and this interaction might further have stabilized p53 at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g001">Fig. 1c, i&#x02013;iv</xref>). Further, the interaction between p53 and NTD125 was studied by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 0.5 &#x000b5;g of either BSA, CHIP or NTD125 protein was plated per well onto which p53 (in increasing concentration) was added, followed by detection with anti-p53 antibody (PAb C-19). NTD125 showed interaction with p53 in ELISA too (lanes 18&#x02013;25). BSA (lanes 2&#x02013;8) and CHIP (lane 10&#x02013;16) were taken as negative and positive controls respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). We then analyzed this interaction by immunoprecipitation (IPP) assay at room temperature using various p53 antibodies, PAb C-19 (specific for p53-C terminus), PAb1620 (specific for wild type p53) and PAb240 (specific for denatured/mutant p53); NTD125 was shown to bind to both p53 wild and mutant conformation with equal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>). Again ELISA showed that NTD125 interacts with p53 and with C-ter domain (CTD) of p53 revealing that NTD125 interacts with p53 in C-terminus region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>). The interaction between NTD (1&#x02013;186) and CTD (187&#x02013;393) in cells was shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007159-Okorokov1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, and a low energy complex between CTD (361&#x02013;382) and PRD (80&#x02013;93) was predicted earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007159-Kim1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The thermostable nature of NTD125 and its interaction with p53 led us to analyze whether it could stabilize p53 wild type conformation and DNA binding activity at elevated temperatures.</p><fig id="pone-0007159-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007159.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>NTD125 is highly thermostable.</title><p>A.

The recombinant p53 preparation contained both wild and mutant phenotype at &#x0223c;1&#x02236;1 ratio; shown by IPP with conformation-specific antibodies PAb1620 (wild specific) and PAb240 (mutant specific) at RT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>, panel 1, lanes 2 &#x00026; 3). The recombinant preparation was separately heated at 37&#x000b0;C, 40&#x000b0;C, 42&#x000b0;C and 45&#x000b0;C and the heated mixture was immunoprecipitated either with PAb1620, PAb240 or PAb C-19 antibodies. When p53 was heated sequentially from 37&#x000b0;C to 45&#x000b0;C, the PAb1620 form was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>, panel-1, lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, &#x00026; 14). The loss of wild type (PAb1620) form was progressive with the rise in temperature; the loss of wild type conformation at 37&#x000b0;C and 40&#x000b0;C was about 80&#x00025; whereas there was a total loss of this conformation at 45&#x000b0;C within 1 hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>). When NTD125 (1&#x02236;5 molar ratio) was added prior to denaturation, there was no loss of wild type (PAb1620) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>, panel-2, lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, &#x00026; 14, see arrow). In the presence of CHIP (1&#x02236;2 molar ratio), a known chaperone of p53, the wild type (PAb1620) form was not lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>, panel-3). This suggests that NTD125 showed chaperone-like function in stabilizing wild type conformation (PAb1620). In a parallel experiment, p53 was first heated to denaturation for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C followed by addition of NTD125 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>). In a similar manner, no loss of PAb1620 form was noticed thus confirming the chaperone-like activity of NTD125. This observation was further confirmed by sandwich ELISA in which conformational antibodies PAb1620 (wild type specific) and PAb240 (mutant specific) were plated, onto which heat-denatured p53 (incubated with or without NTD125) was added. After washing the unbound protein, bound wild and mutant phenotypes were probed with either FL-393 (polyclonal antibodies against full length p53) or PAb C-19 (p53 C-ter specific antibodies); PAb C-19 was preferred when NTD125 was added into the mixture. Similar results were obtained by ELISA experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g003">Fig. 3c &#x00026; d</xref>) in which addition of NTD125 resulted in an increase in wild type form (PAb1620) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>, compare lanes 5, 7; 9, 11; 13, 15; 17, 19) and decrease in mutant form (PAb240). The result was more prominent in IPP experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007159-g003">Fig. 3a, b</xref>) than ELISA.
