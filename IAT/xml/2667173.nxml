At early embryogenesis, <italic>Hox </italic>genes are up-regulated sequentially in the epiblast and establish their ordered expression patterns along the A-P axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. They also play an instructive role in distributing cells in an ordered manner along the A-P axis during ingression of epiblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As a consequence, <italic>Hox </italic>gene expression exhibits nested patterns in the paraxial mesoderm as well as in the neuroepithelium. One unique feature of conferring A-P identity by <italic>Hox </italic>genes is that these nested expression patterns display sharp anterior boundaries, creating codes of expression along the A-P axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. For example, expression of paralogue 4 <italic>Hox </italic>genes, such as <italic>Hoxb4</italic>, have an anterior-most limit at the rhombomere 6/7 boundary, while the anterior most limit of paralogue 5 genes lies at the rhombomere 7/8 boundary. Thus rhombomere 7 is defined as a <italic>Hox </italic>paralogue 4 positive and <italic>Hox </italic>paralogue <italic>5 </italic>negative segment. As evidence of this code-dependent positional identity, null mutant mice of <italic>Hox </italic>genes exhibit the loss of a segmental identity only of the anterior-most domain of the gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Hence, regulation of <italic>Hox </italic>expression at the anterior-most domain is the most crucial step in the process of conferring A-P identity.</p><p>While the expression of <italic>Hox </italic>genes begins at the primitive streak stage, cells are not committed to express specific <italic>Hox </italic>genes and the pattern does not strictly follow the cell lineage. Instead, the expression patterns of many <italic>Hox </italic>genes display dynamic changes during neurulation. In addition to <italic>Hoxb4</italic>, as described below in detail (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), <italic>Hoxb1</italic>, <italic>b3 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and <italic>b9 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] in chick and <italic>Hoxb5, b6 and b8 </italic>in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] have been shown to exhibit dynamic alterations in their expression patterns during axis elongation before the final pattern is established.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression in the neural tube at 5 to 22 somite stages</bold>.

Up to the 5 somite stage, the anterior boundary of expression is located at the 6<sup>th </sup>somite level both in the neural tube and paraxial mesoderm (A, arrow). At 6&#x02013;10 somite stages, expression in the neural tube exclusively extends anteriorly while mesodermal expression remains at the same level (B-E). At the 22 somite stage, the expression shows its anterior most boundary at the rhombomere 6/7 level (F). Arrowheads indicate the prospective rhombomere 6/7 boundary.

One strong candidate is the influence from flanking somites. It has been shown in chick embryos that transposition of regions of the neural tube along the A-P axis results in the reprogramming of <italic>Hox </italic>codes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, somites have been shown to be able to up-regulate <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>when grafted ectopically in regions that do not normally express <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Similar results were obtained in zebrafish embryos, where grafting of non-axial mesoderm causes transformation of forebrain to a hindbrain character [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These observations led to the idea that the neural tube undergoes continual assessment of its environmental signals in order to establish the correct pattern of <italic>Hox </italic>gene expression in the CNS after neural tube formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Retinoic acid (RA) is the most likely molecule responsible for the up-regulation of <italic>Hox </italic>genes by the somites. An enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (RALDH2), which converts the inactive form retinaldehyde to RA, is expressed in the somites from early stages of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. RA appears to be abundant in the neural tube as well as in the somites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Cyp1B1, another RA synthesizing enzyme, is also expressed in somites during early embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In mice, at least, RALDH2 seems to be the main RA synthesizing enzyme in early embryogenesis at 7.5 dpc and 8.5 dpc, since the RA-responsive transgene RARE-hsp-LacZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] does not show expression in <italic>RALDH2</italic>-/- embryos at these stages except in the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. RA deficiency caused either by genetic deletion of <italic>RALDH2 </italic>in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] or by placing quail hens on a RA-deficient diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] results in defects in axial development and patterning. The defects do not span the whole <italic>Hox</italic>-territory; rather, the defect is restricted to the posterior hindbrain (rhombomeres 4&#x02013;8 including the level of somites 1&#x02013;5), demonstrating that this region requires correct RA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>To account for the complex organization of <italic>Hox </italic>genes by signaling mechanisms, a number of models have been proposed. For example, individual <italic>Hox </italic>genes have specific retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) with different sensitivities to RA, thereby allowing each <italic>Hox </italic>gene to be controlled differently depending on the concentration of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Another example of differential regulation of <italic>Hox </italic>genes is by FGF signaling, where some <italic>Hox </italic>genes have the binding sequence for a downstream transcription factor, Cdx, in their enhancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition to the above, it is likely that there are more mechanisms that are responsible for establishing the correct A-P pattern, such as the duration of exposure to signals, the degree of dependence on signals, the involvement of planar signaling, and the competence of the neural tube to respond to signals. This study aims at clarifying two issues. First, to what extent does endogenous <italic>Hox </italic>expression depend upon the somite signal? Second, what determines the competence of the neural tube to respond to the somite signal? In order to address these questions, <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>has been chosen as a model because the dynamic changes in its expression pattern occur at the stages when the tissues involved are accessible for refined dissections. The chick explant culture system was employed to identify tissue interactions that are responsible for the up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression in the neural tube.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The dynamics of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression in the developing chick neural tube</title><p>We first investigated in detail the changes in the <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression pattern that occur after neurulation. <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>is first detectable at the full streak stage (stage 4 of Hamburger and Hamilton, HH 4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and the anterior-most boundary resides at the level of the future 6<sup>th </sup>somite both in the mesoderm and the neural tube until the 5 somite stage (HH 8<sup>+</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This level is about 5 somite segments more posterior than the final anterior-most boundary of neural tube expression, the rhombomere 6/7 boundary, which corresponds to the anterior edge of the 1<sup>st </sup>somite. During somite stages 6 to 10 (HH 9<sup>- </sup>to 10), which is approximately a difference of 6 hours, the expression pattern rapidly changes exclusively in the neural tube; the domain here extends anteriorly while mesodermal expression remains at the same level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B&#x02013;E</xref>). Expression extends until it finally establishes its anterior most limit at the future rhombomere 6/7 boundary. This does not involve cell movement as cells in the neural tube maintain their relative positions to the flanking somite at these stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. During somite stages 10&#x02013;20 (HH 10&#x02013;13), the expression becomes stronger while the domain remains unchanged (data not shown). By the 22 somite stage (HH 14), the rhombomere 6/7 boundary is formed and the <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>domain is clearly defined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Signals from the mesoderm are necessary for the initial up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4</italic></title><p>Although it has been previously shown that somites are capable of inducing <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in ectopic locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], it is not known whether somites are required for the endogenous up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4</italic>. If so, at which stage are they required and are they sufficient for the correct patterning of the neural tube in normal development? In order to address these questions, the somite level 1&#x02013;5 region was analyzed using the explant culture system. First, in order to test whether the initiation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression in the neural tube is recapitulated in the explant culture system, the neural tube at somite level 1&#x02013;5 including flanking somites, as well as surface ectoderm, notochord and endoderm, were dissected from embryos between 2 and 8 somite stages. It was found that, in all explants dissected at the above stages, <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression was up-regulated in the neural tube along the axial length after 24 hours of culture (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;F</xref>). Presence or absence of notochord did not have an effect on the result (data not shown). Next, in order to investigate the requirement of somites, the neural tube was dissected without somites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2M&#x02013;R</xref>) and compared to a neural tube that included flanking somites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G&#x02013;L</xref>). The results show that neural explants taken between somite stages 3&#x02013;5 did not show any up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>after 24 hours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2M&#x02013;O</xref>). Some weak expression was observed in the posterior half when the explant was taken at the 6 somite stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2P</xref>). Conversely, from the 7 somite stage onwards, the removal of somites did not affect the level of expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2Q, R</xref>), indicating that somites are not required at these stages.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The explant culture system recapitulates the initiation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression in the neural tube and reveals a stage-dependent requirement of somites</bold>. (A-F) As schematized in the left of the panel, explants of neural tube were taken with flanking somites at the level of somites 1 to 5, from embryos at 2 (A, D), 6 (B, E) or 8 (C, F) somite stages, and either fixed immediately (A-C) or cultured for 24 hours (D-F). Immediately fixed explants show no or faint expression of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>depending on the stage of explanting, reflecting the normal expression (A-C, n = 3/3 at each stage). After 24 hours of incubation, the explants show strong expression of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>throughout the length of the neural tube (D-F, n = 6/6 at each stage). Indicated above each panel are the somite stages (S) at which explants were dissected. (G-R) Neural tube explants were taken either with (G-L) or without (M-R) flanking somites, at stages between 3 and 8 somites (3S to 8S) and cultured for 24 hours. All explants that included somites strongly express <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>homogenously in the neural tube (G-L, n = 6/6 at each stage). When somites are removed, <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression is absent in explants from 3 to 5 somite stages (M-O, n = 6/6 at each stage). In explants taken at the 6 somite stage, weak expression is observed (P, n = 8/8). It is at the 7 and 8 somite stages that the explants express <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>strongly (Q, R, n = 6/6 at each stage).

In other words, at a particular level of the neural tube, are the adjacent somites sufficient to pattern this level or not? In order to test this, the neural tubes of 3 to 5 somite stage embryos were dissected at each somite level including somites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;L</xref> and Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). After 24 hours, it was found that posterior levels (somite levels 4 and 5) strongly expressed <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in the neural tube (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G, K, L</xref>), whereas neural tube at somite levels 2 and 3 exhibited weaker <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, C, E, F, I, J</xref>). The neural tube at somite level 1 displayed no expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, D, H</xref>). These results suggest the following: (1) Vertical signals (from somite to the adjacent neural tube at the same axial level) alone are not sufficient, and hence planar communication and signaling in the neural tube along the A-P axis are to be considered. (2) Different axial levels exhibit different degrees of vertical signaling, either by posterior somites producing a greater signal than anterior ones or by different axial levels of the neural tube responding differently to the somite signal, or both. There are two pieces of evidence that support the idea that somites send different degrees of signal strength to the neural tube. Firstly, ectopic somite grafting showed that the more posterior somites have a stronger inducing capability in the adjacent neural tube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Second, <italic>RALDH2 </italic>is expressed strongly in posterior somites whereas there is very little or no expression in somite 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3M&#x02013;R</xref>). In fact, the ability of each somite to induce <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression in the adjacent neural tube, both ectopically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and at endogenous locations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;L</xref>), coincides spatially and temporally with the graded expression of <italic>RALDH2 </italic>in somites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3M&#x02013;R</xref>). However, there is some discrepancy in considering <italic>RALDH2 </italic>as the sole factor responsible for up-regulating <italic>Hoxb4</italic>: At the 8 somite stage when <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>is being up-regulated but is not yet being expressed in anterior regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), <italic>RALDH2 </italic>has already been down-regulated at most of the somite 1&#x02013;5 levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3Q</xref>). In addition, while the <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression domain extends anteriorly during the course of development, <italic>RALDH2 </italic>expression is down-regulated in an anterior to posterior direction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3M&#x02013;R</xref>). Another RA synthesizing enzyme, Cyp1B1, is expressed in somites at young stages without any significant down-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, despite the expression of Cyp1B1 in somites, anterior somites such as 1 and 2 failed to fully up-regulate <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in the adjacent neural tube in the above experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B, D, E, H, I</xref>). These results led us to further analyze the role of somites in up-regulating <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in the neural tube.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Signaling of each somite to the adjacent neural tube</bold>.

In order to address these, we used <italic>Hoxb3 </italic>as another <italic>Hox </italic>marker. <italic>Hoxb3 </italic>has an anterior-most expression domain at the rhombomere 5/6 boundary and establishes its final expression pattern at the 9 somite stage, slightly earlier than <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].

By dissecting somite level 1 neural tube along with flanking somites, it was observed that somite 1 is sufficient to up-regulate <italic>Hoxb3 </italic>in the adjacent neural tube (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3U</xref>). Hence, the 1<sup>st </sup>somite is not incapable of inducing <italic>Hox </italic>genes; the failure to up-regulate <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in somite level 1 neural tube is not due to the specific feature of the 1<sup>st </sup>somite; rather, different signal strengths are required for the up-regulation of different <italic>Hox </italic>genes. Nevertheless, the result of dissecting neural tube and flanking somites at each of the somite levels 1 to 5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;L</xref>) is in clear contrast to the result of explanting the neural tube and somites as a whole (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G&#x02013;I</xref>), where the neural tube displays homogenous expression along its axial length. These data suggest that vertical signals alone are not sufficient and planar communication or signaling is required.</p></sec><sec><title>Involvement of planar signaling</title><p>To directly test the possible involvement of planar signaling, attempts were made to block planar signaling in the neural tube explant. Neural tube from a 5 somite stage embryo was dissected from somite level 1&#x02013;5 including adjacent somites. A foil barrier was placed in the neural tube at the level of the somite 2/3 boundary (but not in between the somites) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Positioning the barrier in such a manner would block the possible occurrence of planar signals, yet still allow the transmission of vertical signals at each level. Following a 24-hour culture, <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>failed to be up-regulated significantly in the neural tube at somite level 1 and 2 (i.e. the region anterior to the barrier). This implies that the placement of a barrier did block transmission of signals travelling anteriorly through the plane of the neural tube. Weak expression present in the region anterior to the barrier might be attributed to vertical signals coming from somites immediately adjacent to the neural tube.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Requirement for planar signaling in the up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4</italic></bold>.

The barrier was placed across the neural tube as well as all other tissues including somites. Embryos were incubated <italic>ex ovo </italic>on albumen-agar plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], which helped stable positioning of the barrier. After 24&#x02013;26 hours of incubation, <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>induction on the anterior side of the barrier was found to be clearly blocked, either completely (n = 4/12) or to significantly low levels compared to the posterior side of the barrier (n = 7/12) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). This result is consistent with the above experiment of explant culture suggesting planar signaling; however, it is not in agreement with the study by Gaunt and Strachan (1994) where the <italic>Hoxd4 </italic>expression domain was shown to 'spread forward' regardless of physical barrier after 24 hours of culture. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. One possible explanation is that <italic>ex ovo </italic>culture may cause delays in chick development and <italic>Hoxd4/b4 </italic>might be up-regulated after a longer incubation, although embryos incubated <italic>ex ovo </italic>in the same condition without barriers showed a clear up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>as normal (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). However, there was one case showing strong <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>induction anterior to the barrier (n = 1/12, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), suggesting that the results may vary among the cases. Nonetheless, both our explant and <italic>in vivo </italic>studies suggest the requirement of tissue continuity in up-regulating <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in the neural tube, suggesting involvement of planar signaling. The planar signaling may be required for the initial extension in expression, and/or the maintenance of the expression initiated by signals from flanking somites.</p><p>Given the importance of planar signaling in the neural tube, it was next asked whether anterior somites are required for the planar signaling or not. Somites 1 and 2, although unable to up-regulate <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in the adjacent neural tube in a vertical manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), are still required for <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression, since removal of somites 1 and 2 from the explant of somite level 1&#x02013;5 abolished up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in the anterior neural tube (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, compare with Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>). This could be because somites are either required for instructive vertical signals or for sending permissive cues that allow the anterior neural tube to respond to planar signals. We have noticed that the neural tube and somites from level 4 or 5 cause a stronger induction in the level 1 neural tube compared to those from more anterior levels such as levels 1&#x02013;3 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). We therefore designed experiments where a neural explant dissected at somite levels 1&#x02013;2 (without flanking somites) was combined with a level 5 neural tube with flanking somites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Following a 24 hour culture, significant up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>was seen in the anterior neural tube in an area approximately one somite diameter in length (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Hence, the neural tube is able to up-regulate <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in the absence of flanking somites when combined with a more posterior neural tube with somites. In a similar experiment where the neural explant of somite level 1&#x02013;2 was combined with a level 5 neural tube, where all levels included somites, it was noted that up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>was fully extended to the anterior-most end of the explant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>), despite that these anterior somites are not capable of sufficiently up-regulating <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in the adjacent neural tube (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H, I</xref>). These results demonstrate that somites 1 and 2 are required for up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in the neural tube, at least in part to assist in the response of the neural tube to planar signaling, suggesting a synergistic effect between planar and vertical signals.</p></sec><sec><title>Dorso-ventral difference of <italic>Hox </italic>gene expression</title><p>The above results collectively demonstrate that vertical signals do not sufficiently establish the correct expression pattern of <italic>Hoxb4</italic>. This led us to consider the possibility of a factor located within the neural tube that may be able to affect or modulate the response of the neural tube to the somite signal. In line with investigating factors that facilitate the neural tube to express <italic>Hoxb4</italic>, we have noticed that the neural tube shows a considerable difference in <italic>Hox </italic>gene expression along the dorso-ventral (D-V) axis, where the dorsal side expresses more strongly than the ventral side during the course of up-regulation at 10&#x02013;12 somite stages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B</xref>). Transverse sections clearly show that up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>begins at the dorsal-most side of the neural tube, with this D-V difference being seen at all axial levels at these stages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E&#x02013;G</xref> and data not shown). It is noticeable that the dorsal side of the neural tube, which is where <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>is strongly expressed initially, does not necessarily have close contact with the flanking somites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E&#x02013;G</xref>), suggesting that up-regulation in the dorsal side cannot be explained solely by somitic signals. At the 15 somite stage, the D-V difference is less evident, except that the floor plate does not express <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). At the 17 somite stage, the neural tube shows homogeneous expression of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>along the D-V axis except in the floor plate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>The dorsal side of the neural tube precedes the ventral side in up-regulating <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression</bold>.

At the 10 somite stage, when the anterior-most expression has not reached r6/7 (see also Fig. 1E), the up-regulation is restricted to the dorsal-most edge of the neural tube (A). At the 12 somite stage, a distinct D-V difference is seen (B). By the 15 somite stage, this D-V difference becomes less apparent in accordance with the expression becoming stronger, although the most-ventral region of the neural tube does not express <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>(C).

In this situation, the dorsal side of the graft expresses <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>earlier than the ventral side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In another situation, where somites are grafted anteriorly into the pre-otic region causing ectopic induction of <italic>Hox </italic>genes, <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>up-regulation can be seen predominantly in the dorsal edge of the neural tube, which is particularly the case when anterior somites with weak inductive abilities are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, during the normal course of development (HH 18&#x02013;20), there is a transient up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in the dorsal rim of rhombomere 6 while the anterior-most limit of the main expression domain is at the rhombomere 6/7 boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These observations collectively imply that the dorsal side of the neural tube might have a greater susceptibility to expressing <italic>Hox </italic>genes than the ventral region.</p></sec><sec><title>BMP signals are involved in up-regulating <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in the neural tube</title><p>The above observations prompted us to investigate the cause of the dorsal precedence, since this may provide us with a key to understanding the susceptibility of the neural tube to expressing <italic>Hoxb4</italic>. There are two possibilities that may account for this D-V difference in <italic>Hox </italic>expression: (1) The dorsal region of the somite is sending a stronger signal to the neural tube than the ventral region. (2) The somite is sending a uniform strength of signal to the neural tube along its D-V axis, but the dorsal neural tube is more responsive to this signal than the ventral neural tube. To investigate whether the dorsal region of the somite is transmitting a stronger signal to the neural tube than the ventral region, ectopic induction of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>was reassessed using dorso-ventrally rotated somites. A single somite was taken from a posterior level of a 8&#x02013;9 somite stage embryo (i.e. a somite with a <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>inducing ability in the pre-otic region) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and ectopically grafted, while either preserving or reversing the D-V orientation, into the region adjacent to prospective rhombomere 5 of a stage-matching host embryo (where <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>is not normally expressed but is competent to respond to somite signals resulting in induction of <italic>Hoxb4</italic>). Following a 24&#x02013;33 hour culture, when the ectopic induction was clearly observed, expression of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in the rhombomere 5 region was not significantly different between the cases of rotated and non-rotated somites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A&#x02013;F</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that the dorsal region of the somite is sending a stronger signal than the ventral region; rather the somite conveys a uniform strength of signal along its D-V axis. This raises the possibility that the neural tube itself is responding differently along its D-V axis to the somite signal, where the dorsal neural tube is more responsive to the somite signal than ventral regions.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Dorsal precedence of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression is associated with the dorsalized feature of the neural tube</bold>.

The dorsal neural tube (approximately 10&#x02013;15% of the neural tube) was ablated at the level of prospective somites 1&#x02013;5 on one side together with the surface ectoderm immediately overlying the neural tube (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>). In some cases, a foil barrier was placed at the edge of the surface ectoderm to prevent it from regenerating and fusing to the dorsal neural tube (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6J</xref>). The ablation was conducted on 3 to 4 somite stage embryos, after which they were incubated until the 10&#x02013;12 somite stage. Without a foil barrier, the surface ectoderm rapidly regenerated within 6 hours following ablation and formed a continuous epithelial layer with the ablated end of the neural tube. In these cases, up-regulation of <italic>Msx1 </italic>was seen at the dorsal tip of the ablated side of the neural tube (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6H</xref>), as was <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6I</xref>).

Therefore it is suggested that, during the course of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>up-regulation at the level of somites 1 to 6, RA is absolutely required and BMP4 cannot compensate for its absence. This was supported by explant culture experiments, where the neural tube at the level of somites 1 to 5 was dissected without flanking somites and cultured in the presence of RA or BMP4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7I&#x02013;K</xref>).

Hence, while RA plays an instructive role in the up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4</italic>, BMP4's role is likely to be permissive rather than instructive.</p><p>We further investigated whether RA is able to promote ventral expansion of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression in a similar manner to BMP4 <italic>in vivo</italic>. While BMP4 showed clear up-regulation in the ventral side of the neural tube (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7L, N</xref>), exogenous RA only enhanced the dorsally dominant <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression and did not show up-regulation in the ventral neural tube as significantly as BMP4 did (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7M</xref>). The result that exogenous RA cannot up-regulate <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in the ventral neural tube while BMP4 can, underscores a distinct role of BMP signaling in the <italic>in vivo </italic>context. Collectively, these results suggest a two-phase model in establishing <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression in the axial level of somite 1&#x02013;6. First <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>is up-regulated at the dorsal neural tube by signals from the surface ectoderm, likely mediated by BMP or TGF&#x003b2; signaling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G&#x02013;L</xref>). RA is required for the dorsal patterning process (Wilson et al., 2004), and hence this initial phase likely employs both signals. Second, <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression spreads more ventrally, which can be promoted by exogenous BMP4 but not by RA. However, this process does not occur in the absence of RA, at least at the somite level 1 to 6. It is not clear in the experiment of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> using BMS493 <italic>in vivo</italic>, whether the requirement of RA is only in the initial step at the dorsal side, or also in the up-regulation at the ventral side. However, the result that after removal of dorsal neural tube, the remaining ventral neural tube shows <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression in a comparable manner to the control side (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6L</xref>) suggests that RA/somite up-regulates <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>at the ventral side independently of the preceding dorsal expression. Given the direct role of RA on the <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the data suggest distinct functions of RA and BMP signals for up-regulating <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in the ventral neural tube, where RA provided by somites functions as an essential signal, while BMP4 functions as a factor facilitating the neural tube to respond to the RA/somite signal.</p><p>It was noted that, in the neural tube at the level posterior to the 7<sup>th </sup>somite, BMP4 is able to up-regulate <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>even in the presence of BMS493 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E&#x02013;G</xref>, arrows). This axial level does not require RA signaling for <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Hence there remains a possibility that BMP signals may be able to up-regulate <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>independent of RA.</p></sec><sec><title>Dorsalization of the neural tube precedes up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4</italic></title><p>We further examined whether the up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>by BMP4 is a direct effect of activation of BMP pathway, or as a consequence of the dorsalized feature of the neural tube. Consistent with the result of embryo cultures with exogenous BMP4, electroporation of <italic>BMP4 </italic>in the neural tube at the 5 somite stage followed by 6&#x02013;8 hours of incubation caused a noticeable up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expanded toward the ventral side (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A, B</xref>). This was accompanied by up-regulation of other dorsal neural markers such as <italic>Msx1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C, D</xref>) and <italic>Pax7 </italic>(data not shown). Electroporation of a GFP construct did not show any changes (data not shown). Hence, the D-V pattern of the neural tube has already been altered by the time we observe the changes in the <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression. Next, the same stage of neural tube was electroporated with <italic>Smad6 </italic>to test the requirement of BMP signals for <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression. Smad6 blocks transduction of BMP and TGF&#x003b2; signals at the intracellular level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Smad6 successfully inhibited <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression at the dorsal side of the neural tube (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8I, J</xref>). However, the down-regulation was not seen at 6 (data not shown) or 24 hours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E, F</xref>) but at 48 hours of incubation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8I, J</xref>), which was presumably due to the late onset of exogenous Smad6 expression, which might not be prompt enough to override the endogenous programme. In fact, Smad6 electroporation caused down-regulation of <italic>Msx1/2 </italic>not at 6 hours, but after 24 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8G, H</xref> and data not shown) and 48 hours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8K, L</xref> and data not shown). These data suggest that <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression is preceded by the BMP signal-dependent dorsalization of the neural tube. It should be noted that the dorsalizing activity of exogenous BMP4 could be mediated by other members of the TGF&#x003b2; super family whose function BMP4 can mimic. Because of the delay in the change in <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>following Smad6 electroporation, and the fact that no known Smad binding sites have been identified in <italic>Hox </italic>gene enhancer elements, it is likely that up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>is due to the dorsal feature of the neural tube induced by BMP signals, rather than the direct effect of activation of the BMP pathway.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Dorsal expression of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>is preceded by dorsalization of the neural tube by BMP signals</bold>.

While RA is likely to be the main signal derived from somites, it has been difficult to explain the neural A-P patterning process solely by RA/somite signals. The aim of this study is to shed light on new aspects other than the factor(s) derived from somites, that is, ectoderm-derived BMP/TGF&#x003b2; signals and the subsequent acquired competence of the neural tube to respond to the somite/RA signal, together with planar signaling. This work also highlights a mechanism where RA and BMP4 act in a concerted manner to initiate neural <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression.</p><sec><title>Vertical and planar signaling</title><p>The classical idea of vertical and planar signaling has been proposed in studies of neural induction and patterning in amphibian embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. With regard to neural A-P patterning, Nieuwkoop proposed that extrinsic 'caudal influences' originate from the mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] whereas others showed that planar signals alone can induce neural A-P pattern based on experiments with exogastrula embryos and Keller's explants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Hence the role of vertical and planar signals in amphibian gastrulae remains debatable.</p><p>This work has focused on the process of neural patterning long after neural induction, revealed by up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4</italic>. It has been demonstrated that vertical signals from somites are required but not solely responsible for the establishment of the <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;L</xref>). Additional signals emanating from more posterior tissues (neural tissue and/or somites) work in conjunction with the vertical signals to up-regulate <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression in anterior regions. These signals travel within the plane of the neural tube (planar signals), however, the source and identity of the planar signal remains to be determined. Based on the requirement of flanking somites for planar signaling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D, E</xref>), we suggest that somites provide not only instructive signals for <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>up-regulation but also permissive signals that assist in planar signaling.</p><p>Other studies have also suggested the existence of planar signals. This includes experiments where rhombomeres were transposed and incorporated at different A-P levels of the neuroepithelium. Induction of <italic>Hox </italic>genes was only observed in the grafted fragment of tissue providing the graft was perfectly incorporated into the host's neuroepithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This suggested that the inducing signals are being transduced along the plane of the neural tube. In contrast, studies by others have discounted the possibility of planar signals. Analysis of the anterior extension of the <italic>Hoxd4 </italic>expression domain demonstrated that tissue continuity was not required in order for <italic>Hoxd4 </italic>expression to be established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Implantation of a glass barrier in the neural tube of a 2 somite stage embryo posterior to the 2<sup>nd </sup>somites did not prevent the extension of <italic>Hoxd4 </italic>expression, thus implying that planar signals are not necessary after the stage at which the glass barrier was placed. This experiment was reassessed in the present study using the <italic>ex ovo </italic>culture system with <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>as a marker (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The result showed a variable yet significant block of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>induction at the anterior side of the barrier, suggesting that tissue continuity is indeed required during the normal course of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>up-regulation.</p><p>The actual mode of action of the planar signal remains elusive. It is possible that one <italic>Hoxb4</italic>-expressing cell activates <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression in the cell(s) adjacent to it. This idea comes from an observation in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos, where injection of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>mRNA into one blastomere causes induction of endogenous <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression outside of the injected lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], suggesting that <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression is able to induce its expression in adjacent cells in a cell non-autonomous manner.</p></sec><sec><title>The mode of action of the somite signal is influenced by the competence of the neural tube</title><p>This study, as well as previous work by others, has shown that in order to establish <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression in the neural tube, RA from the adjacent somites is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, as seen from transverse sections of normal embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E&#x02013;G</xref>), the somite, although adjacent to the neural tube, is not necessarily close to the dorsal side of the neural tube, which is where <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>is strongly expressed initially. This raises the question of how the neural tube exploits the RA/somite signal to initiate <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression. Somite rotation experiments showed no evidence of D-V difference in the strength of inducing ability in somites. This is in agreement with the expression pattern of <italic>RALDH2</italic>, which shows homogeneous expression along the D-V axis of the somites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Our data suggest that RA is provided evenly at the dorsal and ventral sides of the neural tube, and it is the action of BMPs or other members of the TGF&#x003b2; super family that may sensitize the dorsal neural tube to the RA signal, causing stronger <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression dorsally.</p></sec><sec><title>The effect of D-V differences in establishing the regional specificity along the A-P axis</title><p>This work has suggested that BMP signaling is involved in rendering the neural tube competent to express <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in response to RA or somite signals. Since BMP signaling is a specific feature of the dorsalization of the neural tube, this provides evidence that establishment of the <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression pattern, and hence establishment of A-P positional identity, is under the influence of D-V specific cellular characters, demonstrating interplay between the patterning of these two axes.</p><p>The phenomenon of A-P positional markers being initially up-regulated at the dorsal side of the neural tube is common in many <italic>Hox </italic>genes in the spinal cord and in <italic>Krox20 </italic>in rhombomere 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. However, it should be noted that the D-V difference might be only to influence the initial up-regulation and not to affect the expression domains of each <italic>Hox </italic>gene along the A-P axis. Genetically modified animals with affected D-V patterning in the neural tube, such as zebrafish embryos with compromised BMP signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and mouse embryos with deficiency in shh signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], exhibit correct A-P patterns. Therefore the dorsal specific features are, at most, to facilitate the establishment of the A-P patterns and not to give a clue for the correct A-P patterns. In fact, over-expression of BMP4 causes a ventral expansion of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>only at the specific A-P level where <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>is normally expressed, and never anteriorly beyond the normal rhombomere 6/7 boundary (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A, B</xref>). Thus the mechanism to prevent the anterior extension of expression domains is yet to be clarified.</p></sec><sec><title>The effect of RA on <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>up-regulation</title><p>RA signaling is important not only in rhombomere patterning along the A-P axis but also in specifying the dorsal neural tube. Quail embryos deficient in RA exhibit a great loss of dorsal neural tube-specific markers such as <italic>BMP4/7</italic>, <italic>Msx2 </italic>and <italic>Pax3/6/7 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, RA does not appear to be sufficient for dorsalization of the neural tube. It is rather BMP4 that is responsible for dorsalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Hence it appears that RA is required to exert BMP4's dorsalizing activity. Another example of RA functioning in such a supporting manner is observed in the ventral neural tube during motor neuron differentiation. RA is required for the shh signal to induce <italic>olig2 </italic>in the ventral spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Again, RA is not sufficient to induce <italic>olig2 </italic>in the absence of shh signaling; it is <italic>shh </italic>which induces <italic>olig2</italic>. Hence, in these contexts, RA acts as a factor to render the neural tube competent to other extrinsic signals such as shh and BMP4. In the case of <italic>Hoxb4</italic>, it has been shown that RA works directly as an inducer of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression through an RARE in its enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition to this, the present study proposes that RA might also act to maintain the dorsal-specific domain that serves as an 'initial up-regulation area' for <italic>Hoxb4</italic>, which is likely induced by ectoderm-derived BMP4/TGF&#x003b2; signals. Furthermore, our data showed distinct functions of RA and BMP signals: excess RA expands the <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expressing domain anteriorly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] but not ventrally (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7M</xref>), while excess BMP4 facilitates its ventral expansion. However, BMP4 cannot accomplish ventral expansion of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>in the absence of RA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F, G</xref>). Hence RA and BMP4 are mutually required for <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression both in the dorsal domain as well as in the more ventral side of the neural tube.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The mechanism of up-regulating <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>after neural tube formation was investigated. While vertical signals from somites are necessary for up-regulating <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression in the adjacent neural tube, these signals are not always instructive in nature; especially in the anterior-most region of the <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expressing domain, the flanking somites do not sufficiently up-regulate its expression in the adjacent neural tube, yet they are necessary to provide permissive cues that allow the neural tube to respond to planar signals. <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>is initially up-regulated at the dorsal neural tube, with this up-regulation correlating with the dorsalized character of the neural tube. Moreover, somite/RA-dependent up-regulation of <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>is promoted by BMP signals. These data suggest that establishment of the <italic>Hoxb4 </italic>expression pattern, and hence establishment of A-P positional identity, is under the influence of D-V specific cellular characters, demonstrating interplay between the patterning of these two axes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chick explant culture</title><p>Fertilised chick eggs were incubated at 38.5&#x000b0;C until they reached the required somite stages.
