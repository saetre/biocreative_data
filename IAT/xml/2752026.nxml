The vault particle shows a barrel-shaped structure organized in two identical moieties, each consisting of 39 copies of the major vault protein MVP. Earlier data indicated that vault halves can dissociate at acidic pH. The crystal structure of the vault particle solved at 8 &#x000c5; resolution, together with the 2.1-&#x000c5; structure of the seven N-terminal domains (R1&#x02013;R7) of MVP, reveal the interactions governing vault association and provide an explanation for a reversible dissociation induced by low pH. The structural comparison with the recently published 3.5 &#x000c5; model shows major discrepancies, both in the main chain tracing and in the side chain assignment of the two terminal domains R1 and R2.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>major vault protein</kwd><kwd>ribonucleoprotein particle</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>vault</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vault complex, with a mass of 13 MDa and overall dimensions of 40 &#x000d7; 40 &#x000d7; 70 nm, is the largest ribonucleoprotein particle found in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kedersha <italic>et al</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Hamill and Suprenant, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Herrmann <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>). In mammals, vaults contain three proteins: the 100-kDa major vault protein MVP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kedersha and Rome, 1986</xref>), the 193-kDa vault poly(ADP-ribosyl)ating polymerase VPARP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Kickhoefer <italic>et al</italic>, 1999a</xref>) and the 240-kDa telomerase-associated protein TEP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kickhoefer <italic>et al</italic>, 1999b</xref>). Additionally, at least one small and untranslated RNA is found as a constitutive component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kickhoefer <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>). Approximately 75&#x00025; of the vault particle mass is due to MVP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kedersha <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>). Vault-like particles (VLPs), similar to purified endogenous vaults, are observed when rat MVP is expressed in insect cells, indicating that MVP is sufficient to direct the formation of VLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Stephen <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Earlier sequence analysis of the highly conserved MVP protein indicated the presence of seven 50-residue repeats at its N-terminus, whereas a two-stranded coiled coil was predicted to be present at the C-terminal half of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">van Zon <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Despite their diverse origin, vaults are uniform in size and morphology when imaged by electron microscopy presenting a barrel-like structure with an invaginated waist and two protruding caps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kong <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). The N-terminal region of MVP forms the particle waist and accounts for the non-covalent interface at the vault midsection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Mikyas <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), whereas the C-terminus builds the cap as well as the cap/barrel junction.</p><p>The fact that the murine MVP was found to be orthologous to the earlier described human lung resistance-related protein, known to be overexpressed in multiple chemotherapy resistance models immediately associated vaults with intrinsic drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Scheffer <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). This particle has also been implicated in the regulation of several cellular processes including transport mechanisms, signal transmission and immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Berger <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). An increasing number of proteins have been described as being bound and transported by MVP. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Yu <italic>et al</italic> (2002)</xref> showed that MVP binds through N-terminal repeats R3 and R4 to the C2 domain of the tumour-suppressor phosphatase PTEN in a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent manner. MVP has also been proposed to act as a scaffold for the epidermal growth factor-induced MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Kolli <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), and interactions have also been described with the estrogen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abbondanza <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). Another function for vaults was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Herlevsen <italic>et al</italic> (2007)</xref> that found that MVP knockdown disrupted the lysosomal compartment. Interestingly, an independent set of experiments demonstrated vault dissociation at low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Goldsmith <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Esfandiary <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). The former authors proposed that the acidic nature of the lysosomes may serve as an excellent microenviroment with which to trigger vault dissociation. Vault lability was also observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Poderycki <italic>et al</italic> (2006)</xref> that managed to incorporate vault-associated proteins into preformed MVP-only recombinant vaults proving that they are not rigid, impenetrable boxes, but more a fluctuating dynamic structure presenting substantial flexibility. Their capsular structure and the occasional occurrence of a mass in the inner hollow cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kong <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>) led to the hypothesis that they might represent transport vehicles. However, both the cellular signals responsible for vault opening and the nature of this cargo have still to be determined.</p><p>Very recently, the structure of the rat vault at 3.5 &#x000c5; resolution has been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). It shows that the vault shell is organized in two identical moieties, each consisting of 39 copies of MVP. The MVP monomers are folded into 12 distinct domains: nine repeat domains, a shoulder domain, a cap-helix and a cap ring. Here, we report the high resolution structures of a recombinant MVP fragment, containing the seven N-terminal domain repeats (R1&#x02013;R7), in three different crystal forms and of the intact vaults from rat liver determined at 8 &#x000c5; resolution. The comparison between the structures of R1&#x02013;R7 and the equivalent region in the reported model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>) shows fundamental discrepancies in the tracing of domains R1 and R2. The discrepancies are most probably due to difficulties in model building, using a 3.5-&#x000c5; map of the whole vault. The quality of the R1&#x02013;R7 data allows unequivocal tracing of domains R1 and R2 that form the rims between the two vault halves. The positioning of the 2.1-&#x000c5; structure of R1&#x02013;R7 into the 8-&#x000c5; map of the entire vault reveals the interactions stabilizing vault association and suggests a pH-dependent mechanism for the reversible disassembly of the particle.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Structure of the MVP N-terminal fragment R1&#x02013;R7</title><p>The N-terminal fragment of MVP (amino acid residues from Met1 to Asp383) containing the first seven domain repeats R1&#x02013;R7 was crystallized in three different crystal forms: triclinic P1, diffracting to 2.1 &#x000c5; resolution and two monoclinic crystal forms, P2<sub>1</sub>A (3.0 &#x000c5;) and P2<sub>1</sub>B (2.5 &#x000c5;) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). The structure was determined by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) of seleniomethionated protein from the monoclinic P2<sub>1</sub>B crystals. The P1 and P2<sub>1</sub>A structures were solved by molecular replacement, using the coordinates of the P2<sub>1</sub>B crystals as a starting model. The seven MVP repeats share a similar fold, each consisting of five antiparallel &#x003b2; strands connected by loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The main structural differences between domain repeats concentrate in the size and conformation of the loops, connecting strands. The loop between strands &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3 shows the highest variability and appears partially disordered in repeat R7 in all crystal forms analysed. The central repeats R3, R4 and R5 possess an additional &#x003b2;-hairpin inserted in the protruding loop &#x003b2;2&#x02013;&#x003b2;3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Sequence analyses in earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">van Zon <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>) predicted two possible EF hand domains in repeats R3 and R4 with the putative calcium-binding loop located at the &#x003b2;2&#x02013;&#x003b2;3 hairpin mentioned above (positions 130&#x02013;146 of R3 and 181&#x02013;197 of R4; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1A and B</xref>). Further studies showed that MVP interactions with other proteins such as PTEN were mediated through the proposed EF hands and modulated by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Yu <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). The structures determined here, with all &#x003b2;-conformation, do not show EF hand domains, nor calcium-binding cavities. Moreover, no Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or other ions were found in any of the structures determined. These putative calcium-binding regions located within the &#x003b2;2&#x02013;&#x003b2;3 hairpins contain several acidic residues (E130, E131, E135, D141, E146 in &#x003b2;2&#x02013;&#x003b2;3 of R3 and E181, D184, D186, E189, E194 in &#x003b2;2&#x02013;&#x003b2;3 of R4; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>) totally exposed to the solvent. This large electronegative surface could be able to bind, either Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or the electropositive surface of the CBR3 loop of the PTEN C2 domain, or both in an alternative unknown mechanism.</p><p>The overall structure of R1&#x02013;R7 is maintained in the three crystal forms, showing only minor variations in the relative positioning of the repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). The seven modules are separated by a short linker and closely packed through a hydrophobic interface, formed by residues of strands &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3 and loops &#x003b2;4&#x02013;&#x003b2;5 of consecutive domains. The interdomain linker is also involved in interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table I</xref>). The contact surface is particularly extensive between domains R1 and R2 where, in addition to the interactions mentioned above, the long &#x003b2;2&#x02013;&#x003b2;3 loop of R2 extends over R1 making both, hydrophobic and polar contacts with residues of the &#x003b2;3 strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table I</xref>). The seven repeats are organized in an extended conformation, showing a characteristic bend between repeats R2 and R3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The structure of R1&#x02013;R7 provides the building block for the central vault barrel</title><p>In the P1 crystals, the R1&#x02013;R7 repeats are packed in a parallel arrangement, generating a flat wall of an &#x0223c;18 &#x000c5; thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>) in good agreement with the dimensions estimated by cryo EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kong <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Mikyas <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). With the exception of R7, all repeats participate in lateral packing contacts that are mediated by polar and hydrophobic interactions between 26 different residues that are located in loops &#x003b2;1&#x02013;&#x003b2;2, &#x003b2;3&#x02013;&#x003b2;4 and in the interdomain linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Intact vaults, purified from rat liver were crystallized in different crystal forms, basically identical to the ones described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Querol-Audi <italic>et al</italic> (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kato <italic>et al</italic> (2008)</xref>. Two of them, the monoclinic P2<sub>1</sub> and C2, were analysed by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table II</xref>). Data from the P2<sub>1</sub> crystals were used to solve the structure of the whole vault particle to 8 &#x000c5; resolution by molecular replacement. Initial models were generated as rings of the R1&#x02013;R7 structure with different rotational symmetries (see Materials and methods). The interactions observed in the triclinic crystal packing served as a restraint for building the central barrel of the vault. The bending between domains R2 and R3 could explain the invagination in the central part of the vault particle, with the R1 module located in this central part, as suggested earlier by cryo-EM and mutational studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Mikyas <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). The positioning of the R1&#x02013;R7 rings in both the C2 and P2<sub>1</sub> vault crystals indicate that only models with rotational symmetry of 39 allow intermolecular interactions between neighbour vault particles without introducing steric problems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>), in complete agreement with the D39 symmetry suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kato <italic>et al</italic> (2008)</xref>.</p><p>Density averaging and solvent flattening with DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">CCP4, 1994</xref>) were applied for the P2<sub>1</sub> crystals, using the independent positioning of the two R1&#x02013;R7 rings as starting phases and rotational symmetry 39 (see Materials and methods). The final averaged maps at 8 &#x000c5; resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>) showed unambiguous density, fitting the complete MVP protein. In particular, two additional &#x003b2; domains (R8 and R9) and the long helical domain, for which no information was included in the initial model were clearly defined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). The small changes required in the orientation of repeats R1, R2 and R7, departing from the R1&#x02013;R7 model used, were also visible in the averaged maps. Furthermore, to automatically evaluate the quality of the 8-&#x000c5; averaged density of the vault particle, the secondary structural elements (SSEs) were quantitatively detected and annotated with the program SSEHunter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Baker <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), rendering the same overall structure to that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic> (2009)</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Structural comparisons of the seven N-terminal domains in the R1&#x02013;R7 structure and in the 3.5-&#x000c5; particle</title><p>Overall comparisons between the R1&#x02013;R7 structures determined here with the same region in the intact vault particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>) showed a good superimposition of the central domains, from R3 to R6, but different changes in the relative positioning of domains R1, R2 and to a lesser extent R7, affecting the relative curvature of the fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). Structural superimpositions of the individualized domains revealed close similarities in repeats R3 to R7, as indicated by the root mean square deviations ranging from 0.6 to 1.3 &#x000c5;, for the superimposition of all the residues within the repeats. However, critical differences were observed when repeats R1 and R2 from the R1&#x02013;R7 structures were compared with those reported by Tanaka <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). Repeat R1 shows well-defined SSEs (strands R1&#x003b2;1&#x02013;R1&#x003b2;5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>) in all three crystal forms determined. In the 3.5-&#x000c5; vault structure, most of the SSEs of R1 are lost and the main chain is out of register from residue Ile10 to Gln88. The largest discrepancies concentrate in the &#x003b2;2&#x02013;&#x003b2;3 loops of both, R1 and R2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>) and affect most of the R1&#x02013;R2 and R1&#x02013;R1 interdomain interactions, including those responsible for the contacts between the two vault halves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>). Real space map correlation, calculated with SFcheck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">CCP4, 1994</xref>) for R1R2 domains in the P1 structure, show an overall value of 93.1&#x00025; with minor deviations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). The overall density correlation for the same region in the 3.5-&#x000c5; vault structure is 88.5&#x00025; with the largest deviations concentrated in the &#x003b2;2&#x02013;&#x003b2;3 loop of R2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). The loops &#x003b2;2&#x02013;&#x003b2;3 of both, R1 and R2 domains show well-defined electron density in all R1&#x02013;R7 structures determined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>In the 3.5-&#x000c5; structure of the vault particle, the N-terminal residues (from Met1 to Glu4) were organized in an intermolecular antiparallel &#x003b2; sheet around the two-fold axis. An ionic interaction was also observed at the interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). The R1&#x02013;R7 structures reported here show that the most N-terminal residues of MVP are highly flexible. In P2<sub>1</sub>A and P2<sub>1</sub>B crystals, the seven first residues point out of the domain core and participate in crystal packing interactions. In the P1 crystal form, the first four amino acids are disordered and from residue Glu5 onward the region runs parallel to the R1 core, following similar trajectory to that found in the equivalent domain of the entire particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Hypothetical mechanism for vault opening</title><p>The correct positioning of the 2.1-&#x000c5; R1&#x02013;R7 structure into the 8-&#x000c5; map of the complete particle (this work) as well as in the 3.5-&#x000c5; averaged map, calculated from the deposited structure factors (PDB id; 2ZV4) of the Tanaka structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), reveals important charge complementarity at the interface between the two vault halves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). R1&#x02013;R1 interactions involve two R1 subunits in each half vault moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Side chain of residue Asp39 forms a salt bridge with Arg42 and contacts the main chain N atoms of Ala21 and Gln22. The charged amino acids Glu4, Glu5 and Arg37 and a cluster of hydrophobic residues (Ala6, Ile7 and Ile36), interacting through the two-fold axis of the particle, also determine the contact surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>Recent data obtained by combining fluorescence spectroscopy, multiangle laser light scattering and electron microscopy, provided evidences that vaults dissociate into halves at low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Goldsmith <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The interactions determined in this work let us propose a reversible mechanism of dissociation of the vault particle induced by a pH change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). At low pH, the 234 acidic residues at the vault interface would become neutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Grimsley <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), leaving a highly electropositive charge and inducing the disassembly of the vault particle by charge repulsion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). At higher pH, the aspartate and glutamate residues would recover their acidic state and re-establish the electrostatic interactions, allowing the re-association between the two vault halves.

On close examination, each flower appeared to be composed of eight rectangular petals surrounding a central ring and with the corner of each petal connected to the ring by a short hook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kedersha <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>). After the separation of the two vault halves, the external acidic surfaces observed in the R1&#x02013;R7 region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>), would try to maximize their electrostatic interactions with the polylysine-coated support. About eight petals, with four or five MVP protomers each, seem to provide suited flattened interacting surfaces, while still retaining a high percentage of the lateral interactions among MVP protomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). The vault cap regions, stabilized by extensive hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), are expected to retain native-like conformations, which might correspond to the central ring of the flowers.</p><p>Understanding the mechanisms governing vault opening constitutes an important step towards unravelling vault functions. Moreover, exploiting recombinant vaults as nanocapsules for the delivery of biomolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Esfandiary <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) is a promising therapeutic application that would benefit from such understanding.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Production and purification of the N-terminal fragment of MVP</title><p>The coding sequence for the N-terminus region of MVP, spanning residues 1&#x02013;383, was amplified by PCR using the commercially available Mus Musculus MVP cDNA (RIKEN full-length enriched library, clone: E430002N03) as a template. This fragment was cloned into the pGemT easy vector system (Promega). pGex_R1&#x02013;R7 plasmid was generated by subcloning this insert into the pGex-6P1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), an expression vector that incorporates an amino-terminal GST-tag to the expressed protein.

This procedure resulted in an electron density map of sufficient quality to position accurately mostly the backbone of the two independent R1&#x02013;R7 molecules in the a.u. Some particular features in the map, especially the presence of bulky densities that would correspond to highly conserved Trp residues allowed the sequence assignment of about 20&#x00025; of the residues.

Purified vault particles were subjected to extensive crystallization trials and a diversity of crystals were obtained, though only for two of them X-ray diffraction data have been collected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table II</xref>). The first crystals were monoclinic, space group C2, with unit cell parameters <italic>a</italic>=726.2 &#x000c5;, <italic>b</italic>=391.4 &#x000c5;, <italic>c</italic>=607.6 &#x000c5; and &#x003b2;=124.1&#x000b0; and diffracted to a maximum of about 10 &#x000c5; resolution.

Data collection was performed at 100K, using synchrotron radiation (beamlines ID23-EH1, ESRF, France and X06SA, SLS, Switzerland). Crystals were very sensitive to radiation, being stable to the X-ray for only 10&#x02013;15 exposures (0.3&#x000b0; per exposure). Diffraction images were processed and scaled using the programs MOSFLM and SCALA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">CCP4, 1994</xref>). Large number of crystals were analysed but most of them resulted non-isomorphous. The P2<sub>1</sub> data, 50.1&#x00025; complete, were obtained from five crystals and the C2 data, with 48&#x00025; completeness, were obtained form four crystals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table II</xref>). A detailed comparison of the crystal packing modes of vaults in the two space groups is provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary data</xref>.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Molecular replacement and density modification</title><p>Initial models corresponding to the R1&#x02013;R7 region of the vaults were generated as rings of the R1&#x02013;R7 structure with different rotational symmetries. Interactions between neighbour R1&#x02013;R7 chains are essentially identical in the ring and in the P1 crystal, except for the small departures introduced by the curvature of the ring (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). In the modelled rings, the average radius of the modules differs only for the R1 module, which allows the definition of the internal face of the ring as the one with the R1 module having the smallest radius. This would explain the invagination in the central part of the vault, implying also that the R1 module is located in the central part, in full agreement with what had been reported by EM and mutational studies. When the R1&#x02013;7 rings were placed in both the C2 and P2<sub>1</sub> vault crystals, the models with a rotational symmetry of 38 or smaller result in unfeasible, loose packings in which no direct interactions can be established between neighbour vault particles. In turn, models with rotational symmetries of 40 or higher result in unacceptable steric clashes between neighbour vaults in the crystal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). A rotational symmetry of 39 allows interaction between neighbour vault particles without introducing steric problems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Density averaging and solvent flattening were applied, for the P2<sub>1</sub> crystals, using the program DM. The averaging (and corresponding solvent flattening) masks were initially defined as cylindrical shells following the external profile of the vaults reported from EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kong <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). Shrinkage factors for the profile (with a final value of 0.95) were used to minimize the overlaps between masks from neighbour vaults. The masks were also limited by the middle planes of the straight line joining (and perpendicular) to the longest axis of the close neighbour vaults, similarly to what is often done in virus studies. The thickness of the shells were initially set very large (even values of &#x0003e;100 &#x000c5; in the central part of the vault were tested) to avoid any limiting assumption. The solvent averaging masks were taken, in general, as the complementary of the averaging masks, though buffer regions were also tested.</p><p>Initial phases were either taken from models of continuous density within the mask, by placing the R1&#x02013;R7 rings in different orientations or by combinations of both. Cycles of averaging and phase extension, performed using for averaging only the rotational symmetry, consistently resulted in a thin shell of continuous density with details differing depending on the initial phasing and in the phase extension protocol used. Therefore, a new averaging mask was then defined adjusted to the thin shell of density. The volume inside the averaging mask represented a density of 20&#x00025;, close to the one estimated using the Matthew coefficient for 2 &#x000d7; 39 MVP subunits.</p><p>With these new averaging and solvent flattening masks, cycles of phase extensions were preformed with the initial phases obtained using only one R1&#x02013;R7 ring whose orientation around and positioning along the vault axis were systematically screened. To reduce model bias, the no-combine mode in DM was used and starting figures of merit were set to 0.3. The best result gave a final electron density map in which the second R1&#x02013;R7 ring was clearly visible in the second half of the vault, even despite no model had been introduced in that region. This density required only minor changes in the available R1&#x02013;R7 ring model with a rotational symmetry of 39. Then, the process was repeated using the positioning of only the second R1&#x02013;R7 for initial phasing. The corresponding electron density map showed again the density corresponding to the R1&#x02013;R7 ring in the first half of the vault, where now no model had been introduced. Therefore, the two R1&#x02013;R7 rings have been well fitted in the vaults density derived without any model bias. The process was then repeated using as starting phases the two R1&#x02013;R7 rings and either the 39 rotational symmetry or the complete point group symmetry of the vault, 39 2, where the position of the vault two-fold axis was determined from the relationships between the chains in the two R1&#x02013;R7 rings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="N0x341c7d0N0x3e5ecb0" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supplementary Data</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="emboj2009274s1.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="N0x341c7d0N0x3e5ed10" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Review Process File</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="emboj2009274s2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grants BFU2005-08686-C02-01 to IF and BFU2005-02376/BMC and BIO2008-2556 to NV.
