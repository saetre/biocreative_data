One aspect in particular is the transduction events occurring at the plasma membrane following Wnt activation of the Frizzled/LRP6 coreceptor complex. Studies over the last several years have shed light on these events by uncovering several kinases that phosphorylate LRP6 resulting in its recruitment of AXIN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006129-Zeng1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006129-Davidson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. As AXIN recruitment to LRP6 appears to be a key step in the propagation of a WNT signal, it is likely a hotspot for pathway regulation. Our identification of Bili as a negative regulator of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling and inhibitor of AXIN recruitment to LRP6 is the first report of negative regulation at this step in pathway transduction. The specific details of how Bili affects AXIN recruitment will be the focus of future studies. One proposed mechanism is that Bili sterically hinders the recruitment of the kinases required for LRP6 phosphorylation and subsequent AXIN recruitment. A second possibility is that Bili inhibits the formation of LRP6 aggregates or &#x02018;signalosomes&#x02019; which have been shown to be the LRP6 population associated with AXIN (Bilic et al. 2007).</p><p>We propose that inhibitors of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway fall into two groups: &#x02018;constitutive inhibitors&#x02019; that keep basal levels of &#x003b2;-catenin low, such as members of the degradation complex; and &#x02018;inducible inhibitors&#x02019; that act outside of the degradation complex and may function only when the pathway has been activated. The &#x02018;constitutive inhibitors&#x02019; would include APC and AXIN, while &#x02018;inducible inhibitors&#x02019; would include NKD and Bili. Consistent with this categorization, NKD and Bili both antagonize a WNT signal between receptor activation and the degradation machinery as well as having similar phenotypes in both flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006129-Zeng2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006129-Wharton1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. In concert, constitutive and inducible inhibitors allow for rapid pathway activation in response to WNT ligand and tight regulation of the strength and duration of the WNT signal. Continued characterization and identification of both constitutive and inducible inhibitors is key to our understanding of the regulation of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in development and disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly screen</title><p>The screen was performed as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006129-DasGupta1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Reporter assays</title><p>&#x003b2;-catenin reporter assays were carried out in the 24-well or 48-well plate format in HEK293T cells transiently expressing SuperTOPFLASH (1&#x02013;5 ng) or BAR (&#x003b2;-catenin Activated Reporter) and <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (10&#x02013;40 ng) for normalization.

Expression of short-hairpin (shRNA) dbili (#3M) under the control of prd-GAL4 in the Drosophila embryo results in &#x0003e;75&#x00025; knockdown in message level (Red bar) as compared to prd-GAL4 control embryos (Blue bar). As a control, Armadillo mRNA was not affected in embryos expressing dBili shRNA. (B) Embryos expressing dBili shRNA under the control of even skipped stripe 3/7-GAL4: These embryos display a partial lack/disruption of the 2nd or 3rd denticle belt which coincides with the eve-stripe 3 expression. This phenotype is consistent with a localized increase in Wingless signaling activity in the region around eve-stripe 3. The same however was not observed for stripe 7 (posterior end of the embryo), perhaps due to differential expression of GAL4 in stripe 3 versus stripe 7.</p><p>(3.11 MB EPS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0006129.s003.eps" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="postscript"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006129.s004"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>(A) Knockdown of dBili with a second dsRNA, ds11848_2, revealed only &#x0223c;30&#x00025; knockdown of endogenous message compared to the original dsRNA (DRSC1.0-CG11848) which robustly knocked down message levels by &#x0003e;50&#x00025;.
