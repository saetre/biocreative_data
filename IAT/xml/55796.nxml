We have previously shown that the mechanism of M1 splicing repression is conserved between distantly related <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. Using transgenic fly strains, we have examined the effects on regulation of mutations in two conserved features of the M1 intron. Our results show that TRA-2-dependent repression of M1 splicing depends on the presence of a suboptimal non-consensus 3&#x02032; splice site. Substitution of this 3&#x02032; splice site with a strong splice site resulted in TRA-2 independent splicing, while substitution with an unrelated weak 3&#x02032; splice site was compatible with repression, implying that reduced basal splicing efficiency is important for regulation. A second conserved element internal to the intron was found to be essential for efficient M1 splicing in the soma where the intron is not normally retained. We show that the role of this element is to enhance splicing and overcome the reduction in efficiency caused by the intron&#x02019;s suboptimal 3&#x02032; splice site. Our results indicate that antagonistic elements in the M1 intron act together to establish a context that is permissive for repression of splicing by TRA-2 while allowing efficient splicing in the absence of a repressor.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A number of RNA binding proteins have now been identified that regulate the cell-specific splicing of specific pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c2">2</xref>). Several of these factors also autoregulate their own expression by directing alternative splicing of the pre-mRNAs that encode them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c7">7</xref>). For example, the splicing regulator TRA-2 controls the splicing of pre-mRNAs of genes such as <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>) and <italic>fruitless</italic> (<italic>fru</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c14">14</xref>) as well as that from the <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> gene itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c4">4</xref>). Autoregulation of splicing in this case serves to limit the expression of a specific isoform of TRA-2 (TRA-2<sup>226</sup>) that is required in male germ cells for normal spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c15">15</xref>). Negative feedback has an important biological role because expression of excessive levels of TRA-2<sup>226</sup> in the germline results in formation of abnormal spermatids and sterility in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c16">16</xref>).</p><p> The focal point of <italic>tra-2 </italic>autoregulation is the M1 intron which splits the initiation codon of the TRA-2<sup>226</sup> open reading frame. M1 splicing is repressed by the TRA-2<sup>226</sup> protein resulting in the formation of an alternative mRNA encoding TRA-2<sup>179</sup>, a protein isoform initiating translation at a downstream start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c18">18</xref>). Unlike TRA-2<sup>226</sup>, expression of TRA-2<sup>179 </sup>is neither sufficient nor required in the germline for spermatogenesis. In flies homozygous for point mutations blocking expression of functional TRA-2<sup>226</sup>, the M1 intron is efficiently spliced and M1-containing RNAs are not detected in the germline. In contrast, in wild-type males expressing this protein the M1 intron is retained in &#x0003e;50&#x00025; of mature germline <italic>tra-2</italic> mRNA. Thus repression of M1 splicing serves to limit the amount of TRA-2<sup>226</sup>-encoding mRNA that is produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c16">16</xref>).</p><p> In addition to germ cells, TRA-2 mRNAs are produced in a wide variety of somatic tissues in both sexes. Although a low level of M1 retention is observed in the soma, accumulation of somatic M1-containing RNA is not dependent on functional TRA-2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c4">4</xref>). The basis of the germline specificity of TRA-2 autoregulation is unknown, but it is unlikely that TRA2<sup>226</sup> is a limiting factor as significant levels of mRNAs encoding this isoform have been shown to be present both in the soma and germline.</p><p> The mechanism responsible for TRA-2-dependent repression of M1 splicing in male germ cells is likely to differ significantly from the well characterized mechanism by which TRA-2 activates female-specific splicing of <italic>dsx</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c25">25</xref>). The latter activity occurs only in the soma rather than the germline, requires a cofactor (TRA) that is not involved in repression of M1 splicing and can be functionally separated from the repression of M1 splicing by specific mutations in the <italic>tra-2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c26">26</xref>). Moreover, in <italic>dsx</italic> splicing, TRA-2<sup>226</sup> and other TRA-2 isoforms associate with the <italic>dsx</italic> pre-mRNA and enhance splice site recognition by recruiting general splicing factors, but in the case of the M1 intron, TRA-2 protein acts to repress splicing.</p><p> We have taken an evolutionary approach to identify <italic>cis</italic>-elements affecting M1 splicing. In a previous study we showed that the negative feedback strategy used by the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic><italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> gene is conserved in <italic>Drosophila virilis</italic>, a species that diverged &#x0003e;60 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c27">27</xref>). Although the intron sequences of these two species are highly divergent, two short conserved sequence features were identified within M1. In this study we have investigated the possible regulatory roles of these sequences. Our results show that these sequences have opposing activities that are necessary for the correct tissue-specific repression of M1 splicing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of transgenes</title><p><italic>P</italic>&#x0005b;<italic>tra2&#x0002f;ftz</italic>&#x0005d;, in which the <italic>ftz</italic> intron is substituted for the M1 intron of<italic> tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic>, was introduced into the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome using the plasmid pCSP<italic>tra2&#x0002f;ftzIVS</italic>. To generate this plasmid, primer-directed mutagenesis of sequences flanking both introns was performed to introduce ClaI sites.

Cycling at these temperatures was followed by a single final incubation at 72&#x000b0;C for 5 min. In all experiments the primers were positioned so that PCR products derived from M1-containing RNAs could be readily distinguished from products derived from contaminating genomic DNA based on gel mobility. The above PCR conditions produced ratios of endogenous spliced and unspliced M1 intron consistent with those determined in nuclease protection experiments and were therefore judged to be representative of the relative ratios of transgenic products as well.</p><p> PCR products were separated on a 1.2&#x00025; agarose gel and blotted overnight in 1.5 M sodium chloride, 0.1 M sodium citrate.

These oligonucleotides are complementary to sequences at the position of the 7 nt insertion placed in exon 4.

A restriction fragment containing the entire <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2&#x0002f;ftz</italic> hybrid gene as well as the <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> promoter and its other flanking sequences was then introduced into the P element transformation vector pCaSper4 to produce the plasmid pCSP<italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2&#x0002f;ftz</italic>IVS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f1">1</xref>A). In these and all subsequent constructs we included a 7 nt insertion in exon 4 that served both to block translation of TRA-2<sup>226</sup> protein from the transgene and as a means of distinguishing the transgene-derived RNAs from those of the endogenous <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f1">1</xref>A). Transcripts from the transgene were specifically detected by RT&#x02013;PCR using an oligonucleotide (Nae&#x0002b;1) that&#x000a0;includes sequences homologous to the 7 nt insertions in exon 4.</p><p> Fly strains containing random insertions of the <italic>P</italic>&#x0005b;<italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2&#x0002f;ftz</italic>&#x0005d; transgene were produced by microinjection of <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic><italic><sup>B</sup></italic>&#x0002f;<italic>CyO</italic> embryos.

Control experiments confirmed that the M1 intron containing RNA from the endogenous <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> gene accumulated normally (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f1">1</xref>C).

Together these results show that <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2&#x0002f;ftz</italic>IVS transcripts are not subject to splicing repression by products from the endogenous <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> gene. We conclude from this that sequences within the M1 intron are necessary for splicing repression.</p></sec><sec><title>A suboptimal 3&#x02032; splice site is essential for repression of M1 splicing <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Examination of the sequence of the M1 3&#x02032; splice site region revealed that it differs significantly in several respects from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> 3&#x02032; splice site consensus. An adenosine is present at the &#x02013;3 position rather than the consensus pyrimidine that is found in &#x0223c;96&#x00025; of all <italic>Drosophila</italic> introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c29">29</xref>). In addition, the 3&#x02032; splice site was not preceded by the usual long polypyrimidine tract, but instead only by several short runs of pyrimidines each &#x0003c;5 nt in length (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f2">2</xref>A). Finally, there was no good match to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> consensus branchpoint in the distal region of the intron (not shown). We previously found that the 3&#x02032; splice site region of the M1 intron of the <italic>D.virilis</italic> tra-2 gene shares these characteristics and that this intron is also repressed by TRA-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c27">27</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that these atypical sequences are suboptimally recognized by the general splicing machinery and that poor recognition of the 3&#x02032; splice site&#x0002f;polypyrimidine tract facilitates TRA-2-dependent repression of M1 splicing. To test this idea, we produced transgenes with two mutations, in which sequences from the 3&#x02032; splice site region of M1 were replaced with sequences more closely matching the <italic>Drosophila</italic> consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c29">29</xref>). In <italic>P&#x0005b;ftz 3</italic>&#x02032;<italic>&#x0005d;</italic> the M1 3&#x02032; splice site and polypyrimidine tract were replaced with the analagous sequences from the <italic>ftz</italic> intron (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f2">2</xref>A). In the other construct, <italic>P&#x0005b;CAG 3</italic>&#x02032;<italic>&#x0005d;</italic>, the non-consensus A residue at position &#x02013;3 was changed to C as in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> consensus. Transgenic fly strains were generated using both of these mutations and assayed for the ability of transgene-derived RNA to undergo M1 repression in the presence and absence of functional endogenous TRA-2. Splicing of the &#x02018;improved&#x02019; M1 intron in transcripts from <italic>P&#x0005b;ftz 3&#x02032;&#x0005d;</italic> was not repressed in the presence of TRA-2 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f2">2</xref>B, lanes 5&#x02013;8). This indicates that splicing of an intron containing a consensus 3&#x02032; splice site cannot be repressed by TRA-2. In contrast, transcripts from <italic>P</italic>&#x0005b;<italic>tra-2&#x0002f;CAG</italic>&#x0005d; were repressed by endogenous TRA-2 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f2">2</xref>B, lanes 9&#x02013;12) to a similar extent to endogenous<italic> tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> RNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f2">2</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;4). This shows that a non-consensus nucleotide at the &#x02013;3 position is not essential for<italic> tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic>-dependent repression of M1 splicing.</p><p> A possible explanation for the above findings is that non-consensus sequences near the 3&#x02032; splice site are necessary to lower the basal rate of M1 splicing to a level that permits repression by TRA-2<sup>226</sup>. A second possibility is that the substituted sequences are directly and specifically recognized by TRA-2 or another regulatory factor involved in repression. To distinguish these possibilities we used sequences from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> myosin heavy chain intron E (mhce) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c30">30</xref>), which also has a non-consensus 3&#x02032; splice site, to substitute for those of the M1 3&#x02032; splice site&#x0002f;polypyrimidine tract region. The mhce 3&#x02032; splice site sequences differ from those of the native M1 intron (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f2">2</xref>A) and thus, would not be expected to bind similar regulatory factors. Transcripts produced from a transgene with this substitution <italic>P&#x0005b;mhce 3</italic>&#x02032;<italic>&#x0005d;</italic> are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f2">2</xref>B (lanes 13 and 15). Unlike endogenous<italic> tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> transcripts, a large fraction of transgene-derived RNAs retained the M1 intron in the absence of functional TRA-2 protein (lane 13). This suggests that recognition of the 3&#x02032; splice site in<italic> P&#x0005b;mhce 3</italic>&#x02032;<italic>&#x0005d;</italic> by the basal splicing machinery is less efficient than splicing of transcripts from the endogenous<italic> tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> gene. Significantly, in the presence of a functional endogenous TRA-2 protein, splicing of the M1 intron from <italic>P&#x0005b;mhce 3</italic>&#x02032;<italic>&#x0005d;</italic> was further reduced (lane 15). These results indicate that substitution of mhce sequences near the 3&#x02032; end of the intron are compatible with TRA-2-dependent splicing repression. Because repression occurs with either the mhce or the native M1 sequences, we conclude that a critical feature of this region necessary for splicing repression is a suboptimal (but functional) polypyrimidine tract.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation of a conserved sequence internal to the M1 intron affects splicing in somatic tissues</title><p>Comparison of the <italic>D.virilis</italic> and<italic> D.melanogaster</italic><italic>tra-2 </italic>genes also revealed a sequence element (VC) internal to the M1 intron of both genes that is conserved at 15 out of 18 positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c27">27</xref>). To determine if the VC element plays an important role in M1 repression we generated two transgenes with different mutations disrupting the element in the <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> M1 intron (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f3">3</xref>A). In the transgene P&#x0005b;<italic>VC-sub</italic>&#x0005d; we replaced the VC element with random nucleotides at 14 out of 18 positions. In the transgene P&#x0005b;<italic>VCdel</italic>&#x0005d; we deleted 14 nt from the element. Both transgenes produced M1-containing RNAs in a TRA-2 independent manner, suggesting that the VC element is necessary for efficient splicing of the intron (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f3">3</xref>B). Northern blot analysis of M1-containing RNAs from a transgenic strain carrying P&#x0005b;<italic>VC-sub</italic>&#x0005d; revealed the appearance of a novel M1-containing RNA that is independent of the presence of functional TRA-2 protein and is larger than the normal male germline M1-containing<italic> tra</italic>-<italic>2 </italic>transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f3">3</xref>C). The size of the novel RNA suggests that it might be derived from the soma where an upstream transcription start site is utilized (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f4">4</xref>A) and where the M1 intron is normally not retained at significant levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c31">31</xref>). RNAase protection assays confirmed that these flies expressed novel transcripts with the somatic form of exon 3 and retained the entire M1 intron (data not shown). To further determine that these novel transcripts accumulate in the soma, we utilized primers from exons 2 and 4 in RT&#x02013;PCR experiments with RNA extracted from gonad-free carcasses of adult male flies. M1-containing sequences made up a large fraction of the products deriving from both the P&#x0005b;<italic>VC-sub</italic>&#x0005d; and P&#x0005b;<italic>VC-del</italic>&#x0005d; transgenes but were only a minor fraction of products from the endogenous <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f4">4</xref>B). As expected based on previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c31">31</xref>), neither endogenous nor transgenic M1 containing RNAs found in the soma were dependent on the activity of the TRA-2 protein. We conclude that somatic splicing of the M1 intron is reduced in the absence of the VC element.</p></sec><sec><title>The VC element is necessary to overcome suboptimal splicing signals near the 3&#x02032; end of the M1 intron</title><p>The low levels of M1-containing transcripts present in the soma suggest that the intron is normally efficiently spliced in these tissues despite the presence of suboptimal 3&#x02032; signals. This led us to hypothesize that a function of the VC element is to overcome these suboptimal splicing signals. If so, then an intron with consensus 3&#x02032; splicing signals would not be expected to require the VC element in the soma for efficient splicing. We therefore produced transgenic flies that expressed transcripts carrying a combination of mutations in both VC and the 3&#x02032; splice site region P&#x0005b;<italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2&#x0002f;VCsub, ftz 3</italic>&#x02032;&#x0005d;.

As predicted by our hypothesis, the M1 intron was efficiently spliced from transcripts containing this transgene despite the absence of a functional VC element (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f5">5</xref>). These results indicate that the VC element is required for M1 splicing only in the presence of the suboptimal, native 3&#x02032; splicing signals.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The alternative splicing of <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> appears to be conserved during evolution. TRA-2 protein variants that are generated by alternative splicing in humans are strikingly similar to those produced in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c32">32</xref>). Although conservation of the regulatory mechanisms between human and insects appears unlikely, examination of the splicing of <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2 </italic>RNA from <italic>D.virilis</italic>, a species that diverged from <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> over 60 million years ago, revealed that it undergoes similar regulation in these two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c27">27</xref>). Testes-specific splice variants in <italic>D.virilis</italic> retain an intron analogous to M1 that interrupts the first translation initiation codon. When introduced into <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>, the <italic>D.virilis tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> gene acted <italic>in trans </italic>to regulate splicing of the endogenous <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> pre-mRNA. Using a defective <italic>D.virilis</italic> transgene it was found that the endogenous <italic>D.melanogaster </italic>TRA-2 protein could likewise repress splicing of <italic>D.virilis</italic><italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> pre-mRNA. Thus, the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences affecting <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> splicing are likely to be very similar in the two species.</p><p> Comparison of the <italic>D.virilis</italic> and<italic> D.melanogaster</italic><italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> pre-mRNA sequences revealed conserved features within the M1 intron. In both species the 3&#x02032; splice site of the M1 intron is similarly divergent from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> 3&#x02032; splice site consensus, with both introns containing a non-consensus A at position &#x02013;3, as well as interrupted polypyrimidine tracts. Sequences near the M1 5&#x02032; splice site (AT&#x0002f;GTAAGA) are also conserved in the M1 intron. However, in contrast to the 3&#x02032; splice site, this conservation is likely to be due only to the canonical requirement for these sequences. The conserved 5&#x02032; splice site closely matches the <italic>Drosophila</italic> 5&#x02032; splice site consensus (AG&#x0002f;GTRAGT) both in its extent and sequence and is thus similar to 5&#x02032; splice sites found in many other introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c29">29</xref>). A final conserved feature of M1 identified in the comparison between <italic>Drosophila</italic> species is an intron-internal sequence (the VC element) that is identical at 15 out of 18 positions but does not correspond to any known canonical splicing signals.</p><p> To determine if these conserved sequences are needed for regulation of M1 splicing we generated transgenic fly strains expressing altered <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> pre-mRNAs. Mutations of the M1 3&#x02032; splice site region suggest that the non-consensus sequences at this position are critical for normal splicing regulation. Substitution of the wild-type M1 3&#x02032; splice site region with sequences from a different non-consensus site supported TRA-2-dependent splicing repression but substitutions that more closely match the <italic>Drosophila</italic> consensus did not. One possibility is that a poor 3&#x02032; splice site limits the rate of splicing allowing regulatory factors an opportunity to intervene before splicing is initiated. This idea is supported by <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing experiments showing that substitution of the <italic>ftz</italic> 3&#x02032; splice site signals into M1 dramatically increases the rate of splicing relative to RNAs with the wild-type 3&#x02032; splice site (D.S.Chandler and W.Mattox, manuscript in preparation).</p><p> Although the non-consensus sequences in the wild-type 3&#x02032; splice site appear to confer a relatively slow rate of splicing on M1, the intron is removed from all germline <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> mRNA produced in the absence of functional TRA-2<sup>226 </sup>protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c16">16</xref>). Thus, the inherent &#x02018;strength&#x02019; of 3&#x02032; splicing signals in the native M1 intron appears to be precisely tuned to a level that permits intron retention in the presence of repressor and complete splicing in the absence of repressor.</p><p> Non-consensus 3&#x02032; splice sites appear to be a common, but not universal, feature of introns where splicing is repressed. The 3&#x02032; splice sites of several other <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAs with similarly regulated introns are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke417f6">6</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c36">36</xref>). Four of the five introns deviate significantly from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> 3&#x02032; splice site consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c29">29</xref>), and in the fifth case (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> P&#x000a0;element) splicing is known to be repressed through interactions of regulators near the 5&#x02032; splice site. We speculate that a reduced rate of basal splicing caused by non-consensus sequences near the 3&#x02032; splice sites in many such introns is essential for regulated intron retention <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p> Analysis of the VC element, the most highly conserved sequence within the M1 introns of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D.virilis</italic>, showed that this sequence acts to facilitate M1 splicing. This effect appears to be specific to the somatic tissues of adults, where TRA-2-dependent repression of M1 splicing does not occur. When the VC element was deleted or substituted, adult flies accumulated high levels of somatic RNAs containing M1. Thus, the VC sequence appears to be necessary for efficient splicing of M1 in the soma.</p><p> The above results raise the issue of why the <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> pre-mRNA contains sequences that both positively and negatively affect M1 splicing. We hypothesized that positive elements, such as VC, might be required to overcome the weak 3&#x02032; splice site and allow efficient M1 splicing in somatic tissues. In support of this idea we found that substitution of the M1 3&#x02032; splice site with a strong 3&#x02032; site alleviated the need for the VC element in the soma. Thus, the VC element allows for efficient M1 splicing in the presence of the intron&#x02019;s weak 3&#x02032; splice site, which is itself a necessary feature of germline splicing repression.</p><p> Neither of the sequences examined here appears to be a direct target of TRA-2<sup>226</sup> or a co-repressor of M1 splicing. The VC element clearly has a positive rather than repressive role and alterations in it do not affect repression of M1 splicing in the germline. The weak M1 3&#x02032; splice site is required for germline splicing repression, but the ability of another weak 3&#x02032; splice site to functionally replace it suggests that it does not contain sequences recognized specifically by factors involved in M1 splicing repression. Therefore, it seems most likely that these conserved sequences affect only the basal level of M1 splicing in the soma and germline. The evolutionary conservation of such &#x02018;context elements&#x02019; and the observation that alteration of these elements leads to qualitative changes in M1 splicing indicates that the basal splicing efficiency is critical to normal regulation. Increased rates of basal M1 splicing overcome the ability of TRA-2<sup>226</sup> to repress it in the germline, while a decrease in basal splicing in the soma leads to accumulation of M1 containing transcripts where they are normally not found.</p><p> It is surprising that comparison of the <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic> genes from different <italic>Drosophila</italic> species did not identify conserved sequences more directly involved in splicing repression. In a similar comparison, a critical 13 nt repeated element of the splicing enhancer from the <italic>dsx</italic> gene was found to be well conserved in the same two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c37">37</xref>). Several of the same 13 nt repeat elements are also found in the regulatory sequences within <italic>fru</italic> pre-mRNA, another target of <italic>tra</italic>-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c14">14</xref>). Although this suggests that the 13 nt repeat element may be common to RNAs where splicing is affected by <italic>tra</italic>-<italic>2</italic>, no sequences identical to the 13 nt element were found in or near the M1 intron.<italic> In vivo</italic> studies on two related but non-identical and non-conserved repeat sequences in exon 3 upstream of the M1 intron showed that they are not required for M1 repression (D.S.Chandler and W.Mattox, unpublished). It is possible that the absence of a similar regulatory sequence in <italic>tra-2</italic> pre-mRNA reflects differences in the role of the TRA protein, which is required in combination with TRA-2 for enhancement of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> splicing but does not function in the male germline where M1 splicing repression occurs. Thus, germline specific targets of<italic> tra-2</italic> including the RNAs from <italic>tra-2</italic>, <italic>exuperantia</italic> and <italic>alternative-testes-transcript</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c39">39</xref>) may be regulated via different <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements than those found in <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic>.</p><p> The idea that regulation of alternative splicing depends on sequences that affect the efficiency of splicing is supported by observations that other regulated pre-mRNAs contain poor matches to consensus splicing signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c44">44</xref>). In several cases it has been shown that substitution of these sequences with consensus splice sites leads to constitutive use of the splice site and thus correct regulation of splicing depends on the weak splice site. In addition, some splicing enhancers have been shown to be essential for regulated splicing despite not being the direct targets of determinative tissue-specific regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke417c45">45</xref>). Our results emphasize the sensitivity of splicing regulation to the basal rate of splicing and the importance of studying splicing regulatory elements within an appropriate context. Outside of a context where basal splicing occurs at normal efficiency, the effects of splicing regulators such as TRA-2 would not be observed.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke417f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Replacement of the<italic> tra-2</italic> M1 intron with the intron from the <italic>ftz</italic> gene.
