To determine if this increased frequency was due to the nucleotide site having the properties of a mutation hot spot, or some other explanation, we developed a new experimental approach. We examined the spatial distribution of the frequency of the C755G mutation in the germline by dividing four testes from two normal individuals each into several hundred pieces, and, using a highly sensitive PCR assay, we measured the mutation frequency of each piece. We discovered that each testis was characterized by rare foci with mutation frequencies 10<sup>3</sup> to &#x0003e;10<sup>4</sup> times higher than the rest of the testis regions. Using a model based on what is known about human germline development forced us to reject (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) the idea that the C755G mutation arises more frequently because this nucleotide simply has a higher than average mutation rate (hot spot model). This is true regardless of whether mutation is dependent or independent of cell division. An alternate model was examined where positive selection acts on adult self-renewing Ap spermatogonial cells (SrAp) carrying this mutation such that, instead of only replacing themselves, they occasionally produce two SrAp cells. This model could not be rejected given our observed data. Unlike the disease site, similar analysis of C-to-G mutations at a control nucleotide site in one testis pair failed to find any foci with high mutation frequencies. The rejection of the hot spot model and lack of rejection of a selection model for the C755G mutation, along with other data, provides strong support for the proposal that positive selection in the testis can act to increase the frequency of premeiotic germ cells carrying a mutation deleterious to an offspring, thereby unfavorably altering the mutational load in humans. Studying the anatomical distribution of germline mutations can provide new insights into genetic disease and evolutionary change.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Some human disease mutations occur 100&#x02013;1,000 times more frequently than would be predicted from genome wide studies of mutation in different species. In Apert syndrome, for example, two-thirds of all new causal mutations occur at only one base in the affected gene. This unusually high frequency suggests that something about that DNA base or its local surroundings makes it highly susceptible to mutation. We studied this hypothesis by examining the location of cells containing this mutation in the testes of normal men. We found that mutant cells were not uniformly distributed throughout the testes, as would be expected for random mutations. Instead, we found 95&#x00025; of the mutants in small clusters containing only a few percent of the total testes cells. A higher-than-average mutation rate could not explain the data. We propose that these mutations arise at the expected rate, but that mutated cells gain a selective advantage that allows them to increase their frequency compared to nonmutant cells. Our results&#x02014;which argue against the mutational hot spot model in favor of a selection model&#x02014;suggest how germline selection in animals can alter the mutational load of a species.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The frequency of Apert syndrome mutations is 100-1,000 times higher than expected from average mutation rates, and it is due to positive selection in the testis increasing the frequency of germ cells carrying the defect.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Qin J, Calabrese P, Tiemann-Boege I, Shinde DN, Yoon SR, et al.

Surprisingly, the high incidence of Apert syndrome cannot be explained by mutations at numerous nucleotide sites in the <italic>FGFR2</italic> gene leading to the disease phenotype. In fact, greater than 98&#x00025; of Apert syndrome cases arise by transversion mutations at only two sites (C755G and C758G). The C755G mutation is located at a CpG &#x0005b;dinucleotide containing a C followed by a G (5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032;)&#x0005d; site (leading to a serine-to-tryptophan substitution at amino acid 252) and accounts for two-thirds of the cases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

One intuitive explanation is that this nucleotide simply has a higher than average chance of undergoing a base substitution (mutation hot spot model). Alternatively, positive selection for diploid germline cells carrying the mutation has also been proposed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

This epididymal sperm DNA preparation was unique in containing a highly viscous material, suggesting that the epididymis might have been subject to some local pathological process that contaminated the sperm sample with nongermline DNA, thereby explaining the lower mutation frequency estimate.</p><p>In summary, analysis of the distribution of C755G Apert syndrome mutations in four testes showed a small number of pieces with very high mutation frequencies among a general background of lower mutation frequencies.

In this model, we make use of data on human germline development and maturation&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Our model has two phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050224-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In the first phase between zygote formation and puberty, called the growth phase, the male germline cells divide symmetrically and thus increase in number exponentially. At each division, there is a probability of a mutation at the disease site. The exponential increase in cell number can magnify the influence of any single mutation on the mutation frequency if it occurs early enough in development. This concept, first noted by Luria and Delbruck &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; in bacteria, can lead to a &#x0201c;mutation jackpot.&#x0201d; Because the germ cells would be expected to stay in close proximity to their ancestors, any such early mutations will result in regions of the testis with high mutation frequencies. The germ cells of the growth phase eventually form the adult self-renewing Ap spermatogonia (SrAp). In the second phase, called the adult phase, SrAp divide asymmetrically to produce a daughter SrAp (self-renewal) and another daughter cell, whose descendants, after only a few additional divisions, will produce sperm. During the adult phase, the number of SrAp remains approximately constant, and each new mutation in this phase produces only one mutated SrAp cell lineage. There are many more SrAp cell divisions during the adult phase than there are SrAp precursor cell divisions during the growth phase; for a 50&#x02013;60-y-old man, the ratio of mutations expected to occur in the adult phase, compared to the growth phase, is approximately 500 to 1 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio-0050224-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Model Schemes</title><p>The models are depicted with only three growth phase generations leading to eight adult SrAp cells; in actuality there are &#x0223c;30 growth phase generations leading to &#x0223c;10<sup>10</sup> adult SrAp cells.

This program allows us to estimate model parameters and test the hypothesis that the data are consistent with this model. A key model parameter is the nucleotide substitution rate per cell division. We infer this value by finding that rate that, in simulations, is most likely to match the overall C755G testis mutation frequency. Even though this frequency is very high relative to data on transversion frequencies at other CpG sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, the inferred C755G mutation rate per cell division is still low enough that mutations early in the growth phase with the potential to produce a jackpot are unlikely. In those simulations with this inferred rate, almost all of the mutations occur in the adult phase or late in the growth phase, and consequently, there is little variation in the mutation frequency of the testis pieces: 95&#x00025; of the mutants are found distributed among 95&#x00025; of the testis pieces. This contrasts sharply with the experimental data where the mutation frequency varies greatly between testis pieces, and 95&#x00025; of the mutant genomes are found in only a few testis pieces containing between 2.6&#x00025; and 5.7&#x00025; of the total genomes. In simulations, when we increase the mutation rate per cell division so that more mutations occur in the growth phase, there are so many mutations in the adult phase that the overall testis mutation frequency is much greater than that found in the actual data.</p><p>To test whether the observed distribution of the mutation frequencies among the testis pieces is consistent with the model, we performed both a goodness-of-fit test and a chi-squared test (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

We reached the same conclusion when we considered a model with replication-independent mutations (or a model with both replication-dependent and replication-independent mutations), since the adult phase lasts much longer than the growth phase (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Our data provide strong support for rejecting the most intuitive explanation for the high frequency of C755G mutations: that the site has an inherently higher probability of undergoing transversion mutations than does an average CpG site in the genome. We conclude that this site is not a mutation hot spot, regardless of the exact molecular mechanism responsible for the C755G mutation event.</p><table-wrap id="pbio-0050224-t002" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Model Parameters and Goodness-of-Fit <italic>p</italic>-Values</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050224.t002"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Germline Selection</title><p>Incorporating selection as a modification to our model can reproduce both the overall testis mutation frequency and the distribution of mutation frequencies observed in the testis pieces.

The occasional symmetric divisions would allow mutated SrAp to grow locally in number over time, and thereby increase the overall mutation frequency in the testis.

With this modification, we can no longer reject the model using the chi-squared test (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050224-t002">Table 2</xref>): the distribution of frequencies in the testis pieces now matches the data.

Both male-driven evolution and the paternal age effect can be explained by the cell division&#x02013;dependent mutation process, because cell divisions of self-renewing spermatogonia occur throughout a man's life, whereas the cellular precursors of eggs (oogonia) cease replication during the fetal life of a female &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We examined the molecular anatomy and frequency of the Apert syndrome C755G mutation in normal human testes to test whether the high mutation frequency was due to an exceptionally high C-to-G transversion mutation rate per cell division.

Therefore, while further selection on sperm is possible, we believe that the vast majority of the increase in mutation frequency is due to selection on the diploid premeiotic cells.</p><p>Why should a mutation that has a distinct selective disadvantage when present in all the cells of an organism have a selective advantage when present only in a small fraction of the germline cells? It is worth noting here that achondroplasia, the most common cause of dwarfism, has many similarities to that of Apert syndrome (see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;). Virtually all of the new achondroplasia mutations arise in the male germline at one nucleotide site (G1138A) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 <italic>(FGFR3)</italic> gene and with a mutation frequency even higher than the C755G mutation in <italic>FGFR2</italic>. These common characteristics suggest that the G1138A mutation may also increase to such a high frequency by a selective mechanism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

He examined how mitotic gene conversion and somatic crossing over events in diploid germline cells of animals could lead to loss of heterozygosity of recessive alleles and the possibility of positive or negative selection on such alleles. He calculated that selection against rare germline cells made homozygous for a recessive allele can effectively lower the transmission of the deleterious allele to offspring thereby reducing disadvantageous alleles entering the population and burdening it with reduced viability or fertility. Using plausible models, this reduction in the mutational load could be as large as 100-fold. Similarly, loss of heterozygosity could allow recessive alleles that conferred a germline advantage to be spread more quickly in the population. Experimental literature on germline selection in premeiotic diploid cells in animals is very sparse (see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d; and references therein) but in one case, wild-type <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells were produced by a genetic trick in the germline of females heterozygous for a phenotypically recessive mutation and were found to have a proliferative selective advantage compared to the background heterozygous cells.</p><p>Hastings' analysis was primarily concerned with recessive alleles that were already polymorphic in the population. But gain-of-function mutations that arise sporadically in the testis would behave in the same way, because a second event leading to loss of heterozygosity is not required for positive and negative selection to be effective. A new gain-of-function mutation with a germline selective advantage will more likely be transmitted to the next generation, because the effective mutation frequency is elevated beyond the level that can be achieved by the mutation process alone. A disadvantageous gain of function mutation would be less likely to be tested in the population if it were selected against in the germline. Finally, Hastings realized that alleles conferring a selective advantage in the germline may be disadvantageous in the adult and might lead to &#x0201c;mitotic drive&#x0201d; systems that could increase the mutational load of a population. Both Apert syndrome and achondroplasia may be examples of such a system, and additional examples of mutations of medical interest may also exist (see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;).

Primer extension by DNA polymerase, and thus PCR, is not expected to occur in either case. However, we used a DNA polymerase (in our case TMA31FS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;) capable of both efficient pyrophosphorolysis of ddNMP terminated primers (thereby unblocking them) and primer extension using dNTPs. The pyrophosphorolysis and amplification preferentially occurs using the mutant templates. PAP is far more selective than conventional ASPCR for rare mutation detection. If the TMA31FS polymerase mistakenly removes a mismatched terminal ddNMP, insertion of the correct (templated) nucleotide simply results in the generation of another copy of the wild-type template and not loss of selectivity. To measure the mutation frequency of a DNA sample, 25-&#x003bc;l PAP reactions were carried out in 96-well plates &#x0005b;Opticon 2, MJR (BioRad; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biorad.com">http://www.biorad.com</ext-link>)&#x0005d; or 10-&#x003bc;l reactions in 384-well plates &#x0005b;ABI 7900HT (Applied Biosystems; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.appliedbiosystems.com">http://www.appliedbiosystems.com</ext-link>) or Roche LightCycler 480 (Roche Applied Science; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.roche.com">http://www.roche.com</ext-link>)&#x0005d;.

The C nucleotide is known to be polymorphic in the human population (see accession numbers). Testis donor 374 was genotyped and found to be a C/C homozygote and thus his testis and sperm cells could be examined for the presence of C-to-G transversion mutations at this site. To measure the frequency of mutation, 10 &#x003bc;l PAP reactions were carried out in 384-well plates (ABI 7900HT, Applied Biosystems). Each reaction contained 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 30 mM KCl, 50 &#x003bc;M Na<sub>4</sub>PPi, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 80 &#x003bc;M of each dNTP, 200 nM of each primer, 2 &#x003bc;M Rox, 0.2 X Syber Green I, 0.04 unit/&#x003bc;l TMA31FS DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Systems), and 25,000 copies of testis or epididymal sperm DNA molecules/reaction.

In those cases where fewer than 25/40 reactions were positive, we took the number (after Poisson correction) as an estimate of the C755G mutation frequency for that piece. If 25 or more reactions were positive, then the experiment was repeated using 10-fold dilutions until a dilution of the DNA from the piece was found to give fewer than 25/40 positives.</p><p>Based on the mutation frequency results from the first pair of testes, a slightly different strategy was used for testes 854&#x02013;2 and the upper right and tail half (UR and TH, respectively) parts of 854&#x02013;1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050224-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). First, ten reactions were carried out on every piece (total of 250,000 genomes analyzed). In the case of those pieces where four or fewer reactions were positive, we took the number (after Poisson correction) as an estimate of the C755G mutation frequency. In those cases where five or more of the ten reactions were positive, we carried out additional experiments using 40 reactions (1,000,000 testis genomes) and appropriate dilutions in the manner described for the 374 testes. Repeated measurements from the same piece had an average deviation of 32&#x00025; from the mean value.</p><p>For all mutation counting, the estimate of the total testis mutation frequency was the average of the frequencies of the pieces weighted by the number of genomes in those pieces. For a positive assay control, ten or 20 Apert C755G mutant molecules from a patient heterozygous for the C755G mutation (kindly provided by Dr. Mimi Jabs, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions) were added to 500,000 human genomes and divided into 20 reactions (an average of 0.5 or 1 mutants per reaction). Negative assay controls consisted of 25,000 genomes of nongermline human blood DNA from normal individuals (Clontech; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clontech.com">http://www.clontech.com</ext-link>).

This places an upper limit on the possible mutation frequency in human white blood cells, although it would be lower if false positives can also result from artifacts of the assay itself.</p><p>The method for counting the Chromosome 7 control C-to-G transversion mutations was identical to that used for testes 854&#x02013;2 and the UR and TH parts of 854&#x02013;1. For a positive control, 20 mutant genomes of blood DNA from a heterozygous (C/G) individual were added to 500,000 human genomes from individuals homozygous for the C allele and divided into 20 reactions (an average of one G allele-containing genome per reaction).

Not long after fertilization, human primordial germ cells arise in the developing human embryo and migrate to the embryonic sites of testis formation (genital ridges). The germ cells become organized into seminiferous tubules, proliferate, and differentiate into gonocytes and fetal spermatogonia. By the beginning of puberty, the seminiferous tubules are composed primarily of spermatogonia and supporting Sertoli cells. The spermatogonia (including the adult SrAp) are located in their niche at the periphery of the tubule and in intimate association with Sertoli cells. After puberty, seminiferous tubules also contain B spermatogonia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; that are derived from the asymmetric division of SrAp. B spermatogonia are a precursor of meiotic cells.

In spermatogenesis, both meiotic and post-meiotic cells gradually move from the periphery toward the lumen of the tubule. Sperm enter the lumen of the tubule (spermiation) and are transported to the epididymis, where they undergo further development and are stored. Note that in a seminiferous tubule segment, any mutant SrAp will be in close proximity to its spermatogonial, meiotic, and post-meiotic cell descendants that will carry the same mutation. Although SrAp divide every 16 d, it takes much longer than 16 d for the division products of one to yield sperm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

In the first phase between zygote formation and puberty, called the growth phase, self-renewal cells divide symmetrically to produce two self-renewal cells. This continues for <italic>g</italic> generations. In this phase, the testis grows exponentially from one self-renewal cell to 2<italic>&#x0200a;<sup>g</sup></italic> self-renewal cells. The total number of divisions in the testis in this phase is (2<italic>&#x0200a;<sup>g</sup></italic> &#x02212; 1). This corresponds to a total of (2<italic>&#x0200a;<sup>g</sup></italic><sup>&#x0002b;1</sup> &#x02212; 2) daughter cells being produced, and there are this many opportunities for replication-dependent mutations. There is a mutation rate per cell division &#x003bb; at the disease site. A mutation is shared by all of a cell's descendants, so a mutation early in the growth phase will produce many mutants. To be more specific, a mutation at the <italic>k</italic>th generation will produce 2<italic>&#x0200a;<sup>g</sup></italic><sup>&#x02212;<italic>k</italic></sup> mutant descendants. This concept, first noted by Luria and Delbruck &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; in bacteria, can lead to a &#x0201c;mutation jackpot.&#x0201d; Since the germ cells would be expected to stay in close proximity to their ancestors, any such early mutations will result in regions of the testis with high mutation frequencies. We will discuss the spatial details in the Spatial Structure section below.</p><p>Zhengwei et al. measured on average 656,000,000 type A spermatogonial cells per testis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.

Because one-half of the type A spermatogonial cells are SrAp &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;, we estimate the number of growth phase generations <italic>g</italic> is 27 or 28. We have also considered higher numbers from the literature (30 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; or 34 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>In the second phase, called the adult phase, SrAp divide asymmetrically to produce one SrAp and another cell whose descendants will ultimately produce sperm. In this phase, the number of SrAp remains constant. These cells divide every 16 d &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, so assuming this phase begins at puberty (age 13), donor 374 who is age 62 has experienced <italic>a</italic> &#x0003d; 1,127 adult phase generations, and donor 854 who is age 54 has experienced <italic>a</italic> &#x0003d; 943 adult phase generations. The total number of divisions in the testis in this phase is equal to (<italic>a</italic> &#x000d7; 2<italic>&#x0200a;<sup>g</sup></italic>). For these donors, there are approximately 500 (&#x02248;a &#x000d7; 2<italic>&#x0200a;<sup>g</sup></italic>/2<italic>&#x0200a;<sup>g</sup></italic>&#x0200a;<sup>&#x0002b;1</sup>) more opportunities for replication-dependent mutation in the adult phase than in the growth phase, and because we assume identical mutation rates per cell division in both the growth and adult phases, there will also be, on average, this many more mutations in the adult phase. These mutations will be randomly spread throughout the testis. Unlike in the growth phase, mutations in the adult phase lead to only a single mutated SrAp (and approximately 25 other mutated germ cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;). If the testis mutation frequency is <italic>f</italic>, then <italic>f</italic> &#x000f7; <italic>a</italic> is an upper bound for the mutation rate &#x003bb; (this inequality ignores mutations in the growth phase).</p><p>We examine two modifications to this model. First we consider replication-independent mutations. The number of these mutations is proportional to time rather than the number of divisions. The literature is not definitive &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, but it appears that most of the growth phase generations occur in approximately 1 y (the 9 mo of embryonic and fetal development plus possibly several months of infancy). There may be several further growth phase generations in the &#x0223c;13 y before the adult phase begins; however, the number of such generations is small enough that any mutations in these years, like in the adult phase and unlike in the growth phase, will not produce significant mutation clusters (in the absence of selection). Then, letting <italic>z</italic> be the age of the donor, the ratio of replication-independent mutations that cannot cause significant mutation clusters to those mutations that will cause such clusters is (2<italic>&#x0200a;<sup>g</sup></italic> &#x000d7; <italic>z</italic>)/(2<italic>&#x0200a;<sup>g</sup></italic><sup>&#x0002b;1</sup>/<italic>g</italic>). For our donors, this ratio is at least 700 to 1, even more extreme than for the replication-dependent mutations. Consequently it would be difficult for a model incorporating replication-independent mutations to explain our testis data.</p><p>The second modification we consider is selection. We introduce a new parameter into the model: at each adult phase generation, with probability <italic>p</italic>, a mutated SrAp divides asymmetrically, and with probability 1 &#x02212; <italic>p</italic> it divides symmetrically to produce two mutated SrAp. This symmetric division is like that in the growth phase, except that afterward, each daughter SrAp reverts to having asymmetric divisions until the next rare symmetric division occurs; a similar model was independently proposed in a recent publication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050224-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. The occasional symmetric divisions allow mutated SrAp to grow locally in number over time, and thereby increase the overall mutation frequency in the testis. On average, a mutation in this phase will leave <disp-formula id="pbio-0050224-e001"><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050224.e001.jpg" position="anchor" mimetype="image"/></disp-formula>descendants (if a mutation occurs with <italic>x</italic> generations remaining, it leaves on average (1 &#x0002b; <italic>p</italic>)<italic><sup>x</sup></italic> descendants, the time of a mutation is uniform on &#x0005b;0, <italic>a</italic>&#x0005d;). Since the mutation probability and <italic>p</italic> are small, the number of self-renewal cells will still stay roughly constant in the adult phase. </p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Spatial structure.</title><p>Above we discussed the number of mutant cells with regard to our various models, now we will discuss their spatial distribution. For simplicity, we have assumed that the testis is in the shape of a rectangular box, and it is divided into a regular grid of 6 &#x000d7; 8 &#x000d7; 4 &#x0003d; 192 cubic testis pieces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050224-g001">Figure 1</xref>). If a mutation event occurs in the growth phase after testis formation, then there is a mutation cluster where all of the SrAp cells in a cubic region are mutants. Depending on the size of this cluster, it may be contained within one of the testis pieces, intersect parts of several adjacent testis pieces, or contain all of one or more testis pieces and intersect parts of the surrounding testis pieces. The number of mutants in a cluster depends on the cell generation in which the mutation event occurred and is discussed in the previous paragraphs. The size of a cluster is calculated assuming that it has the same density of SrAp cells as the rest of the testis, and the total testis has 2<italic><sup>g</sup></italic> SrAp cells. We set the units so that 1 is the length of one of the 192 testis pieces. Then a mutation at the <italic>k</italic>th generation will produce a cubic mutation cluster with length (192 &#x000d7; 2<sup>&#x02212;<italic>k</italic></sup>)<sup>1/3</sup>. To consider some examples, a mutation at the first generation means half of the testis is mutated, a mutation at the 8th generation produces a cluster with 91&#x00025; of the length and 75&#x00025; of the volume of one of the testis pieces, a mutation at the 21st generation produces a cluster with 5&#x00025; of the length and 0.01&#x00025; of the volume of one of the testis pieces. The location of a cluster is random within the testis.</p><p>We assume that at the beginning of the adult phase, there is an equal fraction of the 2<italic><sup>g</sup></italic> SrAp cells (mutated or not) in each of the 192 testis pieces. During the adult phase, mutation events occur randomly throughout the testis. If <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0, then each such mutation event produces only one mutant SrAp cell. If <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0, then each mutation event produces a cluster of mutant SrAp cells. The number of mutants in a cluster is discussed in the previous paragraphs. For simplicity, we assume that the shape of a cluster is a cube. The size of a cluster is calculated assuming that the cluster has the same density of SrAp cells as the rest of the testis. Depending on the cluster's size, it may be contained within one testis piece or intersect several adjacent testis pieces. Unlike the growth-phase clusters, the SrAp cells in the selection clusters are in addition to the nonmutated SrAp cells in the testis pieces. Due to the exponential growth of these selection clusters, there is a relatively narrow range of realistic parameter values for <italic>p</italic>. For example, a mutation early in the adult phase will produce a cluster approximately 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> the size of the testis if <italic>p</italic> is 0.01, whereas this same cluster will be larger than the rest of the testis if <italic>p</italic> is 0.03 or greater. Multiple mutation clusters may intersect the same testis piece and a given cell may only be mutated once (there are no reverse mutations).</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Testing the model.</title><p>We have written a computer program (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050224-sd001">Protocol S1</xref> or download from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rd.plos.org/pbio.0050224">http://rd.plos.org/pbio.0050224</ext-link>) to simulate the model and its modifications. We fix the parameters <italic>a</italic> &#x0003d; 1,127 for donor 374 and <italic>a</italic> &#x0003d; 943 for donor 854, and consider both the extremes <italic>g</italic> &#x0003d; 27 and <italic>g</italic> &#x0003d; 34. First we consider the mutation hot spot model (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0). We simulated the model many times to estimate the probability that the simulated mutation frequency is within 5&#x00025; of the observed mutation frequency as a function of the mutation parameter &#x003bb; (mutation rate per cell division). The &#x003bb; that optimizes this quantity is our approximate maximum likelihood estimate (this technique is sometimes called a rejection sampler) and standard methods can produce approximate 95&#x00025; confidence sets. For the selection model (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0), there are two parameters to consider: <italic>p</italic> and &#x003bb;. There are an infinite number of pairings of these parameters' values (a subset of parameter space) for which the model can match the observed mutation frequency. Consequently, we searched for the parameter values which optimized the following two-criteria probability: (a) that the simulated mutation frequency is within &#x0221a;5&#x00025; of the observed frequency, and (b) that the simulated fraction of testis' genomes in the fewest number of testis' pieces necessary to contain 95&#x00025; of the mutants is within &#x0221a;5&#x00025; of this observed quantity. Note that for the mutation hot spot model (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0) this two-criteria probability is 0 for all values of &#x003bb;, since no single value of &#x003bb; can match both criteria. In general, to estimate the empirical likelihood, we simulated the model 1,000 times for each set of parameter values.</p><p>To determine whether the distribution of mutations in the 192 pieces is consistent between the model and the data, we used two hypothesis tests. First we counted the number of pieces with mutation frequencies in each of the eight color categories in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050224-g002">Figure 2</xref> (&#x0005b;0&#x02013;25/million&#x0005d;, etc.). For both the mutation hot spot model (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0) and the selection model (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0), we simulated the model under optimal parameters and counted the number of pieces with frequencies in these same categories, and then performed the chi-squared test. For the control site, since the observed frequencies are much lower, we considered the following four categories: &#x0005b;0&#x02013;4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>), &#x0005b;4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>&#x02013;9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>), &#x0005b;9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>&#x02013;1.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>), &#x0005b;1.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>&#x0002b;). The notation &#x0005b;<italic>x</italic>&#x02013;<italic>y</italic>) means frequencies <italic>f</italic> such that <italic>x</italic> &#x02264; <italic>f</italic> &#x0003c; <italic>y</italic>.</p><p>Because a mutation cluster can overlap adjacent testis pieces, this dependence makes the chi-squared test anticonservative. In order to not reject the selection model (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0), this test is sufficient; however, in order to reject the hot spot model (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0), we have also performed a goodness-of-fit test. For each simulation, we computed the following statistic: the minimum fraction of testis pieces which contain at least 95&#x00025; of the total mutants. We simulated the hot spot model under the optimal parameters and recorded this statistic for those simulations such that the total testis mutation frequency was within 5&#x00025; of the real data. We repeated this procedure such that 1,000,000 simulations met this criterion (under optimal parameters over 90&#x00025; of simulations met the criterion). The simulated statistic was never lower than 90&#x00025;, in contrast with the much lower values for the real data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050224-t001">Table 1</xref> (&#x0003c;6&#x00025;). Therefore an empirical <italic>p</italic>-value is &#x0003c;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>. However, this value is just a function of our patience in running simulations; we contend that for however many simulations are run, this statistic will never be lower than for the data. In order to get a <italic>p</italic>-value independent of the number of simulations, we fit the distribution of simulated statistics to a <italic>t</italic>-distribution (admittedly a poor fit) and the statistics for the real data were over 300 standard deviations away, making the <italic>p</italic>-value less than 10<sup>&#x02212;200</sup>. The (anticonservative) chi-squared test rejected the hot spot model with <italic>p</italic>-value less than 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>. Regardless of which <italic>p</italic>-value is used, there is strong support to reject the hot spot (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0) model.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050224-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Simulations from Our Neutral Model</title><p>The blue lines depict the 25&#x00025; and 75&#x00025; quantiles of the allelic skew, and the red line depicts the median skew, as a function of mutation frequency.</p><p>(6 KB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0050224.sg001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050224-sg002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>Alternate Testes Dissection Strategy</title><p>Testis 854&#x02013;1.
