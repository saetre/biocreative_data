Specific holoenzyme complexes are thought to be deregulated during oncogenic transformation and oncogene-induced signaling. Since most studies on the role of this phosphatase family have relied on the use of generic PP2A inhibitors, the contribution of individual PP2A holoenzyme complexes in PP2A-controlled signaling pathways is largely unclear. To gain insight into this, we have constructed a set of shRNA vectors targeting the individual PP2A regulatory subunits for suppression by RNA interference. Here, we identify PR55&#x003b3; and PR55&#x003b4; as inhibitors of c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) activation by UV irradiation. We show that PR55&#x003b3; binds c-SRC and modulates the phosphorylation of serine 12 of c-SRC, a residue we demonstrate to be required for JNK activation by c-SRC. We also find that the physical interaction between PR55&#x003b3; and c-SRC is sensitive to UV irradiation. Our data reveal a novel mechanism of c-SRC regulation whereby in response to stress c-SRC activity is regulated, at least in part, through loss of the interaction with its inhibitor, PR55&#x003b3;.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Protein Phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) represent a family of holoenzyme complexes involved in wide range of activities such as growth, differentiation, and cell death. The PP2A holoenzyme complex is made up of a catalytic, a structural, and one of various &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; subunits. These &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; subunits are thought to provide the substrate specificity required for PP2A activity. Previous work on PP2A has mostly been derived by inhibiting the catalytic subunit through chemical inhibition, as such inhibiting all of the pathways associated with PP2A. To identify individual &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; subunits involved in specific cellular processes we have generated a &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; subunit gene knockdown library, which allows us to inhibit each of the known &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; subunits individually. One of the many pathways regulated by PP2A is the c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) kinase pathway, which, depending on stimulus, can affect either cell survival or cell proliferation. Here we report that the &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; subunit PR55&#x003b3; acts as a negative regulator of JNK activity and cell death. We show that PR55&#x003b3; influences JNK activity by inhibiting one of its upstream regulators, the proto-oncogene c-SRC, through dephosphorylation at one of the key residues on c-SRC, a site we show to be critical for c-SRC activation following cell stress. Overall our work describes the novel function of a specific PP2A subunit involved in cell survival and identifies a novel mechanism of c-SRC regulation.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Eichhorn PJA, Creyghton MP, Wilhelmsen K, van Dam H, Bernards R (2007) A RNA interference screen identifies the Protein Phosphatase 2A subunit PR55&#x003b3; as a stress-sensitive inhibitor of c-SRC.

Overexpression of v-Src, a constitutively active form of c-SRC lacking the c-terminal part containing the inhibitory Tyr<sup>527</sup>, is a potent activator of c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK), a growth-regulatory enzyme that can control cell proliferation and cell survival both positively and negatively, depending on the stimulus and the cellular context &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

The holoenzyme generally exists as a core dimer, consisting of a 36-kDa catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) and a 65-kDa scaffold subunit (PR65) that associates with a variety of regulatory subunits. These regulatory B subunits can modulate the activity of the PP2Ac/PR65 core unit, thus allowing specific temporal targeting of a wide range of PP2A substrates. To date 15 genes coding for more than 26 (B) regulatory subunits have been identified that are subdivided into five different subfamilies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The variable PP2A B subunits are targeted by a number of viral oncogenes, which thereby compete for interaction with the PR65/PP2Ac core dimer.

Understanding the precise manner in which PP2A is involved in the regulation of these different signaling cascades and its role during oncogenic transformation requires the identification of the specific holoenzymes involved in these processes. Interpretation of a large amount of data using general PP2A inhibitors has been limited by the pleiotropic inhibition of all PP2A holoenzyme complexes by the inhibitors used. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the various B subunits can lead to competition with other subunits for binding to the holoenzyme, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions from the data &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

This suggests that specific PP2A regulatory B subunits are involved in PP2A-mediated regulation of the JNK pathway. To directly assess the putative role of PP2A in JNK regulation we asked if suppression of one or more PP2A regulatory subunits by RNA interference could affect JNK activity following UV irradiation. U2-OS cells were transfected with the different library pools and then assayed by western blotting for the efficiency of UV induced JNK activation as judged by threonine-183/tyrosine-185 phosphorylation. Unsurprisingly, we found that suppression of a number of the B subunits appeared to enhance the levels of phosphorylated JNK following UV. Of these, PR55&#x003b3; consistently yielded the strongest effect and was chosen for further validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and unpublished data). To evaluate which of the four individual knockdown vectors in this pool were active against PR55&#x003b3;, we transfected cells with HA-tagged PR55&#x003b3; and determined the protein levels of HA-PR55&#x003b3; in lysates of transfected cells in the presence or absence of the individual PR55&#x003b3; knockdown vectors. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, all four shRNA vectors (A&#x02013;D) in this pool were able to suppress HA-PR55&#x003b3; expression levels, whereas no effect was detected on a cotransfected green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).

Since knockdown of PR55&#x003b3; in our system regulates not only JNK but also the MAPK p38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), it would suggest that c-SRC may be the critical target of PR55&#x003b3; in negatively regulating the JNK pathway in U2-OS cells following stress.</p><p>To test whether the enhanced activation of JNK after suppression of PR55&#x003b3; is dependent on c-SRC, we cotransfected a dominant negative version of c-SRC, which has a lysine 295 to methionine mutation, resulting in a kinase deficient c-SRC (Src<sup>295M</sup>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;.

Likewise inhibition of c-SRC by the generic Src family inhibitor PP2 also inhibited the enhanced JNK activity caused by suppression of PR55&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g004">Figure 4</xref>D).

Since suppression of a number of the B subunits appeared to enhance the levels of phosphorylated JNK following UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030218-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), we wanted to determine whether the increased levels of phosphorylated JNK observed with knockdown of the other B subunits are dependent on c-SRC. As expected knockdown of PR55&#x003b4; enhanced the activity of JNK following UV irradiation.

Via an RNAi-mediated gene family&#x02013;knockdown screen of regulatory PP2A B subunits, we now identify PR55&#x003b3; as a specific negative regulator of stress-induced JNK activation. We find that PR55&#x003b3; regulates the JNK pathway through negative regulation of c-SRC kinase activity. Importantly, we identify here c-SRC serine 12 as a critical residue for the regulation of the c-SRC kinase activity during stress signaling. We show that PR55&#x003b3; physically interacts with c-SRC and has a higher affinity for c-SRC when it is phosphorylated on serine 12. Since the interaction of the PP2A holoenzyme complex with c-SRC is dependent on PR55&#x003b3;, this would suggest a transient interaction between PR55&#x003b3;-containing PP2A holoenzyme and c-SRC, which is reduced as soon as serine 12 dephosphorylation has occurred.</p><p>Previous work has indicated that PP2A might play a role in the regulation of c-SRC activity, since treatment of cells with okadaic acid, a chemical inhibitor of PP2A &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, resulted in enhanced c-SRC activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;, and PP2A can inactivate c-SRC in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;.

This present study confirms and extends these results by demonstrating that the inhibition of SRC by PR55&#x003b3; does not completely inhibit JNK activation but rather results in an overall decrease, similar to the effects observed with a kinase dead mutant of c-SRC. In contrast, knockdown of PR55&#x003b3; increases SRC kinase activity following UV resulting in enhanced levels of phosphorylated JNK. These results suggest that modulation of one of the upstream activator pathways may result in a prolonged and amplified JNK effect.</p><p>It has previously been shown that the majority of c-SRC is present in the perinuclear region where it was found to be inactive as judged by Tyr 416 phosphorylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. c-SRC was also found in the cytoplasm at lower levels correlating with increasing activity and moved to the membrane in response to various stimuli where it was fully active &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030218-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;.
