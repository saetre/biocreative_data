MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) inhibits the MAPK pathway and decreases TLR signaling, but the regulation of MKP-1 is not completely understood. We now show that MKP-1 is acetylated, and that acetylation regulates its ability to interact with its substrates and deactivate inflammatory signaling. We found that LPS activates acetylation of MKP-1. MKP-1 is acetylated by p300 on lysine residue K57 within its substrate-binding domain. Acetylation of MKP-1 enhances its interaction with p38, thereby increasing its phosphatase activity and interrupting MAPK signaling. Inhibition of deacetylases increases MKP-1 acetylation and blocks MAPK signaling in wild-type (WT) cells; however, deacetylase inhibitors have no effect in cells lacking MKP-1. Furthermore, histone deacetylase inhibitors reduce inflammation and mortality in WT mice treated with LPS, but fail to protect MKP-1 knockout mice. Our data suggest that acetylation of MKP-1 inhibits innate immune signaling. This pathway may be an important therapeutic target in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: ER, estrogen receptor; ERK, extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; JNK, Jun-N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; MKP, MAPK phosphatase; NO, nitric oxide; si, small interfering; OMFP, 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TSA, trichostatin A.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Innate immune responses play a critical role in defending the host from pathogens. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns stimulate pattern recognition receptors such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which activate a set of signaling pathways, inducing expression of innate immune effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). LPS is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that interacts with TLR4, which in turn interacts with intracellular adaptor proteins such as MyD88 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). The TLR4 signaling complex then activates two intracellular pathways, the NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, both of which direct an inflammatory response.</p><p>The MAPK pathway plays a critical role in innate immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). The three major families of MAPKs include extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the p38 MAPKs, and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). These MAPKs are activated by MAPK kinases (MAPKKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). MAPKKs are in turn activated by a set of MAPKK kinases. The MAPK pathway that mediates innate immune signaling includes MKK3/4/6, p38, and JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>).</p><p>Negative regulators of innate immunity prevent excessive inflammation and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Distinct inhibitors of TLR signaling have been identified, many of which act upon the Myd88 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Furthermore, endogenous inhibitors of the MAPK system may also negatively regulate TLR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>).</p><p>MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) are dual-specificity phosphatases that inactivate MAPK members by dephosphorylating phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). The MKP family includes four types; the type II, III, and IV MKPs all include a MAPK-docking domain and a dual-specific phosphatase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). The docking domain mediates interactions between MKP and its substrate MAPK. MKP binding to its MAPK target via the docking domain increases MKP catalytic activity by more than fivefold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). MKP-1 can be phosphorylated to regulate its stability, but other modifications have not been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Recent studies have emphasized the importance of MKP-1 in regulating innate immune responses. Mice lacking MKP-1 are more susceptible to LPS than WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). Furthermore, in response to TLR signals, macrophages lacking MKP-1 produce higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines.</p><p>Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) can regulate gene expression by modifying histone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). However, HAT and HDAC can regulate specific signaling pathways and have other targets in addition to histones, including NF-&#x003ba;B, Stat3, and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Recent reports suggest that inhibitors of HDAC can decrease inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). Interestingly, HDAC inhibitors repress expression of some inflammatory genes, but increase expression of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>). This reinforces the idea that HDAC inhibitors do not regulate expression of inflammatory proteins only by a general effect on transcription, but may also have specific targets. In this study, we searched for acetylated targets in innate immune signaling, and we discovered that acetylation of MKP-1 is a negative regulator of innate immunity.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>HDAC inhibitors decrease LPS activation of NOS2 expression</title><p>To explore the effect of global protein acetylation upon NOS2 expression, we pretreated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) or control, added LPS, and measured the concentration of the nitric oxide (NO) metabolite nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) in the media. TSA decreases LPS-activated NO production in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Another HDAC inhibitor, sodium butyrate, also inhibits NO production (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). To explore the mechanism by which TSA inhibits NO production, we measured the steady-state RNA and protein levels of NOS2 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. TSA decreases NOS2 mRNA levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). TSA also decreases NOS2 steady-state protein levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>).

LPS or <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which are activators of TLR4 signaling, peptidoglycan, which is an activator of TLR2 signaling, or double-stranded RNA, which is an activator of TLR3 signaling, can activate NOS2 expression in macrophages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>). TSA inhibits expression of NOS2 activated by each of these four TLR activators (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>).

We treated RAW macrophages with SB203580 to inhibit p38, with U0126 to inhibit ERK, or with SP600125 to inhibit Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK); we then added LPS and measured expression of NOS2 protein. MAPK inhibitors decrease LPS activation of NOS2 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). These MAPK inhibitors are not cytotoxic (unpublished data). To identify which MAPKs are affected by deacetylase inhibition, we added media, LPS alone, TSA alone, or LPS and TSA together to RAW cells, and then measured levels of the three major groups of phosphorylated MAPK proteins as follows: p38; ERK1 and ERK2; and JNK1 and JNK2. LPS increases phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). TSA decreases LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2, but not JNK1/2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Deacetylase inhibition blocks MAPK signaling.</bold> (A) The MAPK pathway regulates NOS2 expression. RAW cells were treated for 1 h with 10 &#x003bc;M of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, 10 &#x003bc;M of the MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126, or 5 &#x003bc;M of the JNK inhibitor SP600125, and then 100 ng/ml LPS was added for 6 h and cell lysates were immunoblotted with antibody to NOS2 (top) or MEK1/2 (bottom left) of HuR (bottom right).

RAW cells were treated with LPS and TSA as in B and C, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to MKK3. The kinase activity of MKK3 was assayed by adding recombinant GST-p38 and ATP to immunoprecipitated MKK3 for 30 min at 30&#x000b0;C, and then immunoblotting for phospho-p38 (top) and total p38 (bottom).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2051491f02"></graphic></fig><p>The p38 pathway of MAPK signaling includes MKK3/6, which phosphorylates p38, which in turn phosphorylates ELK-1 and other targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>).

We reasoned that acetylated MAPK components would interact with acetylases. Accordingly, we immunoprecipitated the histone acetylase p300 from RAW cell lysates, and immunoblotted precipitants for a variety of MAPK proteins, including MKP-1. We found that MKP-1 does not associate with p300 in resting macrophages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). However, we reasoned that HDAC and HAT might compete for the same acetylation site of MKP-1, and blockade of HDAC might permit an unopposed increase in the interaction between p300 and MKP-1. For example, TSA not only increases acetylation of Sp1 but also recruits p300 into a complex that includes Sp1 and HDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>). Accordingly, we tested the idea that TSA might increase the interaction of p300 and MKP-1.

MKP-1 contains a lysine K57 that is conserved among most MKP isoforms (including MKP isoforms 1, 2, 3, and X; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). This conserved lysine residue is located in the middle of the MKP-1 docking domain, which interacts with p38.

We synthesized a peptide consisting of MKP-1 residues 47&#x02013;76, designated MKP-1(47&#x02013;76)(WT). We also synthesized a mutant peptide consisting of MKP-1(47&#x02013;76) with an arginine substituted for lysine at residue 57, designated MKP-1(47&#x02013;76)(K57R). We incubated the WT and mutant MKP-1 peptides with recombinant acetyltransferases p300 or PCAF (p300/CBP-associated factor) and [<sup>14</sup>C]acetyl-CoA. p300 acetylates MKP-1(47&#x02013;76) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>).

TSA decreases TNF-&#x003b1; by 62% in WT mice, but only by 22% in MKP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref> left). TSA decreases IL-1&#x003b2; by 79% in WT mice, but only by 21% in MKP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref> right). TSA also suppresses cytokine production more in primary macrophages from WT mice than from MKP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice; in particular, TSA suppresses TNF-&#x003b1; by 87% in WT macrophages, but only by 27% in MKP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages; and TSA decreases IL-1&#x003b2; by 85% in WT macrophages, but only by 34% in MKP-1 KO macrophages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>). Supporting these data, TSA decreases LPS-induced TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA levels in the liver (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 E</xref>), and TSA decreases NOS2 steady-state protein levels in liver (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 G</xref>). However, TSA slightly increases COX-2 and CXCL2 expression in vivo (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 F</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesize that MKP-1 mediates part of the antiinflammatory effects of HDAC inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation confirmed that MKP-1 is acetylated in livers of mice treated with LPS, and that TSA increases acetylation of MKP-1 in vivo (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 H</xref>). We pretreated MKP-1 KO mice with TSA or control, and then injected them with 20 mg/kg LPS. LPS causes 100% mortality of MKP-1 KO mice within 3 d (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 I</xref>). However, TSA has a minimal and insignificant effect on mortality (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 I</xref>). Thus, TSA protects WT mice from LPS (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>), but TSA does not protect MKP-1 KO mice from LPS (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 I</xref>).</p><p>These data confirm the findings of others that LPS induces higher levels of inflammation in MKP-1 KO mice compared with WT mice. Our data also confirm prior studies showing that HDAC inhibitors decrease inflammation caused by LPS in vivo. Furthermore, our data extend these studies by showing that TSA inhibits inflammation less in mice lacking MKP-1 than in WT mice. Therefore our data suggest that MKP-1 mediates part of the antiinflammatory effects of HDAC inhibitors in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Summary</title><p>The major finding of this study is that acetylation of MKP-1 regulates TLR signaling. Acetylation of MKP-1 increases its interaction with p38. A greater interaction of acetylated MKP-1 with p38 increases MKP-1 phosphatase activity by &#x0003e;100%, decreases cellular phospho-p38 levels, and inhibits the MAPK signaling cascade. Acetylation may be a negative regulator of innate immune pathways (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 J</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Acetylation of MKP-1</title><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that MKP-1 is acetylated. The acetyltransferase p300 associates with MKP-1 in cells, and PCAF and p300 acetylate MKP-1 in vitro (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Treatment with the deacetylase inhibitor TSA increases levels of acetylated MKP-1 in cells and in mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that regulators of transcription are acetylated, including histones, transcription factors, nuclear import factors, and tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>). Our data identify a member of a signal transduction cascades as a novel target of acetylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Acetylation of MKP-1 regulates protein&#x02013;protein interactions and phosphatase activity</title><p>Our data suggest that acetylation of MKP-1 at a specific site regulates its ability to interact with its substrates. The interaction between MKP and their MAPK substrates is mediated by a docking domain in the N terminus of MKP and a docking domain in the MAPK substrate. The docking domain of murine MKP-1 extends from amino acid residues R47 to E63, and contains a central region with 4 arginine and 1 lysine residues: RFSTIVRRRAKGAMGLE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>). We identified K57 as an amino acid residue acetylated in MKP-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This lysine residue lies within the docking domain of MKP-1. Acetylation of K57 may neutralize the positive charge within the docking domain, which may explain our observation that acetylation of MAPK K57 increases the interactions between MKP-1 and p38. Our data thus confirm other studies that found that acetylation of lysine residues can increase protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref>). The docking domains of all MKP family members are rich in arginine and lysine residues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Some isoforms contain a lysine residue in the same relative position as MKP-1 K57, others contain a lysine residue two amino acyl residues adjacent to K57 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Other MKP isoforms lack a lysine in the docking domain. It is possible that selective MKP isoforms are acetylated in their respective docking domains, and others are not.</p><p>We also found that acetylation of MKP-1 indirectly affects its phosphatase activity. Substrate binding to MKP-1 increases the phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Other MKP isoforms are also activated by interacting with their respective substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref>). Our studies of recombinant MKP-1 show that acetylation does not affect phosphatase activity of the enzyme alone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>.) However, acetylation of MKP-1 significantly increases phosphatase activity in the presence of substrate by &#x0223c;125% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). Our SPR assay of the interaction between p38 and MKP-1 peptides also suggests that acetylation of MKP-1 increases its affinity for its substrate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Collectively, our findings suggest that acetylation indirectly increases phosphatase activity by increasing the avidity of MKP-1 for its substrate.</p></sec><sec><title>Acetylation of MKP-1 negatively regulates innate immune signaling</title><p>Our data provide a mechanistic explanation for the antiinflammatory effects of HDAC inhibitors administered to animals. Numerous studies have shown that HDAC inhibitors decrease inflammation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). Although it is thought that HDAC inhibitors decrease inflammation by regulating histone acetylation and inflammatory gene transcription, our data suggest that HDAC inhibitors decrease inflammation in part by increasing acetylation of MKP-1. However, HDAC inhibitors probably have other antiinflammatory targets in addition to MKP-1, especially because TSA partially decreases cytokines in macrophages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>) and mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>), and because TSA has a small protective effect on MKP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse mortality (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 I</xref>). Other studies suggest that MKP isoforms can be regulated by other posttranslational modifications, such as oxidation of cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref>). Our data demonstrate another mechanism of regulating inflammation through MKP. Acetylation of target proteins in inflammatory signaling pathways may be novel therapeutic targets in patients with sepsis or autoimmune diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Materials.</title><p>LPS, TSA, sodium butyrate, actinomycin D, and 4-hydroxytamoxifen were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
