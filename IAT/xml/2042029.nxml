We sequenced 4.5 kb of the <italic>Hras1</italic> gene on distal Chr 7 in a diverse set of 12 commonly used laboratory inbred strains of mice and detected no sequence variation to account for strain-specific differences in <italic>Hras1</italic> mutation prevalence. Furthermore, the <italic>Hras1</italic> sequence is essentially monoallelic for an ancestral gene derived from the <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> species. To determine if the monoallelism and associated low rate of polymorphism are unique to <italic>Hras1</italic> or representative of the general chromosomal locale, we extended the sequence analysis to 12 genes in the final 8 Mb of distal Chr 7. A region of at least 2.5 Mb that encompasses several genes, including <italic>Hras1</italic> and the <italic>H19/Igf2</italic> loci, demonstrates virtually no sequence variation. The 12 inbred strains share one dominant haplotype derived from the <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> allele.

This research verifies and details a patchwork pattern of variation first posited in 1987, in which pairs of laboratory inbred strains share large blocks derived from one ancestral strain, primarily <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> or <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> (Bonhomme et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1987</xref>). Within any pairwise inbred strain comparison, there are haplotype blocks defined by a low or high SNP rate, and the average length of these blocks is estimated to be 1.2&#x02013;1.4 megabases (Mb) (Frazer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2004</xref>; Wade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2002</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>). Genome-wide studies of a few inbred strains estimate that the average rate of polymorphism between two such strains is 0.5 SNP/10 kb in the low-SNP-rate blocks and 35 SNP/10 kb in SNP-dense blocks (Frazer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2004</xref>). Blocks of limited diversity are attributed to a recent coalescence in which inbred strains inherited the same ancestral allele, while SNP-dense blocks reflect inheritance of divergent ancestral alleles.</p><p>Laboratory inbred strains of mice vary in their frequency of <italic>Hras1</italic> (H-<italic>ras</italic>) mutational activation during multistage hepatocarcinogenesis (Buchmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1991</xref>; J.C. Drew and N.R. Drinkwater, unpublished). Given its significant role in liver tumorigenesis and its strain-dependent frequency of activation, we tested the hypothesis that strain-specific polymorphisms in the <italic>Hras1</italic> gene could account for variable frequencies of <italic>Hras1</italic> initiation in liver tumors. We sequenced approximately 4.5 kb of the <italic>Hras1</italic> gene from 12 diverse, yet commonly used laboratory inbred mouse strains and two distantly related inbred strains. The set includes representatives from all six families of inbred strains as defined by genome-wide parsimony analysis of simple sequence length polymorphisms (Witmer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2003</xref>).</p><p>In this article we report on the monoallelic inheritance of <italic>Hras1</italic> and its neighbors on distal Chr 7 among 12 classic inbred strains. Sequence analysis revealed a region of remarkably low diversity among the strains. No strain-specific SNPs account for differences in frequency of <italic>Hras1</italic> activation. Additional sequence analysis of surrounding genes in the final 8 Mb of distal Chr 7 exposed a unique 2.5-Mb block that is essentially devoid of any sequence variation among the 12 classic inbred strains. This block is flanked by regions with significantly greater diversity. Analysis of wild-derived inbred strains representing ancestral genomes of <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> and <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> indicates that the 12 lab inbred strains have fixed alleles from the <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> progenitor strain in the 2.5-Mb region on distal Chr 7 that includes the <italic>Hras1</italic> gene. Considering the well-established role of <italic>Hras1</italic> in cell signal transduction and of mutant <italic>Hras1</italic> in tumor development, these results have important implications for the study of <italic>Hras1</italic> in mouse models of neoplasia and contribute to the burgeoning understanding of laboratory inbred mouse genomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sequence analysis of <italic>Hras1</italic> and surrounding genes on Chr 7</title><p>The C57BL/6J (B6) <italic>Hras1</italic> and additional 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; nucleotide sequence was originally obtained from GenBank (accession No. z50013) and the Trace Archive database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi</ext-link>).

Most unexpectedly, several strains share identical haplotypes, without any SNPs, that span the entire 8 Mb. <fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Distal Chr 7 features a 2.5-5-Mb monoallelic block of <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> origin.

The strain names are listed on the left <italic>Y</italic> axis. Each strain at every position is indicated with a symbol and the distance between symbols along each row is fixed, not scaled, to actual positions.

The resulting tree (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) reveals relatedness at distal Chr 7 that does not match the strains&#x02019; overall relatedness based on genealogic, microsatellite, and SNP data (Beck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2000</xref>; Petkov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2004</xref>; Tsang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2005</xref>; Witmer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2003</xref>). For instance, in genome-wide analyses, 129P3/J and C3H/HeJ align to two separate branches although they are identical at the distal Chr 7 region. C57BR/cdJ and C57BL/6J are closely related in genome-wide scans, but these two strains are distinct in the distal Chr 7 region and C57BR/cdJ and SM/J are entirely identical. These results are consistent with previous observations that local and global hereditary relationships often differ (Frazer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2004</xref>; Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Validation of the haplotype structure</title><p>Previous estimates indicate that <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> ancestry accounts for two thirds of the laboratory inbred mouse genome (Wade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2002</xref>). Given this proportion, the chance of randomly encountering a locus in which 12 laboratory inbred strains have all fixed the <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> allele, as for the monoallelic block on distal Chr 7, is (0.67)<sup>12</sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.008 per block, or about 10 per genome. To determine the frequency of such blocks empirically, and to validate the presence of this large, monoallelic block on distal Chr 7, we queried the Mouse Phenome Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aretha.jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=docs/home">http://www.aretha.jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=docs/home</ext-link>). Although this database has information for all 12 lab inbred strains, the level of strain coverage varies. We restricted our analysis to the eight strains in our set for which at least 155,000 SNPs per genome had been analyzed: 129X1/SvJ, A/J, AKR/J, BALB/cByJ, C3H/HeJ, B6, DBA/2J, and SM/J. We discovered that for 354 nucleotide positions in a 2-Mb (141&#x02013;143 Mb) window that lies within the monoallelic block on distal Chr 7, 100% were identical for all eight strains. We assessed the level of SNP variation throughout the entire genome to determine how often one would encounter a 2-Mb block with this level of sequence similarity at random among eight laboratory inbred strains. We analyzed all entered SNP information for the eight sampled strains in 2-Mb sliding windows. We identified five hundred 2-Mb intervals that contained information for at least 50 SNPs for the eight strains queried. In this analysis, 1% of these 2-Mb blocks are identical for all nucleotide positions in all eight laboratory strains. However, the block on distal Chr 7 had the highest level of significance as determined by comparing the lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals (data not shown). Therefore, although the monoallelic block on distal Chr 7 is not singular, blocks of this size with similar sequence conservation (100% similarity among many strains) are rare in the mouse genome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Remarkably, a 2.5-Mb region on distal Chr. 7 that encompasses several genes, including <italic>Hras1</italic>, is essentially monoallelic among many laboratory inbred strains, all of which have fixed the <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> allele. Although the AKR/J strain harbors two SNPs in the <italic>Hras1</italic> gene, they are both in noncoding regions. The AKR/J strain develops <italic>Hras1</italic> mutations in approximately 4% of its chemically induced liver tumors, which is very similar to the phenotype of the C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains (J.C. Drew and N.R. Drinkwater, unpublished). These observations support the inference that the AKR-specific SNPs are phenotypically silent.</p><p>As a result of this high degree of haplotype conservation, we conclude that a 4.5-kb region carrying the <italic>Hras1</italic> gene is not responsible for strain-dependent variation in <italic>Hras1</italic> mutation rates in liver tumors. Although sequence analysis included the promoter regions and the 3&#x02032; untranslated region, regulatory elements beyond the sequenced domain may affect expression and result in variable rates of <italic>Hras1</italic>-initiated liver tumors. We analyzed <italic>Hras1</italic> expression in the livers of five of the classic inbred strains (129X1/SvJ, C57BR/cdJ, C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ, and SM/J) by microarray and did not observe any significant differences among the strains (A. Bilger, personal communication).</p><p>The extremely low rate of variation in the 2.5-5-Mb <italic>Hras1</italic> region, which contains up to 100 genes, is highly unusual. The overall SNP rate of the monoallelic region on distal Chr 7 is 0.48 SNPs/10 kb and is consistent with the observed rate in low-SNP regions for a single pair of strains. However, this low SNP rate is very rare for comparisons among many strains. Frazer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2004</xref>) recently suggested that haplotype analysis with 12 inbred strains captures greater than 95% of the variation likely to be present among the classic laboratory inbred strains. The set of 12 lab inbred strains presented here are genetically diverse and include members from the six major families of inbred strains (Witmer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2003</xref>). The monoallelic region on distal Chr 7 is the only block reported with such a low rate of variation over 66 pairwise strain comparisons. The two less-conserved regions flanking the monoallelic block are in agreement with the published average rate of 35 SNP/10 kb in a SNP-dense block, and our strain distribution of ancestral alleles is in accordance with the predicted proportion of two thirds with <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> ancestry (Frazer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2004</xref>; Wade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2002</xref>).</p><p>The monoallelic interval, or SNP &#x0201c;desert,&#x0201d; on distal Chr 7 affects QTL analysis in two ways. First, this SNP desert is effectively noninformative and precludes linkage analysis in this region for pairs of the aforementioned, frequently used, 12 laboratory inbred strains. Second, the lack of genotypic differences among the 12 common lab strains examined in this study suggests that phenotypic differences are unlikely to be the direct result of genes located in this monoallelic 2-5-Mb interval, which includes <italic>Hras1</italic>, <italic>H19</italic>, <italic>Igf2</italic>, <italic>Insulin 2 precursor</italic> (<italic>Ins2</italic>), and <italic>Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1c</italic> (<italic>Cdkn1c</italic>) (Mouse Genome Informatics, www.informatics.jax.org).</p><p>Functional selection may account for the shared <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> ancestry in the distal Chr 7 monoallelic region. However, the <italic>Hras1</italic> gene is unlikely to be the driving force of such selection because <italic>Hras1</italic> is not an essential gene and it demonstrates functional redundancy with other RAS family members (Esteban et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2001</xref>; Ise et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2000</xref>; Johnson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1997</xref>). The monoallelic block also includes the well-studied <italic>H19</italic>/<italic>Igf2</italic> imprinted region, which could drive selection for this haplotype. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed analysis of sequence variation among a large number of inbred strains in any imprinted region. Integrity of human imprinting clusters is essential and may be important for regulating expression. Since imprinted clusters are well conserved between human and mouse, murine imprinted regions may also require strict conservation (Caspary et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1998</xref>; Reik and Walter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2001</xref>). However, mice lacking functional <italic>Igf2</italic> are viable, which suggests that <italic>Igf2</italic> is not solely driving selection (Constania et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>). A congenic mouse line carrying the <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> distal Chr 7 region on a <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> or standard inbred background would reveal whether the <italic>M. m. musculus</italic> Chr 7 allele results in a selective disadvantage.</p><p>Reduced variation is often observed at chromosomal regions linked to a beneficial mutation driving positive selection (Kaplan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1989</xref>). For example, Schlenke and Begeen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>) identified a chromosomal invariant region in a <italic>Drosphilia simulans</italic> population that was best explained by recent fixation due to directional selection. Candidate gene evaluation of the region led to a locus containing a transposon that is associated with increased resistance to insecticides and thereby potentially improves fitness. As this example shows, monoallelic blocks can be signposts for biologically relevant loci and conserved regions such as that on distal mouse Chr 7 may be fruitful to explore.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="N0x1a5dda0N0x2f40c58" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="335_2007_9061_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MO6" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="N0x1a5dda0N0x2f40d78" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="335_2007_9061_MOESM2_ESM.pdf" id="MO7" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="N0x1a5dda0N0x2f40e98" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="335_2007_9061_MOESM3_ESM.pdf" id="MO8" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="N0x1a5dda0N0x2f40fb8" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="335_2007_9061_MOESM4_ESM.xls" id="MO9" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Supplementary material</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Kristin Liss, Kim Leutkehoelter, Andrew Schneider, and Matthew Gigot for expert technical assistance in various aspects of this work.
