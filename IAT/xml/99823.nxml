We proceeded to delineate the BMP-2-responsive region to an area between &#x02013;1917 and &#x02013;1747 in the Dlx3 promoter. Gel shift assays with recombinant Smad1 and Smad4 demonstrated that this DNA fragment (&#x02013;1917 to &#x02013;1747) was competent in the formation of protein&#x02013;DNA complexes. By deletion and mutational analyses we localized a Smad1&#x0002f;Smad4-binding site containing a GCAT motif, which showed similarity to other TGF-&#x003b2; family responsive elements. Supershift assays with keratinocyte nuclear extracts and antibodies against members of the Smad family showed that this motif was able to form a complex with Smad1. Mutation of the Smad1&#x0002f;Smad4-binding site inhibited transcriptional activation of the Dlx3 gene by BMP-2. In the hair follicle, where Dlx3 is expressed in the hair matrix cells, BMP-2 also activates Dlx3 transcription. These results provide a possible mechanism of action for the BMP signaling pathway on the regulation of Dlx3.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Dlx3 is a homeodomain transcription factor and member of the Dlx vertebrate family that is expressed in differentiating epidermal cells. The stratified epidermis is characterized by the outward migration of keratinocytes from the proliferative basal compartment to the upper, terminally differentiated cornified layer of the skin. The differentiation process is associated with sequential induction of stratification-specific markers and enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c1">1</xref>).</p><p>Dlx3 is a transcriptional activator that is primarily expressed in the differentiated granular layer of the epidermis and in the hair matrix cells of the hair follicle and has an AT-rich consensus DNA-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c2">2</xref>). Transgenic temporal and spatial misexpression of Dlx3 in the basal layer causes an abnormal skin phenotype, characterized by cessation of proliferation and premature differentiation of the basal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c3">3</xref>). Disruption of the DLX3 coding sequence has been associated with the autosomal dominant human tricho-dento-osseous syndrome, characterized by defects in ectodermal derivatives such as hair and teeth, and craniofacial bone abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c4">4</xref>). The expression of Dlx3 is controlled by transcription factors NF-Y and Sp-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c5">5</xref>) and is up-regulated by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> through the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway. Dlx3 function is potentially regulated through post-translational phosphorylation by PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c6">6</xref>).</p><p>The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) were originally identified as inducers of bone and cartilage formation in ectopic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c7">7</xref>). BMPs constitute the largest subfamily in the transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) superfamily of growth and differentiation factors, and exert pleiotropic biological effects ranging from regulation of early developmental processes to organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c8">8</xref>). BMPs play important roles in many aspects of vertebrate embryogenesis. Transgenic mice misexpressing a constitutively active BMP receptor-1B caused bifurcation, duplication and posterior transformation of digits in the mouse limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c9">9</xref>). Patterning of embryonic ectoderm is dependent on transcription factors such as Dlx3 and Msx1, which have differential responses to BMP signaling in the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c10">10</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, ventral ectoderm transcription of Dlx3 is regulated by BMP signaling. This is demonstrated by the negative response of Dlx3 to BMP antagonists, such as the neural inducer chordin, or a truncated BMP receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c11">11</xref>). Several BMPs are expressed in hair follicle cells as well as the interfollicular epidermis. BMP-6 is expressed in the developing intermediate layers at 15.5 d.p.c. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c12">12</xref>) and located in the suprabasal layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c13">13</xref>). In the mature hair follicle, BMP-2 transcripts are normally seen only in precortex cells at the base of the hair shaft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c14">14</xref>).</p><p>BMPs bind to two types of transmembrane receptors, type I and type II, with serine&#x0002f;threonine kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c15">15</xref>). Upon ligand binding, type II receptors phosphorylate the GS domain of type I receptors. The activated type I receptors then phosphorylate the Smads downstream substrates. Smads are grouped into three classes based on structure and function. Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 propagate BMP signals and Smad2 and Smad3 are activated by TGF-&#x003b2; or activin. Smad4 is the only common Smad and can associate with receptor-regulated Smads (1&#x02013;3 and 5), while Smad6 and Smad7 belong to the inhibitory class Smads. Receptor-regulated Smads are directly phosphorylated by type I receptors and then associate with Smad4. The heteromeric complexes translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate transcription of target genes in association with several nuclear partners (FAST-1, FAST-2, STAT3, Hoxc-8 and AP-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c21">21</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c23">23</xref>). Smads mediate their effects through protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;DNA binding interactions and several DNA-binding motifs for Smads have been identified. PCR-based screening of random sequences identified palindromic GTCTAGAC as a Smad-binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c24">24</xref>) and a Smad3-binding motif (CAGACA) has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c26">26</xref>). The first demonstration that Smads can directly bind to DNA was reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c27">27</xref>). The Smad binding GCCG<sub>n</sub>CGC (GCCG motif) sequence was also found in mammalian BMP-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c28">28</xref>). Recently it was reported that a GCAT motif was responsible for Smad1 binding in the Xvent-2B promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c29">29</xref>).</p><p>In this report we show that BMP-2 is expressed in mouse keratinocytes and transactivates Dlx3 gene expression. We have identified a BMP-2-responsive region containing Smad1- and Smad4-binding sites (GCAT motif) in the Dlx3 promoter. We also show that this transactivation occurs in hair follicle cells through the same DNA sequence. We propose that the BMP signaling pathway is one possible mechanism of regulation of Dlx3 during epidermal differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The &#x02013;2317 to &#x0002b;160 upstream sequence of the Dlx3 gene was inserted into a pCAT-basic (Promega) and designated p2317CAT.

Unless otherwise indicated, the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration of the medium was adjusted to 0.05 mM to maintain a basal cell-like population of undifferentiated cells. Hair follicle cells were isolated from the dermis of newborn mouse skin using a Ficoll gradient.

CAT activities were determined 48 h after transfection and normalized to the protein value at OD<sub>595</sub>. For treatment with BMP-2, different concentrations of BMP-2 (Genetics Institute) were added to the growth medium for 24 h before the CAT assay. CAT activities were measured by the fluor diffusion CAT assay using Econofluor premixed scintillation fluid and &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;acetyl-CoA (Dupont NEN) in the linear range of the assay.

At these concentrations of calcium the keratinocytes present a basal (0.05 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>) or a differentiated phenotype (0.12 or 1.4 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c30">30</xref>). We found that BMP-2 was expressed in mouse keratinocytes independent of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f1">1</xref>A). We also tested whether BMP-2 is expressed in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes separated on a Percoll gradient. Expression of BMP-2 is also detected in both cell types (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f1">1</xref>A, right). To examine whether Dlx3 is a target for BMP-2 signaling in keratinocytes, we treated mouse primary keratinocytes grown in 0.05 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (which maintains the basal condition) with increasing concentrations of BMP-2 and performed RT&#x02013;PCR analysis with specific primers for Dlx3. At this Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration Dlx3 is not expressed or is present at very low levels in normal mouse keratinocytes cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c5">5</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f1">1</xref>B, Dlx3 transcription increased upon treatment with 10 ng&#x0002f;ml BMP-2, with no further increments at higher BMP-2 concentrations. BMP-2 at 10 ng&#x0002f;ml was the concentration used for future experiments. The levels of Dlx3 mRNA were strongly induced 12 h after treatment with BMP-2 and remained elevated throughout the duration of experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f1">1</xref>B, center). To further delineate the earliest time point of Dlx3 induction by BMP-2, we carried out assays 3, 6, 9 and 12 h after treatment. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f1">1</xref>B (right), the induction level of Dlx3 mRNA increased dramatically after 12 h treatment.</p><p>To examine whether treatment with BMP-2 affected the transcription of structural terminal differentiation markers in keratinocytes, RT&#x02013;PCR analyses were performed with specific primers for keratin1, filaggrin and transglutaminase K. There was no change in the transcription of terminal differentiation markers (data not shown). Cycloheximide treatment of keratinocytes grown in 0.05 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (basal conditions) resulted in activation of Dlx3 expression, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f1">1</xref>C, which suggests that there is an inhibitory factor regulating Dlx3 expression under basal culture conditions. Pretreatment of the keratinocytes with cycloheximide and consequent BMP-2 treatment did not show additional activation of Dlx3 transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f1">1</xref>C). This result suggests that BMP-2-mediated activation of Dlx3 might also require new protein synthesis and&#x0002f;or that BMP-2 treatment results in the removal of an inhibitor of Dlx3 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of the BMP-2-responsive region in the Dlx3 promoter</title><p>Several deletion mutants were constructed and tested for BMP-2 responsiveness (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f2">2</xref>A).

To determine whether Smad1 and Smad4 were capable of directly binding to this region, bacterially expressed full-length Smad1, Smad4 and Smad3 were incubated with the <sup>32</sup>P-end-labeled &#x02013;1917 to &#x02013;1747 fragment. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f3">3</xref>A, both Smad1 and Smad4 were capable of binding this fragment in a concentration-dependent manner, but Smad3 was unable to bind under the same experimental conditions. To test the binding activity of Smad3 protein, we performed gel shift assays using a Smad3&#x0002f;4 consensus oligonucleotide (Santa Cruz). The Smad3 protein was capable of binding to the probe and the shift was competed with unlabeled oligonucleotide competitor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f3">3</xref>A, right) The lack of a DNA shift by Smad3 and binding by Smad1 suggested a specific role for BMP signaling.</p><p>To further delineate the Smad-binding sites, four overlapping 50mer oligonucleotides covering the &#x02013;1917 to &#x02013;1747 fragment were prepared and used as probes in gel shift assays. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f3">3</xref>B, Smad1and Smad4 bound to SBE2 and SBE4 specifically. SBE2 and SBE4 contain the GCAT motif. Although SBE1 also contained a GCAT motif, no specific shift was observed with either Smad1 or Smad4. To test the specificity of the Smad-dependent complex, we performed competition assays with the SBE4 oligonucleotide probe. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f3">3</xref>B (right), although the bottom shifted complex was competed by the unlabeled SBE4 competitor, the upper non-specific complex was unaffected. To delineate which parts of SBE2 and SBE4 were responsible for binding to Smad1 and Smad4, each element was divided into two parts and used as a competitor in gel shift assays. The 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-parts of SBE2 partially competed the complexes formed between SBE2 and Smad1 or Smad4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f4">4</xref>A). In contrast, the 5&#x02032;-part of SBE4 completely competed the complexes, while the 3&#x02032;-part of SBE4 did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f4">4</xref>B). To confirm specific binding of Smad proteins to SBE4-1, supershift assays were performed with anti-Smads antibodies and nuclear extract of mouse keratinocytes pretreated with BMP-2. Several specific complexes, which were competed with cold SBE4-1, were formed and a supershifted complex was shown in the presence of anti-Smad1 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f4">4</xref>C). This supershifted complex was not readily detectable in assays performed with nuclear extracts from untreated (&#x02013;BMP-2) cultured cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f4">4</xref>C). We were unable to detect a supershift when using a Smad4-specific antibody (Santa Cruz). Together, these results suggest that Smad1 and Smad4 bound specifically to the 5&#x02032;-part of SBE4. A possible explanation for the results with SBE2 is that binding of Smad1 and Smad4 requires the whole region of SBE2 or that the specificity for binding is not as strong as for SBE4. We focused on SBE4-1 for further examination.</p></sec><sec><title>Smad1 and Sma4 bind to the GCAT sequence in SBE4</title><p>To determine the specific sequence responsible for Smad1 and Smad4 binding, serial 4 bp mutations were made in SBE4-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f5">5</xref>A, left). Each mutant oligonucleotide was used as a probe in gel shift assays with Smad1 and Smad4 recombinant proteins. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f5">5</xref>A, Smad1 and Smad4 binding to SBE4-1 was unaffected by the mutations in the M1, M2 and M4 probes. However, the M3 mutant probe, mutated in the GCAT sequence, showed decreased binding activity for both Smad1 and Smad4. To investigate whether the GCAT sequence contributes to BMP-2-induced transcriptional activation of the Dlx3 promoter, the site was mutated in p1917CAT. The mutated p1917mCAT was transfected into mouse keratinocytes, after which the cells were treated with BMP-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f5">5</xref>B). Mutation of the GCAT sequence consistently reduced transcriptional activation by BMP-2 treatment when compared to the wild-type p1917CAT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f5">5</xref>C). To confirm the role of the GCAT sequence, we investigated the response of p1917mCAT and p1917CAT to co-transfection with Smad1 and Smad4 expression vectors. The transcriptional activity of p1917CAT was induced with Smad1 and Smad4. However, p1917mCAT showed a reduction in transcriptional activation by Smad1&#x0002f;Smad4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f5">5</xref>D). These results strongly suggest that the GCAT sequence located in the &#x02013;1797 to &#x02013;1747 region of the Dlx3 promoter is responsible for binding of Smad1 and Smad4 and for transcriptional activation of Dlx3 by BMP-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional activation of Dlx3 by BMP-2 in hair follicle cells</title><p>By the end of embryonic development, Dlx3 is expressed in the stratified epidermis and in the matrix cells of hair follicles. In addition to keratinocytes, we tested the transcriptional activation of Dlx3 by BMP-2 in hair follicle cells. We prepared RNA from hair follicle cells cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> after treatment with BMP-2 at increasing concentrations. Using total RNA, RT&#x02013;PCR was performed with Dlx3-specific primers. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f6">6</xref>A, transcription of Dlx3 was induced by 10&#x000a0;ng&#x0002f;ml BMP-2 and reached a maximum at 100 ng&#x0002f;ml BMP-2. To determine whether the identified GCAT sequence, which is responsible for transcriptional activation of Dlx3 by BMP-2 in keratinocytes, also has an important role in activation in hair follicle cells, several constructs, including the GCAT mutation construct p1917mCAT, were transfected into hair follicle cells. After treatment with BMP-2, extracts from transfected cells were used in CAT assays. The wild-type p1917CAT construct showed induction of transcriptional activity by BMP-2, while p1917mCAT did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf124f6">6</xref>B).

Although it has been established that activation of Dlx3 and two other family members (Dlx5 and Dlx6) requires BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c34">34</xref>), the responsive sequences in the promoter region have not been delineated. We examined expression of BMP-2 in mouse keratinocytes isolated from neonatal epidermis and cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>, and show that BMP-2 is expressed independent of the differentiation state of the keratinocyte. We also show up-regulation of Dlx3 expression after treatment with BMP-2, and specific binding and transactivation activities of Smad regulators on the Dlx3 gene, indicating an alternative mechanism for induction of Dlx3 than the PKC-dependent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> activation of epidermal differentiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c35">35</xref>).</p><p>BMP signal transduction is mediated by direct phosphorylation of Smad1 protein. Upon phosphorylation, Smad1 interacts with a common partner, Smad4, which then translocates to the nucleus where the complex recruits a transcription factor(s) to activate specific gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c15">15</xref>). Evidence indicates that homeobox genes (Dlx5, Xvent2 and Tlx2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c37">37</xref>) mediate events downstream of the BMP signal. In other cases, Smads directly interact with homeobox proteins and indirectly regulate their function. Hoxc-8, which functions as a transcriptional repressor, interacts with Smad1 and is dislodged from the Hoxc-8-binding site in the osteopontin gene, in this way activating gene transcription in response to BMP stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c38">38</xref>).</p><p>Recent work has delineated the BMP-responsive region of the Xvent-2B proximal promoter (&#x02013;275 to &#x02013;152) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c29">29</xref>), which contains a Smad1-binding region with two GCAT motifs and AGNC binding sites for Smad4. We have delineated the BMP-2-responsive sequences in the Dlx3 promoter to the region between &#x02013;1917 and &#x02013;1747 and found an element that contains a GCAT sequence, SBE4, able to bind Smad1 and Smad4. Four other GNCT motifs were also found in the &#x02013;1917 to &#x02013;1747 region but these do not contribute to the responsiveness to BMP-2. The BMP-2 response of the &#x02013;1917 to &#x02013;1747 promoter region was weak when compared to the dramatic response shown for the endogenous Dlx3 gene. One possible explanation is that treatment with BMP-2 not only induces Dlx3 expression but also affects the stability and&#x0002f;or half-life of the mRNA. A second possibility is that besides the BMP-2-responsive elements that have been delineated in the &#x02013;1917 to &#x02013;1747 region, another element(s) located further upstream is required for the full response to BMP-2 shown by endogenous Dlx3.</p><p>Crystal structure studies have shown that sequence-specific DNA recognition is facilitated by the interaction of amino acids with only three bases of a Smad-binding element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c39">39</xref>). As these residues are invariant among the Smads, the GNCT sequence is expected to be recognized by several members of the Smad family. Furthermore, biochemical and biological studies have established at least two distinct TGF-&#x003b2; family pathways: one shared by TGF-&#x003b2; and activin and the other by the BMP-2 and BMP-4 subfamily. The promoters of TGF-&#x003b2;- and activin-responsive genes have been shown to contain GNCT Smad motifs. We tested the transcriptional activation of Dlx3 in mouse keratinocytes by TGF-&#x003b2; and found no effect (G.-T.Park, unpublished results). Therefore, transcription of Dlx3 responds to BMP through direct binding of Smad1 and Smad4 to a GCAT sequence in the Dlx3 promoter.</p><p>BMPs also regulate expression of another member of the Dlx family, Dlx5, in chick embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c36">36</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, during early development expression of Dlx3 is localized to the ventral ectoderm and interference in BMP signaling inhibits expression of Dlx3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c40">40</xref>). We have previously shown that in differentiating mouse keratinocytes Dlx3 expression is dependent on the activity of Sp1 family members and NF-Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c5">5</xref>) and that the inductive process requires Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling through a PKC-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c35">35</xref>). We present evidence to support the hypothesis that BMP signaling could potentially be one of the regulatory pathways that control Dlx3 transcription in mouse keratinocytes.</p><p>Dlx3 is also expressed during embryonic development in the hair follicle and dental and mammary gland primordia, sites derived from epithelium&#x02013;mesenchyme interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf124c42">42</xref>). Within the hair follicles, Dlx3 is expressed in the matrix cells at the base of the follicle. It is possible that the BMP pathway may exert an important function in this ectodermal derivative when compared to the stratified epidermis, where the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> induction-dependent pathway plays a crucial role.</p><p>Since BMP-2 is expressed in basal and differentiated keratinocytes, there must be a regulatory mechanism that prevents activation of Dlx3 expression by BMP signaling in basal cells of the epidermis, where it is not normally found <italic>in vivo</italic>. It remains to be determined how this activation pathway is regulated and how it interacts&#x0002f;overlaps with other inductive signaling pathways, such as the PKC&#x0002f;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent pathway.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf124f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> BMP-2 is expressed in mouse keratinocytes and activates the transcription of Dlx3.
