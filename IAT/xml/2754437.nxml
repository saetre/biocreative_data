This process is tightly regulated by transcription factors, including Sox9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Mice lacking Sox9 display distortion of numerous cartilage-derived skeletal structures[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

However, the precise mechanism how Sox9 regulates chondrogenesis both spatially and temporally is still largely unknown.</p><p>CARM1 belongs to a family of arginine-specific protein methyltransferases (PRMTs), which includes at least eight members (PRMT1-8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. All PRMT family members share a core arginine methyltransferase region composed of a conserved Ado-Met binding domain and a more divergent C-terminal domain. CARM1 has been shown to synergistically activate transcription with nuclear receptors in combination with other coactivators, such as p160 family, p300/CBP and SRC-2/TIF2/GRIP1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. After recruitment to promoters of steroid-responsive genes, CARM1 methylates specific residues (Arg17 and Arg26) at the N-terminus of histone H3 resulting in transcriptional activation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Skeletal phenotype of CARM1 null mice</title><p>To examine the potential role of CARM1 in skeletal development, we analyzed CARM1 null embryos, which die immediately after birth as reported[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. At E14.5, before ossification starts, embryos did not exhibit significant differences by alcian blue and alizarin red staining. However, at E16.5, ossification in null mutants was remarkably delayed, and the size of null mutant was smaller compared with heterozygotes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>: SafraninO). At E18.5, the difference between null and wild type gets relatively weak (data not shown). Using von Kossa staining, we observed that absorption of calcified cells in null mutants at E16.5 was delayed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>: von Kossa). <italic>In situ </italic>hybridization (ISH) of, <italic>Col2a1</italic>, <italic>Col10a1</italic>, <italic>Bone Sialoprotein (BSP)</italic>, <italic>Osteopontin (Op)</italic>, <italic>Osteocalcin (Oc)</italic> and <italic>Runx2</italic> in mutant embryos supported the conclusion that endochondral bone formation was significantly delayed (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Importantly, BrdU pulse-labeling of cells in E16.5 CARM1-null and wild type mouse embryos revealed a marked reduction in the number of BrdU-positive chondrocytes in mutant compared with wild type embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>: &#x000e1;BrdU), indicating that chondrocyte proliferation in mutant embryos was inhibited.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of skeletal phenotypes in CARM1-null mutant embryos</bold>.

In contrast to null mutants, CARM1-transgenic mice analyzed at E18.5 were larger than controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>: Double stain, Tg). Alizarin red positive regions appeared at the shaft of humerus in E14.5 CARM1-transgenic mice but were not visible in wild type mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>: Double stain, Tg limb, arrow heads). von Kossa staining showed absorption of calcified regions was also accelerated in E14.5 transgenic compared with wild type mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>: von Kossa), while SafraninO staining was unchanged and chondrocyte differentiation marker, <italic>Col2a1 </italic>and <italic>Col10a1 </italic>expression was not significantly altered in cartilage in E14.5 transgenic compared to wild type mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>: SafraninO, Tg, Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).

To define the interaction domain of Sox9 with CARM1, we performed the assay using <italic>in vitro </italic>translated CARM1 and bacterially expressed GST-Sox9 fragments. Full length GST-Sox9 (1-507aa) and 328-508aa and 423-508aa fragments interacted with CARM1, while 1-327aa and 1-422aa fragments did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> GST-pull down). Taken together, CARM1 likely interacts with Sox9 via the Sox9 carboxy-terminal domain, which was previously reported to be a transcription activation domain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>CARM1 methylates Sox9</title><p>Since CARM1 methylates some non-histone proteins, such as CBP/p300[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and splicing factors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], we asked whether Sox9 can serve as a substrate for CARM1. Recombinant Flag-Sox9 was incubated with recombinant CARM1/PRMT4 or PRMT1 in the presence of <sup>3</sup>H-labeled S-adenosyl-L-methionine ([<sup>3</sup>H]AdoMet) as a methyl donor. Histone H3 was assayed as a positive control because H3 can be methylated by CARM1 and PRMT1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We observed that Sox9 could be methylated by CARM1/PRMT4, but not by PRMT1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Arginine methylation was also seen in endogenous Sox9 immunoprecipitated from mouse (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, left) or human (data not shown) primary cultured chondrocytes. A recent report showing that the HMG domain of HMGA1a can be arginine-methylated[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] prompted us to determine whether arginine residues in the HMG domain of Sox9 (74-179aa) are CARM1 targets. Based on in vitro methylation assays, simultaneous mutation of five arginine residues within the HMG domain (mt(b)) completely abolished methylation signals, whereas mutants exhibiting R177K, R178K and R179K (mt(a)) were methylated similarly to wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, right &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). These data indicate that CARM1 methylates multiple arginine residues within the HMG domain of Sox9.</p></sec><sec><title>CARM1 regulates chondrocytes proliferation</title><p>Decreased chondrocyte proliferation phenotypes seen in Sox9 transgenic mice are partly explained by the model that Sox9 competes with Tcf/Lef for binding to beta-catenin and regulates chondocyte proliferation via <italic>Cyclin D1 </italic>expression. The beta-catenin/Tcf complex binds the Tcf/Lef consensus site in the <italic>Cyclin D1 </italic>promoter, transactivating <italic>Cyclin D1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Sox9 reportedly inhibits transcriptional beta-catenin activity, an inhibition that does not result from competition by Sox9 with Tcf/Lef for Tcf/Lef DNA-binding sites[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. To determine whether arginine methylation of Sox9 modulates its interaction with beta-catenin, we transfected wild type and methylation point mutant forms of Flag-tagged Sox9 expression plasmids into SW1353 cells, a chondrosarcoma cell line. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that CARM1 overexpression decreased the interaction between Flag-tagged Sox9 and endogenous beta-catenin proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>: top). By contrast, protein with mutation of all Sox9 methylation sites (residues 74, 152, 177, 178, and 179, R to K) strongly interacted with beta-catenin, even when CARM1 was overexpressed, suggesting that methlyation of CARM1 inhibits the interaction between Sox9 and beta-catenin or that CARM1 binding to Sox9 blocks beta-catenin binding. We also checked whether these mutations on Sox9 may effect on cellular localization. Mutants Sox9 R177K, R178K and R179K were mainly located in the nucleus as well as wild type Sox9, when they were orverexpressed in the SW1353 cell line (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>CARM1 regulates Cyclin D1 gene expression</bold>.

In growth plates of E16.5 CARM1-null mutants, <italic>Cyclin D1 </italic>mRNA levels were reduced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>: ISH of <italic>Cyclin</italic><italic>D1 </italic>in CARM1-null), whereas <italic>Col2a1 </italic>was expressed in the limb bud of CARM1-null mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>: RT-PCR).

These data suggest that CARM1 promote <italic>Cyclin D1 </italic>gene expression. To determine how CARM1 regulates <italic>Cyclin D1 </italic>expression, we performed <italic>Cyclin D1 </italic>promoter assays in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, which express endogenous Lef1. On the -963CD1 <italic>Cyclin D1 </italic>promoter reporter plasmid and on a Tcf mt reporter plasmid with a mutation in the Tcf binding site[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], Sox9 inhibited basal promoter activity, as previously reported (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). CARM1 overexpression rescued inhibition by Sox9 in this assay, suggesting that CARM1 may inhibit Sox9 and beta-catenin complex formation and thus increase <italic>Cyclin D1 </italic>expression. In contrast CARM1 and Sox9 did not activate transcription using the Tcf mt reporter plasmid, which lacks beta-catenin reactive sites. With the mutation at all 74,152,177,178,179 shows strong suppression at <italic>CyclinD1</italic> promoter, however, this suppression did not relieved by overexpression of CARM1 (data not shown). This suggests that CARM1 and Sox9 may cooperatively regulate <italic>CyclinD1 </italic>promoter activity.</p><p>Evidence of CARM1-dependent <italic>Cyclin D1 </italic>regulation prompted us to ask whether reduced chondrocyte proliferation may partly explain bone development phenotypes seen in CARM1-null mutant and transgenic embryos. Consistent with BrdU experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>: BrdU stain), CARM1-null chondrocytes showed remarkably lower <italic>Cyclin D1 </italic>mRNA than that seen in CARM1-heterozygotes and wild type chondrocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>: RT-PCR). CARM1-heterozygotes chondrocytes showed quicker disappearance of <italic>Cyclin D1 </italic>mRNA than wild type. Furthermore, 10.60% of CARM1-null chondrocytes were in S-phase, compared with 16.85% in heterozygous chondrocytes, a typical shift seen following <italic>Cyclin D1 </italic>downregulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>: FACS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].
