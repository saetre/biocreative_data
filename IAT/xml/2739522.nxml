Research over the past 15 years has yielded a large body of information concerning the molecules that regulate this process. Some of these molecules, such as the evolutionarily conserved netrin and slit proteins, are expressed in the embryonic midline, an area of extreme importance for early axon pathfinding decisions. A general model has emerged in which netrin attracts commissural axons towards the midline while slit forces them out.

So far, these studies have identified components of the four major guidance cue systems (the netrins, slits, semaphorins, and ephrins) and a variety of morphogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>One of the areas where axons make a major decision on their projection path is the embryonic midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Embryonic midline cells are the main source of secreted midline guidance cues encoded by the <italic>netrin </italic>and <italic>slit </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Netrin is thought to be responsible for attracting commissural axons toward the midline, while slit is responsible for repulsing them. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, commissural axons initially express high levels of a gene called <italic>commissureless </italic>(<italic>comm</italic>), which functions as an inhibitor of the slit receptor roundabout (robo), thus making those axons sensitive only to netrin and not slit signaling. As soon as the axons reach the midline, <italic>comm </italic>gene expression levels are quickly down-regulated, making those axons responsive to midline slit, which forces them to exit the midline contralaterally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, the observation that commissural axons still orient normally and that large numbers of them can reach and cross the midline successfully even in the complete absence of netrin signaling indicates the presence of a yet unidentified midline attractant system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The conserved turtle/Dasm1 Ig proteins are found in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Mammalian Dasm1 has been implicated in the dendritic arborization and synaptic maturation of hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], while the <italic>Drosophila turtle </italic>gene (<italic>tutl</italic>)is thought to be involved, by yet unspecified mechanisms, in coordinating larval motor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

Our analysis indicates that <italic>turtle </italic>encodes extracellular molecules that function as midline attractants, and are independent of netrin or slit signaling. We also report that the <italic>turtle </italic>encoded proteins are potent stimulators of axonal branching and invasiveness, thus adding them to the brief list of molecules that function in regulating axonal morphology and guidance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generating a molecular null of the <italic>turtle </italic>gene</title><p>In the initial <italic>turtle </italic>gene publication, the exon-intron map provided by the authors indicates that none of the generated deficiencies removes all <italic>turtle </italic>transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

During stages 12 and 13, when neurons begin to project axons, expression was initially restricted to a segmentally repeated cluster of cells surrounding the midline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Later, expression spread throughout the central nervous system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p><p>We also generated RNA probes against sequences that are unique to each isoform.

RNA <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization with GH15753, LD28824, and GH08133 isoforms in wild-type embryos indicated strong, overlapping nervous system expression during stages 13 to 14 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>, arrow). We also observed overlapping expression of LD28824 and GH08133 in certain areas of the gut and salivary glands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>, arrowhead and asterisks, respectively). However, RNA <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization performed against the AT02763 and HL010565 isoforms did not produce a signal above background (data not shown), thus further confirming their low expression levels.</p><p>We were unable to detect fluorescence signal of any isoform in early stage 12 embryos.

Both isoforms are largely expressed in segmentally repeated neurons both near to and distant from the midline, with some minor expression in glia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G-J</xref>).</p><p>In wandering third instar larvae, RNA <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization of imaginal discs and brains showed robust and partially overlapping expression of GH15753, LD28824, and GH08133. In the eye disc, GH15753, LD28824, and GH08133 are expressed within the morphogenetic furrow (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref>, asterisks). However, in the tip of the eye disc, where the optic stalk is located, we observed a cluster of cells that are only GH15753-positive (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref>, arrow). Those cells were surrounded by a group of cells that express only LD28824 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref>, arrowhead).

In 60% of homozygous <italic>tutl</italic><sup><italic>ex383 </italic></sup>embryos, these axons are defasciculated, and some inappropriately project to the midline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). This phenotype is distinct from that of mutations that cause a reduction in midline repulsion, such as <italic>robo </italic>or <italic>slit</italic>. In <italic>robo </italic>mutants, the innermost fascicles remain intact but repeatedly crisscross the midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], while in <italic>tutl</italic><sup><italic>ex383 </italic></sup>embryos the FasII tracks maintain their relative distance from the midline, but axons emanating from all three fascicles bundle together as they cross the midline (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that the observed defects are due to loss of <italic>turtle </italic>function, we performed complementation tests and transgenic rescue. Embryos trans-heterozygous for <italic>tutl</italic><sup><italic>ex383 </italic></sup>and <italic>tutl</italic><sup><italic>01085 </italic></sup>have defects in commissures, longitudinal connectives, and FasII-tracks that are similar to those of <italic>tutl</italic><sup><italic>ex383 </italic></sup>homozygotes. However, these defects occur with a lower frequency and severity than is observed in <italic>tutl</italic><sup><italic>ex383 </italic></sup>embryos (data not shown). Post-mitotic neuronal expression of any of the different <italic>turtle </italic>isoforms in a <italic>tutl</italic><sup><italic>ex383 </italic></sup>background, using either Elav-Gal4 or the midline cell driver singleminded-Gal4 (Sim-Gal4), fully rescues these midline crossing defects (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D, H, I</xref>). Furthermore, transgenic expression using the pan-neuronal Elav-Gal4 driver of the diffusible isoform encoded by the EST clone AT02763 on a <italic>tutl</italic><sup><italic>ex383 </italic></sup>mutant background is sufficient to rescue adult lethality even though this isoform is weakly expressed in the wild type.</p><p>Both Elav-Gal4 and Sim-Gal4 are expressed close to or within the midline. If <italic>turtle </italic>expression near the midline is critical for its axonal midline crossing functions, then its expression in cells that are away from the midline, using Repo-Gal4, should not rescue the mutant phenotype. Indeed, mutant <italic>tutl</italic><sup><italic>ex383 </italic></sup>embryos that transgenically express <italic>turtle </italic>in only Repo-Gal4-positive glia do not show any rescue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E, J</xref>). These results indicate that mutation in the <italic>turtle </italic>gene is indeed responsible for the midline crossing defects and lethality seen in <italic>tutl</italic><sup><italic>ex383 </italic></sup>embryos, and that <italic>turtle </italic>expression close to or within the midline is most important for this function.</p><p>We also performed pan-neuronal overexpression of the different isoforms in a wild-type background using a Sca-Gal4 driver. While no obvious phenotype resulted from overexpression of the membrane-bound isoforms, overexpression of the diffusible isoforms produces FasII-tracks that crisscross the midline in a manner reminiscent of <italic>robo </italic>mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2N</xref>), a phenotype that is typically interpreted as an increase in midline attraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The same phenotype was also produced when the diffusible isoforms were expressed only in the midline cells and not in the FasII-positive axons using Sim-Gal4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O</xref>), which indicates that the secreted <italic>turtle </italic>isoforms can produce their effects on midline axons via a non-cell autonomous mechanism.</p><p>The above results, combined with <italic>turtle </italic>expression near the midline during critical stages of axon development, implicate <italic>turtle </italic>in increasing axonal midline crossing. All isoforms are fully capable of rescuing the axon midline crossing defects in <italic>turtle </italic>mutants. However, the diffusible isoforms are the most potent as they are the only isoforms that induce a gain-of-function phenotype when overexpressed on a wild-type background.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>turtle </italic>promotes midline crossing via a <italic>netrin</italic>- and <italic>slit</italic>-independent mechanism</title><p>Turtle proteins may promote midline attraction by one of three potential mechanisms.

If turtle directly facilitates netrin function, then reducing turtle levels in embryos with no netrin signaling should produce no additional modifications of those embryos' mutant phenotype, since there is no netrin signaling in the first place to be modified.

The integrative capacity of abl is due to its ability to physically link midline guidance cue receptors, such as the netrin receptor fra and the slit receptor robo, to actin cytoskeleton modulators such as ena and trio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The general effect of increased abl signaling on both netrin and slit pathways is to produce an increase in the ability of axons to cross the midline. Genetic null mutations in the <italic>abl </italic>gene alone, such as <italic>abl</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup>, produce only minor midline crossing defects.

Nevertheless, these results do indicate that turtle pathway signaling is integrated with other guidance cue pathways to ultimately produce appropriate midline crossing behavior in growing axons.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>turtle </italic>promotes both motor and retinal axon branching and invasive behavior</title><p>In stage 16 wild-type embryos, the ventral body wall muscles are innervated by an invariant pattern of motor axons coming from ISNb, SNc, and ISNd nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

However, a reduction in the level of abl, a known component of both netrin and slit pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], does enhance <italic>turtle </italic>midline defects.</p><p>Although most of our data suggest that the turtle proteins promote axonal midline crossing, in <italic>turtle </italic>null mutants some FasII-positive tracks do abnormally cross the midline, suggesting that the turtle signal prevents, rather than encourages, midline crossing in some axons. It is possible, therefore, that turtle produces different effects on different axons. Indeed, many guidance cues, such as netrin, have opposite effects on different axons, depending largely, though not entirely, upon which type of netrin receptor complex the axons express [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

Furthermore, as was stated in the results section above, the manner in which FasII-positive tracks in <italic>turtle </italic>null mutants cross the midline is clearly distinct from the midline crossing defects seen in mutations or transgenic manipulations that are known to reduce midline repulsion.</p><p>Our results also indicate that the <italic>turtle </italic>gene encodes signaling molecules that promote axon and neuronal cell body invasiveness and axonal branching, and that these molecules are capable of performing those functions via a non-cell autonomous mechanism.

In contrast, the membrane isoforms are only capable of reducing the severity of some aspects of the <italic>tutl</italic><sup><italic>ex383 </italic></sup>phenotypes. The importance of these diffusible isoforms is further supported by the high degree of homology in the extracellular domains, but not the cytoplasmic domains, of <italic>Turtle</italic>/<italic>Dasm1 </italic>family members.

A PCR reaction was done on genomic DNA isolated from <italic>tutl</italic><sup><italic>ex383 </italic></sup>with one primer of the A series and one primer of the B series (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1B</xref>). Only 1 minute of elongation time per cycle was given to the PCR reaction. Hence, amplification occurred only if the left and right primers were brought within 1 kb of each other as a result of the deficiency. Only the combination A4/B2 gave a product, which was approximately 900 bp long (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1C</xref>). Since those two primers are about 14 kbp away from each other in the wild type, their ability to produce a PCR product demonstrated a deficiency had removed 12 kbp of genomic DNA within the <italic>turtle </italic>locus in <italic>tutl</italic><sup><italic>ex383</italic></sup>. We then subcloned the PCR product and sequenced it. The sequencing result indicates the presence of an 11,430 bp deficiency in <italic>tutl</italic><sup><italic>ex383 </italic></sup>(Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1D</xref>). Such a deficiency is more than enough to effectively remove all the different isoforms of turtle, thereby producing a true null allele of this gene.</p><p>The PCR primer series A and B were designed based on the genomic sequence of the P1 Clone DS00830, and have the following sequences: A1, TAC TTT TGC GGA CAC TCT CTC TGT CC; A2, GCT TTG CTG CCT GAC AAA TAG CAA GG; A3, AGG GAA ARC GAA GCC AAA CCG AAA GG; A4, ATA AGA ATC GGA TGC GAA CCG TCA GC; A5, GCC ATG CGA GTT TTA CTG TTC TAG GC; A6, ATC CAG AGT AAC AGA GTC TAC GAG CC; A7, AAT CTG GCT TCA TAG CGC CTT GCA GC; B1, CCA GTG GAG TAT GGC AAT GAG AAT GG; B2, TTT TTC TGG GTG TGA GTT TGC AGG GG.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR, RNA localization, and protein immunocytochemistry</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from 1 mg stage 12/13 wild-type embryos using a Qiagen RNA Extraction Kit (Quigen #74104 Valencia, CA, USA) and the amount of RNA was measured with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer.
