Deletion of 25 nts from the 3&#x02032;terminus of the 5&#x02032;untranslated region resulted in reduced binding with PTB protein and also showed significant decrease in IRES activity compared to the wild type. We have also demonstrated putative contact points of PTB on the IRF2&#x02013;5&#x02032;UTR using primer extension inhibition assay. Majority of the PTB toe-prints were found to be restricted to the 3&#x02032;end of the IRES. Additionally, Circular Dichroism (CD) spectra analysis suggested change in the conformation of the RNA upon PTB binding. Further, binding studies using S10 extract from HeLa cells, partially silenced for PTB gene expression, resulted in reduced binding by other <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors.

The data validates the predicted MFOLD structure of the 5&#x02032;UTR RNA. To map the putative contact points of the protein on the IRF2 5&#x02032; UTR we have performed primer extension inhibition assay. PTB was found to have multiple contact points on the IRF2 RNA, but mostly at the 3&#x02032;end of the 5&#x02032;UTR. Since many contact points were found on the 3&#x02032; end of the RNA, a deletion mutant was generated, where 25 nt from 3&#x02032;end was deleted. UV cross-linking and competition experiments showed a reduced binding of the purified PTB on the mutant RNA as compared to the wild type RNA. The above data was supported by Circular Dichroism (CD) spectra analysis of the RNA, which also suggested a change in the conformation of IRF2 5&#x02032; UTR in presence of PTB binding. Proteins from whole cell extracts showed that full length IRF2 IRES interacted predominantly with a 57 kDa (PTB) protein, compared to the mutant IRF2. Further PTB silencing experiments showed reduced PTB binding along with significant reduction in binding of other cellular <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. Ribosome binding analysis also indicated that supplementation of purified PTB enhanced the formation of translation initiation complex. This led us to hypothesize that PTB interaction with the IRF2 IRES might trigger a change in the conformation that helps in the recruitment of other hitherto unknown <italic>trans</italic> acting factors and ribosomes, thus facilitating translation initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Probing the secondary structure of the IRF2 IRES</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>DMS modification</title><p>Earlier we have shown that the putative secondary structure of IRF2 5&#x02032;UTR RNA (predicted by using the MFOLD program) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007049-Dhar1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007049-Zuker1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Various IRES <italic>trans</italic> acting factors or ITAFs have been implicated to have role in mediating internal initiation of translation. Polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein (PTB) has been implicated as an important ITAF for a number of viral as well as cellular IRESs. It is believed that PTB has a chaperone like activity that can bring about a change in the conformation of the IRES structure, which might facilitate the interaction of the ribosomes with the RNA leading to efficiently initiate translation.</p><p>In this paper, we have investigated the interaction of PTB with the IRF2-IRES RNA and studied its importance on its translation initiation. Multiple contact points were mapped on the IRF2 IRES RNA. A significant number of those contact points were mapped to the 3&#x02032; end of the IRES element. In fact, Apaf-1 IRES is also known to have two potential PTB binding sites at the 3&#x02032; end region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007049-Mitchell2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This might be a logistic position for PTB binding to facilitate binding of the ribosome in the vicinity of the iAUG, the translation start site. Deletion of 25 nt from the 3&#x02032;end of the IRF2 IRES RNA showed reduced PTB binding. Although, the IRES function was severely impaired, it was not completely abrogated perhaps due to residual PTB binding through other sites within the 5&#x02032;UTR, which might still contribute to IRES function. It is also possible that there is a minor change in the local structure of the mutant RNA due to deletion that has contributed to the decrease in the IRES activity.</p><p>However recent report suggests that the IRES activity might not completely depend on the overall structure but on different sequence modules that play important role in the ITAF recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007049-Baird1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. This was supported by UV crosslinking for Wt and mIRF2 RNA probes in presence of purified PTB and HeLa S10 extracts. As expected mIRF2 showed significantly reduced binding with PTB when compared to wtIRF2. Also, in HeLa S10 extracts, we found that the wt IRF2 RNA showed a stronger binding with the 57 kDa protein as compared to the mIRF2. Interestingly, smaller polypeptides were found to specifically bind to the mIRF2. At this stage we are not sure about the functional significance of the binding of these smaller polypeptides to the mIRF2; however it is tempting to speculate that these proteins might negatively influence the translation initiation in the mIRF2 RNA.</p><p>Nuclease mapping and chemical modifications partly revealed the secondary structure of the IRF2 5&#x02032;UTR, which largely supports the MFOLD prediction. DMS modification interference assay indicated perturbation of the RNA structure in presence of PTB. The presence of PTB masked the RNA, rendering it inaccessible to DMS modifications at certain places. Also, a few new DMS modification sites were found under such condition, suggesting changes in local structure due to protein binding. CD spectroscopic analysis reinforces the idea of change in RNA conformation upon protein binding. In fact when CD experiment was performed with the mutant IRF2 IRES RNA and the PTB protein, change in molar ellipticity was found to be less than that obtained with the wild type RNA. PTB has been shown to have chaperone like activity, thus it would be interesting to study how its interaction with the IRF2 5&#x02032; UTR RNA and consequent change in the RNA conformation helps in ribosome assembly during internal initiation. Also it is possible that such a change in the conformation of the RNA might recruit certain other <italic>trans</italic> acting factors near the vicinity of the translation start site that would facilitate the recruitment of the ribosomes to the RNA and thus facilitating translation initiation. To further consolidate the observation, S10 extract isolated from HeLa cells, partially silenced for PTB expression was used for binding using Wt IRF2 probe. Several cellular <italic>tran-</italic>acting factors were unable to bind Wt IRF2 in reduced presence of PTB. Interestingly, we found that supplementing the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation mix with purified PTB marginally enhanced the formation of the 48S ribosomal initiation complex.</p><p>Thus we hypothesize that PTB serves as an ITAF which recruits other possible <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that could facilitate IRES mode of translation initiation in the IRF2 mRNA. However, at this stage it is not clear how PTB or other IRES <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors (ITAFs) interaction helps in switching on the IRES activity of the cellular IRES elements. It could be a complex interplay of PTB and several other ITAFs. Future experiments would be directed to understand how the ITAFs binding directs the ribosome to land preferentially to the IRES site and translate by internal initiation under stress conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>No, an ethics statement is not required for this work.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>The bicistronic constructs containing respective 5&#x02032;UTR sequences of full length IRF2 (NCBI accession number NM_002199) and 3&#x02032; deletion IRF2 (pR&#x00394;EIRF2F, pR&#x00394;EmIRF2F) were cloned downstream of the landscape of structure derived form the inactive part of &#x00394;EMCV IRES sequence between Renilla luciferase (RLuc) and Firefly luciferase (FLuc) genes, in HindIII and EcoRI sites.
