The incidence rate of this aggressive tumor is increasing and the treatment is ineffective with a poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Recently, gathering of data concerning genomics and proteomics studies of pancreatic cancer showed differential regulation of 2,516 potential biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These include known oncogenes and cell cycle regulators, <italic>e.g.</italic>, the <italic>ras </italic>oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], SMAD4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], epidermal growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], cyclin D1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], CDK4I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], as well as insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, stat-3 and the tyrosine kinase <italic>src </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

WD-repeat proteins usually consist of 4-16 WD-repeats forming an up to eight blade propeller structure creating a stable platform that may form complexes reversibly with several proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Despite of the structural similarity between these members they are a functionally diversified group where all members seem to possess regulatory functions <italic>e.g</italic>. proteins including cell division control proteins, coatomer b subunits, transcription initiation factors, microtube associate proteins, actin interacting proteins, as well as enzymes like protein phosphatase 2A and myosin heavy chain kinase A 3-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. To date, the function of the various protein members have thus been ascribed to crucial regulatory roles in signal transduction, RNA processing, gene expression, trafficking of vesicles, assembly of cytoskeletal components as well as participation in the regulation of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Since several WD-repeat proteins are known to form multiprotein complexes by interacting with other proteins sometimes through their WD-repeat domains, we set forward studies to reveal which function(s) that may be attached to endonuclein by identifying interacting proteins. Consequently, we have expressed recombinant endonuclein in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>and used the purified immobilized protein to affinity purify several endonuclein interacting proteins from a placental tissue extract. A proteomic approach using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and tandem mass sepctrometry (MS/MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] together with a number of proteins assays were used to further characterize the proteins. The nature of the affinity purified proteins confirms that endonuclein may possess regulatory functions. Thus, among the interacting proteins, we have identified, are TIP-1 (a PDZ protein that interacts with the oncogenic HTLV-1 Tax protein), mt-SSB (a transcription factor) and a number of stress related proteins belonging to the molecular chaperones. Thus, we have discovered and characterized a number of putative functions of endonuclein that will be discussed in light of the disclosure of the interacting partners.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to detect endonuclein interacting proteins, we immobilized recombinant endonuclein to a column and prepared a reference column without immobilized endonuclein.

In previous studies endonuclein has been reported to be up-regulated at the transcript level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] as well as at the protein level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] in adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Up-regulation of this protein in cancer may be in line with the fact that endonuclein is identified as a cell cycle regulated protein synthesized at increasing levels and with nuclear focusing during interphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Up-regulation of the protein may promote the cell cycle in line with the observation that yeast cells with a null mutation of the homologous gene (PWP1) grow slowly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. PWP1 is involved in ribosome biosynthesis through its interaction with <italic>trans</italic>-acting ribosome biogenesis factors and with several ribosome protein subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In addition, it has recently been shown that PWP1 associates with the 25S ribosomal DNA chromatin (rDNA), and that PWP1 may play a role in regulation of rDNA transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Furthermore, the recent finding that endonuclein is downregulated during heat stress-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], suggests that indeed this protein is involved in diverse important cellular functions. Since WD-repeat proteins as a rule possess regulatory functions rather than enzymatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], we further explored the functional roles of endonuclein by biochemical analyses with emphasis on the identification and characterization of its interacting proteins.</p><p>Endonuclein interacting proteins (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) may largely be classified into two groups, one that is involved in signal transduction from the cytosol to the nucleus and another that participates in chaperone activities in the ER. These localizations are in line with the previous observation by immunoelectron and laser scanning fluorescence microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] that endonuclein localizes to the nucleus as well as to the cytoplasm in the endoplasmic reticulum indicating that the interactions observed may be of functional significance. The results are summarized in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>. In the cytosol endonuclein may interact with the Tax interaction protein 1, TIP-1. TIP-1 was originally identified as a PDZ domain protein interacting with the C-terminal of Tax, a 40 kDa nuclear phosphoprotein encoded by HTLV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and recent studies have identified TIP-1 as an atypical PDZ protein that functions as a negative regulator of PDZ-based scaffolding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Tax is considered to be oncogenic by <italic>trans</italic>-activating a number of viral and cellular genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], and it has been shown that overexpression of TIP-1 reduced the proliferation and growth of colorectal cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Since Tax is not a DNA binding protein <italic>per se</italic>, it executes its action through the binding of other cellular proteins. However, which specific <italic>trans</italic>-activation pathway that is essential for transformation of cells still remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Interestingly, TIP-1 that contains a PDZ domain has been reported to interact with the C-terminal of rhotekin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Rhotekin was identified as a target protein of the Rho family of small GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. A ternary complex of active Rho with rhotekin and TIP-1 produces a signal in the cytosol that triggers strong activation of the c-fos serum response element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] that also is activated by Tax [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. How the signal from the ternary complex in the cytosol is transferred to the nucleus is unknown. The interaction of endonuclein with TIP-1 could thus have modulatory actions on the Rho signal transduction pathway as well as on the pathway that leads to oncogenesis induced by Tax. Such a modulatory effect on signal transduction pathways is further substantiated by the observation that endonuclein may interact with mt-SSB, a transcription factor for the A&#x003b1; fibrinogen gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. This gene is induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6) which activates two signal transduction pathways; the Janus kinases that phosphorylate a group of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors known as stats and the MAP kinase signaling cascade that activates the C/EBP transcription factors. Upon phosphorylation, stat-3 is translocated to the nucleus and generally binds to the IL-6 response element (IL-6 RE) of the genes that it activates. However, stat-3 does not associate with the IL-6 RE of the fibrinogen promoter. Instead mt-SSB is attached to this site. Upon IL-6 stimulation mt-SSB transiently leaves the site and re-associates again later. The further details of the molecular mechanism whereby IL-6 <italic>trans</italic>-activates the A&#x003b1; fibrinogen gene remains to be investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Endonuclein may thus putatively modulate the signal transduction pathway through its interaction with mt-SSB.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Model of endonuclein functions</bold>. Endonuclein may modulate several signal transduction pathways to the nucleus as well as chaperone activities in the ER. Through interaction with TIP-1, endonuclein may interfere with the Rho signaling pathway and the pathway leading to oncogenesis by Tax. RhoA, rhotekin and TIP-1 may form a ternary complex in the cytosol (indicated with two-way green arrows) that produces a signal in the nucleus increasing c-fos transcription (indicated with one-way green arrows). Tax may<italic> trans</italic>-activate a number of genes, <italic>e.g</italic>. c-fos (red arrows) through interaction with a number of cellular proteins. IL-6 stimulation activates two signaling pathways one involving the Janus kinases (Jaks) and one involving the MAP kinase cascade. The Jaks phosphorylate stat-3, which is then translocated into the nucleus. Usually, stat-3 then binds to the IL-6 response element (IL-6 RE), however, this does not occur at the A&#x003b1; fibrinogen promoter that instead binds the transcription factor P16 (mt-SSB). The IL-6 induced transcription of A&#x003b1; fibrinogen may thus be modulated by interaction of endonuclein with P16. In the ER endonuclein may modulate chaperone activities by interacting with the membrane bound co-chaperone HEJD (DNAJB11) and the chaperone BiP. The significance of the interaction of endonuclein with EIP-8 (SDF2-like protein 1) and PSGs (PSBGs) in the ER is unknown at present. Two-way arrows indicate putative protein-protein interactions. Protein motifs or domains are indicated on the proteins, MIR, RGD, PDB, J, PDZ, SSB and NLS.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-10-34-6"/></fig><p>In the ER, endonuclein may interact with proteins of the molecular chaperones that assist in the folding of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The specific endonuclein interacting proteins identified was BiP that is involved in protein translocation, folding, refolding and degradation of proteins in the ER as well as reverse translocation of proteins from the ER to the cytosol for ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. In presence of ATP, BiP interacts with the J domain of DNAJB11 and may activate the ATPase activity of BiP during its action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Both BiP and DNAJB11 have recently been implied as target genes in the mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Endonuclein may thus through its interaction with DNAJB11 and BiP modulate the chaperone activity in the ER.</p><p>Finally, two other proteins of the ER were observed to interact with endonuclein. PSBGs which are a group of secretory proteins that are abundantly expressed in the placenta during embryonic development and which may have immunomodulatory functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and SDF2-like protein 1 which is a novel protein that contains three MIR domains. The latter motifs are found in three classes of proteins in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], protein <italic>O</italic>-mannosyl-transferases, which catalyzes transfer of mannose from dolichyl activated mannose to seryl or threonyl residues of secretory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] and two classes of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release channel proteins, the ryanodine receptors and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. From these proteins, it is known that the MIR domains in the protein <italic>O</italic>-mannosyl-transferases are essential for its enzymatic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] whereas they are involved in binding of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in the signal transduction pathway that releases Ca<sup>2+ </sup>from intracellular stores. In this respect, it may be of importance that endonuclein can bind two Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ions, each with a<italic> k</italic><sub>D </sub>of approximately 240 &#x003bc;M. Endonuclein thereby possesses the ability of binding Ca<sup>2+ </sup>with the concentrations of free Ca<sup>2+ </sup>that are present in the ER ranging from about 400 &#x003bc;M in resting cells to below 50 &#x003bc;M after Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mobilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. It is thus possible that the physiologic effect of endonuclein in the ER is Ca<sup>2+ </sup>dependent. However, the specific functions of the MIR domains in SDF2-like protein 1 must await further studies, although it may be anticipated that the domains presumably are involved in the binding to endonuclein since SDF2-like protein 1 almost exclusively consists of three MIR domains (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we have found that the nature of the endonuclein interacting proteins confirms a regulatory role for endonuclein, especially with respect to modulation of signal transduction pathways to the nucleus and chaperone activities in the ER. The specific function(s) of endonuclein in these processes will be the focus of future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli</title><p>The coding region (Asn<sup>2</sup>-Ser<sup>501</sup>) of the 2309.2-cDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] was PCR amplified essentially as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>].

Open reading frames (ORFs) were sequenced on both strands. Outside ORFs we performed mainly one strand sequencing.

The PCR fragment was purified by gel electrophoresis cut with enzymes and ligated into the protein expression plasmid pGEX-4T3 so that the coding region of the protein was made as a fusion protein with glutathion-S transferase, GST according to the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). After subcloning, the plasmid was sequenced to insure that no PCR errors were introduced. Sequence identity search was carried out in the publicly available DNA and protein databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, NCBI, using the basic local alignment search tool, BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>].

Briefly, the gel spots were washed with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>/acetonitrile (1:1) followed by dehydration with acetonitrile. The proteins were reduced in 10 mM dithiotreitol (DTT)/50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3 </sub>for 1 hour at 56&#x000b0;C, and alkylated in 55 mM iodoacetamide/50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3 </sub>at room temp.

The proteins were digested overnight with trypsin (Promega, modified trypsin) at 37&#x000b0;C and the resulting peptide mixtures were purified on POROS R2 perfusion chromatography material in purification capillaries. The peptide mixtures were eluted with 50% (v/v) methanol, 5% (v/v) formic acid into the nanospray capillary by centrifugation. Peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was performed using a nano-electrospray system coupled to a prototype QqTOF (QSTAR) mass spectrometer (Sciex, Toronto, Canada). Each peptide mass and the partial amino acid sequence were arranged in peptide sequence tags [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>] and used to search the nrdb database.

In short, surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed on a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). This technology relies on the phenomenon of the surface plasmon resonance that occurs when surface plasmon waves are excited at a metal/liquid interface. Light is directed at, and reflected from, the side of the surface not in contact with sample, and surface plasmon resonance causes a reduction in the reflected light intensity at a specific combination of angle and wavelength. Biomolecular binding events cause changes in the refractive index at the surface layer, which are detected as changes in the surface plasmon resonance signal. In general, the refractive index change is proportional to change in mass concentration at the surface layer.</p><p>Coupling of endonuclein was performed by using the amine coupling method. Briefly, a continuous flow of HBS buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 3.4 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20) passing over the sensor surface of a CM5 sensor chip was maintained at 5 &#x003bc;l/min. The carboxylated dextran matrix of the sensor chip flow cell 1 and 2 was activated by the injection of 60 &#x003bc;l of a solution containing 0.2 M N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 M N-hydroxysuccimide in water. Endonuclein was then at a concentration of 50 &#x003bc;g/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.0 injected over flow cell 2 with a flow rate of 5 &#x003bc;l/min. Totally 60 &#x003bc;l was injected. The remaining binding sites in both flow cells were blocked by injection of 35 &#x003bc;l 1 M ethanolamine pH 8.5. The surface plasmon resonance signal from immobilized endonuclein generated 3302 BIAcore response units (RU) equivalent to 59 fmol endonuclein/mm<sup>2</sup>. Pregnancy specific &#x003b2;-1 glycoprotein was from Advanced Immunochemical, Inc. (CA). Recombinant hamster BiP/Grp78 was from Calbiochem. TIP-1 was made as GST fusion protein as described above.

The BIAcore response is expressed in relative response units (RU), <italic>i.e.</italic>, the difference in response between flow cell with immobilized endonuclein and the control flow channel.

The secondary antibodies were conjugated with Alexa 488 or Alexa 556, all purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen, Denmark). Labelling was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Germany). The high specificity of the endonuclein antibody has previously been demonstrated by western immunoblotting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].
