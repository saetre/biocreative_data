Although it has been shown that certain individual proteins can localize to different classes of synapses, the biochemical composition of specific synapse types is not known. Here, we have used a combination of genetically engineered mice, affinity purification, and mass spectrometry to profile proteins at parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses. We identify approximately 60 candidate postsynaptic proteins that can be classified into 11 functional categories. Proteins involved in phospholipid metabolism and signaling, such as the protein kinase MRCK&#x003b3;, are major unrecognized components of this synapse type. We demonstrate that MRCK&#x003b3; can modulate maturation of dendritic spines in cultured cortical neurons, and that it is localized specifically to parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses in vivo. Our data identify a novel synapse-specific signaling pathway, and provide an approach for detailed investigations of the biochemical complexity of central nervous system synapse types.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The brain is composed of many different types of neurons that form very specific connections: synapses are formed with specific cellular partners and on precise subcellular domains. It has been proposed that different combinations of molecules encode the specificity of neuronal connections, implying the existence of a &#x0201c;molecular synaptic code.&#x0201d; To test this hypothesis, we describe a new experimental strategy that allows systematic identification of the protein composition for individual synapse types. We start with mice that are genetically engineered to facilitate the purification of one type of synapse from a given neuronal population in the central nervous system, the parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapse. The purification is performed using a combination of biochemical fractionation and affinity purification. Subsequent mass spectrometry allows us to identify approximately 60 different proteins present in the resulting sample. We have further analyzed some of the 60 proteins and show that MRCK&#x003b3;, a newly identified kinase, is localized in the dendritic spines where the parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses are formed and that it can modulate the morphogenesis of dendritic spines. The use of this experimental strategy opens up the ability to provide insights into the underlying &#x0201c;molecular code&#x0201d; for the diverse types of synapses in the brain.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>In a first step toward characterizing a putative molecular "synaptic code," a strategy--using genetically modified mice and cell fractionation to purify one class of synapses followed by mass spectrometric protein identification--reveals new proteins at the parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapse.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Selimi F, Cristea IM, Heller E, Chait BT, Heintz N (2009) Proteomic studies of a single CNS synapse type: The parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapse.

Therefore, the formation and function of each type of synapse is controlled by a complex activation of signaling pathways through specific proteins.</p><p>Since the visualization of synapses by electron microscopy, attempts have been made at biochemically purifying them and at identifying their chemical composition, especially for the postsynaptic densities characteristic of excitatory synapses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The use of mass spectrometry (MS) to identify proteins in complex mixtures has greatly improved our ability to unravel the protein composition of organelles. Using this technique, over 1,000 different postsynaptic proteins have been identified in &#x0201c;bulk&#x0201d; postsynaptic density preparations or in affinity-purified receptor complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b011">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. These proteins have a wide range of functions: receptors to neurotransmitters, scaffold proteins, kinases, enzymes, etc. Recently, combining comparative genomics and proteomics, Emes and collaborators &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; have shown that increased behavioral complexity correlates with a phylogenetic expansion of synaptic proteins that are involved in upstream signaling pathways, such as receptors and adhesion molecules. Microarray analysis also showed a very variable regional expression pattern for these upstream synaptic proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, in accordance with previously obtained results for neurotransmitter receptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. The complexity of the synaptic proteome illustrated by these data highlights the need for studies aimed at systematically identifying the protein composition of individual synapse types, and understanding their mechanistic diversity.</p><p>To address this issue, we have developed synaptic protein profiling as an approach to isolate and biochemically characterize specific types of central nervous system (CNS) synapses. We chose to analyze first the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell (PF/PC) synapse in the cerebellum, because of its unique physiological properties and its involvement in neurological disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. We engineered mice to tag and purify specifically PF/PC synapses and, using MS, we have identified 65 proteins located at the PF/PC synapse. This dataset provides clues to PF/PC synapse-specific signaling pathways, as illustrated by our functional analysis of one of these proteins, MRCK&#x003b3;. Our results provide an important example of the biochemical complexity of an individual synapse type, and reveal a new mechanism for the regulation of synaptic function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Purifying the Parallel Fiber/Purkinje Cell Synapse</title><p>To enable purification of PF/PC synapses, we developed a transgenic line that expresses an affinity tag only at the PF/PC synapse. We generated a fusion between the glutamate receptor delta2, GluR&#x003b4;2 (National Center for Biotechnology Information &#x0005b;NCBI&#x0005d;&#x00023; EDK98768), which is specifically localized at the PF/PC postsynaptic density &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, and Venus, a variant of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The resulting fusion protein, VGluR&#x003b4;2, is properly processed and transported to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). To express the fusion specifically in cerebellar Purkinje cells, the VGluR&#x003b4;2 cDNA was then incorporated into a Pcp2 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) by homologous recombination, and the resulting Pcp2/VGluR&#x003b4;2 BAC construct was used to generate transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g001">Figures 1</xref>A and S1). Expression of the fusion polypeptide was detected in the cerebellar extracts of Pcp2/VGluR&#x003b4;2 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated proper assembly of the VGluR&#x003b4;2 fusion with the endogenous GluR&#x003b4;2 receptor subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, the localization of VGluR&#x003b4;2 in the molecular layer and somata of PCs agrees with the synaptic localization of the GluR&#x003b4;2 receptor. In contrast, the enhanced GFP (eGFP) control protein expressed using the same BAC vector (Pcp2/eGFP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gensat.org">http://www.gensat.org</ext-link>) is detected throughout the cell, including marked labeling of both Purkinje cell dendrites and axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). Prior to the affinity-purification step, we sought to produce cerebellar extracts enriched for synaptic structures relative to trafficking complexes, and to maximize the recovery of VGluR&#x003b4;2-tagged postsynaptic densities (PSDs). This was performed by fractionation of a solubilized crude synaptosome fraction (S3) on a gel-filtration column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).

These excitatory synaptic fractions contain essentially all of the PSD95 scaffolding protein. They also contain VGluR&#x003b4;2, which was distributed amongst the different fractions in the same manner as wild-type GluR&#x003b4;2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000083-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). This was also observed using a standard synaptosome purification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000083-sg002">Figure S2</xref>) and shows that the fusion receptor VGluR&#x003b4;2 is targeted to the synapse similarly to the wild-type GluR&#x003b4;2.</p><fig id="pbio-1000083-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Tagging the Parallel Fiber/Purkinje Cell Synapse in Transgenic Mice</title><p>(A) Southern blot was used to identify transgenic mice having integrated the Pcp2 BAC (a Purkinje cell&#x02013;specific driver) containing the Venus-tagged GluR&#x003b4;2 receptor, VGluR&#x003b4;2.

Interestingly, eight of the proteins identified in our study can regulate or be regulated by phospholipid metabolism (Iptr1, synaptojanin 1 and 2, phospholipase B, ABCA12, and MRCK&#x003b3;), or contain phospholipid-binding domains (Plekha7, annexin A6, and MRCK&#x003b3;), and were thus grouped into a previously unrecognized category &#x0201c;phospholipid metabolism and signaling.&#x0201d; This suggests that phospholipid regulation is a major feature of the PF/PC synapse. Another important category present at synapses groups receptors and ion channels: several glutamate receptor subunits and several G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors (GABA-B and BAI receptors) were detected in our analysis of the PF/PC PSD. Interestingly, the extracellular domain of BAI receptors contains thrombospondin repeats, which can mediate cell adhesion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;.

Using our approach, we have prepared a fraction enriched in PF/PC PSDs and identified 65 proteins classified in 11 different functional categories. This dataset provides information on signaling pathways specifically tethered to this synapse, as exemplified by our functional analysis of MRCK&#x003b3;. It also provides information on the variety of proteins that can be part of the code defining the PF/PC synapse.</p><p>Approximately 700 different proteins have been identified in PSD preparations from whole brain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. However, it has been estimated that, given the mass of a single PSD, the copy number of scaffold proteins in a PSD, and an average size of 100 kDa for each synaptic protein, only about 100 different proteins can be expected to be found at one particular type of PSD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. The number of proteins we find in our study is consistent with that estimate. Although our analysis may not have revealed all PF/PC postsynaptic proteins, the successful identification of AMPA receptor subunits in our preparations suggests that any proteins not detected in our sample must be present at low stochiometries in the PSD.</p><p>Synaptic protein profiling can reveal novel sets of proteins that allow formulation of specific hypotheses regarding synaptic function. For example, we discovered MRCK&#x003b3; at PF/PC synapses: this kinase is part of a family that has never been described at synapses. This result was striking since MRCK proteins can respond to small GTPases signaling and have been shown to modulate actin cytoskeleton and cell morphology in nonneuronal systems &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. These characteristics immediately suggest a role for these kinases in spine morphogenesis, which we have now shown for MRCK&#x003b3; using transfection of cultured cortical neurons. Taken together, these data also have implications for the study of neurodevelopmental diseases. Deficiencies in spine length and spine morphology in Purkinje cells have been found in models of mental retardation and Angelman syndrome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Given the link between another small GTPase-dependent kinase, PAK3, and mental retardation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, our results suggest that MRCK&#x003b3; could participate in the signaling pathways involved in mental retardation and autism spectrum disorders.</p><p>Another interesting finding of our study is the presence of a high proportion of proteins involved in phospholipid metabolism and signaling at the PF/PC PSD. A major regulator of the physiology of the PF/PC synapse is the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) which induces phosphatidylinositol-4,5-P2 (PIP2) hydrolysis through activation of phospholipase C &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Our results show the presence of MRCK&#x003b3; and Itpr1 in affinity-purified PF/PC PSDs: these proteins can respond to, respectively, DAG and IP3, which are the metabolites of PIP2 hydrolysis. This further supports the importance of mGluR1 signaling at the PF/PC synapse and extends the number of regulatory pathways potentially activated by mGluR1. Also included in the &#x0201c;phospholipid signaling and metabolism&#x0201d; category in our data are synaptojanin-1 and &#x02212;2, two PIP2-metabolizing enzymes. These enzymes are best known for their regulation of vesicle recycling at synapses, but have also been found by other biochemical studies at PSDs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Phospholipid metabolism is known to be critical for the function of the presynaptic side of the synapse, especially vesicle recycling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. It also plays a role in defining the boundaries of the apical pole and the localization of tight junctions in epithelial cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Our results suggest that phospholipid signaling also participates in regulating the structure and stability of PSDs. Given the fact that lithium is used as a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, and that it might act by modulating phospholipids' metabolism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, our results may be particularly relevant for studies of a variety of human neurological disorders. Indeed, it has been suggested that synaptojanin-1 is involved in the cognitive defects observed in Down syndrome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;, and that PIP2 metabolism may be linked to synaptic dysfunctions in Alzheimer disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The results presented here provide clues to the nature of the &#x0201c;synaptic code&#x0201d; and the types of molecules that may be critical in definition of specific synapse types. As expected from previous studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;, we find proteins with classical adhesion domains such as Neph1 and the receptor tyrosine phosphatase RPTPmu. SYG1, the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> homolog of Neph1, has been shown to define synapse location in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;, and may play a similar role for the PF/PC synapse. Receptor tyrosine phosphatases play important roles in axon guidance, and have also been shown to control synapse formation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. We also find proteins at the PF/PC synapse with as yet unknown functions in synaptogenesis, such as the BAI receptors or GABA-B receptors. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the GABA-B receptor 1 contains a CCP module in its extracellular domain. This module is also found in proteins of the complement cascade, which have recently been shown to be involved in synapse development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. These proteins, and the majority of the remaining proteins identified in this study, are specifically expressed in Purkinje cells within the cerebellum (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>). Since cerebellar granule cells also receive excitatory inputs from mossy fibers, we can conclude that, even within the cerebellum, the synaptic codes for specific synapse types must be quite distinct. This supports the results of expression analysis of proteins identified in bulk synapse preparations showing that receptors and other upstream signaling molecules have a highly variable expression pattern in the vertebrate brain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000083-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Taken together, these data indicate that very different sets of molecules must define different excitatory synapse types.</p><p>Although our approach employed the expression of a fusion of GluR&#x003b4;2 with EGFP in a specific cell type, this basic approach can readily be adapted to characterize a wide variety of synapse types, given the wide range of affinity tags that are now available and the hundreds of BAC vectors that can be used to target expression to specific neurons (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gensat.org">http://www.gensat.org</ext-link>).
