Recently, we have described that this fat (TAT) produces angiogenic factors and induces human endothelial cell proliferation and migration, indicating its potential angiogenic properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>Adult thymus fat and subcutaneous adipose tissue specimens were obtained from 28 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, making this tissue readily available as a prime source of adipose tissue. We focused our investigation on determining VEGF gene expression and characterizing the different genes, mediators of inflammation and adipogenesis, and which are known to play a relevant role in angiogenesis regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that VEGF-A was the isoform most expressed in TAT. This expression was accompanied by an upregulation of HIF-1&#x003b1;, COX-2 and HO-1 proteins, and by increased HIF-1 DNA binding activity, compared to SAT. Furthermore, we observed that TAT contains a high percentage of mature adipocytes, 0.25&#x00025; of macrophage cells, 15&#x00025; of endothelial cells and a very low percentage of thymocyte cells, suggesting the cellular variability of TAT, which could explain the differences in gene expression observed in TAT. Subsequently, we showed that the expression of genes known as adipogenic mediators, including PPAR&#x003b3;1/&#x003b3;2, FABP-4 and adiponectin was similar in both TAT and SAT. Moreover the expression of these latter genes presented a significantly positive correlation with VEGF, suggesting the potential association between VEGF and the generation of adipose tissue in adult thymus.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we suggest that this fat has a potential angiogenic function related to ongoing adipogenesis, which substitutes immune functions within the adult thymus. The expression of VEGF seems to be associated with COX-2, HO-1 and adipogenesis related genes, suggesting the importance that this new fat has acquired in research in relation to adipogenesis and angiogenesis.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It has been shown that the thymus grows rapidly during embryonic life and during childhood, reaching its maximum absolute size in puberty; thereafter growth ceases and involutes gradually until old age, when the gland is often smaller than at birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Hale1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This age involution is shown by a decrease in the overall weight of the organ, associated lymphoid tissue atrophy and replacement by mature adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Hale1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. For this reason, all the studies carried out on adult thymus involution have been focused primarily on the immunological aspect, but has never been considered interesting enough to be studied as a potential source of humoral and angiogenic factors. Part of this tissue is discarded in aortic cannulation procedures of the ascending aorta in cardiovascular surgery in patients in need of a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), making this tissue a readily available prime source of adipose tissue.</p><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the first member of angiogenic factors to be cloned and remains today the best-characterized angiogenic growth factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Ferrara1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. VEGF was first described as a vascular permeability factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Dvorak1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> but has also been recognized as being a potent stimulator of endothelial proliferation and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Wang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Gene targeting studies have demonstrated the critical importance of VEGF for both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Ferrara2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been demonstrated that white adipose tissue produces and secretes many different types of proangiogenic factors, such as VEGF-A and VEGF-B, the two key angiogenic factors produced by adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Saiki1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Other adipose-tissue derived factors with pro-angiogenic properties are VEGF-C and VEGF-D, which have been found to be important in the proper formation and maintenance of the lymphatic network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Asano1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. As a result, VEGF has been used in numerous preclinical and early clinical gene or protein therapy trials with varying degrees of success <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Sosman1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have recently found that thymus fat produces a variety of angiogenic factors such as Angiopoietin (Ang), Tie2, VEGF, VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2. Furthermore, human umbilical cord endothelial cells cultured in the presence of thymus fat extract displayed enhanced proliferative and migratory responses, which are two relevant steps in angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Salas1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings lead us to believe that TAT is an interesting source of angiogenic factors which may, in the future, have a relevant role in promoting angiogenesis and tissue repair. To complete our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Salas1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, we performed a comparative evaluation of VEGF expression in human thymus (TAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissues. As angiogenic regulation is usually associated with inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms involving cyclooxygenase-2, heme oxygenase-1 and hypoxia-induced factor-1 transcription factors, we tested the hypothesis that VEGF expression could correlate with these markers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients and Adipose Tissue Collection</title><p>This study was approved by the local ethical committee of Hospital Carlos Haya, and signed informed consent was obtained from all participating patients by the Spanish Society of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (SECTCV).

Adult thymus specimens were obtained from cardiomyopathy ischemic patients undergoing cardiac surgery, due to the fact that part of this tissue is discarded in aortic cannulation procedures of the ascending aorta in cardiovascular surgery for patients in need of a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). However, until now, no studies have been carried out that consider thymus fat as a potential source of humoral and angiogenic factors, that could help in heart neovascularization after a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Our idea is that thymus fat tissue and derived cells could serve as an angiogenic source which could help in the regeneration of new vessels in the ischemic myocardium. This hypothesis should be rigorously analyzed by studying the expression of the different angiogenic factors and especially those which are known to play relevant roles in angiogenesis and the generation of new vessels, and the molecular mechanisms that could have a crucial role in angiogenesis regulation in TAT. Here we present a preliminary and observational study which reveals the activation of a variety of genes and proteins generally known to be involved in inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes and also in the regulation of angiogenic factors, especially the VEGF. Recently, we showed that thymus AT contains significant levels of a variety of angiogenic factors. Furthermore, developing cell migration and proliferation assays in which umbilical cord endothelial cells were evaluated for their ability to migrate and to proliferate, we observed an increase in proliferative and migratory activities in the presence of thymus extract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Salas1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, which are two relevant steps in angiogenesis, suggesting the angiogenic capacity of TAT. In the present work we observed that TAT expresses high levels of adipogenesis mediated genes, suggesting the generation of new adipose tissue in the thymus gland at old age. The expression of these adipogenic genes and those regulators of inflammation correlate positively with VEGF, suggesting the possible implication of these genes in VEGF regulation.</p><p>It is well known that over-expression of VEGF- A and VEGF- B has been associated with increased angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Zhang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, while VEGF-C and VEGF-D are lymphangiogenic factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Asano2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, evaluating the expression of VEGF isoforms, we found that TAT seems to have both angiogenic and lymphangiogenic properties, while SAT seems to be especially an angiogenic source, because VEGF-C expression was mostly detected in TAT. This VEGF-C positive staining suggests that the expression of this VEGF isoform could be related to the stromal lymphopoietin activity of Hassall's corpuscles that could conserve thymus AT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Chinen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, here we could clearly appreciate the presence of these corpuscles after immunohistochemistry staining (data not shown), but we also observed that TAT showed a structure characterized by unilocular adipocytic cells such as subcutaneous adipose tissue. The next proposal of our study was to analyze whether VEGF expression could be accompanied by COX-2, a protein relevant in regulating pro-inflammatory processes, and HO-1, one of the most potent cytoprotector proteins, which have been demonstrated to play a relevant role in VEGF regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Siner1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, works have shown that COX-2 promotes angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Cao1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, and up-regulates VEGF expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Jung1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Others have shown that HO-1 mediates VEGF stimulated angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Fernandez1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we found that in the two AT's, a significant expression of COX-2 and HO-1 was detected, especially in TAT, suggesting that TAT displays the activation of both inflammatory and cytoprotective processes. Also the strong positive correlation of COX-2 and HO-1 with VEGF expression could suggest the potential relationship between these three proteins in TAT. These data have to be confirmed in future experiments, where signaling pathways should be well defined.</p><p>If we want to demonstrate that TAT is a white adipose tissue we have to define the different cell populations that constitute this tissue in order to determine whether we are studying a tissue that is 100&#x00025; adipose or if it conserves its thymopoietic characteristics. For this end, we performed a cytometric analysis to characterize the different cell populations that constitutes TAT. As expected, TAT has a similar cellular profile as another white adipose tissue; in fact it contains a large amount of pre-adipocytes and adipocytes, a percentage of 15&#x00025; of endothelial cells and 0.25&#x00025; of macrophages. However and as expected, we could barely observe thymocytes either by cytometric analysis or by immunohistochemistry. Also, immunohistochemistry analysis showed a similar cellular structure as that observed in any other white adipose tissue. These data suggest that instead of talking about the degeneration of the thymic gland we should talk about the generation of new adipose tissue which replaces the generation of thymocytes. Also, the profile of gene expressions observed above could be the results of the presence of a variety of cell type in TAT. We believe that in the near future new experiments should be done in order to ascertain whether VEGF, COX-2 and HO-1 expressions are exclusive to adipocytes or other cells as macrophages and endothelial cells are involved in this genetic profile observed in whole TAT.</p><p>On the other hand, here we show that thymus tissues degeneration at old age is rather a substitution of thymocytes by adipocytes, indicating the presence of neo-generation mechanisms of new adipose tissue which is adipose tissue. In fact the analysis of the expression of a variety of genes known to be relevant mediators of adipogenesis and lipogenesis (PPAR&#x003b3;, adiponectin and FABP-4)(10,20&#x02013;22), showed that both PPAR&#x003b3;1 and &#x003b3;2 are expressed in both AT's. PPAR&#x003b3;2 is especially expressed in fat while PPAR&#x003b3;1 is expressed in fat and other tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Spiegelman1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent works have demonstrated that PPAR&#x003b3;2 has a high adipogenic activity in adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Tontonoz1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Rosen1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, adiponectin and FABP-4, two relevant adipogenesis mediators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Urs1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Yuchang1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, showed similar expression levels in TAT compared to those observed in SAT. Taken together, all these data show for the first time that TAT has adipocytic properties like other AT's. Furthermore, positive correlations were observed between PPAR&#x003b3;2, adiponectin, and FABP-4 expressions and VEGF-A and VEGF-B gene expressions, suggesting that the expression of these angiogenesis-related genes observed in this study could be largely localized in adipocytes than in other cell types such as macrophage or endothelial cells. Future experiments should be carried out to confirm this hypothesis, by separating the different cell types that constitute TAT and analyzing the expression of these genes in each one. Here we anticipate that both macrophages and adipocytes seem to have a potential role in the observed VEGF expressions, because strong positive correlations are also found between adipogenesis markers (PPARg2, adiponectin and FABP-4) and VEGF gene expression &#x0005b;r(PPARg2,VEGF-B)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.78&#x0002a;, r(FABP-4,VEGF-B)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.45&#x0002a;&#x0002a;, r(adiponectin,VEGF-A)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.61&#x0002a;&#x0002a;, &#x0002a;&#x0002a;p&#x0003c;0.01 and &#x0002a;p&#x0003c;0.05)&#x0005d;.

On the other hand, we found a significant positive correlation between HIF-1&#x003b1; and COX-2 &#x0005b;<bold><italic>r</italic></bold><sub>(COX-2, HIF-1)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.54, p&#x0003c;0.05) in TAT, suggesting the potential relationship between these two proteins in TAT. In conclusion, the fact that VEGF showed a positive correlation between both COX-2 and HIF-1 could lead us to believe that these two proteins may have a potential role in regulating VEGF, since in some white adipose tissues many authors have explained that VEGF activation implicates COX-2 gene expression activation through HIF-1&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Solban1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, because it has been observed that the COX-2 gene is directly transcriptionally activated in response to hypoxia by HIF-1 binding to a functional HRE within the proximal COX-2 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Csiki1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, and that COX-2 over-expression stimulates the expression of HIF-1, which in turn induces continued COX-2 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Fukuda1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here we can conclude that adult thymus fat is an interesting source of angiogenic factors, which was previously unappreciated. Most studies have shown that the thymus loses its function during old age. With the data presented in this work we should say that the thymus replaces its immune function by another which is that of an ordinary white adipose tissue.</p><p>Moreover, it is evident that thymus fat presents a similar cellular profile as that observed in other white adipose tissues such as SAT. This cellular variety seems to be responsible for the observed differences in the expression of a variety of genes that are known to be relevant in the regulation of angiogenesis and adipogenesis in other white adipose tissues.</p><p>VEGF gene expression seems to be related to both adipocytes and macrophages, since the markers of these two cell types show a significant and strong correlation with VEGF gene expression in TAT. Also, this VEGF expression appears to be also associated with COX-2 and HIF-1 expression and activation in TAT. Our future objective is to well define the molecular mechanisms mediated by these proteins that could play a crucial role in VEGF regulation, in whole thymus adipose tissue and separately in each cell population.</p><p>One may wonder why use this thymus fat as a source of angiogenesis having access to other body fats such as subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues. Firstly, as we mentioned previously, part of this fat is discarded during CBP surgery, and the results obtained in this and previous works <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Salas1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> indicate that this tissue deserves to be studied in depth in order to investigate its potential usefulness as an adipose tissue. Furthermore, there are no adverse effects of removing this fat, because in our clinical experience these procedures had no surgical complications or morbidity associated. On the other hand, the largest source of thymus adipose tissue are ischemic patients, because part of this tissue used to be discarded in aortic cannulation procedures of the ascending aorta in cardiovascular surgery in patients in need of a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and this is a procedure frequently used by cardiac surgeons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Rathore1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Pacifico1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the studies done on thymus fat and thymus function are based in the vast majority in excising and removing thymus fat during cardiac interventions, which shows how often this practice is carried out, and its safety. Moreover, we are of the opinion that this fat could, in the future, provide much needed help in heart neovascularization after a cardiopulmonary bypass interventions (CPB), especially for patients who cannot benefit from coronary revascularization treatment after surgery or angioplasty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008213-Mukherjee1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008213.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Clinicopathological characteristics and biomarker parameters in Ischemic Cardiomyopathy patients.
