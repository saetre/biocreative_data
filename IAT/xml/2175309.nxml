Here, we identify a novel paternally expressed variant of the <italic>Inpp5f</italic> gene (<italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic>) that shows a number of unusual features. <italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic> initiates from a CpG-rich repeat region adjoining two B1 elements, despite previous reports that SINEs are generally excluded from imprinted promoters. Accordingly, we find that the <italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic> promoter acquires methylation around the time of implantation, when many repeat families undergo <italic>de novo</italic> epigenetic silencing. Methylation is then lost specifically on the paternally derived allele during the latter stages of embryonic development, resulting in imprinted transcriptional activation on the demethylated allele. Methylation analyses in embryos lacking maternal methylation imprints suggest that the primary imprinting mark resides within an intronic CpG island &#x0223c;1 kb downstream of the <italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic> transcriptional start site. These data support the hypothesis that SINEs can influence gene expression by attracting <italic>de novo</italic> methylation during development, a property likely to explain their exclusion from other imprinted promoters.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Genomic imprinting in mammals results in a small number of genes being silenced on one allele, depending on the gender of the parent from which the allele is inherited. Imprinted genes typically occur in clusters, in regions of the genome containing allele-specific DNA methylation marks which are established in the germ line. These germ-line methylation imprints can subsequently act after fertilization to establish allele-specific epigenetic asymmetry at the promoters of adjacent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in members of the <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferase gene family lead to disruptions in imprinted gene expression and to retrotransposon animation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), suggesting that the two processes are controlled by a common mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). <italic>Dnmt3l</italic> encodes a regulatory protein that stimulates <italic>de novo</italic> methylation by <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3b</italic>, but lacks the catalytic motifs necessary for methyltransferase activity. Male mice lacking functional copies of the <italic>Dnmt3l</italic> gene are sterile due to meiotic arrest, which is associated with the upregulation of endogenous retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Females carrying null mutations in the <italic>Dnmt3l</italic> gene fail to establish imprinted methylation marks during oogenesis, but show no obvious effects on retrotransposon activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>There is evidence to suggest that at least five known imprinted domains originated from retrotransposition events that generated novel genes during mammalian evolution. The imprinted <italic>Peg10</italic> gene is essential for placental development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), and is derived from a sushi-ichi-type LTR retrotransposon that originated in a common ancestor of placental mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). We recently reported the identification of a group of four retrotransposed gene copies (retrogenes), each of which originated from X-linked source genes and generated elements that form germ-line differentially methylated regions (gDMRs) in the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Parent-of-origin effects on DNA methylation have also been extensively studied at the <italic>agouti</italic> locus, where stochastic methylation at an IAP insertion generates coat colour variegation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Two independent studies have reported that short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) repeats are significantly underrepresented at imprinted promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). It has been suggested that this may reflect selection against insertions within imprinted regions due to the ability of SINEs to disrupt local methylation patterns. Imprinted genes would be particularly susceptible to this epigenetic disruption due to their dependence on allele-specific CpG methylation for normal expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). However, detailed developmental methylation analyses in the region of individual SINE repeats have not been reported.</p><p>Here, we identify a novel imprinted transcript variant of the murine <italic>Inpp5f</italic> gene (<italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic>) which initiates from a CpG-rich region adjacent to inverted B1 SINE repeats. The promoter is situated 1 kb upstream from an imprinted and retrotransposed copy of the X-linked gene, <italic>Tmem1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"><italic>14</italic></xref><italic>a</italic>. Both imprinted transcripts are expressed only from paternally derived alleles. A developmental analysis of CpG methylation at the two imprinted promoters suggests that the CpG island associated with the X-derived retrogene carries the primary imprint mark at the locus. The upstream repeat region undergoes <italic>de novo</italic> methylation at around the time of implantation, before undergoing demethylation specifically on the paternal allele during the latter stages of embryonic development. Allele-specific demethylation is a common feature of genomic imprinting in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), but has not, to our knowledge, previously been reported in mammals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Tissue sources</title><p>To obtain oocytes and morulae, 4-week-old C57BL/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>J (B6) females were superovulated using procedures described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). For oocyte collection, ovaries were dissected and cumulus clumps were flushed into hyaluronidase solution (300 &#x003bc;g/ml; Sigma Cat No. H4272) and left for 10 min at room temperature. To remove cumulus cells, oocytes were passed through a series of 100 &#x003bc;l drops of PBS in a glass Petri dish using a fine bore Pasteur pipette, and then collected in aliquots of 50 in 10 &#x000b5;l TE buffer. Morulae were obtained from females at embryonic day (E)3.5, and collected in aliquots of eight. Over 90% were at the 16 cell stage. E8.5 embryos were collected in pools of five for RNA purification, and individually for the isolation of genomic DNA. Embryos and tissues collected at later stages were not pooled.</p><p>The <italic>Dnmt3l</italic> mutant allele was generated on a 129/SvJ background. E8.5 embryos were obtained from crosses of <italic>Dnmt3l</italic> homozygous null mothers and wild-type (wt) cast fathers as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The <italic>Dnmt1</italic> mutant allele was generated on a 129/SvJ background, and homozygous mutant, heterozygous mutant and wt E8.5 embryos were generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Neonatal brains from mice carrying uniparental duplications for Chromosome 7 [proximal to the T65H breakpoint; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>)] were generated as described (Beechey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004).

RT-PCR was conducted using Reddymix PCR mix (Abgene), under the following cycling conditions: 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min, followed by <italic>n</italic> cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 55&#x000b0;C for 30 s and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min.

In every case, control reactions were performed using cDNA prepared in the absence of reverse transcriptase, to eliminate the possibility of genomic DNA contamination. RT-PCR primer sequences are listed in Table S1. For the allele-specific RT-PCR sequencing assays, PCR products were purified using the ExoSapIT reagent (USB) and sequenced using standard ABI sequencing technology (Bigdye v3.1, Applied Biosystems). RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends)-ready cDNA was generated using the SMART RACE cDNA kit (Clontech Cat.

Sodium metabisulphite measuring 2.1 g was dissolved in 2.5 ml of H<sub>2</sub>O, 7<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref> &#x000b5;l of 2 M NaOH and 350 &#x000b5;l of 0.1 M hydroquinone prior to heating at 37&#x000b0;C for 20 min. Four hundred microlitres of this solution was added to the denatured DNA and the mixture was overlaid with 100 &#x000b5;l light mineral oil. Tubes were incubated in the dark for 5 h at 55&#x000b0;C and mineral oil was removed by serial transfer through eppendorf tubes. DNA was purified using the QiaEX II kit (Qiagen Cat No. 20021) and care was taken to shield the bisulphite-treated DNA from the light. DNA was recovered in 20 &#x000b5;l H<sub>2</sub>O, and desulphonated by the addition of 3.5 &#x000b5;l NaOH (0.3 M final concentration) followed by incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 15 min.

Two percent LMP agarose was melted in a 65&#x000b0;C water bath, and added to the oocytes/embryos at a final concentration of 1.6%. The tubes were flicked to mix the contents and spun briefly in a benchtop centrifuge. Tubes were placed on ice for 5 min to solidify the agarose, which was overlaid with 100 &#x000b5;l of cold mineral oil. Four hundred microlitres of this solution (10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.6, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) was added, and 4 &#x000b5;l proteinase K (100 mg/ml, Sigma), prior to incubation for 15 h at 50&#x000b0;C. Tubes were placed on ice to resolidify the agarose and then the lysis buffer and mineral oil were removed. Agarose beads were washed for 3 &#x000d7; 15 min in TE buffer, 2 &#x000d7; 15 min in 0.3 M NaOH then finally 1 &#x000d7; 15 min in 0.1 M NaOH. Sodium metabisulphite/hydroquinone solution was prepared as described above and added to the agarose beads, and the mixture was overlaid with mineral oil. After incubation in the dark at 55&#x000b0;C for 5 h, solutions were removed and the beads were washed for 5 &#x000d7; 15 min in TE buffer. After the last wash, DNA was desulphonated by adding 500 &#x000b5;l 0.2 M NaOH and incubating at 37&#x000b0;C for 15 min. NaOH was then neutralized by adding 100 &#x000b5;l 1 M HCl and leaving to stand for 5 min. Beads were finally washed for 2 &#x000d7; 10 min in H<sub>2</sub>O and all liquid was removed. The dry beads were heated at 70&#x000b0;C for 5 min and flicked gently to mix, then at 80&#x000b0;C for a further 5 min or until the agarose had melted completely. Agarose from each bead was split into two separate tubes, and used directly as a template for the subsequent PCR step. Regions 1 and 2 were amplified in nested PCR reactions, in which 2 &#x003bc;l of the first round reaction were carried forward to the second round. Cycling conditions were identical for each round of amplification: 95&#x000b0;C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 55&#x000b0;C for 30 s and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min. Bisulphite PCR primers were designed to be specific for the same strand from which transcription occurs, and are listed in Table S2.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA sequence analysis</title><p>CpG islands were defined according to the criteria proposed by Gardiner-Garden and Frommer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) :&#x0003e;200bp, &#x0003e; 50% C + G and an observed/expected ratio of CpG dinucleotides of &#x0003e; 0.6 when compared to the total proportion of G + C in the same DNA segment.

For allele-specific RT-PCR sequencing assays, the relative height of the sequence trace corresponding to each parental allele of a SNP gives an indication of the relative contribution of maternally and paternally derived alleles to the total transcript pool. For the analysis of bisulphite PCR data, strands with thymine nucleotides at positions occupied by cytosine in unconverted DNA were presumed to have been unmethylated prior to bisulphite conversion. Cytosines in CpG dinucleotides that were unconverted following treatment were presumed to have originally been methylated. Where F1 hybrid DNA was used, the parental origin of each strand was determined from a SNP within the PCR product.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>The <italic>Inpp5f</italic> transcription unit</title><p>Recent evidence suggests that a number of mammalian imprinted domains were formed by the retrotransposition of X-linked genes into autosomal regions, generating sequences that undergo methylation in the maternal germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In order to gain insights into the regulation of imprinting at this class of imprinted domain, we chose to study the murine <italic>Inpp5f_v2</italic> locus, searching for additional imprinted transcripts and putative regulatory elements. <italic>Inpp5f_v2</italic> is a paternally expressed transcript variant of the murine <italic>Inpp5f</italic> gene and is transcribed at high levels in the developing nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The unique first exon of the imprinted isoform contains a retrotransposed ORF originating from the X-linked <italic>Tmem114a</italic> gene, which is spliced onto five downstream exons of the non-imprinted <italic>Inpp5f</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). A CpG island overlapping the retrotransposed sequence undergoes sexually dimorphic patterns of DNA methylation during gametogenesis, with maternal allele-specific methylation established during oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). EST evidence suggests the presence of an additional promoter &#x0223c;1 kb upstream of <italic>Inpp5f_v2</italic>, generating a transcript variant of <italic>Inpp5f</italic> that has not previously been described (<italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic>). RT-PCR assays demonstrate that <italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic> contains a unique first exon which, like the first exon of <italic>Inpp5f_v2</italic>, is spliced onto the five downstream exons of <italic>Inpp5f</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The unique first exon of <italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic> lacks putative translational start codons. However, a number of in-frame start codons occur within the five exons that are shared with <italic>Inpp5f</italic>, potentially giving rise to C-terminal <italic>Inpp5f</italic> polypeptides. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Genomic and transcriptional organization at the <italic>Inpp5f</italic> locus.

A detailed methylation analysis of this region revealed that the allele-specific markings, which are established during gametogenesis, are maintained throughout embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, embryos derived from <italic>Dnmt3l<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mothers showed activation of the normally silent maternally derived allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). These observations suggest that the CpG island with homology to the X chromosome is integral to the imprinting mechanism at this locus.</p><p>Despite also undergoing differential methylation during gametogenesis, the <italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic> promoter undergoes <italic>de novo</italic> methylation on the paternally derived allele between E3.5 and E8.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B and C). The genome undergoes extensive epigenetic reprogramming during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), including the acquisition of methylation at Alu elements in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Murine B1 repeats are homologous to primate Alu elements; both families originated from 7SL, the RNA component of the signal recognition particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Thus, the inverted B1 elements situated &#x0003c;100 bp upstream of the CpG-rich repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A) may attract methylation to the surrounding region at the implantation stage. A similar B1 repeat upstream of the murine <italic>Aprt</italic> gene is capable of attracting <italic>de novo</italic> methylation to surrounding sequences in a cell culture system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>The activation of <italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic> in <italic>Dnmt1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> embryos shows that maintenance DNA methylation is required for <italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic> silencing <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). The proximity of the promoter region to tandem B1 elements suggests that the SINEs may contribute to the developmental expression profile of this gene. This provides an attractive explanation for the paucity of murine B1 and primate Alu elements found in the vicinity of imprinted promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Appropriate DNA methylation at imprinted loci is essential for embryonic viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), but may be disrupted by SINE insertions with potentially deleterious consequences. In this regard, <italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic> can be viewed as exceptional. Here, the epigenetic regulation of the repeat-rich sequences may be utilized by the host organism to achieve the appropriate developmental expression pattern for <italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic>. Alternatively, the imprinting and tissue-specific expression of <italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic> may serve no intrinsic function but may occur as a downstream consequence of paternal-allele-specific <italic>Inpp5f_v2</italic> expression, which is highest in neural tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>Despite biallelic hypermethylation at E8.5, the paternal <italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic> promoter subsequently loses methylation and is expressed while the maternal allele remains hypermethylated and silent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D). Demethylation is more pronounced in the brain than in non-expressing heart tissue, suggesting a model in which active chromatin &#x02018;spreads&#x02019; from the <italic>Inpp5f_v2</italic> promoter region which is active primarily in neural tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). This could occur due to the binding of transcription factors, which is known to cause demethylation of local sequences in dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). To our knowledge, <italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic> is the first example in mammals of an imprinted gene that undergoes allele-specific demethylation during somatic development.</p><p>The ORF of <italic>Inpp5f_v2</italic> is one of a group of at least four imprinted retrogenes that originated from X-linked source genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The data presented here show that the promoter region exhibits the epigenetic characteristics of an ICR, which could control the imprinting of both the <italic>Inpp5f_v2</italic> and <italic>Inpp5f_v3</italic> transcripts. <italic>U2a1-rs1</italic> and <italic>Mcts2</italic>, two other X-to-autosome retrogenes, also physically overlap gDMRs that are likely to control the imprinting of adjacent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). We have recently identified additional imprinted transcripts at the fourth locus: <italic>Nap1l5</italic> (Wood <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished data). Thus, all of the four known gDMRs that overlap X-to-autosome retrogenes are associated with multiple imprinted transcripts. These observations, combined with recent findings at the <italic>Peg10</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), suggest that the (retro)transposition of elements from the X chromosome is one mechanism by which mammalian imprinted domains were generated during evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm742_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm742_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm742_2.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkm742_nar-01440-x-2007-File010.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Colin Beechey for providing tissues from mice carrying uniparental partial disomies proximal to the T65H translocation (UpDp7), Ben Woodman and Michelle Lupton for the collection of embryos and Reiner Schulz and Ruth McCole for critical reading of the manuscript.
