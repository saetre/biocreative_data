In metaphase, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome&#x02013;dependent destruction of cyclin B1 inactivates Cdk1 again, allowing mitotic exit and cell division. Several models describe Cdk1 activation kinetics in mitosis, but experimental data on how the activation proceeds in mitotic cells have largely been lacking. We use a novel approach to determine the temporal development of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity in single cells. By quantifying both dephosphorylation of Cdk1 and phosphorylation of the Cdk1 target anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome 3, we disclose how cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 continues to be activated after centrosome separation. Importantly, we discovered that cytoplasmic cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity can be maintained even when cyclin B1 translocates to the nucleus in prophase. These experimental data are fitted into a model describing cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activation in human cells, revealing a striking resemblance to a bistable circuit. In line with the observed kinetics, cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 levels required to enter mitosis are lower than the amount of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 needed for mitotic progression. We propose that gradually increasing cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity after centrosome separation is critical to coordinate mitotic progression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>When active, the enzyme cyclin B1&#x02013;cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) commits a growing cell to the process of mitotic cell division and chromosome separation. Cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activation is controlled in many ways, but once its activity rises above a certain level, further activation of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 is catalyzed by a positive-feedback loop. This generates highly active cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 and triggers the start of mitosis, which can only be completed when cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity is properly shut off again. However, it is not clear how cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity develops in human cells or how the switch between its inactive and active states is controlled. Our work combines activation measurements with a kinetic model to study how cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity accumulates just before and during mitosis. We show that cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity develops gradually in early mitosis and that different activity levels are required for initiation of, and progression through, mitosis. We also demonstrate that once cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activation is truly launched, it is bound to continue and will not lightly drop back again. We propose that the successive cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity levels by themselves may coordinate the progression through the distinct phases of mitosis.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The gradual increase of cyclin B1-Cdk1 activation in human cells is proposed to be critical for the progression of mitosis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Lindqvist A, van Zon W, Karlsson Rosenthal C, Wolthuis RMF (2007) Cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activation continues after centrosome separation to control mitotic progression.

Some models suggest a limit cycle behavior, in which the levels of Cdk activity will never be stable but oscillate between an inactive and an active state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Other models describe a bistable system, in which thresholds for activation and inactivation differ and Cdk1 is either inactive, active, or approaching one of these stable states &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b031">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. One of the differences between these systems is that, in a bistable system, once a threshold level of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 complexes is reached and activation has proceeded, cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 will not be inactivated even though the cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 levels are reduced to levels below the activation threshold. This feature of a bistable system is referred to as hysteresis. A commitment of cells to start and complete mitosis once they have activated cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1, is strikingly reminiscent of certain features of bistability. Various models and some experimental data indeed point to bistability governing mitotic Cdk1 activation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b034">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). It has also been argued, however, that the experimental set-ups used so far may have created an artificial bistable system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, recently, Csikasz-Nagy and coworkers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d; suggested that both bistability and limit cycle oscillations occur, depending on the cellular context.</p><p>Although it is clear that cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 is mostly inactive in G2 and highly active in mitosis, methods to follow the development of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity during the rapidly successive mitotic stages have been lacking. As a result, experimental data of Cdk1 activation kinetics in human cells are very limited. Such data could, for instance, reveal whether cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activation, once initiated, is sufficiently robust to drive mitotic progression even in the cytoplasm, when a large fraction of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 translocates to the nucleus in prophase. This would be indicative of a bistable Cdk1 activation response and further indicate that precise regulation of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity could control mitotic events per se.</p><p>We use novel assays to determine how cytoplasmic cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activation proceeds in human cells. We find that cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 is activated in late G2 and that the activity gradually increases between centrosome separation and prometaphase. Moreover, we investigated the effect of partially reducing Cdk1 levels on mitotic progression. We show that whereas low levels of Cdk1 are sufficient for mitotic entry, higher levels are needed for normal mitotic progression and initiation of anaphase. Altogether, we show that the development of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity in vivo proceeds as if it were governed by bistability. Our results explain how cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 can be responsible for cytoplasmic rearrangements even during nuclear translocation. We propose a model in which different thresholds of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity, in combination with a gradual increase in activity, help to coordinate early and late mitotic events.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Temporal Development of Cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 Activity in Single Cells</title><p>Cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 is initially activated on centrosomes in late G2, shortly before they start to migrate apart &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. To determine how cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activation proceeds, we developed an assay to follow the pattern of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity in single human cells. Because Cdk1 levels are in excess of cyclin levels in mammalian cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d; (unpublished data) and because Cdk1 is phosphorylated only when in complex with a cyclin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, we reasoned that the ratio between phosphorylated Cdk1 and cyclin B1 could provide an estimate of the relative activity of the cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 complex. Therefore, we used an antibody recognizing Cdk1 when phosphorylated on Y15 (Cdk1 phosphorylation &#x0005b;Cdk1-P&#x0005d;, which represents inactive Cdk1) combined with an antibody recognizing cyclin B1, in immunofluorescence experiments.</p><p>We first wanted to test the specificity of these antibodies, and therefore we used short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to reduce the levels of cyclin B1 or Cdk1 in cells. The cytoplasmic staining of the Cdk1-P antibody in G2 almost completely disappeared by microinjecting cells with an shRNA to cyclin B1 or Cdk1, showing the cytoplasmic signal represents phosphorylated Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). However, Cdk1 RNA interference (RNAi) could not totally eliminate the staining in interphase nuclei and on centrosomes, indicating some cross-reactivity in these locations, most probably with phosphorylated Cdk2. Furthermore, the cyclin B1 and Cdk1-P signal colocalized linearly in the cytoplasm, indicating that the signal represents cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Therefore, in this study we exclusively focused on cytoplasmic cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activation, which we could monitor specifically.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows maximum intensity projections of cells in various stages of G2 and mitosis, costained for chromosomes, phospho-Cdk1, and cyclin B1. In G2 and mitotic cells, cyclin B1, shown in the second panel, colocalized with cytoplasmic phospho-Cdk1, apparently decreasing around the time when cyclin B1 (third panel) translocated to the nucleus. In metaphase, cyclin B1 levels declined, whereas Cdk1-P appeared to remain similar to the level in prometaphase cells. In anaphase, both cyclin B1 and phospho-Cdk1 levels had largely disappeared.</p><p>Subsequently, we analyzed numerous undeconconvolved fluorescent images of G2 and mitotic cells, to carefully quantify the cytoplasmic cyclin B1 and Cdk1-P staining in various phases of G2 and mitosis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sg003">Figure S3</xref> for details on image acquisition and data analyses). To control for changes in morphology during mitotic progression, we performed quantitations of nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B), a protein that is cytoplasmic in normal cells and has no obvious function in mitosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). We exclusively analyzed endogenous proteins in unsynchronized HeLa cells under normal growth conditions.</p><p>After correction for changes in morphology, we subsequently plotted cytoplasmic Cdk1-P levels as a function of cytoplasmic cyclin B1 levels. We observed that both Cdk1-P and cyclin B1 increased in a roughly linear fashion when cells proceeded through G2, with little change in the Cdk1 phosphorylation (P) state, in agreement with cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 complexes displaying low activity in early G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">2</xref>A; blue diamonds). As we showed previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, a subset of cells with nonseparated centrosomes and high cyclin B1 levels contained reduced levels of phosphorylated Cdk1, indicating a pool of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 is partially active. In cells with high cyclin B1 levels, we saw Cdk1 dephosphorylation further proceeding when centrosomes started to migrate apart. The dephosphorylation gradually continued until chromosomes were aligning in prometaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">2</xref>A; top left, red squares and light-blue Xs), whereas total Cdk1 levels did not decline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). This strongly indicates cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activation progressively develops during mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Cytoplasmic Cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 Dephosphorylation Continues after Nuclear Translocation of Cyclin B1</title><p>Subsequently, we focused on the development of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 dephosphorylation when cyclin B1 enters the nucleus due to phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic retention signal in prophase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. It should be noted that the effect of nuclear translocation on development of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity is puzzling. Translocation means a drop in the cytoplasmic cyclin B1 concentration, which could cause cytoplasmic Cdk1 activity to plummet. However, cytoplasmic cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity seems required to govern mitotic onset in the cytoplasm, e.g., to induce rearrangements such as microtubule polymerization and spindle assembly, involved in promoting nuclear envelope breakdown at the end of prophase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. In a bistable model, though, a sudden reduction of cyclin B1 from the cytoplasm at the end of prophase would not necessarily prevent cytoplasmic activation of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 to proceed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sd001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p>When we compared cyclin B1 and phospho-Cdk1 levels before and after the onset of translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, red squares and green triangles), we observed that during cyclin B1 nuclear translocation, both the cytoplasmic cyclin B1&#x02013; and Cdk1-P levels continued to decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">2</xref>A; also see statistical analyses of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">Figures 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sg007">S7</xref>). To further visualize the details of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 dephosphorylation during nuclear translocation, we plotted the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic cyclin B1 ratio as a function of the ratio between cytoplasmic Cdk1-P and cyclin B1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">Figure 2</xref>B. When the ratio between phosphorylated Cdk1 and cyclin B1 was approaching 50&#x00025; of that observed in early G2 cells, cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 translocated to the nucleus. Strikingly, in cells with translocated cyclin B1, the ratio between cytoplasmic Cdk1-P and cyclin B1 indeed continued to decrease, demonstrating the activation did proceed in the cytoplasm, too (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Thus, our results show that a pool of active cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 remains in the cytoplasm even throughout the nuclear translocation, potentially explaining how cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity can contribute to mitotic rearrangements taking place outside the nucleus at this time. Furthermore, these results indicate that once a positive feedback has been initiated, the activation of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 is remarkably robust, and even proceeds upon a sudden drop in cyclin B1 concentration of approximately 50&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).</p><p>Total cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity in the cytoplasm is dependent on the concentration of the complex as well as on the fraction of active complexes present. We therefore reasoned that by multiplying the &#x0201c;relative activity&#x0201d; with the cyclin B1 levels, we would acquire a rough estimate of the &#x0201c;total cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity.&#x0201d; To estimate the relative activity, we assumed the ratio between P-Cdk1 and cyclin B1 in early G2 cells represented inactive complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">Figures 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">2</xref>F). We then continued to plot the total cytoplasmic cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity as a function of cytoplasmic cyclin B1 levels, obtaining a loop representing activation and deactivation in G2 and mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">2</xref>E). In this representation, we see that the total cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity starts to increase in late G2, continues to rise to prometaphase, and remains high until cyclin B1 levels start to decline by inactivation of the spindle checkpoint and activation of Cdc20-APC/C in metaphase. The plot generated by our experimental data markedly resembled the relationship between in vitro Cdk1 activity and cyclin B concentration, observed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, with the important difference that human cytoplasmic cyclin B1 levels decreased as a result of nuclear translocation in prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">2</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">2F</xref>).

As an additional benefit, this would allow us to confirm the kinetics of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activation when quantifying a positive readout signal. To this end, we used purified antibodies specifically recognizing phosphorylated APC3, a cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 substrate, in mitosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sg006">Figure S6</xref>A clearly shows the accumulation of APC3&#x02013;Thr244-P on centrosomes after cyclin B1 translocation and during prometaphase, while the signal stabilized in metaphase and was greatly reduced in anaphase. Because cytoplasmic staining of this epitope was weak, next we analyzed the appearance of APC3&#x02013;Thr446-P. Phosphorylation of this site was first identified in mitotic cells and has been reported to be induced by Cdk1, but not by Polo-like kinase 1, in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;.

For comparison, in the same manner as for Cdk1 dephosphorylation, we next quantitated the increase in APC3&#x02013;Thr446-P exclusively in the cytoplasm. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sg006">Figure S6</xref>C (gray bars) shows that cytoplasmic APC3&#x02013;Thr446-P first rose slightly in G2 cells, slowly increasing after centrosome separation, and, interestingly, continued to accumulate while cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 translocated to the nucleus. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows a similar but more detailed quantification throughout G2 and mitosis of APC3&#x02013;Ser426-P, a well-established Cdk1 target in vitro and in vivo, which is phosphorylated independently of Polo-like kinase 1 in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. Accumulation of cytoplasmic APC3&#x02013;Thr446-P and APC3&#x02013;Ser426-P was highly comparable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sg006">Figure S6</xref>C).

Moreover, APC3 is situated in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, leading to an increased accessibility to cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 after nuclear envelope breakdown. Therefore, the detected APC3 phosphorylation lags slightly behind the detected Cdk1 dephosphorylation. However, both measurements showed a similar trend in gradually increasing cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity, in which the direct activity precedes the accumulated resulting phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Fitting Activation to Mitotic Events: A Plot of Cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 Activation Kinetics</title><p>To correlate the duration of Cdk1 activation with mitotic progression, we determined the timing of specific G2 and mitotic events: centrosome movement, DNA condensation, chromosome congression and sister chromatid separation in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sg008">Figure S8</xref>). In late G2, the centrosomes of most cells migrated from a position next to the nucleus to below the nucleus, where they separated. The activation of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 preceded centrosome separation, but during the 27 min (SD &#x0003d; 13 min) between centrosome separation and DNA condensation, almost 50&#x00025; of the cytoplasmic cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 complexes were activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g004">Figure 4</xref>, black line). At the same time, the amount of Ser426-phosphorylated APC3 started to increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g004">Figure 4</xref>, dotted line). Due to the nuclear translocation of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1, the total cytoplasmic activity was moderately decreased when DNA condensation became visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g004">Figure 4</xref>, gray line). We showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">Figure 2</xref> that even during nuclear translocation, activation of cytoplasmic cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 complexes could continue. We also showed that accumulation of APC3&#x02013;Ser426-P did not decrease during nuclear translocation. The chromosomes started to align on the metaphase plate about 20 min (SD &#x0003d; 9 min) after DNA condensation was initiated. During this process, cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 gained full activity, and as a consequence, the most dramatic increase in APC phosphorylation occurred.</p><p>In conclusion, cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity continued to accumulate between centrosome separation and chromosome congression in HeLa cells during a time span of approximately 45 min. The dephosphorylation of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 proceeded in a gradual fashion, and the development of total cytoplasmic activity was modestly influenced by localization changes of the cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Implications for the Features of a Cdk1&#x02013;APC/C Cell Cycle Oscillator</title><p>If bistability and hysteresis govern cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity, Cdk1 should not be phosphorylated and inactivated when the cyclin B1 concentration drops slightly below the activation threshold &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. This occurs twice in an unperturbed cell cycle: during nuclear translocation of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 in late G2, when cytoplasmic cyclin B1 levels decrease to the level of G2 cells in which cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 is inactive, and when cyclin B1 starts to be degraded in metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">2</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">2</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g002">2</xref>F). Indeed, we do not observe any increase of Cdk1-P during these events. Although we need to stress that this does not prove that mitosis is controlled by a bistable cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 circuit (since the system may not reach a steady state), we show that within the time-frame in which concentration changes occur in vivo, the activation curve for human cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 proceeds as if it were governed by bistability. It is probable that this contributes to the robustness and unidirectionality of mitosis, especially during the dramatic decrease in cytoplasmic cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 levels during nuclear translocation.</p><p>In a recent spatial theoretical simulation, Yang and coworkers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; found that removing cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1-dependent destruction of cyclin B1 turns the activation dynamics from limit cycle oscillations to bistability. Interestingly, in this model the cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity continues to rise in the cytoplasm during nuclear translocation. It should be noted that the negative feedback loop, leading to cyclin B1 inactivation, is not directly set off by the active state of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1. Rather, active cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 triggers mitotic entry, and the mitotic state is maintained by the spindle checkpoint, which prevents early activation of the APC/C-dependent negative feedback, even after the APC/C has already been phosphorylated by cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1. This means that once cells are in the mitotic state with high cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 levels, they can remain in this state even when the negative feedback has been &#x0201c;preloaded&#x0201d; (i.e., the APC/C is maximally phosphorylated by cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1). During a prolonged arrest, cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity remains high for hours in the checkpoint-arrested, mitotic state. Eventual slippage through the checkpoint is caused only by progressive, but very slow, degradation of cyclin B1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. In normal mitotic cells, cyclin B1 is destroyed only when spindle checkpoint silencing releases inhibition of the APC/C, and Cdk1 rapidly returns to its low, interphase-state, activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Effect on Mitotic Progression by Reducing Cyclin-Cdk1 Activity</title><p>Abrupt and efficient Cdk1 activation at the beginning of mitosis might be required to eventually trigger normal Cdk1 inactivation, which is necessary to build an uncompromised Cdk1-APC/C cell cycle oscillator in cycling extracts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

These findings indicate that specific cyclin-Cdk1 kinase activity needs to accumulate during mitosis to prepare for efficient mitotic exit.</p><p>Next, to investigate the requirement for cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 at different phases of mitosis in human cells, we reduced the expression levels of Cdk1 by vector-driven shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). As previously reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;, we observed that reducing Cdk1 levels caused an increase in the population of G2 cells and a reduced fraction of cells entering mitosis after release from a G1/S block (unpublished data; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sg009">Figure S9</xref>). However, approximately 20&#x00025; of the cells with reduced Cdk1 levels initiated mitosis. When we compared the levels of Cdk1 in G2 and mitotic cells (collected by shake-off) after Cdk1 RNAi treatment, Cdk1 was selectively more abundant in the mitotic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). This indicates that only cells with modestly reduced Cdk1 levels progressed from G2 to mitosis and suggests the existence of a threshold for Cdk1 at mitotic entry. These Cdk1-attenuated cells, which initiated mitosis, clearly showed reduced phosphorylation of the Cdk1 substrates APC3 and Cdc25C when arrested in nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), revealing that although the cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity was sufficient for entry into mitosis, phosphorylation of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 targets remained incomplete. Coexpression of an RNAi-resistant Cdk1 construct together with the shRNA vector restored APC3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g005">Figure 5</xref>C), confirming the specificity of the RNAi. Biochemical analysis of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity in cells that entered mitosis with reduced cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 levels revealed that the activity per complex remained largely unchanged, showing that the remaining cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 can still be activated even when total cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 levels are reduced, a result in agreement with a model of bistability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sg010">Figure S10</xref>). Release from nocodazole arrest revealed that Cdk1-attenuated cells retained the ability to exit from mitosis after 3&#x02013;4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). However, when analyzed by time-lapse microscopy, cells that entered mitosis with reduced Cdk1 levels were strongly delayed before initiation of anaphase, with their chromosomes aligned at the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g005">Figures 5</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050123-g005">5</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050123-sg009">S9</xref>; average of 15 cells: 88 &#x000b1; 65 min compared with 5 &#x000b1; 3 min in 15 control cells, cotransfected with Cdk1 shRNA and RNAi-resistant Cdk1&#x02013;yellow fluorescent protein &#x0005b;YFP&#x0005d;). Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells (unpublished data). Given the large number of Cdk1 substrates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;, it is likely these aberrancies can be attributed to impaired function of many cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 targets, which prohibited us from pinpointing a single mitotic process being affected. Nevertheless, taken together these results indicate that mitotic cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity needs to further increase after mitotic entry and pass a threshold before metaphase, necessary to allow activation of the machinery required for efficient mitotic progression and initiation of mitotic exit.</p><p>An important consequence of our findings is that distinct thresholds for cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity exist that control successive mitotic events. This concept has recently been demonstrated in mitotic exit, which requires the passage of different thresholds of decreasing cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 activity for the metaphase-to-anaphase and the anaphase-to-telophase transition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050123-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;.

Extracts of these cells were blotted with indicated antibodies. Importantly, next to a reduction of Cdk1 levels, cyclin B1 levels also were reduced. This indicates that only around 40&#x00025; of cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 complexes could be formed in pSuper-Cdk1&#x02013;treated cells compared to control cells.</p><p>(B and C) Cell extracts from (A) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with cyclin B1 antibodies for 4 h at 4 &#x000b0;C. Next, the cyclin B1 immunoprecipitates were incubated with <sup>32</sup>P-&#x003b3;ATP for 30 min with Histon H1 as substrate. We separated different amounts of the reactions on gel to correct for possible differences in cyclin B1 and/or Cdk1 levels in the IPs. Western blots were performed using cyclin B1 and Cdk1 antibodies after exposures were taken using PhosphorImager films. Intensities were measured and background was subtracted using MetaMorph software and Excel. The highest signal in the pSuper samples was set at 100&#x00025;, and the estimated kinase activity for every lane was plotted against protein levels of cyclin B1 (B) or Cdk1 (C) present in the same lane. In both mitotic samples, the kinase activity roughly followed the same line. Only the activity per cyclin B1 molecule from the pSuper-Cdk1 cells seemed slightly lower (B), which can be explained if cyclin B1 exceeds the remaining amount of Cdk1. Indeed, correlating kinase activity with the Cdk1 levels revealed a closer overlap (C). All together, these data show that pS-Cdk1 cells have fewer cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 complexes but the complexes that are formed are fully active.</p><p>(1.2 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0050123.sg010.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050123-sd001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><title>Small Glossary of Nonlinear Dynamics in the Cell Cycle</title><p>(21 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.0050123.sd001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We cordially thank our colleagues from current and past labs, and especially Rene Medema, for their support of our work.

Cells were labeled according to morphology and staining as follows: cells with cytoplasmic cyclin B1 (blue diamonds), cytoplasmic cyclin B1 and separated centrosomes (red squares), predominant cyclin B1 staining in nucleus (green triangles), condensed DNA and no distinguishable nucleus in cyclin B1 staining (light blue Xs), all chromosomes aligned on a metaphase plate (black dots), and anaphase (red Xs).</p><p>(B) Relative cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1-P during nuclear translocation.

Mitotic cells were more than 95&#x00025; MPM2 positive as analyzed by immunostaining and FACS analysis (unpublished data). Separated G2 and mitotic pools were analyzed for Cdk1 expression by Western blotting. Cdc20 protein levels serve as loading control.

Cells do not enter mitosis unless a threshold concentration of active cyclin B1&#x02013;Cdk1 is present (G<sub>2</sub> arrest). After mitotic entry, the Cdk1 activity gradually increases, which enables the cell to prepare for mitotic exit (normal G2/M). If the Cdk1 activity does not develop fully after mitotic entry, the cell is delayed before anaphase (mitotic delay).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050123.g006"/></fig></sec><fn-group><fn id="n103" fn-type="present-address"><p>&#x000a4; Current address: Department of Medical Oncology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands</p></fn><fn id="ack3" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests.</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn id="ack1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> AL, WvZ, CKR, and RMFW conceived and designed the experiments and analyzed the data.
