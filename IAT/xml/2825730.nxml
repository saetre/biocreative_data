Although COX-2-derived PGE<sub>2</sub> is known to play a role in the development of various tumours, the involvement of mPGES-1 in carcinogenesis has not yet been fully understood. In the present study, we used LLC (Lewis lung carcinoma) cells with mPGES-1 knockdown or overexpression, as well as mPGES-1-deficient mice to examine the roles of cancer cell- and host-associated mPGES-1 in the processes of tumorigenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that siRNA (small interfering RNA) silencing of mPGES-1 in LLC cells decreased PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesis markedly, accompanied by reduced cell proliferation, attenuated Matrigel&#x02122; invasiveness and increased extracellular matrix adhesion. Conversely, mPGES-1-overexpressing LLC cells showed increased proliferating and invasive capacities. When implanted subcutaneously into wild-type mice, mPGES-1-silenced cells formed smaller xenograft tumours than did control cells. Furthermore, LLC tumours grafted subcutaneously into mPGES-1-knockout mice grew more slowly than did those grafted into littermate wild-type mice, with concomitant decreases in the density of microvascular networks, the expression of pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor, and the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2. Lung metastasis of intravenously injected LLC cells was also significantly less obvious in mPGES-1-null mice than in wild-type mice. Thus our present approaches provide unequivocal evidence for critical roles of the mPGES-1-dependent PGE<sub>2</sub> biosynthetic pathway in both cancer cells and host microenvironments in tumour growth and metastasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>knockout mouse</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1</kwd><kwd>prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub></kwd><kwd>tumorigenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>COX, cyclo-oxygenase</kwd><kwd>cPGES, cytosolic prostaglandin E synthase</kwd><kwd>DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium</kwd><kwd>dmPGE<sub>2</sub>, 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub></kwd><kwd>ECM, extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>EP, prostaglandin E receptor</kwd><kwd>FCS, fetal calf serum</kwd><kwd>GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase</kwd><kwd>HEK, human embryonic kidney</kwd><kwd>KD, knockdown</kwd><kwd>KO, knockout</kwd><kwd>LLC, Lewis lung carcinoma</kwd><kwd>MMP, matrix metalloproteinase</kwd><kwd>mPGES, microsomal prostaglandin E synthase</kwd><kwd>NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</kwd><kwd>PG, prostaglandin</kwd><kwd>PGES, PGE synthase</kwd><kwd>RT, reverse transcriptase</kwd><kwd>siRNA, small interfering RNA</kwd><kwd>TBS, Tris-buffered saline</kwd><kwd>TBS-Tween, TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20</kwd><kwd>VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor</kwd><kwd>WT, wild-type</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><ref-count count="44"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Numerous studies on rodent cancer models and human cancers have shown that NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) have antineoplastic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A well-known effect of the NSAIDs is their ability to inhibit the enzyme COX (cyclo-oxygenase) and thereby to suppress PG (prostaglandin) synthesis. PGE<sub>2</sub>, the most common PG, is involved in tumour progression by inducing angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis in several solid tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Biosynthesis of PGE<sub>2</sub> from arachidonic acid, which is spatiotemporally supplied from membrane phospholipids by the action of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>, is catalysed sequentially by COX and PGES (PGE synthase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. COX catalyses the insertion of molecular oxygen into arachidonic acid to form the unstable intermediate PGG<sub>2</sub>, which is rapidly converted into PGH<sub>2</sub> by the peroxidase activity of the same enzyme. Of the two COX isoforms, COX-1 is expressed constitutively in most tissues and is generally responsible for the production of PGs that control normal physiological functions, whereas COX-2 is inducible in response to mitogens, cytokines and cellular transformation. High levels of constitutive expression of COX-2 and its product PGE<sub>2</sub> have been detected in various cancer cells and tissues. Moreover, pharmacological, cell biological and gene targeting studies investigating COX-2 and EPs (PGE receptors) have demonstrated that PGE<sub>2</sub> produced through the COX-2-dependent pathway contributes to the progression of several types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>PGES catalyses the conversion of PGH<sub>2</sub>, produced by COX-1 or COX-2, into PGE<sub>2</sub>. Thus far, three PGES enzymes, mPGES (microsomal PGES)-1, mPGES-2 and cPGES (cytosolic PGES), have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Among these PGES isozymes, mPGES-1 is induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli and down-regulated by anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids, as in the case of COX-2, and is functionally coupled with COX-2 in marked preference to COX-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Induction of mPGES-1 expression and its function have been observed in various diseases and systems in which COX-2-driven PGE<sub>2</sub> has been implicated, such as rheumatoid arthritis, febrile response, reproduction, bone metabolism, cardiovascular function, stroke and Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, it has previously been reported that mPGES-1 is constitutively expressed in several cancers, most of which also express COX-2 constitutively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We have reported that the forcible transfection of mPGES-1 in combination with COX-2, but not with COX-1, into HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells led to cellular transformation with a concomitant and robust increase in PGE<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Transgenic mice overexpressing both COX-2 and mPGES-1 developed metaplasia, hyperplasia and tumorous growth in the glandular stomach with heavy macrophage infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It has also been suggested that the PGE<sub>2</sub> produced through the COX-2-dependent pathway may regulate cancer&#x02013;host communications that influence tumour progression. Studies using mice null for COX-2 or EPs have revealed that stromal cells around cancer cells express COX-2 and synthesize PGE<sub>2</sub>, which, in tumour niches, may act on stromal cells in an autocrine fashion to induce the production of pro-angiogenic factors and consequent angiogenesis, as well as on cancer cells in a paracrine fashion to promote their growth, survival, adhesion and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although several studies, including our own, have found, by immunohistochemistry, that mPGES-1 is expressed in both stromal cells and cancer cells in tumour tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], the contribution of mPGES-1 expressed in either cell population to tumour progression has not yet been fully elucidated.</p><p>Although the inhibition of COX-2-mediated PGE<sub>2</sub> formation represents a promising chemopreventive strategy for reducing the risk of cancer, the cardiovascular side effects associated with COX-2 inhibitors, which most likely result from the blunting of anti-thrombotic prostacyclin (PGI<sub>2</sub>), have previously been found to limit their use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. From this viewpoint, selective blockage of the biosynthesis of PGE<sub>2</sub> without affecting other prostanoids appears to be feasible for cancer chemoprevention with the potential for improved tolerability over NSAIDs. To better evaluate the efficacy of mPGES-1 inhibition in relieving symptoms of cancer, the present study used lung carcinoma cells with mPGES-1 KD (knockdown) or overexpression, as well as mice null for mPGES-1. Our results provide evidence that mPGES-1 in both cancer cells and hosts contributes to tumorigenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>Cells</title><p>LLC (Lewis lung carcinoma) cells, which were originally isolated from C57BL/6 mice, were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) containing 10% (v/v) FCS (fetal calf serum) under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Gelatin zymography revealed that the activity of MMP-2 in the metastasized lung tissues was mitigated in mPGES-1-KO mice in comparison with that in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D), and the levels of both MMP-2 and -9 mRNAs were significantly lower in the lung of mPGES-1-KD mice than in that of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). Collectively, these results indicate that host mPGES-1-driven PGE<sub>2</sub> plays a role in promoting tumour development and metastasis, which was associated with increased VEGF expression and MMP-2 and -9 activation.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Reduced lung metastasis in mPGES-1-KO mice</title><p>A total of 10<sup>5</sup> cells were injected into the lateral tail veins of female mPGES-1-KO and WT mice on the BALB/c background.

In this context, we have previously shown that co-transfection of mPGES-1 in combination with COX-2 into HEK-293 cells leads to a malignant phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In our continuing efforts to gain further insights into the role of mPGES-1 in tumorigenesis, we used two approaches in the present study. First, we performed siRNA-mediated silencing and overexpression of mPGES-1, which enabled us to address the complementary effects of endogenous compared with overexpressed mPGES-1 in cancer cells on tumorigenic potentials (growth, invasion and ECM binding <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumour xenograft propagation <italic>in vivo</italic>). Secondly, implantation of carcinoma cells into mPGES-1-KO mice and WT mice allowed us to evaluate the contribution of mPGES-1 expressed in tissue microenvironments to the development and metastasis of tumours in proximal and distant tissues. Our results clearly indicate that mPGES-1 expressed in both cancer cells and hosts is capable of promoting proliferation and invasion of cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><sec><title>Role of mPGES-1 in cancer cells</title><p>We found that PGE<sub>2</sub> generation and cell proliferation were reduced by mPGES-1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D) and conversely enhanced by mPGES-1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A&#x02013;3C</xref>) in LLC cells (a PGE<sub>2</sub>-dependent mouse lung carcinoma cell line; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]), indicating the role of mPGES-1, acting downstream of COX-2, in providing the mitogenic PGE<sub>2</sub>. In accordance with the impact on cell proliferation, the gene silencing of mPGES-1 decreased, whereas overexpression of mPGES-1 increased, the invasive activity of LLC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D). The process by which tumour cells break out from their site of origin and metastasize to distant sites requires an ability to invade through the ECM and underlying mesenchymal cells. PGE<sub>2</sub> stimulates the invasion of cancer cells through up-regulating MMP-2 and MMP-9 (type IV collagenases), as shown by the observations that MMP-2 is increased in COX-2-overexpressing or PGE<sub>2</sub>-treated tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and that MMP-9 is induced by COX-2/EP4 signalling in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We found that the expression of MMP-2 and -9 in mPGES-1-KD cells were lower than that in mock cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), suggesting the contribution of these matrix-degrading proteases to the mPGES-1dependent invasiveness of LLC cells. In addition to adhesion to and degradation of the ECM, detachment from the ECM is also an important step in the metastasis of tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>(C), both collagen- and fibronectin-adherent activities were significantly increased in mPGES-1-KD cells, and treatment with dmPGE<sub>2</sub> reversed these activities consistently. Accordingly, the expression of integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 (a major adhesion molecule of fibronectin) in mPGES-1-KD cells was higher than that in mock cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D), an observation that is reminiscent of our previous report that co-overexpression of COX-2 and mPGES-1 in HEK-293 cells results in a marked reduction in a subset of integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Thus mPGES-1-driven PGE<sub>2</sub> may regulate the ECM-adherent activity of cancer cells by altering the expression of integrins.</p><p>Importantly, <italic>in vivo</italic> tumour growth after subcutaneous engraftment of mPGES-1-KD cells was less obvious than that after engraftment of replicate mock cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), implying that mPGES-1 contributes to the supply of the major pool of the PGE<sub>2</sub> mediating tumour proliferation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Gene disruption of EP2 resulted in a reduced number and size of intestinal polyps in <italic>Apc</italic>-mutant mice, a model for human familial adenomatous polyposis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and the <italic>Apc</italic> mutation is accompanied by aberrant activation of &#x003b2;-catenin signalling, which is accelerated by PGE<sub>2</sub> through the EP2&#x02013;Gs&#x003b1; axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In another model, disruption of the gene for EP1, EP2 or EP4 suppressed the development of colorectal cancer induced by carcinogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Transactivation of EGF (epidermal growth factor) receptors by the PGE<sub>2</sub>/EP1, 2, or 4 signalling via protein kinase A and c-Src led to increased cell growth and invasion of carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In a positive-feedback loop, COX-2-derived PGE<sub>2</sub> acts on EP2, leading to the elevation of intracellular cAMP, which in turn up-regulates the expressions of both COX-2 and EP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Although the identification of EPs participating in the propagation of LLC xenografts is beyond the scope of the present study, the co-ordinated reduction of mPGES-1 and EP2 in mPGES-1-KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) suggests that COX-2/mPGES-1-derived PGE<sub>2</sub> may stimulate EP2 signalling in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to facilitate LLC cell proliferation and, accordingly, defects in mPGES-1 may lead to down-regulation of EP2 and eventually reduce the cellular sensitivity to PGE<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>While this paper was in preparation, two groups reported opposite effects of mPGES-1 deficiency in intestinal tumorigenesis. Nakanishi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] showed that the genetic deletion of mPGES-1 ameliorates the development of intestinal tumours in both <italic>Apc</italic><sup>&#x00394;<italic>14</italic></sup>-dependent and carcinogen-induced models, whereas Elander et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] demonstrated that intestinal polyposis is exacerbated in mPGES-1-null <italic>Apc</italic><sup><italic>min</italic></sup> mutant mice, probably because of the metabolic shift from PGE<sub>2</sub> towards other pro-tumorigenic lipid mediators. Although the reason for the discrepancy between these two studies is unclear, our present results appear to be in line with the former study and thus support the feasibility of targeting mPGES-1 for cancer chemoprevention. Critically, although the experimental design of the previous studies did not allow a precise distinction between the contribution of cancer cell- and host-associated mPGES-1 to tumour development, our present approach clearly underscores the importance of mPGES-1 pools both in cancer cells (as discussed above) and in microenvironments (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>Role of mPGES-1 in host microenvironments</title><p>As is COX-2, mPGES-1 is expressed in stromal cells as well as in cancerous cells in several types of tumour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Given that stromal COX-2 and PGE<sub>2</sub> of the host can influence the development of grafted tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], we used mPGES-1-KO mice to evaluate the potential roles of the host stromal mPGES-1 in tumour growth, and found that tumour growth at a proximal site and metastasis into a distant tissue were significantly reduced in mPGES-1-KO mice relative to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This result provides an additional line of genetic evidence that the COX-2/mPGES-1-derived PGE<sub>2</sub> from host stromal cells, in addition to that from cancer cells (see above), is important for tumorigenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. The induction of mPGES-1 in tumour stromal tissues may be ascribed to the migration and expansion of host inflammatory cells and neovascular endothelial cells, since previous immunohistochemical analyses have demonstrated a preferential localization of mPGES-1 in macrophage-like cells infiltrating into the stromal tissues in proximity to cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and since massive macrophage infiltration and microvessel formation have been observed in the stroma of gastric hyperplasia in COX-2/mPGES-1-double transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, vascular density and VEGF expression in tumour xenografts were decreased in mPGES-1-KO mice. It has been reported that angiogenesis induced by either endogenous COX-2 or exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> was accompanied by increased VEGF expression and was abolished by a VEGF-directed antisense oligonucleotide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Moreover, the growth, VEGF expression and angiogenesis of LLC-implanted tumours were markedly suppressed in EP3-KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], a phenotype that is reminiscent of mPGES-1-KO (the present study) and COX-2-KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These studies indicate that, in the tumour milieu, both cancer cells and adjacent stromal cells synthesize (via COX-2/mPGES-1) PGE<sub>2</sub>, which in turn acts on the particular population of EP3-expressing stromal cells to induce the production of VEGF and consequent angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Consistently, Nakanishi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] have reported very recently that genetic deletion of mPGES-1 in <italic>Apc</italic>-mutant mice caused marked and persistent suppression of intestinal cancer growth in association with a disorganized vascular pattern. In addition to tumour growth and associated angiogenesis, lung metastasis of LLC cells across the blood circulation was also decreased in mPGES-1-KO mice as compared with replicate WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The metastatic phenotype observed in mPGES-1-KO mice was similar to that observed in MMP-2-KO mice, in which focal xenograft propagation and lung metastasis of LLC cells were reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In agreement, MMP-2, as well as MMP-9, expression in the metastasized lung tissues was markedly lower in mPGES-1-KO mice than in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>E). Thus, in the metastatic foci, the PGE<sub>2</sub> derived from the host mPGES-1 may lead to the increase in the activities of MMP-2 and -9, which, in co-operation with VEGF, may promote the invasion of cancerous cells into the adjacent and distant tissues, thereby allowing subsequent expansion and metastasis of the tumour.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that both cancer cell-associated and host-derived mPGES-1 is critical for tumour growth and metastasis. The mPGES-1-driven PGE<sub>2</sub> signalling on stromal cells may be functionally linked to the induction of potent pro-angiogenic and matrix-degrading factors, which in turn would facilitate tumour development. Previous studies have shown that, unlike the specific inhibition of COX-2, which predisposes to cardiovascular risk, gene ablation of mPGES-1 in mice shows minimal unfavourable effects on the circulation system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore an mPGES-1 inhibitor would exhibit a chemopreventive action on various tumours by attenuating both cancer cell- and stromal cell-derived PGE<sub>2</sub>, thereby serving as a novel therapeutic tool for cancer. Future clinical studies will address the important question of the efficacy and safety of mPGES-1 inhibition in human diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Online data</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" content-type="local-data" position="float" xlink:type="simple"><caption><title>Supplementary data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bj4250361add.pdf" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION</title><p>Daisuke Kamei designed and performed the experiments, analysed the data and contributed to writing the manuscript; Yuka Sasaki also performed the experiments; Yoshihito Nakatani, Masataka Majima, Yukio Ishikawa and Toshiharu Ishii helped in manuscript and scientific discussions; Satoshi Uematsu and Shizuo Akira provided the resources for the work; Ichiro Kudo designed the experiments; and Makoto Murakami and Shuntaro Hara designed the experiments and also wrote the manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank Dr S.
