An understanding of cellulose degradation at the molecular level requires learning the different roles of these hydrolases. In this study, we show that interspecific conjugation with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> can be used to transfer a plasmid into <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> that has a resistance marker, an origin of replication that can be selectively lost, and a designed group II intron for efficient, targeted chromosomal insertions without selection. We applied these methods to disrupt the c<italic>phy3367</italic> gene, which encodes the sole family 9 glycoside hydrolase (GH9) in the <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> genome. The GH9-deficient strain grew normally on some carbon sources such as glucose, but had lost the ability to degrade cellulose. Although <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> upregulates the expression of numerous enzymes to break down cellulose, this process thus relies upon a single, key hydrolase, Cphy3367.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellulose is the most abundant renewable, biological energy source on earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Leschine, 1995</xref>), and its degradation is a key part of the global carbon cycle. Cellulose has tremendous potential as a biofuel feedstock; more than a billion tons of lignocellulosic plant biomass could be used each year for liquid biofuels in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Perlack <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The major challenge of producing biofuel from cellulose is the recalcitrance of cellulosic fibres to break down into sugars. The current cost of converting cellulosic biomass to sugar doubles the carbohydrate purchase cost, nullifying the advantage of biomass relative to corn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Lynd <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Microbes both that secrete enzymes to break down cellulosic biomass and that ferment the resulting saccharides can make cellulosic biofuels more efficient by obviating feedstock pre-treatment and raising conversion efficiencies. However, the development of robust microbial strains for conversion of biomass to fuels has been hindered by our inability to genetically manipulate these organisms.</p><p><italic>Clostridium phytofermentans</italic>, a mesophilic anaerobe isolated from forest soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Warnick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), is an ideal microbe to study the direct conversion of cellulosic biomass to ethanol. It grows on both of the two main components of plant biomass, cellulose and hemicellulose, by secreting enzymes to cleave these polysaccharides and then fermenting the resulting hexose (glucose, galactose, mannose) and pentose (xylose, arabinose) sugars to ethanol. Among clostridial genomes sequenced to date, <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> has the highest number of genes encoding enzymes for the modification and breakdown of complex carbohydrates. It contains genes for 161 carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy), which include 108 glycoside hydrolases spread across 39 families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Cantarel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). This abundance of hydrolases highlights how cellulosic biomass is a complex substrate whose degradation likely requires the concerted action of many enzymes. Cellulolytic clostridia usually have numerous genes encoding family 9 glycoside hydrolases (GH9): the <italic>Clostridium thermocellum</italic> ATCC 27405 genome has 16 GH9 genes, <italic>Clostridium cellulolyticum</italic> H10 has 13 GH9 genes, and <italic>Clostridium cellulovorans</italic> has five GH9 genes. In contrast, <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> has only a single GH9-encoding gene, <italic>cphy3367</italic>. GH9 proteins are all &#x003b2;-1,4-glucanases, but members of the GH9 family may have different substrate specificities and end-products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). There are subfamilies of GH9 proteins with different molecular architectures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). Cphy3367 belongs to the subfamily, called theme B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Gilad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>), in which the hydrolytic module is fused to a family 3 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A.

The different roles of these hydrolases could be uncovered by targeted gene inactivation. Although cellulolytic clostridia have been studied for decades, targeted mutagenesis in these organisms has remained challenging, likely due to highly active DNases and inefficient homologous recombination. Previously, cellulolysis-deficient strains of <italic>C. cellulolyticum</italic> were isolated by spontaneous mutation of the scaffoldin gene, which anchors the cellulolytic enzymes to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Maamar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">2004</xref>), and by reduction of CelF48 expression with antisense-RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Perret <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In this study, we developed a general system for targeted, chromosomal gene inactivation in <italic>C. phytofermentans.</italic> Efficient transfer of DNA into <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> is achieved by conjugation with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> expressing the broad-host-range RP4 conjugal apparatus. Conjugation has been used transfer plasmids to several mesophilic clostridia including <italic>Clostridium acetobutylicum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Williams <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>), <italic>C. perfringens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Lyras and Rood, 1998</xref>), <italic>C. cellulolyticum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Jennert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>) and <italic>C. difficile</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Purdy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). To make targeted chromosomal insertions in <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic>, we modified a Gram-positive conjugal shuttle vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Trieu-Cuot <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>) to contain a strong <italic>C. phytofermentan</italic>s promoter driving expression of a group II intron that was designed to inactivate <italic>cphy3367.</italic></p><p>Group II introns are catalytic RNAs that insert into dsDNA in a site-specific manner called retrohoming (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Lambowitz and Zimmerly, 2004</xref>). The intron used in this study is derived from the <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> Ll.LtrB group II intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Karberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). It consists of a 0.9 kb Ll.LtrB-deltaORF intron flanked by short exon sequences and a downstream <italic>ltrA</italic> gene that encodes a protein with endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Guo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). The intron inserts into the genome by splicing into a 13&#x02013;16 bp DNA recognition sequence. The LtrA protein then cleaves the opposite DNA strand and uses the 3&#x02032; DNA as a primer to reverse transcribe the inserted intron RNA. Because the DNA binding specificity of the group II intron is conferred by short sequences, the intron can be easily modified to integrate into a desired DNA target site. Group II introns can be made to insert into virtually any DNA sequence with frequencies in <italic>E. coli</italic> of 0.1&#x02013;22% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Karberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). In theory, group II introns can function in any bacterial taxa into which plasmid DNA can be delivered because intron insertion does not require host-supplied factors. Group II introns have been used to make mutations in both Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Yao and Lambowitz, 2007</xref>) and Gram-positive bacteria, including clostridia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Heap <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Previous experiments in the Gram-positive <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> found that this mobile group II intron made targeted gene disruptions in 37&#x02013;100% of colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Yao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Broadly, our goal is to dissect the set of cellulolytic enzymes in <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> in order to identify key genes for the degradation of cellulosic biomass. The <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> genome differs from other cellulolytic clostridia in encoding only a single GH9, Cphy3367. In this study, we disrupted the <italic>cphy3367</italic> gene with a targeted group II intron, which was delivered into <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> by conjugation with <italic>E. coli.</italic> Inactivation of <italic>cphy3367</italic> resulted in a strain that grew normally on glucose, cellobiose and hemicellulose, but had lost the ability to degrade crystalline cellulose. mRNA expression supports that <italic>cphy3367</italic> is among the most highly upregulated CAZy genes during growth on cellulose. These findings reveal a central role played by Cphy3367 in cellulose degradation. Generally, these results show that targeted gene inactivation can be used to identify key enzymes for cellulose degradation in <italic>C. phytofermentans.</italic></p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>A group II intron plasmid for use with <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic></title><p>The plasmid we developed for gene inactivation in <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> is derived from pAT19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Trieu-Cuot <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>). This plasmid has an RP4 conjugal origin of transfer, origins of replication both for <italic>E. coli</italic> (pUC) and for Gram-positive bacteria (<italic>Enterococcus</italic> pAM&#x003b2;1) and an erythromycin resistance gene from <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> Tn<italic>1545</italic> that functions in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. This plasmid was modified to disrupt <italic>cphy3367</italic> with a group II intron in three steps: addition of a strong <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> promoter to pAT19, insertion of the intron (Ll.LtrB-deltaORF and <italic>ltrA</italic> gene) downstream of the <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> promoter, and targeting the intron to <italic>cphy3367</italic>. In the first step, the promoter from <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (<italic>cphy3558</italic>) was cloned into pAT19 to yield pQexp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>). Pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase functions in central carbon metabolism to couple the reduction of ferredoxin with the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO<sub>2</sub>. Genome-wide studies of <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> mRNA (J. Blanchard, pers. comm.) support that <italic>cphy3558</italic> is among the most highly expressed genes in the genome on all tested carbon sources. The gene upstream of <italic>cphy3558</italic> in the genome is transcribed in the opposite direction, showing that <italic>cphy3558</italic> is transcribed from its own promoter. The high, constitutive expression of <italic>cphy3558</italic> supports that this promoter can be used in pQexp for strong expression of the group II intron, or other genes, in <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> under diverse physiological conditions.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Construction of a plasmid for inactivation of <italic>cphy3367</italic> with a group II intron.

The DNA binding region of the intron in pQint was retargeted to <italic>cphy3367</italic> by a two-step, cross-over PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>). An intron insertion site in <italic>cphy3367</italic> was selected that was both in the antisense orientation and near the start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). An antisense site was used because introns integrated in the sense orientation can splice out from the RNA transcript <italic>in vivo</italic> with the help of LtrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Yao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). An antisense insertion in <italic>cphy3367</italic> would yield an unconditional disruption, which was predicted to grow normally on media containing a simple carbon source such as glucose that does not require cleavage by a &#x003b2;-1,4-glucanase. The antisense insertion site nearest to the start codon was used in order to have the highest probability of disrupting <italic>cphy3367</italic> expression. This site is 37 bp downstream of the predicted start codon and resides in the putative secretion signal sequence (other potential sites in Supporting information S1). As <italic>cphy3367</italic> is the downstream member of a putative two gene operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>), disruption of <italic>cphy3367</italic> should not result in polar transcriptional effects.

The conjugal donor was <italic>E. coli</italic> strain 1100-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bandrin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>) containing pRK24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Meyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1977</xref>), the plasmid encoding the RP4 conjugal apparatus, and pQint3367. Cells were mated on solid G2 medium overnight. Following mating, <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> transconjugants were isolated by selecting against both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> cells that did not receive pQint3367. As <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic>, but not <italic>E. coli</italic> 1100-2, is naturally resistant to nalidixic acid and trimethoprim, these antibiotics were used to prevent growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> 1100-2 after mating. If other <italic>E. coli</italic> strains that are less sensitive to these antibiotics are used for matings, additional steps may be needed to isolate pure <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> colonies. For example, if plates are supplemented with X-gal and IPTG, <italic>lacZ</italic>+<italic>E. coli</italic> strains will form blue colonies whereas <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> colonies will be white. Alternatively, liquid cultures can be inoculated with phage T7 before plating to selectively remove <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Tolonen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Relative to <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> colony counts on plates lacking erythromycin, colony counts on plates containing erythromycin showed that the efficiency of plasmid transfer to <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> was &#x0223c;1 transconjugant per 10<sup>6</sup> recipient cells. This transfer rate is typically efficient enough to isolate 10&#x02013;20 <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> transconjugants per plate. In this study, 10 independent transconjugants were isolated, hereafter called AT02-1 to AT02-10.

The expected intron insertion, 37 bp downstream of the start codon <italic>cphy3367</italic> in the antisense direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>), was confirmed by PCR mapping of the <italic>cphy3367</italic> locus in the AT02 isolates.

PCR of the 5&#x02032; and the 3&#x02032; intron&#x02013;genome junction regions using one primer in the genome and the other in the intron (3367_F/Ebs2_3367 for the 5&#x02032; junction and 3367_R/Ebs_univ for the 3&#x02032; junction) resulted in products in AT02-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>, lanes 4 and 6), but not wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>, lanes 3 and 5). These PCR products were sequenced to confirm that AT02-1 bears the expected intron insertion in <italic>cphy3367</italic> (Fig. S1).

AT02-1 was then plated on solid GS2 (&#x02212;erm) medium and 10 colonies were tested by PCR, both for the presence of the erm<sup>R</sup> gene in pQint3367 and for the retention of an intron insertion in <italic>cphy3367</italic> with primers 3367_F and Ebs2_3367. Transfer in medium lacking erythromycin resulted in rapid loss of pQint3367 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>). In total, 8 of 10 colonies had lost pQint3367, while all 10 had retained the intron insertion in <italic>cphy3367</italic> (Fig. S2A). Further, plating on GS2 medium containing erythromycin showed that strains that had lost pQint3367 were erythromycin-sensitive (Fig. S2B). After an additional five transfers in the absence of erythromycin selection, it was again confirmed that all 10 AT02-1 cultures still retained the genomic intron insertion in <italic>cphy3367</italic>. The pQint plasmid can thus be used to make genomic insertions in <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> that are stable in the absence of selection. Because the pQint plasmid can be efficiently lost in the absence of selection and the intron does not contain an antibiotic resistance gene, multiple genes in the same <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> strain can be inactivated by sequentially introducing pQint plasmids targeted to different genes.</p><p>Southern blotting showed that AT02-1 and AT02-2 do not harbour any additional intron insertions elsewhere in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C</xref>).

A Southern blot of AT02-1 prior to loss of pQint3367 showed a second band of 7799 bp due to the plasmid-born intron.

The hemicellulose used in this study was birchwood xylan, which is a polysaccharide of 89.3% xylose, 1% arabinose, 1.4% glucose and 8.3% anhydrouronic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kormelink <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>). Although this assay does not establish whether Cphy3367 is active on &#x003b2;-1,4-<sc>d</sc>-xylose bonds, the robust growth of AT02-1 on hemicellulose shows that Cphy3367 is not required for <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> to metabolize hemicellulose.</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>A&#x02013;C.

Initially, we compared the expression of <italic>cphy3367</italic> with those of surrounding genes in the genome to see which genes were coexpressed with <italic>cphy3367</italic>. The <italic>cphy3367</italic> gene is 76 bp downstream of <italic>cphy3368</italic>, a family 48 glycoside hydrolase, and is 341 bp upstream of <italic>cphy3366</italic>, a MoxR-like ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5A</xref>). Sequence analysis suggests that <italic>cphy3366</italic> is transcribed from its own promoter; disruption of <italic>cphy3367</italic> would thus not result in polar transcriptional effects. A putative promoter upstream of <italic>cphy3368</italic> led us to hypothesize that <italic>cphy3367</italic> is the second gene in a putative two gene operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, we found that in wild-type cells <italic>cphy3367</italic> and <italic>cphy3368</italic> mRNA transcripts are upregulated on hemicellulose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5B</xref>) and cellulose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5C</xref>) relative to expression on glucose, while the surrounding genes did not increase in expression.

The <italic>cphy3367&#x02013;cphy3368</italic> putative operon is thus upregulated independent of the surrounding genes, which do not appear to be involved in acclimation to growth on cellulosic biomass.

The set of CAZy genes we examined included 33 glycoside hydrolases spread across 20 families, two carbohydrate esterases, three glycosyl transferases and two polysaccharide lyases (see Supporting information S3 for a complete list of genes). Among these 40 CAZy genes, 14 genes were greater than twofold upregulated on hemicellulose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>) and 13 genes were upregulated on cellulose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>) relative to their expression during growth on glucose. Moreover, there were widespread differences in the mRNA expression of CAZy genes between hemicellulose and cellulose (shaded bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> can thus differentiate between the components of cellulosic biomass and respond by transcriptionally altering the set of CAZy genes that are expressed.

The expression of <italic>cphy3366</italic>, the gene downstream of <italic>cphy3367</italic> in the genome, was moderately lower in AT02-1 than in wild type when growing on hemicellulose, but these changes were less than twofold. Further, we found that mRNA expression of the intron was similar to <italic>cphy3367</italic> in AT02-1, but was not detected in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Although the <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> genome encodes over a hundred glycoside hydrolases and many of these genes are upregulated on cellulosic carbon sources, this study shows that the inactivation of a single hydrolase, Cphy3367, results in an inability to degrade cellulose. To enable the genetic analysis of cellulose degradation by <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic>, the initial contribution of this study was to develop a system to make targeted insertions in the <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> chromosome<italic>.</italic> We showed that interspecific conjugation with <italic>E. coli</italic> can be used to reliably transfer foreign DNA into <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic>. The plasmid we transferred to <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> established that the erm<sup>R</sup> gene from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> Tn<italic>1545</italic> gives high erythromycin resistance in this organism. Further, the <italic>Enterococcus</italic> pAM&#x003b2;1 origin of replication replicates stably in <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> under antibiotic selection, but can be easily cured from strains in the absence of selection. Finally, the <italic>L. lactis</italic> Ll.LtrB group II intron makes accurate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A</xref>) and specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C</xref>) chromosomal insertions in <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic>. We found that when the strong <italic>C. phytofermentans cphy3558</italic> promoter is used to drive expression of the intron, it inserts into the genome with such a high efficiency that mutants can be easily isolated without selecting for integration. As the intron insertions are stable in the absence of selection, the intron need not contain a resistance gene. Once the plasmid is cured from <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic>, no antibiotic resistance genes remain. Multiple intron insertions can thus be made in the same strain without needing independent resistance markers. This is particularly helpful because so few resistance markers are known to function in clostridia. It is, however, possible that intron insertions in certain regions of the genome might occur with lower efficiency such that a direct selection for integration would be advantageous. Group II introns have been modified to contain Retrotransposition-Activated Markers (RAM) to positively select for integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zhong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). RAM consist of an antibiotic resistance gene that is interrupted by a group I intron. When the group II intron integrates, the group I intron is excised from the resistance gene. RAM have been used to positively select for intron insertions in other clostridia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Heap <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and would likely be useful in <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> to obtain strains with intron insertions in low-efficiency positions in the genome.</p><p>We applied these methods to study the genetic basis of cellulose degradation by disrupting <italic>cphy3367</italic>, encoding the only GH9 in <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic>. The GH9-deficient strain, AT02-1, grows normally on glucose, cellobiose and hemicellulose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4A&#x02013;C</xref>) but has lost the ability to degrade crystalline cellulose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4D and E</xref>). Several lines of evidence support that this phenotype resulted specifically from the inactivation of Cphy3367. AT02-1 did not have any additional intron insertions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C</xref>). The gene expression patterns of <italic>cphy3367</italic> and surrounding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5</xref>) support that <italic>cphy3367</italic> is the downstream member of a two-gene operon such that inactivation of <italic>cphy3367</italic> would not result in polar transcriptional effects. Finally, the expression of CAZy genes in wild type and AT02-1 appears similar, supporting that disruption of <italic>cphy3367</italic> does not result in altered expression of other genes for the breakdown of cellulose.</p><p>In contrast to other clostridia such as <italic>C. thermocellum</italic>, <italic>C. cellulolyticum</italic> and <italic>C. cellulovoran</italic>s, the glycoside hydrolases in <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> do not appear to multimerize into an extracellular cellulosome. The <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> genome does not appear to encode a cellulosomal scaffoldin to anchor the cellulases to the cell surface and the hydrolases do not have dockerin domains to attach to a scaffoldin. The inability of AT02-1 to degrade cellulose is unlikely to result from the disruption of an extracellular, cellulosome-like complex. Although <italic>C</italic>. <italic>phytofermentans</italic> is different from other cellulolytic clostridia in having only one family 9 hydrolase, numerous other <italic>C. phytofermentan</italic>s hydrolases are upregulated on hemicellulose and cellulose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>), suggesting that the breakdown of cellulose requires the co-ordinated action of multiple enzymes.</p><p>How do we explain the critical dependence of <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> upon Cphy3367 for cellulose degradation? There are well-studied members of the same GH9 subfamily as Cphy3367 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). The protein with the highest sequence similarity to Cphy3367 in the NCBI database is <italic>Clostridium stercorarium</italic> CelZ, with which Cphy3367 shares 65% amino acid identity. Cphy3367 and CelZ have the same domain organization and the CelZ catalytic residues D84 and E447 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Riedel and Bronnenmeier, 1999</xref>) are conserved in Cphy3367 as D83 and E446. Degradation of crystalline cellulose is typically achieved by a synergy between endocellulases to liberate cellulose chains from the cellulose surface and exocellulases to cleave these chains into oligosaccharides. However, GH9 proteins in the subfamily with Cphy3367, such as <italic>C. stercorarium</italic> CelZ, are unusual in that they act both as endoglucanases and as exoglucanases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Jauris <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>). Purified <italic>C. thermocellum</italic> CelI is sufficient to solubilize filter paper <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Gilad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Our results build upon this finding by showing that Cphy3367 is required by <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> to solubilize filter paper <italic>in vivo</italic>. Cphy3367 may have the central role in cellulose degradation, with other cellulases having accessory functions. Alternatively, some or all of the <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> cellulases may have required non-redundant functions to break down cellulose such that inactivation of these genes would have similar phenotypes to AT02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7A</xref>). Future gene inactivation studies will reveal the relative contributions of other <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> hydrolases to cellulose degradation.</p><fig id="fig07" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Non-exclusive models for the roles of Cphy3367 in cellulose degradation.

Cphy3367 has two family 3 CBMs (CBM3): one adjacent to the hydrolytic domain and one at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). CBMs promote polysaccharide degradation by bringing the enzyme into prolonged, close association with the surface of the carbohydrate. Although CBMs are generally non-catalytic, some CBMs have been shown to actively disrupt the polysaccharide structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Din <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). In the GH9 subfamily with Cphy3367, the CBM adjacent to the GH9 domain has been shown to potentiate the catalytic activity while the C-terminal CBM anchors the enzyme to the insoluble, cellulosic substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Sakon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Both CBMs are required for the enzyme to have full activity on crystalline cellulose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Gilad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). It has been proposed that the hydrolase domain and adjacent CBM of CelZ structurally modify the substrate by freeing cellulose chains to make them accessible to other cellulases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Riedel and Bronnenmeier, 1999</xref>). In the <italic>Hypocrea jecorina</italic> Cel7A hydrolase, the CBM and the catalytic domain are proposed to function as a molecular machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Mulakala and Reilly, 2005</xref>) where the CBM is a wedge to pry cellulose chains from the crystalline cellulose surface. The CBM then functions as a Brownian ratchet to pass the freed chain to the GH domain for cleavage. Similarly, <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> may require Cphy3367 to free cellulose chains from the cellulose fibril for attack by other cellulases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7B</xref>).</p><p>Cphy3367 also has two, tandem C-terminal domains of unknown function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>) that are alternatively called DUF291, hydrophilic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Pages <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), or X2 modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Mosbah <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). In addition to being found in Cphy3367, DUF291 domains are found in Cphy2128 (GH26), Cphy3202 (GH5) and Cphy3368 (GH48). Homologous domains are found in the scaffoldin proteins of <italic>C. cellulolyticum</italic> (CipC), <italic>C. cellulovorans</italic> (CbpA) and <italic>C. josui</italic> (CipA) as well as the hydrolases CelY and CelZ from <italic>C. stercorarium</italic>. The CbpA DUF291 domains bind both cellulose and the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kosugi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and have thus been proposed both to promote cellulose degradation and to anchor the cellulosome to the cell surface. Similarly, the DUF291 domains of Cphy3367 may be critical to degrade cellulose or to attach Cphy3367 to the cell surface while the CBM domains bind Cphy3367 to the cellulosic substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7C</xref>). The inability of AT02 to degrade cellulose could be due, at least in part, to an inability to retain the cell in close enough proximity to the cellulose substrate so that hydrolases can function efficiently.</p><p>Microbial cellulose degradation is of global ecological importance to recycle photosynthetically fixed carbon. Further, a mechanistic understanding of how microbes break down cellulose will facilitate the development of cellulosic biofuels as renewable, carbon-neutral alternatives to fossil fuels. This study demonstrates that we can now study the genetic basis of cellulose degradation using targeted chromosomal insertions in <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic>. If the intron is modified to contain a gene of interest, genomic insertion of the intron would allow stable expression of this gene on the chromosome. As these introns do not rely upon host-encoded factors for insertion, they may be generally applicable to the study of cellulolytic clostridia. In this study, we applied these introns for targeted disruption of a glycoside hydrolase gene, <italic>cphy3367</italic>. Among the many <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> glycoside hydrolase genes that are upregulated during growth on cellulosic substrates, it is encouraging that the inactivation of a single gene had a strong effect upon cellulose degradation because it suggests that this process can be engineered using reverse genetics focusing on individual genes.

ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Meyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1977</xref>) and pQint3367. To mate <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic>, a 10 ml culture of the <italic>E. coli</italic> donor was grown overnight in LB medium containing 50 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> carbenicillin to select for pRK24 and 200 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> erythromycin to select for pQint3367. The culture was washed twice with LB medium to remove residual antibiotics and re-suspended in 100 &#x003bc;l of LB medium. <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> was cultured anaerobically in GS2 glucose medium overnight to late log phase (0.9 OD<sub>600</sub>). Approximately 0.5 ml of the <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> culture was then centrifuged and re-suspended in 100 &#x003bc;l of GS2 medium. The <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> were mixed, aliquoted on solid GS2 medium as a series of 10 &#x003bc;l spots, and allowed to mate overnight at 32&#x000b0;C in anaerobic jars. Parallel, mock matings of <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> conjugal donors lacking pQint3367 were conducted to ensure that erythromycin resistance in <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> required transfer of pQint3367. After mating, the cells were re-suspended from the plates into 5 ml of liquid GS2 medium containing 40 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> nalidixic acid and 10 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> trimethoprim and were cultured anaerobically for 3 h. These cultures did not contain erythromycin to permit the <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> to recover from the mating. The cultures were centrifuged, re-suspended in 50 &#x003bc;l of GS2, and plated on GS2 solid medium containing 40 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> nalidixic acid, 10 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> trimethoprim and 40 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> erythromycin. The plates were incubated anaerobically for 6 days at 32&#x000b0;C. Erythromycin-resistant <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> colonies were picked, transferred to liquid GS2 medium containing 200 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> erythromycin and cultured anaerobically. Once cultures had grown to OD<sub>600</sub> &#x0003e; 0.5, the absence of residual <italic>E. coli</italic> cells was confirmed by plating a 50 &#x003bc;l aliquot on solid LB medium and incubating aerobically at 37&#x000b0;C overnight.</p></sec><sec><title>Southern blotting</title><p>To prepare a Southern blot, <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> genomic DNA was isolated from 3 ml of cultures using a Qiagen Genomic Tip 20/G (Cat 10223). One microgram of genomic DNA was digested with HindIII, which does not cut in the intron insertion, and resolved by electrophoresis. The DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Perkin Elmer Genescreen, Cat NEF972001PK) and cross-linked using a Stratagene UV Stratalinker 2400. The blot was probed with a <sup>32</sup>P-labelled intron PCR product that was amplified from pQint3367 with primers Ibs_3367 and Ebs1d_3367.</p></sec><sec><title>qRT-PCR</title><p>Cultures of wild-type and AT02 <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> strains were grown in GS2 medium containing either hemicellulose xylan, glucose or cellulose as a sole carbon source. Cells were collected by centrifugation in mid-log phase for glucose and hemicellulose cultures; samples were taken from cellulose cultures after 2 weeks of growth. RNA was extracted using Ribopure Bacteria Kit (Ambion AM1925) and residual DNA was removed using DNase I (Ambion AM2222). Total RNA yields were approximately 5 &#x003bc;g of RNA per ml of culture. One microgram RNA was reverse transcribed to single-stranded DNA using the Superscript First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen 11904018). Real-time PCR amplification was conducted using a MJ Research DNA Engine Opticon II machine by monitoring incorporation of SYBR green I (Invitrogen S7563). PCR primers were designed to amplify 100 bp products from each gene (see Supporting information S3 for primer sequences). Relative gene expression was quantified using the comparative C<sub>T</sub> method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Schmittgen and Livak, 2008</xref>) with the 16S ribosomal sequence serving as the internal control gene. Expression levels represent the means of duplicate measurements taken from duplicate cultures (see Supporting information S3 for qRT-PCR data files).</p></sec><sec><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>Protein lysates were prepared by French press from cultures of wild-type <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> grown in GS2 medium containing either glucose, hemicellulose xylan or filter paper cellulose as the sole carbon source. Proteins were precipitated by adding one-fourth volume of 100% (w/w) trichloroacetic acid in water, re-suspended in 1% SDS, 0.2 M NaOH and 10 mM DTT and incubated for 60 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Cysteine residues were then derivatized with iodoacetic acid (30 mM) at room temperature in the dark for 60 min. Five hundred micrograms of protein was resolved on 4&#x02013;12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen NP0335BOX). Gels were sliced into eight sections and proteins were in-gel digested as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Shevchenko <italic>et al.</italic> (1996</xref>). The resulting peptides were subjected to C18 solid-phase extraction using Waters SepPak cartridges (Waters WAT054960). Purified peptides were analysed by microcapillary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using an in-house prepared 125-&#x003bc;m-ID C18 reversed-phase column and a hybrid linear quadrupole/FT-ICR mass spectrometer (LTQ FT, Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Haas <italic>et al.</italic> (2006</xref>).</p><p>Acquired MS/MS spectra were searched against a concatentated target/decoy protein sequence database consisting of the predicted proteins from <italic>C. phytofermentans</italic> (NCBI NC_010001.faa), common contaminants such as trypsin and human keratins, and the reversed sequences of these proteins used as decoy component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Elias and Gygi, 2007</xref>). Database searches were performed using the SEQUEST algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Eng <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). Peptide assignments for each treatment were filtered to a protein false discovery rate of smaller than 1%. The number of peptides that could be uniquely mapped to <italic>cphy3366&#x02013;9</italic> were defined based upon peptide sequence, charge state and the gel section from which they were identified. Peptide counts per protein represent the mean of duplicate cultures for each treatment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank A.L. Sonenshein, W. Haas, F. Winston and D.
