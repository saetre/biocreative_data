To investigate the role of this unique structure in aminoacylation, we constructed in vitro transcripts corresponding to the E. coli histidine tRNA sequence and its variants at the G-1-C73 base pair, by using T7 RNA polymerase transcription system. A transcript having a wild-type sequence with no modified bases was a good substrate for histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS), and aminoacylation activity was affected by introduction of a triphosphate at the 5' terminus. Base replacements at position 73 caused a marked decrease of Vmax, and deletion and substitution of the G-1 had a remarkable effect on the aminoacylation. A mutant having an A-1-U73 pair was also not a good substrate for HisRS. Comparison among G-1-deficient mutants showed that A was preferable rather than C as the base at position 73. These data demonstrate that the set of the G-1-C73 pair at the end of the acceptor stem of histidine tRNA is crucial for the catalytic process of aminoacylation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00136-0282.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7855"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00136-0283.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7856"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00136-0284.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7857"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00136-0285.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7858"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00136-0286.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7859"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00136-0287.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7860"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00136-0288.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7861"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00136-0289.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7862"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00136-0290.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7863"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
