Yet how it functions is not well understood. The Murid Herpesvirus-4 gH, like that of other herpesviruses, adopts its normal virion conformation by associating with gL. However, gH switched back to a gL-independent conformation after virion endocytosis. This switch coincided with a conformation switch in gB and with capsid release. Virions lacking gL constitutively expressed the down-stream form of gH, prematurely switched gB to its down-stream form, and showed premature capsid release with poor infectivity. These data argue that gL plays a key role in regulating a gH and gB functional switch from cell binding to membrane fusion.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Enveloped viruses deliver their capsids to the cytoplasm by fusing with either the plasma membrane or the limiting membranes of endocytic vesicles.

Nevertheless, the conservation of gB and gH/gL implies that they operate similarly in these and other herpesviruses once the fusion mechanism is engaged.

Structural analysis of the Herpes simplex virus gB has <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Heldwein1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> shown how these might be made available. Comparison with the Vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Roche1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> suggests that the crystallized form of gB, with its distinct crown formed mainly from C-terminal domains, is a down-stream form. Consistent with this, the Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) gB switches during entry from having readily accessible N-terminal epitopes and poorly accessible epitopes involving C-terminal domains to the converse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Gillet3">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The N-terminal domains are involved in cell binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Gillet1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, gB on extracellular MuHV-4 virions adopts a conformation that allows cell-binding, then following endocytosis undergoes a pH-dependent conformation switch that leads to membrane fusion. Whether this conformation change itself drives membrane fusion, as for Vesicular stomatitis virus, or whether further conformation changes are required along the lines suggested by Heldwein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Heldwein1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, remains unclear.</p><p>While quite a lot is known about gB, much less is known about gH/gL. Understanding gH/gL therefore presents the major obstacle to understanding herpesvirus entry. Unlike gH, gL lacks obvious fusion loops or a trans-membrane domain. Its contribution to membrane fusion is therefore likely to be indirect. So far, gL has been defined only as a chaperone for gH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Gill1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Hutchinson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Kaye1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

These differences may reflect how gB and gH associate. The Herpes simplex virus gB and gH come together only when gD is ligated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Avitabile1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Atanasiu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, so their interaction is likely to involve extracellular domains; for gH, this would imply a requirement for gL. The MuHV-4 gB and gH associate constitutively and independently of gL, probably via an intra-membrane interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Gillet5">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Because MuHV-4 does not require gH/gL for viability, it provides a convenient tool with which to explore gL-dependent down-stream events in viral entry.</p><p>gL<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MuHV-4 virions do show some attenuation relative to the wild-type. One deficit is reduced binding to BHK-21 fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Gillet4">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This reflects that gH/gL binds to GAGs, whereas gH alone does not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Gillet2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, gL-deficient virions infect NMuMG epithelial poorly even though they bind to them quite well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Gillet4">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. gL must therefore have another function that is important for NMuMG cell infection. Here we identify an entry-associated conformation change in gH that was consistent with gL dissociation in late endosomes, the site of MuHV-4 capsid release. When virions lacked gL, gH and gB both adopted their down-stream forms prematurely. This led to premature capsid release and poor infectivity. An important function of gL is therefore to regulate the gB and gH conformation changes that lead to viral membrane fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The MuHV-4 gH changes conformation after endocytosis</title><p>MuHV-4 infects adherent cells via endocytosis.

We looked for evidence of a gL-dependent post-binding infection deficit by binding gL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and gL<sup>&#x02212;</sup> virions to NMuMG cells for 3 h, washing off any unbound virions, and then comparing the initial virion uptake with subsequent viral eGFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002811-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

However, the underlying molecular events are likely to be similar. Endocytic entry is easier to dissect because binding and fusion remain anatomically distinct. MuHV-4 capsid release after endocytic entry was associated with conformation switches in both gB and gH. Low pH was a key trigger of these switches and gL was a key negative regulator. Thus, by associating with newly synthesized gH in the endoplasmic reticulum gL sets virions for cell binding, and by dissociating again in late endosomes of the next cell it triggers membrane fusion.</p><p>Analogy with the Vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Galdiero1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Roche1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> would suggest that the conformation changes in the MuHV-4 gB are intrinsic to its fusion mechanism, with the stable BN-1A7<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or MG-1A12<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> forms representing the respective pre- and post-fusion states. This general model does not apply so easily to gH (gH/gL being pre-fusion and gH-only post-fusion), as gL<sup>&#x02212;</sup> virions fail to express gH/gL yet fuse more readily than the wild-type rather than less. It is possible that gL<sup>&#x02212;</sup> virions express another, as yet unidentified, pre-fusion form of gH. However, we have found no antigenic evidence of other forms (data not shown). Our working hypothesis is therefore that gH/gL and gH-only are both pre-fusion - gH/gL being up-stream of gH-only - and that further gH conformation changes accompany fusion itself. In support of this, gH-only epitopes tended to disappear after a 4 h 37&#x000b0;C incubation, whereas MG-1A12-type gB epitopes were maintained (data not shown). Thus, gL dissociation from gH appears to prime gH for membrane fusion rather than being a part of the fusion reaction per se.</p><p>A pre-fusion conformation change cannot be ruled out for gB either. Heldwein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Galdiero1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> proposed that their gB conformation - which is probably a down-stream form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Roche2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> - undergoes further changes to reveal fusion loops. The neutralization epitopes mapped onto this structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Galdiero1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> would also be difficult to explain if it were simply a post-fusion form. Thus, although the default explanation has to be that gB functions like the Vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G because of their structural homology, it is also possible that the herpesvirus membrane fusion mechanism is different. gB and gH conformation changes must drive fusion, but this does not necessarily mean that every conformation change is part of the fusion mechanism. It is possible that the conformation changes described for Vesicular stomatits virus have for herpesviruses acquired a different function. But whatever the precise fusion mechanism of herpesviruses, a central role for the MuHV-4 gL in stabilizing gH and gB against engaging in fusion seemed clear.</p><p>The influence of gL on the conformation of gB was presumably indirect. A loss of gL would change gH/gL to gH-only and would therefore disrupt the interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Gillet7">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> between gH/gL and the gB N-terminus (gB-NT). This would not separate gH from gB, since their association is independent of both gL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Gillet5">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and gB-NT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Gillet7">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, but could promote a conformation change in the gB extracellular domain. Consistent with such a scheme, MuHV-4 lacking gB-NT shows a gB conformational instability much like that of gL<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Gillet7">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The gB-NT-gH/gL interaction does not appear to play a significant role in stabilizing gH/gL, since gB-NT-deficient mutants maintain gH/gL expression and infect normally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Gillet7">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore the gB conformation change alone is not sufficient for fusion: gL rather than gB-NT is the key fusion regulator. We envisage that the late endosomal milieu disrupts the gH/gL interaction, with low pH playing an important permissive role; gH then changes its conformation to allow hemi-fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Subramanian1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and displace gB-NT; this then allows gB to switch to its pro-fusion form and complete the fusion reaction. In this way, the whole of membrane fusion can be regulated by gL. The neatness of this mechanism for regulating virion entry suggests that it will prove common to many herpesviruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells, viruses, mice</title><p>BHK-21 fibroblasts, NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, NMuMG epithelial cells, and MCCD epithelial cells were propagated as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002811-Gillet7">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.
