Mutations in all five affect axon guidance, either alone or in combination. Highly penetrant central nervous system (CNS) and motor axon guidance alterations are usually observed only when specific combinations of two or more RPTPs are removed. Here, we examine the sixth RPTP, Ptp4E, which is broadly expressed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ptp4E and Ptp10D are closely related type III RPTPs. Non-drosophilid insect species have only one type III RPTP, which is closest to Ptp10D. We found that <italic>Ptp4E </italic>mutants are viable and fertile. We then examined <italic>Ptp4E Ptp10D </italic>double mutants. These die before the larval stage, and have a mild CNS phenotype in which the outer longitudinal 1D4 bundle is frayed. <italic>Ptp10D Ptp69D </italic>double mutants have a strong CNS phenotype in which 1D4 axons abnormally cross the midline and the outer and middle longitudinal bundles are fused to the inner bundle. To examine if <italic>Ptp4E </italic>also exhibits synthetic phenotypes in combination with <italic>Ptp69D</italic>, we made <italic>Ptp4E Ptp69D </italic>double mutants and <italic>Ptp4E Ptp10D Ptp69D </italic>triple mutants. No phenotype was observed in the double mutant. The triple mutant phenotype differs from the <italic>Ptp10D Ptp69D </italic>phenotype in two ways. First, the longitudinal tracts appear more normal than in the double mutant; two or three bundles are observed, although they are disorganized and fused. Second, axons labelled by the SemaIIB-&#x003c4;Myc marker often cross in the wrong commissure. We also examined motor axon guidance, and found that no phenotypes are observed in any <italic>Ptp4E </italic>double mutant combination. However, triple mutants in which <italic>Ptp4E Ptp10D </italic>was combined with <italic>Ptp69D </italic>or <italic>Ptp52F </italic>exhibited stronger phenotypes than the corresponding <italic>Ptp10D </italic>double mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Type III RPTPs are required for viability in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, since <italic>Ptp4E Ptp10D </italic>double mutants die before the larval stage. Unlike Ptp10D, Ptp4E appears to be a relatively minor player in the control of axon guidance. Strong phenotypes are only observed in triple mutants in which both type III RPTPs are eliminated together with Ptp69D or Ptp52F. Our results allow us to construct a complete genetic interaction matrix for all six of the RPTPs.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Signalling via tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for axon guidance in many systems. Target proteins involved in signal transduction and cytoskeletal dynamics in growth cones are phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases (TKs) and dephosphorylated by tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs).</p><p>In a simplified view of phosphotyrosine pathways controlling cell growth and differentiation, signaling is triggered by engagement of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by ligands. Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization and phosphorylation of downstream targets. RTK signalling is downregulated by dephosphorylation of autophosphorylated RTKs and other signalling molecules by cytoplasmic PTPs. In this scenario, the PTPs are passive modulators of a process in which the 'informational' event that initiates signalling is ligand binding to the RTK.</p><p>In contrast, phosphotyrosine signalling pathways involved in growth cone guidance in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryonic central nervous system (CNS) involve receptor tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) and cytoplasmic TKs. Like RTKs, RPTPs are modular signalling receptors. They have cell adhesion molecule-like extracellular (XC) domains, linked via a single transmembrane region to one or two cytoplasmic PTP domains. Five of the six fly <italic>Rptp </italic>genes are selectively expressed in CNS neurons, and all of these genes have loss-of-function phenotypes that affect axon guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The TK that is central to many growth cone guidance events in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryo is Abl, a cytoplasmic kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila </italic>has many RTKs, but no functional RTK has been implicated in embryonic axon guidance (the kinase-related axon guidance receptors Derailed and Off-track are thought to lack enzymatic activity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These facts suggest that phosphotyrosine signalling in growth cones could be controlled in a manner opposite to that used in RTK pathways. In this scheme, the growth cone would use a cytoplasmic TK to constitutively phosphorylate targets, and the 'information' that alters signalling strength would be transmitted via engagement of RPTPs by ligands located on the surfaces over which the growth cone travels.</p><p>Of course, this is a greatly oversimplified picture, because there are many other receptors that can influence phosphotyrosine signalling in embryonic growth cones. For example, the Roundabout 1 (Robo1) receptor is an essential regulator of axon guidance across the midline. Phosphorylation of Robo1 by Abl may be regulated by Robo1's engagement of its ligand Slit, and in this case the 'information' that triggers signalling would be delivered via Slit binding to Robo1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Also, it is unlikely that phosphorylation by Abl is an unregulated, constitutive process. Nevertheless, it is striking that the receptors are kinases and the cytoplasmic modulators are phosphatases in pathways that regulate cell growth, while the reverse seems to be true for pathways that control neuronal growth cone guidance.</p><p>RPTP pathways are poorly understood relative to RTK pathways, partially because <italic>in vivo </italic>ligands that regulate axon guidance and synaptogenesis have been identified only for the <italic>Drosophila </italic>Lar RPTP. These are the heparan sulfate proteoglycans Syndecan and Dallylike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, Lar also has non-heparan sulfate proteoglycan ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and ligands for the other five fly RPTPs have not yet been defined. It has also been difficult to identify substrates that are important for RPTP signalling <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Five <italic>Drosophila </italic>RPTPs have been genetically characterized in published papers. Four of these (Ptp10D, Lar, Ptp69D, Ptp99A) are expressed only on CNS axons in late embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and the fifth, Ptp52F, is CNS-specific but is expressed on both axons and cell bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. All of the published zygotic phenotypes for these genes are alterations in axon guidance, suggesting that this is the major function of this gene family in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In contrast, many mammalian RPTPs are expressed in non-neural tissues and have functions unrelated to axon guidance.</p><p>The RPTPs regulate both CNS and motor axon guidance. There is extensive redundancy among the five genes, so that highly penetrant guidance phenotypes are usually observed only when two or more RPTPs are genetically removed. Studies of motor axon guidance indicate that each guidance decision made by motoneuron growth cones requires a specific subset of the RPTPs. For example, axons in the ISNb nerve are unable to defasciculate from the common ISN pathway in <italic>Lar Ptp69D Ptp99A </italic>triple mutants. The later decision by ISNb axons to enter their target muscle field fails in <italic>Lar </italic>single mutants, so that the axons bypass the muscle field, but the bypass phenotype is suppressed and muscle field entry restored in <italic>Lar Ptp99A </italic>double mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This example illustrates that RPTPs can exhibit either functional redundancy, in which the absence of one RPTP is compensated for by another RPTP, or competition, in which removal of a second RPTP suppresses the guidance errors caused by the absence of the first RPTP. Similar genetic interactions among RPTPs may also occur in vertebrates, as two recent papers show that double mutant combinations and RNA interference perturbations involving the vertebrate Lar and type III (Ptp10D-like) RPTP subfamilies produce complex alterations in motor axon guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we examine the functions of the sixth and last <italic>Drosophila </italic>RPTP, Ptp4E. This protein is closely related to Ptp10D, and is the product of a recent gene duplication. Unlike the other RPTPs, <italic>Ptp4E </italic>is widely expressed in late embryos. When we began these studies, we thought that <italic>Ptp4E </italic>mutations might have phenotypes affecting many non-neural tissues, since loss of Ptp4E could not be compensated for by neural-specific RPTPs. However, our findings show that <italic>Ptp4E </italic>single mutants have no detectable phenotypes, because Ptp4E is redundant with the closely related Ptp10D. Double mutant embryos lacking both of these RPTPs die at hatching, but they have specific phenotypes affecting only CNS axons and tracheal cells.</p><p>Here we describe the axon guidance phenotypes produced by <italic>Ptp4E </italic>mutant combinations. The tracheal phenotypes will be described elsewhere (MJ and KZ, manuscript in preparation). The data in this paper, together with those in earlier papers from our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], allow us to construct complete pairwise interaction matrices that define how all six <italic>Drosophila </italic>RPTPs regulate CNS and motor axon guidance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Evolution of <italic>Ptp4E</italic></title><p><italic>Ptp10D </italic>and <italic>Ptp4E </italic>are clearly the result of a gene duplication that occurred much more recently than the split between the other <italic>Drosophila Rptp </italic>genes. The amino acid sequences of their catalytic PTP domains share 89% identity, versus 36&#x02013;40% identity for pairwise comparisons of <italic>Ptp4E </italic>with other <italic>Drosophila </italic>RPTPs. Their XC domains have a very similar organization, containing chains of 11 FN3 repeats in Ptp4E and 12 FN3 repeats in Ptp10D, and are 58% identical in amino acid sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). The <italic>Ptp4E </italic>gene encodes two predicted preproteins, of 1,767 and 1,607 amino acids, while the <italic>Ptp10D </italic>gene encodes preproteins of 1,931 and 1,631 amino acids. The sequences that differ between the alternative gene products are at the carboxyl terminus in both cases, but there is no sequence similarity between the Ptp4E and Ptp10D proteins within this region. Both genes reside on the X chromosome, and the nine <italic>Ptp4E </italic>introns within conserved coding sequence all correspond exactly in position to <italic>Ptp10D </italic>introns. <italic>Ptp10D </italic>has one additional intron not found in <italic>Ptp4E</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Organization of the <italic>Ptp4E </italic>gene and protein, and evolutionary analysis. <bold>(a) </bold>The EP425 element that was used to generate the <italic>ptp4E</italic><sup>1 </sup>allele was inserted 1,157 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site.

This is visualized in the tree by comparing the branch lengths connecting Ptp4E and Ptp10D to other insect species. <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>Ptp10D is closer than Ptp4E to the sequences in other insects that have only one type III RPTP gene, indicating greater sequence similarity. Also, the Ptp4E sequence evolved much faster than the Ptp10D sequence after the duplication (compare the branch lengths within the <italic>melanogaster/ananassae/virilis </italic>cluster for the two genes). <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, mosquito; <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, mosquito; <italic>A. mellifera</italic>, honey bee.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1749-8104-3-3-1"/></fig><p>The <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>gene <italic>dep-1 </italic>is the ortholog of both <italic>Ptp10D </italic>and <italic>Ptp4E</italic>. Humans and mice have five genes encoding type III RPTPs, defined as proteins with XC domains composed of long chains of FN3 domains and a single PTP domain. Among these, the product of the PTPRB gene (PTP&#x003b2;, not to be confused with RPTP&#x003b2;, which is a different protein also known as PTP&#x003b6;) has a somewhat higher alignment score to Ptp10D and Ptp4E than the other four mammalian type III proteins. These are: DEP-1/CD148, encoded by the <italic>Ptprj </italic>gene; PTPRO; SAP-1, encoded by the <italic>Ptprh </italic>gene; and PTPRQ. Since the radiation into the five mammalian genes seen today occurred after the split between arthropods and mammals, one cannot define any of the type III mammalian genes as an ortholog of one of the fly genes. A more complete description of the relationships among all the <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and mammalian RPTPs is found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The recent availability of genome sequences from twelve different <italic>Drosophila </italic>species, three mosquito species, two hymenopterans, a beetle, and the silkmoth allowed us to trace the evolution of the <italic>Ptp10D/Ptp4E </italic>gene pair within insect lineages. Surprisingly, we find that the <italic>Ptp4E </italic>gene is found only in drosophilid species. Mosquitoes, which are also dipterans, and all other sequenced insects have only a single <italic>Rptp </italic>gene corresponding to this gene pair. This gene is always much more closely related to <italic>Ptp10D </italic>than to <italic>Ptp4E</italic>. In addition, the <italic>Ptp4E </italic>sequence exhibits more sequence diversity among the drosophilid species than does the <italic>Ptp10D </italic>sequence. These data indicate that <italic>Ptp10D </italic>is the ancestral gene and that its sequence has been constrained more by evolution than the <italic>Ptp4E </italic>sequence since the time of the duplication. <italic>Ptp4E </italic>has evolved much more rapidly, suggesting that it may have acquired new function(s) since its emergence or was less essential for fitness than <italic>Ptp10D</italic>. These relationships are displayed in the phylogenetic tree of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>Ptp10D </italic>ortholog found in all insect species always contains the <italic>Ptp10D</italic>-specific intron, and all <italic>Ptp4E </italic>orthologs in drosophilids lack this intron. This suggests that the intron may have been lost at the time of the duplication from the copy that evolved into <italic>Ptp4E</italic>. This would have been between 235 million years ago (the estimated time at which the mosquito and fly lineages diverged from each other) and 40 million years ago (the estimated time at which the radiation among the 12 sequenced drosophilid species occurred) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>We attempted to trace the history of the duplication by examining the genes adjacent to <italic>Ptp10D </italic>and <italic>Ptp4E</italic>, but found that the organizations of the <italic>Ptp10D </italic>and <italic>Ptp4E </italic>regions in <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>arose long after the <italic>Ptp10D </italic>and <italic>Ptp4E </italic>genes diverged from each other. <italic>Ptp10D </italic>is flanked by the <italic>Rst(1)JH </italic>and <italic>bifocal </italic>genes. <italic>Rst(1)JH </italic>is found upstream of the <italic>Ptp10D </italic>ortholog in both the <italic>obscura </italic>and <italic>melanogaster </italic>groups, but is separated from it in <italic>D. willistoni </italic>and all other drosophilids. <italic>bifocal </italic>orthologs are adjacent to the <italic>Ptp10D </italic>gene only in the <italic>melanogaster </italic>group. Similarly, the two genes flanking <italic>Ptp4E</italic>, <italic>SIP3 </italic>and <italic>CG4068</italic>, are located next to the <italic>Ptp4E </italic>ortholog only within the <italic>obscura </italic>and <italic>melanogaster </italic>groups.

Expression in the CNS can also be seen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>). Finally, at stage 17 expression is much higher in the gut than elsewhere, with particularly strong expression observed in the hindgut and at the anterior end of the midgut (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2f</xref>).</p><p>To examine Ptp4E protein expression and localization, we generated a variety of mouse monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against Ptp4E. We made a construct that consisted of 6&#x000d7;-His-tagged Ptp4E XC domain fused to human placental alkaline phosphatase (PTP4E:AP; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). PTP4E:AP was expressed in insect cells, purified over a Ni-NTA column, and injected into mice. To characterize the resulting antibodies, we first stained embryos that overexpressed Ptp4E-GFP using the <italic>engrailed</italic>-GAL4 driver. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2g,h</xref> shows double staining of a germ-band extended embryo with anti-Ptp4E (red) and anti-GFP (green). The polyclonal antibodies clearly recognize the Ptp4E protein, as anti-Ptp4E (red) signal colocalizes with anti-GFP (green) signal in the expected striped pattern. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2i</xref> shows a wild-type embryo at the same stage stained with anti-Ptp4E, where the expression appears to be ubiquitous. Note that the staining between the stripes in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2g</xref> is much weaker than within the stripes, suggesting that the endogenous protein is expressed at low levels.</p><p>Although the ubiquitous staining observed with the antibody is consistent with the <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization data, we cannot be sure that antibody staining in wild-type embryos is due to Ptp4E protein, because it is not significantly reduced in <italic>Ptp4E </italic>mutant embryos (<italic>Ptp4E</italic><sup>1 </sup>or <italic>Df(1)ovo4</italic>). This finding could be explained in two ways. First, <italic>Ptp4E</italic><sup>1 </sup>mutants might continue to make an abnormal Ptp4E protein(s) due to initiation of translation at methionine residues encoded in exons not removed by the excision mutation (the second methionine residue in Ptp4E is at amino acid 377, within an undeleted exon). This protein, if it exists, would lack a signal sequence and may be nonfunctional, because the CNS phenotypes of <italic>Ptp4E</italic><sup>1 </sup><italic>Ptp10D</italic><sup>1 </sup>and <italic>Df(1)ovo4 Ptp10D</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>/Y </italic>embryos are identical (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). <italic>Df(1)ovo4 </italic>deletes the entire <italic>Ptp4E </italic>gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The presence of antibody staining in <italic>Df(1)ovo4 </italic>mutants could be due to persistence of Ptp4E protein synthesized from maternal mRNA, since early embryos contain large amounts of <italic>Ptp4E </italic>mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Second, it is possible that our Ptp4E antibodies cross-react with another ubiquitously expressed protein. They do not cross-react with Ptp10D, because the signal does not decrease in <italic>Ptp10D</italic><sup>1 </sup>mutant embryos.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>CNS phenotype of <italic>Ptp4E Ptp10D </italic>double mutants. <bold>(a-d,h) </bold>Stage 17 embryos were stained with mAb 1D4 and visualized using HRP immunohistochemistry. <bold>(e-g) </bold>Stage 17 embryos expressing the transgene SemaIIb-&#x003c4;myc were stained with anti-Myc antibodies, and images are projections of confocal stacks.

To do this, we drove Ptp4E-GFP with the pan-neuronal <italic>elav</italic>-GAL4 driver. In these embryos, bright staining of both CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons is observed with anti-Ptp4E and anti-GFP antibodies, and the two patterns are superimposable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2j&#x02013;o</xref>). Interestingly, Ptp4E-GFP also appears to localize to neuronal cell bodies in the PNS and CNS (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2j&#x02013;l</xref>). In contrast, Ptp10D, Ptp69D, Lar, and Ptp99A, which are restricted to axons in wild-type embryos, are also axon-specific when overexpressed (unpublished data).</p><p>Expression of Ptp10D protein was detected only in the nervous system in published work.

These findings suggest that the embryonic/larval lethality of <italic>Ptp4E</italic><sup>1 </sup><italic>Ptp10D</italic><sup>1 </sup>animals might be due to either nervous system or tracheal phenotypes. In fact, we have found that these embryos have severe tracheal defects. These will be described elsewhere (MJ and KZ, manuscript in preparation). Their nervous system defects, however, are relatively mild (see below), and would not be expected to produce early lethality. Consistent with this, we find that GAL4-driven pan-neural expression of a UAS-Ptp4E-GFP fusion, which is capable of rescuing the tracheal phenotype when driven in tracheal cells by <italic>breathless</italic>-GAL4 (MJ and KZ, manuscript in preparation), does not rescue lethality in the <italic>Ptp4E</italic><sup>1 </sup><italic>Ptp10D</italic><sup>1 </sup>background.</p><p>Driving Ptp10D in tracheae with <italic>breathless</italic>-GAL4 in a <italic>Ptp4E</italic><sup>1 </sup><italic>Ptp10D</italic><sup><italic>EP</italic>1172 </sup>background (the <italic>EP1172 </italic>line is a UAS-containing P element insertion upstream of the gene, so it allows rescue by crossing in GAL4 drivers) rescues lethality, allowing some adults to emerge.

We observed that the <italic>Ptp4E Ptp10D; Ptp69D </italic>triple mutant has a strong 1D4 phenotype, with extensive ectopic midline crossing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4f</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The 1D4 pattern shows midline crossing defects like those observed in <italic>Ptp10D Ptp69D </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], in which a 1D4-positive bundle crosses in the posterior commissure, but the crossing bundle often is thicker than in the double mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4f</xref>, asterisk).</p><p>The longitudinal tracts look different from those in <italic>Ptp10D Ptp69D </italic>mutants, because they have more distinct bundles. In <italic>Ptp10D Ptp69D</italic>, two 1D4 bundles are observed that sometimes fuse into one, and the CNS is narrowed, suggesting that the outer bundle is missing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). In the triple mutants, there are always two, and sometimes three, longitudinal bundles. Extensive fusion and breakage of the bundles are observed, however (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4f</xref>).</p><p>When examined with SemaIIB-&#x003c4;Myc, the <italic>Ptp10D Ptp69D </italic>double mutant displays occasional ectopic crossing by single axons in the posterior commissure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>, arrowhead). Rare embryos have much more severe phenotypes in which the axons stall along the longitudinal pathways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>, asterisk), and axons project out of the CNS rather than along the longitudinal tracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>, arrows). The triple mutant is observed to have more ectopic midline crossing in the posterior commissure than does the double mutant, and the crossing bundles are thicker (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4g</xref>, arrowhead; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4h</xref>). In one segment of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4h</xref>, all of the axons that should project anteriorly appear to cross instead (top arrowhead). Other axons start crossing and then stall (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4g</xref>, asterisk). We never observed SemaIIB axons that projected out of the CNS in triple mutant embryos (n = 10). It is difficult to say whether removing Ptp4E from a <italic>Ptp10D Ptp69D </italic>double mutant suppresses or enhances the double mutant phenotype. The phenotype changes, so that the outer 1D4 longitudinal bundle is restored in some segments of triple mutants. However, more ectopic crossing of SemaIIB axons is observed, and the ectopically crossing 1D4 bundles are often thicker.</p><p>What does this pattern of phenotypic interactions imply about the roles of these three RPTPs in CNS axon guidance? First, the existence of the synthetic <italic>Ptp10D Ptp69D </italic>phenotype indicates that Ptp10D and Ptp69D have redundant functions with regard to control of midline crossing, and that the activities of Ptp10D that are compensated for by Ptp69D with respect to midline crossing are not shared with Ptp4E. Second, there could be additional Ptp69D functions in CNS axonal guidance that are redundant with Ptp4E activities that are not shared between Ptp4E and Ptp10D. However, elimination of these activities in <italic>Ptp4E Ptp69D </italic>double mutants does not produce a strong 1D4 or SemaIIB phenotype. Third, when all functions of the Ptp10D/Ptp4E subfamily of RPTPs are eliminated, the 1D4 and SemaIIB phenotypes are still weak because these functions are mostly redundant with activities of Ptp69D. Finally, when all the Ptp10D/Ptp4E functions are removed together with the Ptp69D functions, the phenotype is subtly altered relative to the <italic>Ptp10D Ptp69D </italic>phenotype. The lack of a strong synthetic triple mutant phenotype suggests that Ptp4E is a relatively minor player in regulation of CNS axon guidance.</p><p>An earlier study from our group examined CNS axons in double, triple, and quadruple mutant combinations of <italic>Lar</italic>, <italic>Ptp10D</italic>, <italic>Ptp69D</italic>, and <italic>Ptp99A </italic>mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Strikingly, in this paper it was found that <italic>Lar Ptp69D Ptp99A </italic>and <italic>Ptp10D Lar Ptp99A </italic>triple mutants both have an almost normal pattern of 1D4-positive longitudinal axons, but when the fourth RPTP is removed as well (in a <italic>Ptp10D Lar Ptp69D Ptp99A </italic>quadruple mutant) all of the 1D4-positive longitudinal pathways are converted to commissural pathways that cross the midline. Thus, Lar and Ptp99A can have a strong effect on CNS axon guidance, but only when they are removed together with both Ptp10D and Ptp69D.</p><p>We wondered whether analysis of other mutant combinations involving <italic>Ptp4E </italic>would produce results consistent with the idea that strong synthetic 1D4 CNS phenotypes are unique to combinations in which both <italic>Ptp10D </italic>and <italic>Ptp69D </italic>are mutant, as suggested by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].

The <italic>Ptp4E Ptp10D Ptp52F </italic>triple mutant does not show an obvious enhancement of phenotype relative to the <italic>Ptp10D Ptp52F </italic>double mutant (data not shown). In summary, of the eight mutant combinations involving <italic>Ptp4E </italic>that we examined, only the triple mutant that lacks both Ptp10D and Ptp69D has a strong CNS phenotype that is detectable with the markers used in this study.

One of the two SNa branches (anterior/dorsal or posterior/lateral) is missing in approximately 40% of hemisegments in zygotic null mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>When double, triple, and quadruple combinations of <italic>Rptp </italic>mutations were analyzed, we observed that other decisions are perturbed in specific patterns. Each combination of mutations has a unique phenotype, and the data suggest that specific RPTPs are required for each pathway choice made by motor axon growth cones. This is described for ISNb guidance in the Background section. Another example is extension of the ISN past branchpoints in the dorsal muscle field. In <italic>Lar </italic>single mutants, the ISN usually reaches its normal termination point but arborization on muscle 1 is reduced. In the absence of both Lar and Ptp69D, the ISN stops at the second branchpoint near muscle 2, while in <italic>Lar Ptp69D Ptp99A </italic>triple mutants it stops at the first branchpoint near muscle 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Not all combinations of <italic>Rptp </italic>mutations produce phenotypic enhancement. Ptp99A and Lar have opposing activities in controlling ISNb entry into the VLM field. Thus, in the strongest <italic>Lar </italic>mutant combination only 40% of ISNb branches successfully enter the VLM field, while in <italic>Lar Ptp99A </italic>double mutants this phenotype is almost completely suppressed, and approximately 96% of ISNbs enter the muscle field in a normal manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>For the first four RPTPs to be analyzed (Lar, Ptp69D, Ptp99A, Ptp10D), it was possible to construct and analyze all 15 possible single, double, triple, and quadruple mutant combinations, and thus obtain a complete picture of the genetic relationships among these signalling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. When we identified mutations in the fifth gene, <italic>Ptp52F</italic>, it became impossible to make and analyze every combination, so we examined only double mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These two studies led to the conclusion that Ptp10D is relatively unimportant, relative to the other RPTPs, for regulation of motor axon guidance. This conclusion is opposite to that reached for CNS axon guidance, where we observe ectopic midline crossing only in genotypes where Ptp10D is missing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Enhancement of <italic>Ptp52F </italic>phenotypes is observed in <italic>Ptp10D Ptp52F </italic>double mutants, so that ISNb 'stall' phenotypes, in which the ISNb stops short of its normal termination point at the ventral edge of muscle 12, and ISN truncation phenotypes are observed more frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These are the only double mutants involving <italic>Ptp10D </italic>that exhibit phenotypic enhancement relative to the corresponding single mutant. <italic>Ptp10D </italic>mutations increase the penetrance of some double and triple mutant motor axon phenotypes involving <italic>Lar</italic>, <italic>Ptp69D</italic>, and <italic>Ptp99A</italic>, and decrease the penetrance of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>We wondered whether this apparent lack of a role for Ptp10D in motor axon guidance arises from the fact that Ptp10D is the only RPTP in <italic>Drosophila </italic>that has a paralog within the same subfamily. Each of the other RPTPs appears to represent its own subfamily. The Lar subfamily has a representative in <italic>C. elegan</italic>s and three members in mammals, while Ptp69D and Ptp99A each have one worm counterpart but no obvious mammalian orthologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Ptp52F has similarities to type III RPTPs, but has a unique amino-terminal sequence and appears to be unique to drosophilids (unpublished results). Because of their close sequence relationship, the loss of Ptp10D function in the motor axon system might be compensated for by the presence of Ptp4E. This model predicts that <italic>Ptp4E </italic>double mutant combinations also would not exhibit phenotypic enhancement relative to the corresponding single mutants. Indeed, we found this to be the case: no motor axon phenotypes are observed in <italic>Ptp4E Ptp99A </italic>mutants, and the phenotypes seen in <italic>Ptp4E Ptp69D</italic>, <italic>Ptp4E Lar</italic>, and <italic>Ptp4E Ptp52F </italic>mutants are no stronger than in the corresponding <italic>Ptp69D</italic>, <italic>Lar</italic>, and <italic>Ptp52F </italic>single mutants. We also found that removal of both members of the Ptp10D subfamily, in <italic>Ptp4E Ptp10D </italic>double mutants, does not produce motor axon phenotypes, suggesting that the subfamily has no essential role in motor axon guidance that is not compensated for by the presence of one of the other RPTPs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and data not shown).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Motor axon phenotypes in <italic>Rptp </italic>double and triple mutant embryos</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center" colspan="6">Phenotype (%)*</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="6"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Genotype</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold>ISN</bold></td><td align="center"><italic>n</italic></td><td align="center"><italic>t</italic></td><td align="center">T</td><td align="center">SB</td><td align="center">FB</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;<italic>Ptp4E</italic><sup>1 </sup><italic>Ptp10D</italic><sup>1</sup></td><td align="center">155</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">0</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;<italic>Ptp4E</italic><sup>1</sup><italic>;

If so, this would indicate that there are motor axon guidance functions that are redundant between the Ptp10D subfamily and another subfamily, so that synthetic phenotypes would be observed only when both subfamilies are eliminated. To examine this question, we analyzed the triple mutants described above for motor axon phenotypes. Our data show that <italic>Ptp4E Ptp10D Lar </italic>mutants do not have any new phenotypes, and also do not exhibit phenotypic enhancement relative to <italic>Lar </italic>single mutants (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

This is a 'clump' phenotype in which 90% of ISNbs terminate in a darkly staining blob at the dorsal border of muscle 6 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5l,m</xref>). In cases where the ISNb passes this point, it is often misrouted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5k</xref>, right hemisegment), or bypasses the muscle field (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5l</xref>) by growing along the ISN. As in bypass phenotypes seen in other mutants, the axons often ectopically project interiorly to muscle 12 from the ISN (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5l</xref>, right arrow), suggesting that they retain an affinity for this muscle. <italic>Ptp10D Ptp69D </italic>double mutants have a similar percentage of ISNb branches that fail to reach muscle 12 (stall phenotype); however, these branches maintain a growth cone-like appearance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5j</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Motor axon defects in triple mutants.

We previously showed that <italic>Ptp10D Ptp69D </italic>double mutants have a SNa defect in which one of the branches is missing (13% penetrance of a completely absent branch). For a smaller percentage of SNas (10%), both branches are missing or the SNa fails to even reach the bifurcation point. In <italic>Ptp4E Ptp10D Ptp69D </italic>triple mutants, the penetrances of the missing branch phenotypes are similar to those in the double mutant, but an additional 9% of SNa nerves are very thin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5f</xref>, arrow) or completely absent; this phenotype is not seen in <italic>Ptp10D Ptp69D </italic>(<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) Also, there are SNa nerves that project along abnormal pathways (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>).</p><p>The other major effect on motor axon guidance we observed in response to loss of Ptp4E was enhancement of a <italic>Ptp10D Ptp52F </italic>phenotype in which the ISN is truncated at the second branchpoint.

In contrast, many of the 17 mammalian RPTPs are expressed in non-neural cell types and have a variety of functions unrelated to axon guidance. Since <italic>Ptp4E </italic>is the only widely expressed <italic>Rptp </italic>gene, we speculated that studying its mutant phenotype might reveal new functions for <italic>Drosophila </italic>RPTPs outside the nervous system, and that these might provide information about functions of mammalian non-neural RPTPs. One might have expected that <italic>Ptp4E </italic>mutations would cause lethality and produce strong phenotypes, since no other RPTPs would be able to compensate for the loss of Ptp4E in non-neural cells. This, however, is not the case. <italic>Ptp4E </italic>mutants are viable, fertile, and apparently healthy, and have no detectable phenotypes in the nervous system or elsewhere. Furthermore, our evolutionary analysis indicates that <italic>Ptp4E </italic>is a relatively recent invention; it is present in drosophilids but not in mosquitoes or non-dipteran arthropods. Within the drosophilids, its sequence also changes more rapidly than that of <italic>Ptp10D</italic>, suggesting that it has been less constrained by evolution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). All of these considerations indicate that Ptp4E is not essential for development of non-neural cell types in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Perhaps in <italic>Drosophila </italic>the functions executed by mammalian RPTPs in non-neural cell types are carried out by one or more of the eight nonreceptor PTPs. Some of these are ubiquitously expressed. Only three have been genetically characterized. Csw and PTP-ER are involved in cell fate determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Mutations in <italic>ptpmeg </italic>produce axonal defects in the adult brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Ptpmeg, however, does not act in the neurons that exhibit the axonal phenotypes, but is required in surrounding cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thus, it is unlikely to participate in growth cone signal transduction in the same manner as the RPTPs.</p><p>Ptp10D and Ptp4E are the only <italic>Drosophila </italic>RPTPs that are members of the same subfamily; the other four are each the sole fly representative of their subfamily. Mutations in three of the other four <italic>Rptp </italic>genes (<italic>Lar</italic>, <italic>Ptp52F</italic>, <italic>Ptp69D</italic>) cause lethality. This suggests that the viability of <italic>Ptp10D </italic>and <italic>Ptp4E </italic>single mutants might be due to compensation by the other member of the subfamily, and that a <italic>Ptp4E Ptp10D </italic>double mutation would cause lethality. This is in fact observed; the double mutant dies at hatching. However, it does not have generalized defects. Rather, the defects we have found are all within the nervous system and the tracheal network. Our unpublished data show that Ptp10D is also selectively expressed in tracheal cells (MJ and KZ, manuscript in preparation). We suggest that <italic>Ptp4E Ptp10D </italic>double mutant phenotypes are observed only where Ptp10D is expressed.</p><p>The analysis described in this paper, together with that in several other papers from our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] allow us to assemble complete genetic interaction matrices for pairwise combinations of mutations in all six of the <italic>Rptp </italic>genes.

In motor axons, removal of Ptp99A completely suppresses the <italic>Lar </italic>ISNb parallel bypass phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. <italic>Lar </italic>mutations enhance the <italic>Ptp52F </italic>motor axon phenotypes rather than suppressing them as they do in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we have defined the phenotypes associated with simultaneous elimination of the functions of two RPTP subfamilies, by examining triple mutants removing both Ptp4E and Ptp10D together with each of the other three RPTPs whose absence produces lethality. This analysis shows that the Ptp10D/Ptp4E subfamily is redundant with Ptp69D in controlling guidance decisions made by three neuronal types, but <italic>Ptp4E </italic>mutants have relatively minor effects relative to <italic>Ptp10D </italic>mutants. For guidance of 1D4 and SemaIIB axons within the CNS, removal of both members of the Ptp10D/Ptp4E subfamily together with Ptp69D modulates the phenotype observed in <italic>Ptp10D Ptp69D </italic>mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). For SNa axons, the triple mutant has an enhanced phenotype, in that 10% of SNa nerves now fail to extend altogether; this is almost never observed in double mutants (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>). We also observe enhancement of a <italic>Ptp10D Ptp52F </italic>ISN truncation phenotype by removal of Ptp4E (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>), but no strong interactions between <italic>Ptp4E Ptp10D </italic>and <italic>Lar </italic>are observed in the CNS or neuromuscular system.</p><p>These results suggest that there is a special relationship between the Ptp10D/Ptp4E subfamily and Ptp69D. Perhaps these two types of RPTPs have similar substrates in both CNS interneurons and motor neurons. In CNS neurons, some critical substrate(s) dephosphorylated by Ptp69D might also be dephosphorylated by either Ptp10D or Ptp4E, so that certain phenotypes, such as crossing of all the SemaIIB axons in the wrong commissure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4h</xref>), are observed only when all three RPTPs are eliminated. However, in CNS neurons such as the neuroblast 2&#x02013;5 lineage, whose axons ectopically cross the midline in <italic>Ptp10D Ptp69D </italic>double mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], Ptp4E cannot compensate for the loss of Ptp10D. Perhaps in these cells the relevant Ptp69D substrate(s) can be dephosphorylated by Ptp10D but not by Ptp4E; however, this seems unlikely given that Ptp4E and Ptp10D have PTP domains that are much more similar to each other than are those of Ptp69D and Ptp10D. Alternatively, perhaps the Ptp4E concentration is too low in these neurons for efficient dephosphorylation to occur. Another possibility is that growth cones of these neurons contact Ptp10D ligands, but not Ptp4E ligands, and that ligand contact is required for signalling. An understanding of the biochemical origins of these genetic interactions will require identification and characterization of RPTP ligands, substrates and downstream signalling proteins, as well as localization of these proteins to specific neuronal types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title><italic>Drosophila </italic>stocks and transgenic flies</title><p><italic>Ptp4E</italic><sup>1 </sup>was generated by imprecise excision of EP425 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] inserted 1,157 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start. PCR was used to map the deletion endpoints. The deletion removes approximately 10.5 kb, starting from 130 bp upstream of the EP425 insertion site to before the start of exon 3. The excision event introduced chromosomal rearrangement, and as a result there are unrecognizable sequences between the endpoints.</p><p>The following <italic>Rptp </italic>mutant flies were used: <italic>Ptp10D</italic><sup>1 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]; <italic>Ptp69D</italic><sup>1 </sup>and <italic>Df(3L)8ex25 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]; <italic>La</italic><sup><italic>r</italic>5.5 </sup><italic>and Lar</italic><sup>13.2 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]; <italic>Ptp52F</italic><sup>18.3 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

Double and triple mutant lines were checked for the presence of <italic>Ptp4E</italic><sup>1 </sup>by PCR. <italic>Elav</italic>-GAL4 was obtained from Bloomington Stock Center (Bloomington, IN, USA). All crosses were carried out at 25&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The UAS-Ptp4E-GFP construct was made by PCR amplification of the entire coding region of the long Ptp4E cDNA, Ptp4E-A, and cloning it into the Gateway System vector (DGRC, Bloomington, IN, USA). The vector used placed a GFP sequence downstream of the Ptp4E coding sequence. The entire construct was sequenced, and also expressed in S2 cells to check for GFP expression to verify that PCR errors were not introduced into the clone. Ptp4E-GFP DNA was injected into embryos using standard methods to generate transgenic flies. Multiple lines were generated and examined; UAS-4E-GFP#4/CyO was used for all studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of Ptp4E antibodies</title><p>To generate antibodies against the native protein, we made a construct 4E-AP that was expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. The 4E-AP construct was made by dropping in a 2.7 Psi I/Kpn I fragment from Ptp4E-A (extracellular domain amino acids 169&#x02013;1073) into a modified baculovirus expression vector pAcGP67-A (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The vector contains a pg67 secretion signal sequence followed by a 6x-His tag, placed upstream of the Ptp4E insertion site. The sequence for human placental alkaline phosphatase was placed in frame, carboxy-terminal to the Ptp4E sequence. The protein expressed consists of the gp67 signal peptide-6xHis-Ptp4E-AP fusion protein that was harvested from insect cell media. Protein was concentrated ten-fold, then purified over a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Conditions used are: binding buffer (10 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM, Tris pH8.0), wash buffer (25 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM, Tris pH8.0), and elution buffer (250 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM, Tris pH8.0). Purified protein was injected at approximately 100 &#x003bc;g per boost.

Embryos were fixed for 20 minutes with 4% paraformaldehyde. Washes were done in 0.1% PT (0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline), and blocking buffer used was PT with 0.1% bovine serum albumin + 5% normal goat serum. Double and triple mutant embryos were balanced over GFP balancer chromosomes and homozygous mutants were sorted for lack of GFP expression. Anti-GFP and mAb 1D4 were simultaneously incubated on embryos. Alexa-488 conjugated secondary antibodies were used against anti-GFP, and non-green embryos were sorted under an epifluorescent dissecting microscope. These embryos were then treated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) immunohistochemistry using standard procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] to visualize 1D4 staining pattern.</p><p>In cases where RPTP specific antibodies were used for sorting, staining was done in a sequential manner. Embryos were first incubated with RPTP antibodies, sorted, and then incubated with 1D4. For some of the triple mutant combinations, live embryos were sorted under the epifluorescent dissecting microscope, then dissected live on Superfrost/Plus adhesion slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) in phosphate-buffered saline. These live dissected embryos were fixed on the slide, and carried through the same procedures as whole-mount embryo staining procedure.</p><p>Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-GFP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 1:1,000, mAb 1D4 at 1:3, mouse anti-Ptp4E (polyclonal) at 1:500, mouse anti-Ptp10D (8B2) at 1:3; mouse anti-Ptp69D (2C2) at 1:3, mouse anti-Myc (clone 9E10, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 1:250. Secondary antibodies used were: Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen) at 1:1,000, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG+IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA).
