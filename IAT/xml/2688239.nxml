Type II collagen, aggrecan, and link protein &#x02013; encoded by the genes Col2a1, Agc1 and Hapln1, respectively &#x02013; are major components of the articular cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). Type II collagen is the major structural collagen of articular cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Aggrecan is the most abundant proteoglycan, and is responsible for resisting the compressive forces imposed on articulating joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Finally, link protein stabilizes the association of aggrecan with hyaluronic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The expression of these ECM proteins is regulated by transcription factors within the nucleus promoting or inhibiting transcript production. Sry-type high-mobility group box-9 (Sox9) is a regulatory transcription factor that binds DNA at specific sites within Col2a1, Agc1 and Hapln genes to induce their transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis there is a shift in the equilibrium in cartilage production and degradation towards catabolism. TNF&#x003b1;, a potent inflammatory mediator, is found at higher levels in the synovial fluid bathing articular cartilage in diseased joints compared with that of normal, healthy joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Previous work has shown that treatment of chondrocytes with TNF&#x003b1; downregulates the expression of Col2a1, Agc1 and Hapln1 without inducing apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, the activation of NF&#x003ba;B) by TNF&#x003b1; signalling reduces Sox9 activity, possibly through competition for the transcriptional cofactor p300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Other signalling pathways are known to be activated by TNF&#x003b1;, however, including the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]).</p><p>TNF&#x003b1; initiates the activation of ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase through the adaptor protein, Grb2, binding to the TNF&#x003b1; receptor 1, leading to activation of the ras/mitogen-activated kinase kinase (MEK)/ERK signalling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In immortalized chondrocytes and primary rat chondrocytes, ERK1/2 can be phosphorylated as early as 15 minutes of treatment with TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Inhibition of MEK1/2 signalling can attenuate the decreases in Col2a1, Agc1 and Hapln1, as determined by northern blot analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. TNF&#x003b1; also regulates the activity of NF&#x003ba;B and Sox9 in chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. TNF&#x003b1;-induced NF&#x003ba;B DNA binding in immortalized chondrocytes is reduced by inhibition of MEK1/2 signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. TNF&#x003b1; may therefore regulate the expression of a subset of genes by alterations in the activity of these transcription factors in a MEK1/2-dependent manner.</p><p>Although some information is known about selected changes in chondrocyte gene expression in response to TNF&#x003b1;-activated MEK/ERK signalling, the overall impact of this pathway on changes to the chondrocyte gene expression and the downstream transcriptional mechanisms mediating these changes has been poorly defined. We sought to identify the extent to which MEK/ERK may contribute to the overall changes in chondrocyte gene expression in response to TNF&#x003b1;.</p><p>In the present study, we found that ERK1/2 undergoes multiple temporal phosphorylation events in response to TNF&#x003b1;-induced MEK1/2 activation. We discovered that approximately 20% of the genes that changed at least 1.45-fold with TNF&#x003b1; were dependent on MEK1/2 activation. A significant subset of these genes encoded proteins that localized to the extracellular space and had collagenase or hyaluronic acid binding activities. We determined that specific matrix metalloproteinases and cartilage-selective ECM transcript levels were regulated by MEK/ERK, while transcripts of the inflammatory gene macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 (Csf-1), were regulated in a MEK1/2-independent manner. Surprisingly, the activation of NF&#x003ba;B and the inhibition of Sox9 activity by TNF&#x003b1; were independent of MEK1/2. The DNA binding activity of the transcription factor early growth response 1 (Egr-1), however, was regulated by TNF&#x003b1;-activated MEK1/2 signalling. Finally, we determined that Egr family members are responsible for the TNF&#x003b1;-induced, MEK-dependent reductions in mRNA transcripts. Egr-1 may therefore regulate a select number of genes in response to TNF&#x003b1;-activated MEK/ERK signalling.</p><p>These findings reveal that MEK/ERK-dependent transcription factors that are downstream of TNF&#x003b1;, such as Egr-1, may be targets for therapeutic intervention to treat the pathophysiology of arthritis without disrupting other potential positive effects of TNF&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Primary chondrocyte culture</title><p>Chondrocytes were isolated from the femoral condyles of neonatal (1 day old) rats as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The cartilage canals in newborn rats do not form in the femoral condyles until 5 days postnatal and radiographic signs of the secondary ossification centre do not appear until about 10 days postnatal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, to avoid hypertrophic chondrocytes, the upper two-thirds of the cartilage was taken. Cells were plated onto tissue culture plastic (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at a density of ~2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Under these conditions, the culture consists of an essentially pure chondrocyte population.</p><p>Monolayer chondrocyte cultures were grown in RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin and 1% HEPES buffer (Invitrogen) until approximately 90% confluence was reached (6 to 7 days). Prior to treatment, chondrocytes were incubated in serum-free media overnight. For inhibitor studies, chondrocytes were pretreated with the selective MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (10 &#x003bc;M; Promega, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] for 30 minutes. As previously shown, U0126 has very low inhibitory activity towards other protein kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that 24-hour treatment with 10 &#x003bc;M U0126 had no significant effect on the cell morphology or organization in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. As controls, cultures were treated in parallel with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (vehicle for inhibitors), U0124 (10 &#x003bc;M; Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) or the selective epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor PD153035 (1 &#x003bc;M; Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences Inc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Cultures were then treated with human recombinant TNF&#x003b1; (30 ng/ml; Endogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 minutes to 24 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Antibodies used in this study included anti-phospho-tyrosine-ERK1/2 (E4), anti-Egr-1 (588), anti-&#x003b1;-tubulin (E-19), and anti-NF&#x003ba;B p65 (C-20) antibodies (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit or rabbit-anti goat secondary antibodies were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein isolation and western blotting</title><p>Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were isolated using a modified method of Dignam and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Total cell extracts were isolated using RIPA buffer as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein assay kit (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific), as per the manufacturers' instructions. For western blotting, 20 &#x003bc;g cytoplasmic protein was loaded into 10% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and separated by electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto Protran&#x02122; nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Inc., Florham Park, NJ, USA) by electroblotting and were stained with Ponceau S to qualitatively determine equal loading of samples and efficient transfer of proteins. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk (Carnation, North York, ON, Canada) in 0.05% Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 hour followed by incubation with primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight. Membranes were washed in TBST and incubated in 5% milk-TBST with appropriate secondary antibody for 45 minutes to 1.5 hours. Membranes were then washed with TBST and rinsed in Tris-buffered saline prior to incubation in Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Inc., Baie d'Urf&#x000e9;, QC, Canada). Membranes were stripped using 1 M glycine, pH 2.5, and washed using TBST prior to reprobing.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from cultures by Trizol (Invitrogen) followed by RNeasy clean-up (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada) as per the manufacturer's directions. Total RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically. High-quality RNA for use in the microarray analysis was confirmed by analysis in the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray analysis</title><p>Total mRNA (10 &#x003bc;g) from two biological replicates of cells treated with DMSO, U0126, TNF&#x003b1; or U0126 and TNF&#x003b1;, were amplified once and hybridized to RAT230_2.0 gene chips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Amplification, labelling, hybridization and detection were performed at the London Regional Genomics Centre (London, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturers' instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray data and gene ontology analysis</title><p>The raw expression values were imported into Genespring GX 7.3 (Agilent Technologies). Raw expression values &#x0003c;0.01 were set to 0.01 and the normalization per chip was set to the 50th percentile. Relative gene expression of the 31,099 probe sets on the chip was determined by normalizing the raw expression values for each probe set to the DMSO control (= one-fold change for each probe set) from each independent experiment. To identify genes that were TNF&#x003b1;-regulated, probe sets that were altered &#x02265; 1.45 in DMSO/TNF&#x003b1;-treated cultures compared with DMSO-treated cultures were determined for each independent experiment. Probe sets identified as being TNF&#x003b1; regulated in both independent experiments were selected for further analysis. Genes whose transcript levels changed &#x02265; 1.45-fold were selected for study, as our microarray analysis revealed that aggrecan mRNA &#x02013; a transcript previously shown to be TNF&#x003b1; sensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] &#x02013; was reduced approximately 1.45-fold and thus served as a positive control establishing the validity of our microarray data.</p><p>To identify probe sets whose changes were altered by TNF&#x003b1; in a MEK1/2-dependent fashion, we normalized the fold change in gene expression of U0126/TNF&#x003b1;-treated cultures to that of cultures treated with U0126 alone from both independent experiments. We determined probe sets that were altered &#x0003c;1.45-fold in response to DMSO/TNF&#x003b1; treatment, and hence were TNF&#x003b1; regulated in a U0126-sensitive fashion. The remainder of the genes on the lists of TNF&#x003b1;-regulated probe sets were determined to be TNF&#x003b1; regulated and MEK independent. Probe sets identified as being TNF&#x003b1; regulated and MEK/ERK dependent or MEK/ERK independent in both independent experiments were selected for further analysis.</p><p>Genes were also identified whose basal expression was sensitive to U0126 alone. Probe sets altered &#x02265; 1.45-fold in response to U0126 treatment relative to DMSO treatment were identified in both independent experiments. The limited number of genes that were altered with U0126 in both experiments (89/31,099) prevented the use of meaningful cluster analysis, but nonetheless served as a potent indication of the selectivity of the U0126 inhibitor. The generated list was then compared with the list of genes changing &#x02265; 1.45-fold with DMSO/TNF&#x003b1; to identify genes that were basal TNF&#x003b1; independent but MEK/ERK dependent and those genes that were both TNF&#x003b1; and basal MEK/ERK dependent.</p><p>The fold change in the transcript levels increased or decreased &#x02265; 1.45-fold in both independent experiments was averaged. The generated lists of genes determined as TNF&#x003b1;-activated MEK/ERK dependent and TNF&#x003b1;-activated MEK/ERK independent were analysed using the gene ontology browser in Genespring GX 7.3. Major cellular components and molecular functions subcategories of protein products from the list of genes were identified. The resulting list of cellular component ontologies was filtered such that a minimum of 10 genes must be in the initial group of annotated genes from the microarray and the resulting subcategory must be significantly represented (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05). Selected genes within the extracellular space ontology were then organized into subcategories that were significantly represented by the molecular function ontologies (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Total RNA (25 ng) was amplified using the TaqMan One Step RT-PCR Master Mix (4309169; Applied Biosystems Inc., Streetsville, ON, Canada).

Inspection of the ~20% of TNF&#x003b1;-regulated chondrocyte mRNAs whose expression was modulated by MEK1/2 revealed a significant representation of genes whose protein products localized to the extracellular space, and had proteinase activity (for example, Mmp-9 and Mmp-12, which were induced by TNF&#x003b1;) or hyaluronic acid binding activity (for example, the matrix-associated genes Agc1 and Hapln1, which were suppressed by TNF&#x003b1;). Mmp-9 and Mmp-12 cleave selective proteoglycans and collagens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] while Mmp-9 is also an important mediator of inflammatory arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, we have shown that increases in transcripts encoding proinflammatory genes, such as macrophage Csf-1, were U0126 insensitive. Collectively these results suggest the intriguing notion that, compared with the TNF&#x003b1;-regulated transcript levels of genes involved in inflammation, TNF&#x003b1;-induced matrix catabolism may selectively require MEK/ERK. Further efforts will be required to assess whether similar mechanisms might operate in adult rat or human chondrocytes, or in cells isolated from patients with arthritis. Nonetheless, our data &#x02013; for the first time &#x02013; suggest that MEK inhibitors modify the excessive matrix degradation in arthritis.</p><p>Consistent with TNF&#x003b1;-induced increases in macrophage Csf-1 transcript levels observed in this study, macrophage Csf-1 protein levels are also induced by TNF&#x003b1; in chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In rat articular chondrocytes, macrophage Csf-1-induced signalling increases its own expression and the expression of the matricellular protein CCN2 (formerly known as connective tissue growth factor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. CCN2 is required for Col2a1 and Agc1 expression in mouse chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] yet does not result in hypertrophic differentiation of rat articular chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Taken together, inhibition of TNF&#x003b1;-induced MEK/ERK or downstream transcription factors may rescue cartilage ECM gene expression and promote articular cartilage regeneration through continued macrophage Csf-1 expression.</p><p>In immortalized chondrocytes, NF&#x003ba;B-DNA binding activity is dependent on TNF&#x003b1;-induced MEK/ERK signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], consistent with studies in other immortalized cells such as B-cell lymphoma cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In our present study using primary chondroctyes, however, both TNF&#x003b1;-regulated NF&#x003ba;B reporter activity and NF&#x003ba;B-DNA binding were unaltered by MEK/ERK inhibition. Immortalized cells may therefore have altered signalling that activates NF&#x003ba;B in a MEK/ERK-dependent manner by TNF&#x003b1;. Furthermore, we showed that pretreatment of primary chondrocytes with DMSO or DMSO-soluble inhibitors, such as U0124, U0126 and PD153035, reduced TNF&#x003b1;-activated NF&#x003ba;B-DNA binding activity. The regulation of NF&#x003ba;B-DNA binding in primary cells can therefore be explained by the nonspecific effect of DMSO on NF&#x003ba;B activation.</p><p>In the present study we determined that, in addition to NF&#x003ba;B, TNF&#x003b1;-regulated reductions in Sox9 activity were also independent of MEK/ERK signalling. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that reductions in Sox9 activity by TNF&#x003b1; are dependent on NF&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], a mechanism probably involving reductions in p300 histone acetylase activity associated with Sox9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. MEK/ERK-independent reductions in Sox9 activity could therefore explain the inability of U0126 to completely reverse the TNF&#x003b1;-induced reductions in cartilage ECM gene transcript levels observed in this study.</p><p>We showed that Egr-1 DNA binding was increased by TNF&#x003b1; in a U0126-sensitive fashion. Moreover, competitive inhibition of Egr-1 binding to genomic targets attenuated decreases in cartilage ECM genes in response to TNF&#x003b1;. These results suggest that TNF&#x003b1; can modify gene expression in chondrocytes via MEK/ERK through the induction of Egr-1 DNA binding activity. Treatment of chondrocytes with IL-1 increases the Egr-1 protein and DNA binding, leading to decreased human type II collagen promoter activity through competition of Egr-1 for the Sp1 binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Previous studies have also identified that there are putative Sp1 binding sites in the aggrecan promoter of the chick, mouse and rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. In this study, we identified putative overlapping binding sites for Sp1 and Egr-1 in both the rat COL2A1 and AGC1 promoters proximal to the transcriptional start site. Although beyond the scope of our current report, Col2a1 and Agc1 transcription are probably regulated by inhibitory actions of Egr-1 in competition for Sp1 binding sites. Collectively, these data suggest that, in chondrocytes, alterations in Egr-1 DNA binding activity by TNF&#x003b1;-induced MEK/ERK signalling is necessary for the transcriptional regulation of downstream cartilage ECM genes.</p><p>In the current study, pharmacological inhibition of MEK resulted in significant attenuation of the TNF&#x003b1;-induced decreases to Col2a1, Agc1 and Hapln1 24 hours post treatment. Depending on the species the half-life of Col2a1 mRNA in chondrocytes is between 15 and 18 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], whereas the half-life of Agc1 mRNA is about 4 hours in bovine articular chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In this study we observed ~50% reduction in Col2a1 and ~70% reduction in Agc1 transcript levels after 24 hours. Previous studies from our laboratory have indicated that inhibition of Col2a1 transcripts in response to TNF&#x003b1; results from an inhibition of transcription and not from changes to message stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, treatment of chondrocytes with actinomycin D, a transcription inhibitor, decreased Col2a1 and Agc1 mRNAs to a level comparable with that of TNF&#x003b1; treatment alone (unpublished data). Collectively, TNF&#x003b1;-induced reductions in cartilage ECM transcripts in this study are consistent with regulation of these mRNAs through inhibition of transcription. Although it is possible that TNF&#x003b1; may modulate cartilage ECM transcript expression in an indirect fashion, the relatively delayed kinetics of TNF&#x003b1;-modulated cartilage ECM transcripts is probably due to the stability of the mRNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Most therapies for rheumatoid arthritis, specifically biologics, are targeted towards TNF&#x003b1; protein and not towards its activated signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Targeted therapies that block specific subcellular molecules involved in TNF&#x003b1;-activated signalling pathways, however, may be useful in selectively modifying chondrocyte responses to TNF&#x003b1;. Our data suggest that MEK/ERK may selectively be required for TNF&#x003b1;-modulated proteinase and cartilage ECM transcripts, but not for inflammatory gene transcripts. These results raise the intriguing notion that MEK/ERK inhibitors might be used to block the ability of TNF&#x003b1; to promote matrix catabolism but leave perhaps more beneficial effects of TNF&#x003b1; unaltered. In the long term, our observations may be of relevance for developing new methods of treating arthritis. In particular, antagonizing MEK/ERK or activating Egr-1 may be useful methodologies for reversing cartilage degradation observed in both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>Agc1: aggrecan 1; Col2a1: type II collagen (&#x003b1;); Csf-1: colony stimulating factor 1; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; ECM: extracellular matrix; Egr: early growth response; ERK: extracellular regulated kinase; IFN: interferon; IL: interleukin; MEK: mitogen-activated kinase kinase; Mmp: matrix metalloproteinase; NF: nuclear factor; ODN: oligodeoxynucleotide; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; Sox: Sry-type high-mobility group box; TBST: Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20; TNF: tumour necrosis factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JSR carried out all aspects of the study, including the initial design of the study, microarray analysis, immunoblotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, quantitative real-time PCR and transfection studies, drafting and editing of the manuscript, and preparation of the figures.
