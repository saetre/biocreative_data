Neutrophil emigration has been described to occur primarily through endothelial junctions (paracellular) and more rarely directly through endothelial cells (transcellular). Recently, we reported that unlike in wild-type (wt) mice, Mac-1-/- (CD11b) neutrophils predominantly emigrated transcellularly and was significantly delayed taking 20&#x02013;30 min longer than the paracellular emigration (wt). In the present study we noted significant anatomical disruption of the endothelium and hypothesized that transcellular emigration would greatly increase vascular permeability. Surprisingly, despite profound disruption of the endothelial barrier as the neutrophils moved through the cells, the changes in vascular permeability during transcellular emigration (Mac-1-/-) were not increased more than in wt mice. Instead increased vascular permeability completely tracked the number of emigrated cells and as such, permeability changes were delayed in Mac-1-/- mice. However, by 60 min neutrophils from both sets of mice were emigrating in large numbers. Electron-microscopy and spinning disk multichannel fluorescence confocal microscopy revealed endothelial docking structures that progressed to dome-like structures completely covering wt and Mac-1-/- neutrophils. These domes completely enveloped the emigrating neutrophils in both wt and Mac-1-/- mice making the mode of emigration underneath these structures extraneous to barrier function. In conclusion, predominantly paracellular versus predominantly transcellular emigration does not affect vascular barrier integrity as endothelial dome-like structures retain barrier function.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>A fundamental feature of any inflammatory response is the rapid recruitment of leukocytes from supplying blood vessels to the site of inflammation.

Leukocyte emigration has been described to occur either at endothelial junctions, as leukocytes squeeze between adjacent endothelial cells (paracellular emigration), or directly through endothelial cells (transcellular emigration) (reviewed in 6). Adhesion proteins involved in the emigration process include platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), CD99, ESAM-1, ICAM-1, junctional adhesion molecules and vascular endothelial-cadherins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Engelhardt1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Petri1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Although most of these molecules are localized to the junctions, the importance of junctional versus transcellular migration is still debated.</p><p>Systematic assessments of leukocyte emigration across endothelium reveal predominant paracellular emigration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Burns1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Phillipson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Shaw1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Clearly, the discrepancy in results may simply be due to different stimuli (activating endothelium versus leukocytes), different environmental conditions (eg., different shear), different subsets of leukocytes (eg., lymphocytes versus neutrophils), different organs or even subtleties in the culture conditions used to grow endothelium.</p><p>Recently, in identical in vivo conditions, we observed that in a neutrophil response to chemoattractant, a predominant paracellular pathway in wild-type mice versus a predominant transcellular pathway in Mac-1 deficient mice was used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Phillipson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The reason for this difference was related to a new step in the leukocyte recruitment cascade namely neutrophil crawling to junctions, which was absent in Mac-1 deficient mice. Multi-channel fluorescence confocal microscopy revealed that wild-type neutrophils crawled in all directions on the endothelium in order to get to optimal sites for emigration, which for 86&#x00025; of the neutrophils was at junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Phillipson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. By contrast, Mac-1-/- neutrophils were unable to crawl to junctional sites for optimal emigration and as a result emigrated primarily at non-junctional sites.</p><p>It has been shown that neutrophils bind various adhesion proteins localized to junctional sites to allow for emigration. During this process, a limited amount of protein leaks at these emigration sites, which is referred to as increased permeability. Presumably, more invasive invaginations or penetrations through the endothelium would occur during transcellular migration of neutrophils. Also, the absence of junctional adhesion proteins thought to seal gaps, led us to hypothesis that transcellular emigration would disrupt the barrier to a greater degree further enhancing vascular permeability. Comparing mice where emigration occurs predominantly paracellularly (wild-type mice) versus transcellularly (Mac-1-/- mice), the influence of the route of emigration on endothelial barrier function (microvascular permeability) was investigated. This study shows that the vascular permeability increase was nearly identical in both forms of emigration, mainly as a result of the fact that the endothelium forms a dome over the emigrating neutrophil sealing and thereby limiting changes in vascular permeability independent of the ultimate route of emigration.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>In the first instance we demonstrate that under basal conditions, the cremaster preparation had very little change in leukocyte adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), emigration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and microvascular permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) over 60 min. By contrast, addition of MIP-2, the CXC chemokine that preferentially recruits neutrophils rather than other leukocytes, induced a robust increase in leukocyte recruitment and microvascular permeability at 30 and 60 min.

Mac-1 deficient mice had similar basal values for rolling flux, and slightly higher rolling velocity (about 55 &#x000b5;m sec<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). In response to superfusion with the neutrophil specific chemokine, MIP-2, the rolling flux decreased in both groups and was unaffected by the MIP-2 concentration used (0.5 or 5 nmol/L). Rolling cell velocity was not changed over time in response to MIP-2 superfusion in the wild-type mice or the Mac-1-/- mice (data not shown). The number of adherent cells increased about 15-fold in response to MIP-2 (5 nmol/L) in wild-type mice as well as in the Mac-1 deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This is in accordance with our previous findings where neutrophil adhesion was dependent on LFA-1 and not Mac-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Phillipson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Also emigration was increased in wt mice after 30 min of MIP-2 superfusion, as a 10-fold increase in the number of emigrated cells was observed. After 60 min MIP-2 superfusion, a 20-fold increase was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In the Mac-1-/- mice, despite no effect on adhesion, emigration was significantly delayed. In fact at 30 min there was no significant increase in the number of emigrated neutrophils in response to MIP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). However, at 60 min MIP-2 superfusion, the number of emigrated Mac-1-/- cells was not dissimilar to what was observed in the wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Vascular permeability was measured as the flux of FITC-labeled albumin from the circulation to the interstitial space as we and others have described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Kurose1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Ley1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-BonnardelPhu1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> using computer assisted imaging for quantification. There was a significant increase in permeability over time in response to MIP-2 superfusion in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). It is noteworthy that after 30 min of MIP-2 superfusion, permeability had already increased significantly in wild-type but not in Mac-1-/- mice, which is entirely consistent with the delay in emigration of Mac-1-/- neutrophils. At 60 min, microvascular permeability was increased equally in both strains of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Clearly, the increase in permeability tracked entirely with the number of emigrated, not adherent neutrophils.</p><p>It is possible that at 60 min, the maximal permeability increase was achieved in both wt and Mac-1-/- mice, potentially masking any enhancing effects of neutrophil migration through the endothelium (transcellular in Mac-1-/- mice). To address this possibility, we decreased the concentration of MIP-2 10-fold to 0.5 nmol/L. There was significant increase (3-fold less than with 5.0 nmol/L MIP-2) in the number of adherent neutrophils at 30 and 60 min superfusion with the lower MIP-2 concentration in both wild-type mice and Mac-1-/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). At this low concentration of MIP-2, only a 4-fold increase in the number of emigrated cells (25&#x00025; of high MIP-2) was noted at 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). This resulted in a very subtle increase in vascular permeability with time in both wild-type and Mac-1-/- mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Unexpectedly, Mac-1-/- mice did not have enhanced vascular permeability relative to WT mice under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5).</p><p>To further investigate the transmigratory pattern in wild-type versus Mac-1-/- mice, electron micrographs were prepared. In 10&#x00025; of adherent wild-type and Mac-1-/- neutrophils we identified the endothelium folded into cup-like structures around adherent neutrophils extending a pseudopod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g002">Figure 2A&#x02013;C</xref>). These structures were not dissimilar to what earlier had been described for transmigrating neutrophils in vitro by Carman and Springer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Carman1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Clearly, similar docking structures occurred in vivo. In addition, we observed in more than 50&#x00025; of cases that the endothelium extended over the neutrophil creating dome-like structures that completely covered or enveloped the adherent neutrophils (72&#x00025; of the adherent wild-type neutrophils, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g003">Figure 3A and 3C</xref>). Continuous endothelium was still seen intact along the basolateral side of the neutrophil. Clearly, the intact endothelium above and beneath the neutrophil, indicates that the endothelium envelopes the neutrophil prior to the leukocyte emigrating out of the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). These same dome-like structures were also seen in the Mac-1-/- mice (in 62&#x00025; of the adherent Mac-1-/- neutrophils, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g003">figure 3B</xref> shows a neutrophil covered entirely by a dome and the endothelium underneath the neutrophil beginning to fragment.</p><fig id="pone-0001649-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001649.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Endothelial transmigratory cup formation.</title><p>Electron micrographs and cartoons of transmigrating wild-type neutrophils where the endothelium forms a transmigratory cup (A, B and C).

These dome-like structures have not been previously reported in vitro and are presumably not formed or difficult to see in vitro in cell culture conditions. To further explore this possibility, we used spinning disk confocal microscopy in vivo in an attempt to visualize whether domes formed as a result of the movement of endothelium up the sides of the neutrophil thereby enveloping the cell. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g004">Figure 4A</xref> is a confocal image showing the endothelium (green) completely enveloping the adherent neutrophil (red).

Since emigration of neutrophils in vivo seems to occur mainly through the paracellular pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Phillipson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, noting some exceptions including the use of high concentrations of bacterial products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Feng1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, one could speculate that transcellular migration is less regulated and might cause greater barrier damage. Recently, using intravital time-lapse video microscopy of muscle microcirculation exposed to MIP-2, we revealed that neutrophils upon adhering to the venular wall crawl to a junction where they then would emigrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Phillipson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. By using a confocal system, it was revealed that in this model 86&#x00025; of the emigration occurred at junctional regions. We found that adhesion was dependent on the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> integrin LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), and crawling occurred through activation of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Phillipson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. When the neutrophils were not permitted to crawl due to lack of Mac-1, adhesion was unaffected but 60&#x00025; of the neutrophils emigrated transcellularly. This served as a model for paracellular (wt) and transcellular migration (Mac-1-/-) under otherwise similar conditions. Surprisingly, we found that the permeability increase of the vascular endothelium was not at all affected by the route of emigration, despite evidence of greater barrier disruption in the Mac-1-/- mice emigrating transcellularly. Electron microscopy however revealed a rate-limiting barrier or dome that sealed the neutrophil from the lumen thereby allowing extensive disruption of the endothelium under the neutrophil without physiologic impact on barrier function. The increase in vascular permeability would then only be a result of the plasma protein that got encapsulated along with the neutrophil.</p><p>Ligation of the endothelial adhesion molecules by the adherent leukocytes directly affect the endothelial cells, as demonstrated by transient changes in intracellular calcium, which leads to activation of myosin light chain kinase and endothelial cell shape changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Muller1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The induction of endothelial cells to change shape is believed to be important in order for the endothelial cells to retract. This localized dissociation of endothelial cell junctions occurs in order to enable emigration of leukocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Muller1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Newer evidence shows that following firm neutrophil adhesion, the endothelial cells change their morphology so that transmigratory cups are formed, where microvilli-like projections rich in actin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 are docking the neutrophil to the endothelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Carman1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The endothelial cup-like structures partially engulfing the adherent leukocyte are formed regardless of the emigratory route taken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Carman1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Electron micrographs also revealed these endothelial docking structures in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) but using both electron microscopy and spinning disk microscopy, we now for the first time show that these docking structures developed into endothelial dome-like encapsulations that completely surrounded the neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g004">4</xref>). Interestingly, despite clear evidence that docking structures occur in vitro, dome structures have not previously been observed in vitro suggesting either that the domes do not form in vitro or are simply too difficult to see with presently available technology.</p><p>Recently, a new association between endothelial cells and leukocytes was described as transendothelial emigration of lymphocytes was found to be highly dependent on adherent lymphocytes forming podosome protrusions that initiated endothelial invaginations or pseudoprints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Carman2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Extension of the lymphocyte podosome could eventually lead to pore formation through the endothelial cell, via which the lymphocyte would emigrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Carman2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether neutrophils could emigrate through transendothelial pores is still unknown, and neutrophil podosome formations have not yet been described in vivo although our electron micrographs did reveal small breaks (potentially pores) below neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Contrary to lymphocytes and basophils, neutrophils emigrate in very large numbers during the early immune response. If this occurred through pores, the endothelial encapsulation might be an important phenomenon selectively for neutrophil emigration. Although domes were not described in in vitro studies, it could be that they form in microvascular endothelium under shear conditions when neutrophils are emigrating across an intact vessel wall, conditions difficult to mimic completely in in vitro systems.</p><p>Others have previously noted endothelial cytoskeletal rearrangements during neutrophil transmigration after exposure in vivo to either LTB<sub>4</sub> or fMLP using electron microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Feng1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Lewis1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Lewis2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. This resulted in endothelial domes surrounding transmigrated neutrophils that were suggested to reseal the endothelium after neutrophil diapedesis, but clear gaps were always identified in the endothelium either apically or basolaterally of the neutrophil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Lewis1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Lewis2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, similar but complete encapsulations were observed in the wt and Mac-1 deficient mice, despite the fact that the endothelium on the basolateral side of the Mac-1-/- neutrophils often had multiple gaps directly below the neutrophils (see arrows <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001649-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). However, somewhat unexpectedly the microvascular permeability as an index of barrier function was not higher in the Mac-1-/- than wt group, underscoring the potential importance of these domes. Since the Mac-1-/- neutrophils predominantly emigrate transcellularly, while the wild-type neutrophils exit through junctions, we can from our data conclude that transcellular and junctional emigration seems to cause permeability changes of the same degree. We would suggest that the dome-like endothelial structure completely covering the neutrophil would be the rate limiting structure for vascular permeability, minimizing additional plasma protein leakage regardless of route of emigration.</p><p>In conclusion, by comparing mice where emigration occurs predominantly paracellularly versus predominantly transcellularly, this study shows that vascular permeability changes seen during neutrophil recruitment may be limited by an encapsulation of the adherent neutrophil thereby forming an air lock type seal. The permeability would then be independent of the route of emigration. Moreover, the docking structures also referred to as endothelial emigratory cups formed by the endothelium to surround the base of emigrating neutrophils regardless of route of emigration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001649-Carman1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> were the initiators of the endothelial domes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Male C57BL/6 mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories and Mac-1 deficient male mice were originally made by Dr Ballantyne (Baylor College of Medicine).

The cremaster muscle was cut longitudinally with a cautery. The testicle and epididymis were separated from the underlying muscle and were gently pushed into the abdominal cavity. The muscle was held flat on an optically clear viewing pedestal and was secured along the edges with five 4.0 sutures. A coverslip with silicon grease on two of the edges was gently placed over the muscle without touching it, to avoid drying of the tissue.

Rolling leukocytes were defined as those cells moving at a velocity less than that of erythrocytes within the vessel. The flux of rolling cells was measured as the number of rolling leukocytes passing by a given point in the venule per minute. Leukocyte rolling velocity was calculated from the average time required for 10 leukocytes to roll along 100 &#x000b5;m of the vessel. A leukocyte was considered to be adherent if it remained stationary for more than 30 sec, and total leukocyte adhesion was quantified as the number of adherent cells within a 100 &#x000b5;m length of venule over 5 min. Leukocyte emigration was defined as the number of cells in the extra vascular space within a 200&#x000d7;300 &#x000b5;m area (0.06 mm<sup>2</sup>).
