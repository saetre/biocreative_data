Infusion of 100 nmol TRH into the rat third cerebroventricle (3vt) significantly decreased food intake (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) compared to controls infused with phosphate- buffered saline. This TRH-induced suppression of food intake was attenuated partially in histamine-depleted rats pre-treated with &#x003b1;-fluoromethylhistidine (a specific suicide inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase) and in mice with targeted disruption of histamine H1 receptors. Infusion of TRH into the 3vt increased histamine turnover as assessed by pargyline-induced accumulation of tele-methylhistamine (t-MH, a major metabolite of neuronal histamine in the brain) in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), the paraventricular nucleus, and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus in rats. In addition, TRH-induced decrease of food intake and increase of histamine turnover were in a dose-dependent manner. Microinfusion of TRH into the TMN increased t-MH content, histidine decarboxylase (HDC) activity and expression of HDC mRNA in the TMN. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that TRH-R2, but not TRH-R1, was expressed within the cell bodies of histaminergic neurons in the TMN of rats. These results indicate that hypothalamic neuronal histamine mediates the TRH-induced suppression of feeding behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>feeding behavior</kwd><kwd>histamine</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>thyrotropin-releasing hormone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) plays a fundamental role in the regulation of anterior pituitary TSH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Yarbrough 1979</xref>). The endocrine function of TRH is supported by TRH type 1 receptors (TRH-R1) that are localized predominantly to hypothalamic regions. In addition, TRH-R1 expressed in other regions, such as the brain stem and spinal cord support a functional link between TRH and vegetative and autonomic functions. In contrast to the expression of TRH-R1, TRH type 2 receptor (TRH-R2) mRNA is distributed widely throughout the brain, including the thalamus, cerebral and cerebellar cortex, and the reticular formation. This distribution of TRH-R2 indicates that TRH is involved in higher cognitive functions as well as in regulating the arousal system, locomotor activity, and pain perception.</p><p>It was suggested recently that leptin plays an important role in the neuroendocrine regulation of the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;thyroid axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ahima <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Legradi <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Nillni and Sevarino 1999</xref>). TRH gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) has been shown to be regulated by leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Flier and Maratos-Flier 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mantzoros 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Nillni <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). In addition, neurons in the PVN that release TRH express both leptin and melanocortin-4 receptors, which suggests that TRH is an important part of the signaling systems that regulate feeding behavior. In line with this hypothesis, acute central administration TRH was reported to have anorexigenic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Vogel <italic>et al.</italic> 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Morley and Levine 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Breese <italic>et al.</italic> 1981</xref>).</p><p>Histamine is a neurotransmitter that regulates appetite, energy metabolism, body temperature, and the sleep&#x02013;wake cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Doi <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Sakata <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11 b12">Huang <italic>et al.</italic> 2001, 2006</xref>). We demonstrated previously that neuronal histamine suppressed food intake via H1 receptors within the PVN and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Fukagawa <italic>et al.</italic> 1989</xref>). Furthermore, hypothalamic neuronal histamine is one of the hypothalamic targets of leptin, as indicated by the observation that leptin accelerates the release of neuronal histamine within the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Yoshimatsu <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). Leptin-induced suppression of feeding is attenuated both in rats in which histamine has been depleted by &#x003b1;-fluoromethylhistidine (FMH), a suicide inhibitor of histamine synthesizing histidine decarboxylase (HDC) enzyme as well as in mice with targeted disruption of histamine H1 receptors (H1KO mice) (Yoshimatsu <italic>et al.</italic> 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Masaki <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). In contrast to the functional connection between histamine and leptin, little is known about how leptin activates neuronal histamine because the long form of the leptin receptor is not expressed by histaminergic neurons within the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Elmquist <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>). As stated above, leptin elicits the expression of TRH in the PVN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Legradi <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). In addition, TRH immunoreactivity has been identified in some histamine-containing neurons within the TMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Airaksinen <italic>et al.</italic> 1992</xref>). The aforementioned findings suggest that TRH might mediate leptin signaling to histaminergic neurons.</p><p>In the present study, we examined the neuroanatomical and functional relationship between TRH and neuronal histamine. We tested whether histamine depletion and targeted disruption of histamine H1 receptors attenuated the anorexic effects of TRH, if TRH increased histamine turnover within hypothalamic nuclei that are involved in energy homeostasis, and whether TRH receptors were expressed in histaminergic neurons within the TMN.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>We used adult (250&#x02013;280 g) male Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats (Seac Yoshitomi, Fukuoka, Japan), and adult (25&#x02013;30 g) male H1KO mice (C57BL/6 background).

All rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.), placed in stereotaxic apparatus and unilaterally implanted with a stainless steel guide cannula (23-gauge; 15 mm long). TMN coordinates was &#x02212;4.3 mm from bragma, lateral 1.5 mm to the midbrain, 8.0 mm below the cortical surface, according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Paxinos and Watson 1986</xref>).

Brain was removed and the section containing the TMN was dissected with a frozen razorblade. One-tube RT-PCR was performed using the Qiagen (Valencia, CA, USA) one-tube RT-PCR kit according to manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. Primer sets included 5&#x02032;-CCCAGTGAATACCATGAATAC-3&#x02032; (sense) and 5&#x02032;-ATGTCCCCAAAGATGCTA-3&#x02032; (antisense) for rat HDC determination (designed based on GenBank accession number M29591). RT was performed at 50&#x000b0;C for 30 min. followed 40 cycles of PCR (95&#x000b0;C 30 s, 55&#x000b0;C 30 s, 72&#x000b0;C 30 s). Expression of each target gene was normalized to total RNA and samples run in triplicate. The standard curve samples used for RT-PCR were prepared by serial dilution of a RNA sample of known concentration to cover the range of 3000 to 3 ng. The log-linear portion of the standard curve was identified and regression coefficient <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> equaled 1.00. Threshold cycle (Ct) data were used to determine the amount of each target gene in the hypothalamus. &#x00394;Ct was defined as the average Ct value for PBS, TRH (1 nmol), TRH (10 nmol) or TRH (50 nmol) group, respectively. The percent change in expression, relative to the chow group, was defined as 2 &#x02013;&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct &#x000d7; 100, where &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct equals the group &#x00394;Ct minus the &#x00394;Ct of PBS group. The SE of the &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct is considered the same as the SE of the &#x00394;Ct value because the calculation of &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct is subtraction of an arbitrary constant.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.) before being exsanguinated by transcardiac perfusion with 50 mL saline that contained 50 units of heparin. This was followed by transcardiac perfusion with 300 mL 4% paraformaldehyde in ice-cold PBS. The brain was removed and divided into three segments (forebrain, diencephalon, and brain stem). The diencephalon was stored in PBS overnight. The tissue was then submerged in a 20% sucrose solution for 2 days, followed by submersion in a 30% sucrose solution for 3 days. Thereafter, the tissue was snap-frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C before being sectioned at a thickness of 30 &#x003bc;m with a cryostat at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C.

Sections were subsequently exposed to biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (ABC reagent; Vector Laboratories) and Rhodamine-conjugated streptoavidin (ABC reagent; Vector Laboratories). Negative control (single staining for HDC) was performed in each experiment, in which one of the primary antibodies (TRH-R1 or TRH-R2) was replaced with the normal serum, and further incubation with both secondary antibodies was performed as usual. Stained sections were examined with a confocal immunofluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The area immunostained by antibodies were analyzed with a computed image analyzer (Lumina Vision, Mitsutani Corp. Kyoto, Japan). Rhodamine-stained area and FITC-stained area were visualized as red and green signals, respectively.

This finding is consistent with the previous study showing that the central infusion of TRH (25, 50, 100 nmol) suppressed starvation-induced feeding in a dose related manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic> 1982</xref>). Moreover, the depletion of neuronal histamine by pre-treatment with FMH attenuated TRH-induced suppression of food intake. These results suggest that endogenous neuronal histamine may mediate the suppression of food intake by TRH. We showed previously that hypothalamic neuronal histamine suppressed food intake via H1 receptors within the VMH and PVN, both of which are nuclei that are central to satietiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Oohara <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>). Our finding in the present study that the anorexigenic effect of TRH was also attenuated in H1KO mice is further evidence that histamine and H1 receptors mediate TRH signaling to suppress food intake.</p><p>The involvement of TRH&#x02013;histamine signaling in suppressing food intake was also demonstrated by our study that hypothalamic histamine and t-MH concentrations exhibited region-specific increased in response to the administration of TRH and this effect of TRH was dose-dependent in the range of 10 to 500 nmol. Specifically, the increase in histamine concentrations was restricted to the TMN and was not detected in any other hypothalamic nuclei. After pretreatment with pargyline hydrochloride, infusion of TRH into the 3vt increased the concentration of t-MH not only in the TMN but also in the PVN and VMH, which indicated that TRH induced an increase in histamine turnover within these nuclei.</p><p>It might be suggested TRH infusion did not affect concentration of hypothalamic histamine in the hypothalamic nucleus except the TMN because histamine levels measured in present study included released histamine in the extraneuronal space as well as intracellular histamine in the nerve terminal and histamine is rapidly converted to its metabolite, t-MH, in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Oohara <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, microinfusion of TRH into the TMN increased HDC activity and t-MH content in the TMN. The transmethylation of histamine into t-MH, a major metabolite of histamine, and its subsequent deamination, is the major metabolic pathway of histamine in the brain. Therefore, it is much more informative to analyze histamine release by measuring its metabolite than to rely on a measurement of the brain histamine level itself. Pre-treatment with pargyline, an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B, is useful for this assessment, as it induces the accumulation of t-MH in the extraneuronal space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Oishi <italic>et al.</italic> 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Oohara <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>, 1994).</p><p>The TMN contains the cell bodies of histaminergic neurons, whereas the PVN and VMH are major projection sites of histamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Sakata and Yoshimatsu 1997</xref>). Based on this anatomical scheme, we conclude that TRH increased histamine turnover not only in cell bodies within the TMN but also at the nerve terminals within the PVN and VMH. The possibility that TRH directly modulated histamine release at nerve terminals in these sites cannot be excluded; however, it is likely that TRH activates histaminergic neurons within the TMN, and thereafter induces histamine release from the nerve terminals at projection sites because TRH receptors are expressed on the cell bodies of histaminergic neurons within the TMN.</p><p>TRH-R1 and TRH-R2 exhibit distinct expression patterns within the brain. In general, TRH-R1 is localized to the hypothalamus and brain stem, which supports a link between TRH-R1 and vegetative and autonomic functions. In contrast, TRH-R2 mRNA is distributed widely throughout the brain, including the cerebral cortex and reticular formation, which indicates that TRH-R2 may be involved in regulating cognition and the arousal system. In the present study, we identified TRH-R2, but not TRH-R1, within the cell bodies of histaminergic neurons within the TMN. TRH-containing neurons project to the TMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Airaksinen <italic>et al.</italic> 1992</xref>), and it is well established that hypothalamic neuronal histamine regulates the sleep&#x02013;wake cycle via connections to the ventrolateral preoptic area (the &#x0201c;sleep center&#x0201d;) and orexinergic neurons within the lateral hypothalamic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Mignot <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Huang <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). Therefore, the TRH&#x02013;TRH-R2&#x02013;histamine pathway may constitute a neuronal network that regulates arousal. In addition, our findings suggest that this pathway also contributes to the effects of TRH on feeding behavior.</p><p>Present study suggests that both orexin and TRH may be able to stimulate histaminergic system. Orexin increases food intake whereas TRH decreases it. Previous study reported that the central administration of orexin-A caused a significant increase in locomotor activity, but not food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Ishizuka <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). From these findings, it may be concluded that the histaminergic system participates in arousal state rather than feeding regulation by orexinergic neurons. On the other hand, histaminergic system mediates the TRH-induced suppression of feeding behavior partially. The mechanism involved in the anorectic effect of TRH except histaminergic system is uncertain, but it is possibility that TRH might cause anorectic effect by activating TRH receptors localized in the PVN and VMH, regions known to be involved in control of food intake and the site of the so-called satiety center, directly.</p><p>Leptin acts on the brain to inhibit food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Campfield <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>). 3vt infusion of leptin increases histamine turnover rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Yoshimatsu <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). Leptin-induced suppression of feeding was reported to be attenuated both in rats whose histamine was depleted by FMH, a suicide inhibitor of histamine synthesizing HDC enzyme, and in H1KO mice (Yoshimatsu <italic>et al.</italic> 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Masaki <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). Despite these findings, how leptin activates histamine-containing neurons within the hypothalamus is not known. Leptin receptor mRNA is expressed within the PVN (which is where the cell bodies of neurons that release TRH are located) but not in the TMN (which is the origin of histaminergic neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Flier and Maratos-Flier 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mantzoros 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Nillni <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>). Recently, we reported that neurons that contain glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and corticotropin-releasing hormone may mediate leptin signaling to histaminergic neurons within the TMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Gotoh <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). The results of the present study suggest that there is an additional pathway that transmits leptin signals to the histaminergic system.
