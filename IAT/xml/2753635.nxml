Most deaths from ovarian cancer are caused by metastases that are resistant to conventional therapies. Although ovarian cancers metastasize primarily by exfoliation followed by peritoneal implantation, about 40% of patients with advanced ovarian cancer show lymph node metastasis and/or extra-abdominal metastasis. The factors that regulate the metastatic process and chemoresistance of ovarian cancer remain poorly understood.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that the enhanced expression and activation of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 may play a role in ovarian cancer cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. But other factors may also contribute to this malignant behavior. One candidate is human sperm protein 17 (HSp17), a normal tissue specific protein detected in the primary tumor cells from 70% of the patients with ovarian carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>HSp17 is a protein originally reported to be expressed exclusively in the testis and whose primary function is binding to the zona pellucida [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition to testis and ejaculated sperm, HSp17 was also detected in ciliated epithelia of the respiratory airways and both the male and female reproductive systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Recent evidence suggested that HSp17 was aberrantly expressed in many malignant tumors, such as multiple myelomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], ovarian cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], esophageal squamous cell carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], esthesioneuroblastomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and various histological subtypes of human nervous system (NS) malignancies, including neuroectodermal and meningeal tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Wang <italic>et al</italic>. showed that promoter methylation can serve as the main regulatory mechanism for the expression of HSp17 in tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Because the function of the HSp17 in cancer cells is not known, we presume that this protein may play a role in the function of these ciliated cells and may influence the malignant behaviors of ovarian cancer cells.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the frequency of HSp17 expression at the protein level and its cell pattern distribution in various histological subtypes of human ovarian tumors by immunohistochemistry. We then examined the effect of HSp17 overexpression on the migration of an ovarian cancer cell line, HO8910, and its chemoresistance to cisplatin and carboplatin by introducing HSp17 cDNA into the cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient specimens</title><p>A panel of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ovarian tumor specimens were obtained from the archival resource of Department of Pathology, Jinling Hospital, consisting of 70 epithelial ovarian carcinomas (EOC), (median) age 52 (22~80), and 7 non-epithelial malignant tumors primarily developed in the ovaries (1 germ cell tumor, 2 malignant mesodermal mixed tumors, 4 sex cord-stromal tumors), (median) age 38 (25~55). All tumors were classified according to WHO criteria. HSp17 expression in metastatic cancer cells was measured in ascitic fluids obtained from 8 of the EOC patients, and in metastatic tumor tissues obtained from 10 patients with metastatic ovarian cancer in endometrium, oviduct, omentum majus, rectal sinuses, vagina and jejunoileum. Specimen collection and archiving of patient data was performed with written informed consent and approved by the ethical committee of the hospital.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Tissue sections (3 &#x003bc;m) were placed on glass slides, heated at 60&#x000b0;C for 20 min, and then deparaffinized with xylene and ethanol. For antigen retrieval, tumor specimens mounted on glass slides were immersed in preheated antigen retrieval solution (DAKO high pH solution, DAKO) for 20 min and allowed to cool for 20 min at room temperature. After the inactivation of endogenous peroxidase, anti-HSp17 monoclonal antibody (purchased from BD Bioscience Co, clone 21) was added at a concentration of 2 &#x003bc;g&#x000b7;ml<sup>-1 </sup>and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The primary antibody was detected with an anti-mouse IgG (DAKO). Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate was added for 7 min followed by washing with deionized water, and hematoxylin was applied for 1 min to counterstain the tissue sections. The tissue sections were dehydrated via graded ethanols followed by xylene, and coverslips were attached with permount. The extent of immunohistochemical reactivity was graded as follows: negative; +, 5-25% of malignant cells stained; + +, &#x0003e;25-50% of malignant cells stained; + + +, &#x0003e;50-75% of malignant cells stained; and + + + +, &#x0003e;75% of malignant cells stained. Two independent reviewers scored it and results were in consensus. Negative control slides omitting the primary antibody were included in all assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>To investigate the expression of HSp17 in ascetic metastatic tumor cells, washed cells were cytocentrifuged for 3 min at 800 rpm on a glass slide using a Cytospin-2 centrifuge and then fixed with Biofix (Bio-Optica; Milan, Italy), then treated with anti-Sp17 antibody with the same protocol as immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell line and culture conditions</title><p>The HO8910 human ovary carcinoma cell line was a gift from Dr. Liu Qi (Medical School of Nanjing University, China).

In vitro DNA transfection was by lipofectamine-mediated transfection procedure. The cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C under an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and 6 h later, the media was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FCS. Stably transfected clones were selected 36 h later by adding G418 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 500 &#x003bc;g&#x000b7;ml<sup>-1</sup>. The stable clones were then evaluated for the expression of hSp17/EGFP by fluorescent microscopy, and confirmed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis. Transfectants with vector pEGFP-N1/hSp17 and pEGFP-N1 were termed HO8910/hSp17 and HO8910/EGFP cells, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Proteins in HSp17/EGFP expressing cells and EGFP expressing cell lysates (20 &#x003bc;g protein/lane) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in 12% gels and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). After the blot was blocked in PBS-T with 5% skim milk for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C, membrane-bound proteins were immunolabeled with anti-HSp17 monoclonal antibody overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The membranes were washed three times. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody was incubated with the membranes for 1 h at RT and subsequently washed three times. Membranes were then detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) and x-ray film.

These proteins collectively form a new class of tumor associated antigens called cancer-testis (CT) antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Furthermore they have become the most extensively studied antigen group in the field of tumor immunology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. HSp17 is a highly conserved mammalian protein that was originally isolated from rabbit epididymal sperm and testis membranes and has been identified as a member of CT antigen family. The mRNA encoding HSp17 has been found to be highly expressed in a number of in vitro neoplastic cell lines, including lung cancer, prostate cancer, and osteocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. HSp17 protein has been recognized in healthy testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], normal ciliated cells of the male and female reproductive tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], human multiple myeloma cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and in malignant lymphocytes and various tumoral tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The immunogenicity and tissue localization of Sp17 made it an attractive candidate for developing specific active immunotherapy procedures. Nakazato et al. identified Sp17 as a candidate gene related to the chemoresistance of clear cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Bumm et al. showed that Sp17 can be used as a marker to discriminate between 2 subsets of primary esthesioneuroblastomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Our program's primary focus is to study the clinical relevance of aberrant Sp17 expression in order to identify a better prognostic marker and new treatment for ovarian cancer. We analyzed the expression of Sp17 in a panel of ovarian tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry and showed that Sp17 was positive in 43% percent of EOC specimens. We found that Sp17 was present in various tumor types of EOC. Its expression pattern was heterogeneous in all of the positive cancer tissue samples, and expression did not correlate with the histological subtype and degree of malignancy. Although late stage (III-IV) tumors expressed higher amount of Sp17 than early stage tumors, the statistical analysis did not show a significant difference (data not shown).</p><p>Unexpectedly, we observed that all of metastatic ascitic fluid cancer cells from eight EOC patients were positive for Sp17. Therefore, we presume that Sp17 could promote the migration and metastatic activity of cancer cells. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we generated a cell model that over-expressed Sp17 by transfecting Sp17 cDNA into an ovarian cancer cell line, HO8910. HSp17 was present in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface in these model cells, and induced a significant increase in HO8910 migration by a transwell assay. Previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and our results show that the HSp17 gene is greatly induced in metastatic cells. Several recent reports have implicated Sp17 as having a role in cell-cell adhesion and/or cell migration in transformed, lymphocytic, and hematopoietic cells, possibly through its interaction with extracellular heparan sulphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] or its binding to AKAP3.</p><p>Although investigators in different laboratories observed Sp17 in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and on the cell surface, little knowledge of its function related to its localization has been reported. The role of Sp17 in promoting heparin sulphate-mediated adhesion of lymphoid cells has been proposed by Lacy and Sanderson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], who showed that Sp17 expressed on the surface of lymphoid-derived cells from a patient with plasma cell leukemia promoted cell-cell adhesion via interaction with the heparin sulphate chain of syndecan 1.</p><p>Among the three functional domains of HSp17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], the N-terminal domain is similar to the dimer-interaction site in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) IIa regulatory subunit (RII alpha), the central sulphated carbohydrate-binding domain is necessary for heparin binding. Sp17's binding to A-kinase anchoring protein 3 (AKAP3) may reflect a functional need for Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM at sites along the flagella, where Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM is known to play a role in motility.</p><p>Nakazato et al. showed that Sp17 is differentially expressed between clear cell carcinoma and serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary. They examined the effect of small interfering RNA targeting the Sp17 gene on the chemoresistance of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the ovary to paclitaxel and found that this treatment decreased the chemoresistance of these cells to paclitaxel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Their study suggests that expression of the Sp17 gene can be used as a predictor of the chemoresistance of ovarian cancer to paclitaxel. We also demonstrated that Sp17 plays an important role in the chemoresistance of the ovarian cancer cell line HO8910 to cisplatin and carboplatin, the other two fist-line chemotherapeutics for ovarian cancer. Although further investigation is needed to clarify the functions of Sp17 in ovarian cancer, our study suggests that expression of the Sp17 gene can be used as a predictor of the migration and chemoresistance of ovarian cancer to chemotherapeutics.</p><p>In conclusion, we investigated the aberrant expression of human sperm protein 17 in human epithelial ovarian cancer cells and its influences on the cell migration and chemoresistance, and found that HSp17 was aberrantly expressed in 43% of the patients with primary epithelial ovarian carcinomas, and in all of the metastatic cancer cells of ascites from 8 patients; Overexpression of HSp17 increased the migration but decreased the chemosensitivity of ovarian carcinoma cells to carboplatin and cisplatin. The results strongly suggest that HSp17 plays a role in metastatic disease and resistance of epithelial ovarian carcinoma to chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FQL conceived, coordinated and designed the study, and contributed to the acquisition, analysis and interpretation of data and drafted the manuscript.
