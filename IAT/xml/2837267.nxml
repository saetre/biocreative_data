The first member of this family to be cloned and characterized, <italic>TaALMT1</italic>, is responsible for most of the natural variation of Al<sup>3+</sup> resistance in wheat. The current study describes the isolation and characterization of <italic>HvALMT1</italic>, the barley gene with the greatest sequence similarity to <italic>TaALMT1</italic>. <italic>HvALMT1</italic> is located on chromosome 2H which has not been associated with Al<sup>3+</sup> resistance in barley. The relatively low levels of <italic>HvALMT1</italic> expression detected in root and shoot tissues were independent of external aluminium or phosphorus supply. Transgenic barley plants transformed with the <italic>HvALMT1</italic> promoter fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) indicated that expression of <italic>HvALMT1</italic> was relatively high in stomatal guard cells and in root tissues containing expanding cells. GFP fused to the C-terminus of the full HvALMT1 protein localized to the plasma membrane and motile vesicles within the cytoplasm. <italic>HvALMT1</italic> conferred both inward and outward currents when expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes that were bathed in a range of anions including malate. Both malate uptake and efflux were confirmed in oocyte assays using [<sup>14</sup>C]malate as a radiotracer. It is suggested that HvALMT1 functions as an anion channel to facilitate organic anion transport in stomatal function and expanding cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Channel</kwd><kwd>HvALMT1</kwd><kwd>malate</kwd><kwd>oocytes</kwd><kwd>organic anion</kwd><kwd>stomata</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ALMT family of membrane proteins possess 5&#x02013;7 predicted transmembrane domains and the UPF0005 domain of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Delhaize <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref><italic>b</italic>). Of the seven <italic>ALMT</italic> genes that have been investigated to date, most are implicated in Al<sup>3+</sup> resistance mechanisms, with <italic>TaALMT1</italic> from wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) being the most thoroughly studied. <italic>TaALMT1</italic> is expressed constitutively within root apices and maps to chromosome 4DL in the region of a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for Al<sup>3+</sup> resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Raman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Variation in Al<sup>3+</sup> resistance among many wheat genotypes is positively correlated with <italic>TaALMT1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Raman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The membrane topology of TaALMT1 determined experimentally identifies six transmembrane domains in the N-terminal half of the protein, with both termini located on the extracellular side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Motoda <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that TaALMT1 is an anion channel located on the plasma membrane that, upon exposure to Al<sup>3+</sup>, is activated to release malate from the cytoplasm of root cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamaguchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). This malate binds Al<sup>3+</sup> in the apoplasm to form a non-toxic complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Delhaize <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ryan <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). When expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes TaALMT1 is permeable to malate but not citrate, and shows a degree of specificity for activation by Al<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In a more recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pineros <italic>et al.</italic> (2008</xref><italic>a</italic>) showed that TaALMT1 expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes is capable of facilitating anion influx and is permeable to inorganic anions such as nitrate and chloride when external anion concentrations are high. Although TaALMT1 activity was enhanced by Al<sup>3+</sup>, the protein was still functionally active, albeit at a lower level, in the absence of Al<sup>3+</sup> and this was also observed when the gene was expressed in tobacco suspension cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ligaba <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)</xref> provided evidence that TaALMT1 activity is regulated by protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation. They also established that TaALMT1 activity was disrupted when the serine residue at position 384 was replaced with an alanine, and concluded that the serine residue needed to be phosphorylated before Al<sup>3+</sup> can activate TaALMT1.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>TaALMT1</italic>, transcript levels of other <italic>ALMT1</italic> genes implicated in the Al<sup>3+</sup> resistance of other species are increased when roots are exposed to Al<sup>3+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoekenga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ligaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fontecha <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Collins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Of these, AtALMT1 from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoekenga <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), and BnALMT1 and BnALMT2 from rape (<italic>Brassica napus</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ligaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) confer Al<sup>3+</sup>-activated malate efflux when expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. In addition to a role in Al<sup>3+</sup> resistance, AtALMT1 has recently been implicated in the recruitment of beneficial bacteria to the rhizosphere of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> after malate efflux from roots was triggered by foliar infection with <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rudrappa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The remaining two <italic>ALMT</italic> genes characterized to date from maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have different functions and do not appear to contribute to Al<sup>3+</sup> resistance. The ZmALMT1 protein of maize is located on the plasma membrane of cells at the root apices of maize. Although <italic>ZmALMT1</italic> expression is induced by Al<sup>3+</sup> and the protein is weakly activated by Al<sup>3+</sup>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pineros <italic>et al.</italic> (2008</xref><italic>b</italic>) proposed a role in mineral nutrition because the protein is more permeable to inorganic anions such as sulphate and nitrate than to malate or citrate. Another <italic>ALMT</italic> gene from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<italic>AtALMT9</italic>) is expressed in hypocotyls and leaves. The protein is located at the tonoplast and transports malate out of the cytoplasm and into the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kovermann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>This study describes the isolation and characteriztion of an <italic>ALMT</italic> gene from barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>) named <italic>HvALMT1</italic>.

Despite its strong similarity it is evident that HvALMT1 functions differently from TaALMT1. <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes expressing <italic>HvALMT1</italic> induced larger inward and outward currents than water-injected controls when bathed in malate, fumarate, or citrate. The ability of HvALMT1 to transport malate in oocytes was verified by radiotracer experiments that showed greater efflux and uptake of [<sup>14</sup>C]malate compared with controls. These data support the hypothesis that HvALMT1 is a transport protein that facilitates the movement of malate and other ions across oocyte membranes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pineros <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> similarly found that expression of <italic>TaALMT1</italic> in oocytes conferred inward and outward currents of a similar magnitude to those described here for HvALMT1. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kovermann <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> found fumarate- and malate-dependent inward currents in vacuoles isolated from tobacco leaves heterologously expressing <italic>AtALMT9</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pineros <italic>et al.</italic> (2008</xref><italic>b</italic>) found that oocytes expressing <italic>ZmALMT1</italic> showed citrate-dependent currents although ZmALMT1 appeared to have low transport capacity for organic anions compared with inorganic anions. HvALMT1 was weakly activated by Al<sup>3+</sup>, showing a small increase in inward current of a similar magnitude to that observed for ZmALMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pineros <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref><italic>b</italic>), which contrasts with the much larger activation observed for TaALMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pineros <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref><italic>a</italic>). In view of this weak activation it is concluded that HvALMT1 is likely to function in the plant independently of Al<sup>3+</sup>. Seven members of the ALMT family have now been functionally characterized in oocytes, with four strongly activated by Al<sup>3+</sup> and three, including HvALMT1, showing little or no activation by Al<sup>3+</sup>. To identify amino acid residues that potentially interact with Al<sup>3+</sup> to activate the proteins, all seven sequences were aligned, and amino acids shared by the Al<sup>3+</sup>-activated proteins but absent from the others were looked for. Although no identical amino acids were apparent, seven amino acids with strong similarity to one another were present only in the Al<sup>3+</sup>-activated proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erq023/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S6</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). These residues are located in the C-terminus hydrophilic region thought to be located in the extracellular region (Motada <italic>et al.</italic> 2007). Interestingly, one of these amino acids is a serine located at position 384 of TaALMT1, a residue required for activity and that is potentially phosphorylated (Ligaba, 2009). However, the function of this serine appears not to be conserved since the <italic>B. napus</italic> proteins possess alanine at the equivalent position yet are still functional and Al<sup>3+</sup> activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ligaba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The outward currents from oocytes expressing <italic>HvALMT1</italic> were independent of external pH, while the inward current measured with malate in the bathing solution increased with decreasing pH. The efflux of [<sup>14</sup>C]malate from oocytes appeared to be similarly regulated by pH since [<sup>14</sup>C]malate efflux was greater at pH 4.5 than at pH 7.5. The relative current magnitude cannot be directly compared with the [<sup>14</sup>C]malate fluxes because the currents were measured while membrane potentials were clamped at each voltage, whereas for the [<sup>14</sup>C]malate measurements the voltage was not clamped. Furthermore <sup>14</sup>C measurements will also include any non-electrogenic fluxes occurring. The efflux of [<sup>14</sup>C]malate decreased after 2&#x02009;min, suggesting either that internal malate was depleted or that transport through HvALMT1 was rapidly stalled for some other reason such as by the flow of counter ions. When malate, citrate, or fumarate were added to the external solution at pH 4.5 the magnitude of the inward current (and hence efflux of an endogenous anion) increased when compared with Cl<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and MES as well as control oocytes bathed in the same solutions. This suggests that HvALMT1 transport activity is enhanced by external organic anion supply, possibly providing a positive feedback mechanism where organic anion (e.g. malate) efflux by HvALMT1 promotes a sustained efflux of organic anions. These results indicate that HvALMT1 functions as a transport protein, but more work is required to show how the protein is regulated and to determine whether these findings reflect the function of HvALMT1 in plants. Specifically, it will be important to ascertain whether the protein is regulated by the external pH and if high concentrations of external anions enhance efflux.</p><p>The strong sequence similarity between HvALMT1 and the anion channel TaALMT1 suggests that HvALMT1 also functions as an anion channel selective for organic anions. A proportion of the HvALMT1::GFP fusion protein localized to the plasma membrane, which would lead to the efflux of organic anions from the cell. HvALMT1::GFP was also located on motile vesicles which may represent the endomembrane system that delivers the protein to the plasma membrane. Therefore, the localization of HvALMT1 to the vesicles may function to load such vesicles with organic anions. The vesicles could then be transferred to other internal organelles or their contents released to the apoplasm by exocytosis if they fuse with the plasma membrane. A similar cellular localization pattern between the plasma membrane and motile vesicles was reported for a K<sup>+</sup> transporter (KAT1)::GFP fusion in the guard cells of faba bean (<italic>Vicia faba</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hurst <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). ABA triggers the retrieval of the KAT1 proteins from the plasma membrane via the movement of vesicles and the transporters are returned to the plasma membrane after ABA is withdrawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sutter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The dual subcellular localization of KAT1 represents a mechanism whereby the KAT1 protein is transported to the plasma membrane via exocytotic vesicles during the period of guard cell expansion (stomatal opening). The model suggested that during stomatal closure (guard cell contraction), transporter-rich areas of the plasma membrane are recovered by endocytotic vesicles, providing a mechanism for changing the area of plasma membrane surrounding the guard cell and the activity (number) of transporters within the membrane during expansion and contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hurst <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meckel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sutter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>HvALMT1</italic> promoter::GFP fusion fluoresced strongly in guard cells of stomata, suggesting that HvALMT1 is involved in stomatal function, perhaps even regulating stomatal aperture. Anion channels are essential for regulating turgor pressure, and malate transport is known to be pivotal in this regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Roelfsema and Hedrich, 2005</xref>). HvALMT1 may be one of the pathways for malate efflux from guard cells either by functioning as an anion channel at the plasma membrane or via exocytosis by first loading vesicles with organic anions. The density of anion channels in the plasma membrane may even be regulated by a similar mechanism to that of the KAT1 transporters discussed above, with HvALMT1 being similarly transported to, and retrieved from, the plasma membrane via motile vesicles.</p><p>Patch clamping of guard cell protoplasts from faba bean has identified two anion conductances that are involved in the control of the stomatal aperture: a rapid (R-type) conductance and a slow (S-type) conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schroeder and Keller, 1992</xref>). The R-type channel activates rapidly and is voltage dependent such that conductance increases at membrane potentials more positive than &#x02013;80&#x02009;mV. In contrast, the S-type channel is active over a wider range of membrane potentials including those more negative than &#x02013;80&#x02009;mV. The conductance of HvALMT1 is unknown, and nor is it clear how rapidly the protein is activated, but the current&#x02013;voltage curves generated by expression in oocytes show some similarity with the S-type channel.</p><p>For the guard cell anion channel GCAC1 (characterized from faba bean) the addition of malate to the external medium shifts the membrane potential at which maximum current occurs towards the resting potential of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hedrich <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). Addition of malate also increases the magnitude of the inward current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lohse and Hedrich, 1995</xref>), indicative of a greater efflux of malate from the cell. Similarly, the addition of organic anions to the bathing solution of oocytes expressing HvALMT1 increased the current density at positive and negative membrane potentials, and shifted the reversal potential more negatively. GCAC1 activity is also affected by external pH. A decrease in the external pH decreases the inactivation of the conductance in response to membrane depolarization and also decreases the activation in response to membrane repolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schulz-Lessdorf <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). This change is probably related more to the pH gradient across the plasma membrane than the apoplasmic pH <italic>per se</italic>. The present data demonstrate that conductance of HvALMT1 also increases at low external pH. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> the <italic>SLAC1</italic> gene is highly expressed in guard cells of stomata and has a role in the function of the S-type channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Negi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vahisalu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Although direct evidence of transport activity was not demonstrated in that study, the disruption of organic and inorganic anions in protoplasts of guard cells isolated from <italic>slac1</italic> mutants was indicative that SLAC1 is important in anion homeostasis and hence stomatal function. More recently, two studies have identified SLAC1 as an anion channel that is regulated by ABA in a signal transduction pathway involving a kinase&#x02013;phosphatase pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Geiger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Although ABA regulates SLAC1 activity, the Genevestigator database indicates that ABA does not induce <italic>SLAC1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zimmermann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Similarly, the present study showed that <italic>HvALMT1</italic> expression was not induced by ABA and it is more likely that if HvALMT1 activity is regulated by ABA then it will be via a similar signal transduction pathway. Interestingly, although SLAC1 was permeable to a range of anions, it had relatively low permeability towards malate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Geiger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and it is possible that malate efflux from guard cells is conferred by ALMT proteins acting in parallel to SLAC1.</p><p>In addition to the guard cells, <italic>HvALMT1</italic> is expressed in the root elongation zone, lateral roots, and floral spikes, indicating that the protein might facilitate organic anion transport within these tissues perhaps to regulate turgor. Both processes are important in growing and elongating cells due to their high metabolic activity.</p><p>Several <italic>ALMT</italic>-like genes are present in the barley genome, with <italic>HvALMT1</italic> appearing to be the most similar to the wheat Al<sup>3+</sup>-resistance gene <italic>TaALMT1</italic>. The analysis of wheat&#x02013;barley addition lines showed that <italic>HvALMT1</italic> localized to chromosome 2H and not to chromosome 4H to where a major Al<sup>3+</sup>-resistance locus has been mapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, the expression of <italic>HvALMT1</italic> was not induced by Al<sup>3+</sup> treatment nor was it expressed at a higher level in the Al<sup>3+</sup>-resistant cultivar Dayton. Taken together these data confirm that, despite its similarity to <italic>TaALMT1, HvALMT1</italic> is not the major determinant of Al<sup>3+</sup> resistance in barley. Instead it is now apparent that a gene located on chromosome 4H and encoding a member of the unrelated MATE family of proteins controls Al<sup>3+</sup> resistance in barley by facilitating citrate efflux from roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Furukawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fontecha <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> identified a partial (524 nucleotide) <italic>ALMT</italic> sequence generated by PCR from barley that appeared to localize to chromosome 4H. Since this sequence is identical to a PCR-amplified sequence from <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>, it is likely that it was generated from contaminated DNA. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Collins <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> probed wheat&#x02013;barley addition lines with <italic>ScALMT1</italic> from rye (<italic>Secale cereale</italic>; &#x0003e;90% nucleotide sequence identity to <italic>TaALMT1</italic>) using Southern blots and only identified an <italic>ALMT</italic> gene that was located on chromosome 2HL, consistent with the present result. Indeed, when primers specific to <italic>TaALMT1</italic> were used in PCR, products were amplified from samples that contained wheat DNA but not barley DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref> and data not shown). <italic>TaALMT1</italic> is located on chromosome 4D in wheat, and the absence of a barley <italic>ALMT</italic> gene on chromosome 4H with greater sequence similarity to <italic>TaALMT1</italic> than <italic>HvALMT1</italic> (75% identical nucleotide sequence) is puzzling. It is possible that <italic>HvALMT1</italic> was originally located on chromosome 4H in the common ancestor of wheat and barley but was then translocated to chromosome 2H in barley subsequent to the divergence of the species. Alternatively, it is possible that a <italic>TaALMT1</italic> orthologue present in the common ancestor of wheat and barley was lost in the barley lineage and that <italic>HvALMT1</italic> represents a related but distinct homologue. The second alternative is more likely given the presence of <italic>AetALMT2</italic> (GenBank accession EF424085) in <italic>Aegilops tauschii</italic> (the D-genome donor of bread wheat) which has 95% nucleotide sequence identity to <italic>HvALMT1</italic> and two wheat ESTs (GenBank accessions BF483400 and BQ170664) with identical sequence to <italic>AetALMT1</italic> that map to chromosome 2B (Graingenes 2.0 database; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/">http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/</ext-link>) the homeologous chromosome to 2H in barley. Therefore, it is likely that <italic>AetALMT2</italic> and other highly similar sequences in hexaploid wheat (such as those represented by the ESTs) are genes orthologous to <italic>HvALMT1</italic> of barley.</p><p>In summary, it has been shown that HvALMT1 from barley is capable of facilitating the transport of malate and probably other anions. The gene does not confer the major Al<sup>3+</sup> resistance of barley but its high expression in guard cells and roots suggests a role in anion transport and regulation in these tissues.
