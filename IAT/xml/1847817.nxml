Albeit that some fluid may be expelled through the trachea and mouth during parturition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], the majority is absorbed by lung epithelia secondary to active Na absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Rising endogenous epinephrine levels near term contribute to a decreased alveolar fluid volume, increased Na absorption, and induction of lung fluid absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Na absorption is driven by basolateral Na,K-ATPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and apical epithelial Na channels (ENaC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] in the lung epithelial cells.</p><p>Cytokines, such as IL-1, have been proposed to signal parturition onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. During a normal pregnancy, low amniotic IL-1&#x003b2; levels are present, but higher IL-1&#x003b2; levels are seen in preterm labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Many preterm infants suffer from fetal infection and/or the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). It has been proposed that alveolar epithelial ion transport abnormalities may be important in RDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Experimental studies have suggested that cytokines could signal lung maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Bry and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] reported increased surfactant protein mRNA expression and improved lung compliance after intra-amniotic IL-1&#x003b1; administration. Maternal IL-1&#x003b2; exposure in guinea pigs induced fetal lung fluid absorption by activating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This led to fetal cortisol synthesis, which in turn increased membrane expression of &#x003b2;-adrenoceptors (&#x003b2;AR), Na,K-ATPases, and ENaC as well as induced fetal lung fluid absorption.</p><p>It has been proposed that mitogen activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) may regulate &#x003b2;AR stimulation of lung fluid absorption by affecting Na,K-ATPase membrane expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We thus decided to study if maternal IL-1&#x003b2; pretreatment activated MAP kinase pathways in fetal guinea pig lungs and if this would affect induction and stimulation of lung fluid absorption. Our hypothesis was that maternal IL-1&#x003b2; pretreatment induced MAP kinase signaling via cortisol synthesis/release. Consequently, the first aim of these studies was to measure MEK and ERK activation as pMEK and pERK expression in guinea pig fetal lungs at gestation days (D) 61 and 68 (term = 69D gestation). The second aim was to determine the MAP kinase pathway specificity of this response by measuring JNK phosphorylation. We could not measure p38 activation due to a lack of decent cross-reacting antibodies for guinea pigs. Finally, in order to functionally test the hypothesis, the third aim was to study if the MEK inhibitor U0126 affected lung fluid absorption when administered directly to the fetal lungs. We also examined the lungs for ERK expression after U0126 instillation. Since cortisol synthesis has been demonstrated as important for IL-1&#x003b2; induction of lung fluid absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], the fourth aim was to study the effect of cortisol synthesis inhibition by metyrapone (MP) on ERK expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Preterm Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs (Hilltop Lab Animals, Inc., Scottdale, PA) were used (<italic>N </italic>= 123 divided on 31 litters).

Lung fluid absorption studies were carried out on the morning of the last pretreatment day.</p><p>MP pretreatment was carried out over three days simultaneously with the IL-1&#x003b2; pretreatment. Subcutaneous MP injections were given twice daily (25 mg/kg body wt to reach a total daily dose of 50 mg/kg body wt) to guinea pigs of 59 and 66D gestation. In the morning of the day of the lung fluid absorption study, one half the daily dose was given. The MP dose was adopted from its higher ranges of clinical dosage.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgery</title><p>Timed-pregnant guinea pigs were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of pentobarbital sodium (120 mg/kg body wt; Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) and euthanized by intracardiac injections of 60 mg pentobarbital sodium. A laparotomy was rapidly done and the fetuses were carefully delivered. The umbilical cord was ligated to prevent bleeding. The fetuses were immediately euthanized by i.p. sodium pentobarbital (12 mg) mixed with 500 IU heparin (Elkins-Sinn, Cherry Hill, NJ). After euthanasia, an endotracheal tube (PE-190; Clay Adams, BD, Parsippany, NJ) was inserted via a tracheostomy. The fetuses were connected to a constant O<sub>2 </sub>flow (FIO<sub>2 </sub>= 1.0; Praxair, Akron, OH) and the lungs were expanded by adjusting the O<sub>2 </sub>flow to a constant positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Fetuses were placed between heating pads to maintain body temperature during the studies. A temperature probe measured body temperature and heating was adjusted to maintain the temperature at 37&#x02013;38&#x000b0;C. Airway pressure was continuously monitored by calibrated pressure transducers and analogue-to-digital converters and amplifiers (ADInstruments, Grand Junction, CO).</p></sec><sec><title>Lung fluid absorption</title><p>Lung fluid absorption was studied as before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Briefly, the albumin solution (10 ml/kg body wt) was instilled into the lungs through the endotracheal tube. Fetuses were briefly disconnected from the CPAP and the lungs were deflated by gently aspirating residual air with the instillation syringe. The instillation solution was instilled and withdrawn. This procedure was repeated four times to allow thorough mixing of instillate and pre-existing fetal lung fluid and the fluid was finally instilled. The fetuses were reconnected to the CPAP and remained on CPAP for 1 h. A 0.1-ml sample of instillation solution &#x02013; lung fluid mixture (initial solution) was retained for protein measurement. After 1 h, remaining lung fluid was collected. Instillate, initial, and final solution protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (Labsystems Multiscan Microplate Reader, Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) by the Lowry method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] adapted for microtiter plates.</p><p>Lung fluid absorption in ventilated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], earlier <italic>in situ </italic>CPAP animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and in our <italic>in situ </italic>CPAP animals was not significantly different.

The novel finding in this study was that MAP kinase activation followed maternal IL-1&#x003b2; exposure and elevated plasma cortisol concentrations and seemed to be at least partly responsible for the induced and stimulated fluid absorption rates at 61 and 68D gestation, respectively. Guinea pig lungs convert from fluid secretion to fluid absorption 3&#x02013;5 days before birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The successful transition from fluid secretion to absorption in the lung is directly related to infant breathing and postnatal lung function. Several recent studies have suggested a novel role for IL-1 in lung maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], where IL-1&#x003b2; may accelerate lung maturation in guinea pigs by accelerating the epithelial conversion to lung fluid absorption during gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It has been demonstrated in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] that lung fluid is reabsorbed secondary to Na absorption. The molecular mechanism for this has been suggested to be the epithelial Na channel (ENaC) and this channel is sensitive to amiloride inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>MAP kinases such as ERK and JNK have previously been demonstrated to be activated by cytokines and stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Although the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway and its downstream transcription factors are the best characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], this signaling cascade has also been reported in regulation of multiple post-transcriptional mechanisms related to the translational machinery. This occurs primarily via regulation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and the p70<sup>s6K </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In multiple investigations, it has been demonstrated in adult rats that dopamine and isoproterenol as well as growth factors can upregulate Na,K-ATPase expression via activating the MEK/ERK MAP kinase pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Mostly, ERK activation led to increased expression and function of basolateral Na,K-ATPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and some studies have suggested that activation of mTOR and p70<sup>s6K </sup>were important downstream in stimulating increased Na,K-ATPase activity and expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However to our knowledge no study has investigated the effect of MAP kinase activation on ENaC function and lung fluid absorption in fetal lungs. In preliminary unpublished results from our laboratory activation of the MAP kinase pathway did not change lung ENaC expression. From these results, we cannot tell if ENaC activity was altered by MAP kinase activation. However, our data supports an effect on transepithelial Na<sup>+ </sup>transport that may relate to MAP kinase stimulation of the Na,K-ATPase, as demonstrated earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], as well as resulting in a secondary ENaC activation. Thus, we hypothesized that maternal IL-1&#x003b2; pretreatment and its effect on induction of cortisol synthesis and release is mediated in part by activation of ERK and JNK pathways in developing fetal guinea pig lungs. IL-1&#x003b2; pretreatment increased pMEK and pERK expression in fetal guinea pig lungs, but did not affect pJNK expression. This increased pERK expression was attenuated by intratracheal administration of the MEK inhibitor, U0126. Also, simultaneous administration of U0126 attenuated the IL-1&#x003b2;-induced/stimulated lung fluid absorption in the 61 and 68D gestation fetal lungs, suggesting that the ERK pathway was involved in IL-1&#x003b2; increased lung fluid absorption.</p><p>It has been reported earlier that IL-1&#x003b2; acts on the hypothalamus to stimulate release of hypothalamic corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) and thus activate the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland axis with release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and plasma cortisol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that IL-1&#x003b2; increased lung fluid absorption at least partly via the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland axis and plasma cortisol synthesis and release in maternal animals and/or fetuses. As demonstrated earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], MP pretreatment attenuated the IL-1&#x003b2;-induced/stimulated lung fluid absorption in fetal guinea pig lungs. Moreover, MP pretreatment completely inhibited pERK expression normally observed after maternal IL-1&#x003b2; pretreatment. This is a significant observation since there has been little prior evidence that plasma cortisol may affect MAP kinase signaling pathways.</p><p>The involvement of the ERK pathway in fluid clearance late in gestation may not be significant, as the 68D gestation lungs demonstrated a smaller ERK activation, but still a statistical increase in lung fluid absorption. Albeit the reasons for this may be plentiful, including little or no involvement of ERK at this gestation age, there were larger variations in the rates of both baseline lung fluid absorption and IL-1&#x003b2;-stimulated lung fluid absorption at 68D gestation than at 61D gestation. This may have resulted from release of variable endogenous plasma stress hormones, as these rises late during gestation as term approaches. It is inherently difficult to obtain homogenous guinea pigs at this gestation age and consequently the variation may be expected to be greater. All of this potentially leading to a false positive or negative result in signaling pathway function, since the same factors we are introducing via the IL-1&#x003b2; injections, ACTH and cortisol, are also being endogenously released at this gestation stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the results from this study suggest that MAP kinase activation after maternal IL-1&#x003b2; exposure with its resulting elevation of plasma cortisol concentrations may have been involved in controlling the extent of induction of fetal lung fluid absorption. This also suggests an intracellular control mechanism that might prove useful to pharmacologically induce in order to accelerate the conversion from lung fluid secretion to lung fluid absorption in the preterm lung in order to prevent respiratory syndrome development.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Supported by Research Grant No. 6-FY03-64 from the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation.</p><p>The authors wish to express their thanks to our Sr. Research Associates Sonya M.
