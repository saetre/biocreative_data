Here we describe a new mutation in <italic>MSTN</italic> found in the whippet dog breed that results in a double-muscled phenotype known as the &#x0201c;bully&#x0201d; whippet. Individuals with this phenotype carry two copies of a two-base-pair deletion in the third exon of <italic>MSTN</italic> leading to a premature stop codon at amino acid 313.

The canine species presents an excellent system in which to find such associative genes. The purebred dog has a long history of selective breeding, which has produced specific breeds of extraordinary strength, intelligence, and speed. We have discovered a mutation in the canine myostatin gene, a negative regulator of muscle mass, which affects muscle composition, and hence racing speed, in whippets. Dogs that possess a single copy of this mutation are more muscled than normal and are among the fastest dogs in competitive racing events. However, dogs with two copies of the same mutation are grossly overmuscled, superficially resembling double-muscled cattle known to possess similar mutations. This result is the first to quantitatively link a mutation in the myostatin gene to athletic performance. Further, it emphasizes what is sure to be a growing area of research for performance-enhancing polymorphisms in competitive athletics. Future implications include screening for myostatin mutations among elite athletes. However, as little is known about the health issues and potential risks associated with being a myostatin-mutation carrier, research in this arena should proceed with extreme caution.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Mosher DS, Quignon P, Bustamante CD, Sutter NB, Mellersh CS, et al.

The typical whippet is similar in conformation to the greyhound, a medium-sized sighthound, weighing about 9 kg and characterized by a slim build, long neck, small head, and pointed snout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030079-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.

Owners report that &#x0201c;bully&#x0201d; whippets do not have any health abnormalities other than muscle cramping in the shoulder and thigh. However, the dogs are often euthanized at an early age as they do not conform to the American Kennel Club breed standard. In addition, about 50&#x00025; of &#x0201c;bully&#x0201d; whippets have a distinctive overbite.</p><p>The &#x0201c;bully&#x0201d; whippet phenotype is reminiscent of the double muscling phenotype seen in other species that is caused by mutations in the myostatin <italic>(MSTN)</italic> gene.

A 2-bp deletion was discovered in the third exon of the <italic>MSTN</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030079-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This deletion removes nucleotides 939 and 940 within exon three and leads to a premature stop codon at amino acid 313 instead of the normal cysteine, removing 63 aa from the predicted 375-aa protein. The lost cysteine is one of several highly conserved cysteines known to form disulfide dimers required for protein function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Of the 22 whippets sequenced, all &#x0201c;bully&#x0201d; whippets tested (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4) were homozygous for the deletion <italic>(mh/mh)</italic> while all dogs that sired or whelped a &#x0201c;bully&#x0201d; whippet (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5) were heterozygous for the deletion (<italic>mh/&#x0002b;</italic>). None of the initial set of 13 normal-appearing whippets that lacked a family history of the &#x0201c;bully&#x0201d; phenotype carried the deletion; these dogs were designated wild type (<italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</italic>). An additional set of DNA samples from 146 whippets (both racers and nonracers) were collected at racing events and through the mail without regard to the dogs' family histories of the &#x0201c;bully&#x0201d; phenotype. These were sequenced across exon three to determine the frequency of the 2-bp mutation among the dogs sampled. Of these, two were homozygous for the deletion, 20 were heterozygous, and the remaining 124 did not carry the deletion.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Mode of Inheritance and Heterozygote Phenotypes</title><p>The &#x0201c;bully&#x0201d; phenotype displays a simple autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, as all &#x0201c;bullies&#x0201d; resulted from the mating of carriers. The parents have a phenotype of intermediate musculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030079-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In order to quantify the allelic substitution and dominance effects of the deletion mutation we considered three measures of musculature: mass-to-height ratio, neck girth, and chest girth. For all three measures, heterozygous females (<italic>mh/&#x0002b;)</italic> were intermediate in musculature, <italic>mh/mh</italic> females had the highest measures, and female <italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</italic> whippets had the lowest measures. Male <italic>mh/&#x0002b;</italic> whippets were more muscular than wild-type males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030079-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030079-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Mass (kg) and height at the withers (cm) information was available for 71 female and 55 male whippets; we analyzed the two sexes separately due to a lack of samples from male <italic>mh/mh</italic> whippets. Two analyses suggest strong statistical support for the idea that the <italic>mh</italic> deletion mutation affects the mass-to-height ratio. First, a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis one factor Analysis of Variance for females using genotype as a factor (<italic>mh/mh</italic>, <italic>mh/&#x0002b;</italic>, and &#x0002b;/&#x0002b;) was highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x02248; 7.43 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Likewise, a two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test comparing mass-to-height ratio of <italic>mh/</italic>&#x0002b; and &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; males was also significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x02248; 0.00017), with whippets heterozygous for the mutation exhibiting, on average, 17&#x00025; more mass per cm of height (i.e., 0.333 kg/cm for <italic>mh/</italic>&#x0002b; as compared to 0.284 kg/cm for &#x0002b;/&#x0002b; genotypes). Second, we used standard least-squares regression to estimate the allelic substitution (<italic>a</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0817; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 2.44 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>) and dominance effects (<italic>d</italic> &#x0003d; &#x02212;0.0423; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.00415) in female whippets and found both parameters were significantly different than zero. These results, along with box plots of the phenotype by genotype class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030079-g003">Figure 3</xref>), suggest that the mutation is partially recessive with heterozygotes (<italic>mh/</italic>&#x0002b;) having musculature closer to, but significantly different from, that of wild types (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;). As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030079-t001">Table 1</xref>, we found that the <italic>mh</italic> mutation also affected neck and chest girth in a similar fashion in females with a highly significant effect of <italic>MSTN</italic> genotype on phenotype. Overall, we estimate that <italic>mh</italic> explains approximately 60&#x00025; of the variation in both mass-to-height ratio and neck girth (i.e., <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 60&#x00025;) and 31&#x00025; of the variation in chest girth (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030079-t001">Table 1</xref>). In male whippets, we also observed a highly significant difference in neck girth (<italic>p</italic> &#x02248; 0.0013, Wilcoxon rank sum test) and nearly significant difference in chest girth (<italic>p</italic> &#x02248; 0.11, Wilcoxon rank sum test) among wild type (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;) and heterozygotes (<italic>mh/</italic>&#x0002b;).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Association of Heterozygosity with Racing Speed</title><p>We hypothesized that the increased muscle mass of the heterozygotes would allow for increased speed when compared to wild type (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;) whippets. Analysis of 85 genotyped dogs for which we obtained racing grades revealed an association between a dog's genotype and racing grade using two separate (but not independent) approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030079-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Only one <italic>mh/mh</italic> dog competed in racing events and it was a grade-A racer, so we included this dog with the heterozygotes and considered the absence or presence of the deletion for all analyses (i.e., we sum across the <italic>mh/&#x0002b;</italic> and <italic>mh/mh</italic> columns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030079-t002">Table 2</xref>. First, we find a significant positive correlation between racing grade (A, B, C, and D in order from fastest to slowest) and the frequency of dogs carrying the <italic>mh</italic> deletion in either homozygous or heterozygous state (<italic>p</italic> &#x02248; 0.00028, &#x003c4; &#x0003d; 0.3619, Kendall's nonparametric measure). Secondly, standard contingency table analysis reveals strong evidence for heterogeneity in the frequency of dogs carrying the <italic>mh</italic> deletion among racing grade classes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030079-t002">Table 2</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.00029, Fisher's exact test with degrees of freedom &#x0003d; 3). Since the 4 &#x000d7; 2 contingency table (i.e., combining columns two and three of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030079-t002">Table 2</xref>) has three degrees of freedom, it is possible to partition the analysis into three tests of one degree of freedom each in order to identify outlier grades. There are several methods by which this can be accomplished, although they are not independent of each other. For example, 12 of 41 dogs in the fastest two racing grades, A and B, carried the deletion, while just one dog of 43 from the slowest two racing grades, C and D, was a heterozygote (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.00073, Fisher's exact test), indicating a strong difference in frequency between (A, B) and (C, D). There is suggestive evidence for a difference between race grades A and B (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.086, Fisher's exact test) but no evidence for a difference between C and D (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.42, Fisher's exact test). A different approach for dividing the degrees of freedom is to compare A versus (B, C, D) (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.00027, Fisher's exact test), C versus (B, D) (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.099, Fisher's exact test), and C versus D (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.42, Fisher's exact test). Thus, each of these two methods for partitioning the test suggests that the presence of the <italic>mh</italic> mutation strongly influences racing ability.</p><p>There was also a marginally significant difference in the mutation genotype frequency in whippets that participated in racing versus conformation events such as breed club regional specialties, where dogs are judged based on their conformation to the physical breed standard (height at the withers or shoulder, head shape, coat color, etc.). Twenty of 119 confirmed racing whippets were heterozygous for the deletion while just two of 42 whippets that competed in conformation events were heterozygous (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.038, one-tailed Fisher's exact test).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Population Structure in the Whippet</title><p>To investigate how population substructure within whippets affects our candidate gene analysis, we genotyped 32 unlinked microsatellite markers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d; in 84 whippets with racing grades. Analysis of F<sub>ST</sub> revealed that whippets exhibit a low, but measurable, degree of population differentiation with higher levels of interbreeding within racing grades. As a result, genetic distance correlates with racing grade so that there is a moderate differentiation between A and B grades (F<sub>ST</sub> &#x0003d; 0.021), little differentiation between B and C (F<sub>ST</sub> &#x0003d; 0.0044) or C and D (F<sub>ST</sub> &#x0003d; 0.0067) racers, and the largest difference between the population of A and D racing dogs (F<sub>ST</sub> &#x0003d; 0.041). These levels of population differentiation are quite typical for mammalian species and are not surprising, given that whippets are bred to race and positive assortative mating is expected (i.e., fast dogs are bred to fast dogs).</p><p>Analysis of the data using Structure &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; and InStruct &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; gave comparable results under a range of cluster numbers from K &#x0003d; 1 to K &#x0003d; 15. Neither program found a clustering that clearly correlated with racing grade. The neighbor-joining tree of the 84 dogs used in this analysis based on genetic similarity (i.e., kinship coefficient) tends to differentiate dogs within the A racing grade from those in other grades, but not in a fully exclusive manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030079-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). It also demonstrates that dogs carrying the 2-bp deletion are found on all branches of the tree and are not one another's closest relatives, although they do tend to cluster near one another on the tree.</p><p>Logistic regression analysis of 73 alleles at moderate frequencies in the sample confirmed that population substructure may be a potentially confounding effect for association mapping within breeds of dog. In particular, we found that 26 of the alleles (36&#x00025;) across the 32 loci show a nominal <italic>p</italic>-value of 5&#x00025; or lower, a huge inflation above the expected 5&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030079-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A). As a result, many of the 32 loci showed association with racing grade using standard contingency table analysis. However, the association of the 2-bp deletion with racing grade is more significant than all but one of these, suggesting an empirical <italic>p</italic>-value of 1/72 &#x0003d; 0.014 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030079-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>MSTN Genotypes in Other Breeds and Haplotype Construction</title><p>We sequenced exon three of <italic>MSTN</italic> in a set of approximately four dogs each from heavily muscled breeds including the bullmastiff, rottweiler, bulldog, Presa Canario, miniature bull terrier, American Staffordshire terrier, and Staffordshire bull terrier.

A golden jackal was also sequenced to determine the ancestral allele for each dog SNP and insertion/deletion (indel). None of the dogs sequenced from any of the above breeds nor the golden jackal possessed the 2-bp deletion. We discovered 28 SNPs and three indels. For the three indels and eight SNPs that were discovered within 50 kb of the <italic>MSTN</italic> mutation, we inferred haplotypes independently for each breed using PHASE. A total of 13 haplotypes were identified, but only six were observed in more than one breed. Two of these haplotypes are shared across several breeds.

This is the result of a cascading pathway triggered by <italic>MSTN</italic> signaling that prevents myoblast cell progression from the G<sub>1</sub> to S phase of the cell cycle. <italic>MSTN</italic> therefore controls the total number of muscle fibers by regulating overall myoblast proliferation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

Muscular hypertrophy has also been described in the domestic cat &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;; however, a deficiency in dystrophin is the cause in this species rather than a mutation in <italic>MSTN</italic>. To date, six different mutations in the bovine <italic>MSTN</italic> gene have been reported to cause double muscling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. While all these mutations result in a loss of <italic>MSTN</italic> function, a subset of them and the one we describe here in the whippet likely change the three-dimensional shape of the protein by disrupting the &#x0201c;cysteine knot,&#x0201d; a structure important in the folding of all transforming growth factor &#x003b2; family member proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. The mutation in the whippet also removes nearly 20&#x00025; of the protein.</p><p>We sequenced genomic DNA not only from whippets but also from multiple dogs from each of 14 additional breeds in order to determine the haplotype background on which this mutation arose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030079-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In each dog, 15 PCR amplicons that spanned the <italic>MSTN</italic> gene and amplicons spanning known dog SNPs within 50 kb of the <italic>MSTN</italic> mutation were sequenced. Using the resulting data we observed two haplotypes, termed two and seven, that occurred in a large number of breeds and that were identical except at position 3,676,629, which is located outside the gene, 15,801 bp downstream from the 2-bp deletion. The <italic>mh</italic> mutation occurs only on haplotype six, which is identical to haplotype seven except for the deletion itself. Not surprisingly, the golden jackal sequence has only the wild-type allele at the position of the mutation, indicating the <italic>mh</italic> allele represents the derived state. We conclude therefore that haplotype six likely derives from haplotype seven (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030079-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Haplotype seven is the most common and widely dispersed haplotype spanning the gene and was found in 12 out of 15 breeds sequenced. Interestingly, we did not observe haplotype seven in the Afghan hound, Basenji, or boxer.</p><p>Our data do not exclude the possibility that the mutation occurs in breeds other than the whippet. However, we screened for the 2-bp deletion in several mastiff type breeds (rottweiler, bulldog, Presa Canario, miniature bull terrier, American Staffordshire terrier, Staffordshire bull terrier, and bullmastiff) and did not find it. These data argue that the changes in musculature exhibited by the whippet are unique and caused by the effects on <italic>MSTN</italic> associated with the deletion described in this study.</p><p>An excess of the <italic>mh/&#x0002b;</italic> genotype was observed among the fastest racers, as defined by the highest racing grade achieved during a dog's career. This demonstrates that the heterozygote state carries a performance-enhancing polymorphism that provides a competitive edge. The optimal study of racing performance would use the racing points acquired by each whippet during their career as a quantitative measure of performance. However a dog's total career points are a function of the number of races run throughout their career and, as such, whippets of different ages are not easily compared. To compensate, the total number of points accrued over a lifetime of racing could be averaged over the number of races entered. However, as dogs age their performance declines. Some owners stop racing their dogs after their performance declines while others continue to race their dogs for months or even years longer. Using the average number of points accrued during a specific year of the dog's life, for instance age two or three, presents similar problems. Dogs reach their racing prime at different ages and the number of points will always reflect the number of races entered. While an average is satisfactory if many races are run in a given year, the average will be inaccurate if few races are run.</p><p>While cattle breeders have long selected for individuals that are homozygous for mutations in <italic>MSTN</italic> because of their increased musculature, which is optimal for beef production, this is the first example of breeders unknowingly selecting for individuals with a single polymorphism that increases athletic performance. Of interest, the trait appears to confer an undesirable appearance upon dogs competing in conformation. Only two <italic>mh/</italic>&#x0002b; dogs were found among the dogs reported to compete in conformation events, and those dogs were reported to show poorly. This is consistent with the association seen between a dog's genotype and their relative muscle mass as defined by either a ratio of mass (kg) to height at the withers (cm) (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 7.43 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>; Kruskal-Wallis test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030079-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) or the direct measure of an individual's neck girth (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 3.47 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>; Kruskal-Wallis test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030079-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) or chest girth (<italic>p &#x0003d;</italic> 0.001462; Kruskal-Wallis test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030079-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). We acknowledge that there are more accurate methods to measure muscle mass. However, many of these methods are either invasive, such as a muscle biopsy, or would need to be conducted post-mortem, neither of which was an option. These measurements were not designed to specifically eliminate contributions from body fat. However, obesity is rare in the whippet; indeed, the breed is characterized by an overall low body fat content. Thus, these measurements are the best achievable metrics of the phenotype.</p><p>Greyhounds and whippets share a common ancestral gene pool and as a result the breeds are difficult to separate in genetic clustering analyses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. This, together with the fact that both were bred to excel at racing, suggested that the mutation might also be found in racing greyhounds. However, none of the greyhounds tested carried the mutation. There are three possible explanations for this result. First, an insufficient number of samples have been tested if the mutant allele is relatively rare in the greyhound population. Second, the mutation may only be present in a subset of greyhound lines, none of which were among those tested. Finally, the mutation may not be carried in the greyhound population at all, indicating that it is a relatively new mutation in the purebred dog population. This may be because the mutation offers no advantage to greyhound racers. Indeed, it may even be disadvantageous. Studies of muscle composition in <italic>Mstn</italic> knockout mice demonstrate a higher proportion of both fast type II and glycolytic fibers, versus slow type I and oxidative fibers when compared to wild-type mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. While this change in muscle composition may offer an advantage to whippets, which typically race a short sprint of 200&#x02013;300 m, it may be disadvantageous to greyhounds, whose races extend to 900 m and where endurance is more important. In addition, Belgian Blue cattle that are homozygous for a <italic>MSTN</italic> mutation display a decrease in the size of several organs, including the lungs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. If heterozygous dogs have even a slightly reduced lung capacity, it is possible that a <italic>MSTN</italic> mutation would actually be disadvantageous for racing longer distances as greyhounds do. Finally, it remains to be determined whether additional health problems are associated with being a carrier of this mutation.</p><p>We examined the microsatellite data set for evidence of population substructure and found that there is not random gene flow across the racing classes. All groups display positive F<sub>ST</sub> values with the greatest found between the grade A racers and all others. This is not unexpected. The very presence of the &#x0201c;bully&#x0201d; phenotype is evidence that breeders choose to mate dogs with increased musculature to one another. Reducing the mating population of a breed to a small proportion of the whole population has consequences, particularly for genetic mapping of complex traits. This is evidenced by our analysis of the same marker set for association with racing grade. While we find low <italic>p</italic>-values at many of the alleles, only one of 73 had a <italic>p</italic>-value smaller than the 2-bp deletion, confirming that the association between racing grade and the <italic>MSTN</italic> mutation is not simply a spurious result of population structure. Overall, these results suggest that the population structure within breeds is likely to have an important confounding effect on association mapping in the domestic dog.</p><p>Our findings have implications for competitive and professional sports. Here, we show that a disruption in the function of the <italic>MSTN</italic> gene increases an individual's overall athletic performance in a robust and measurable way. To date, the muscular hypertrophy phenotype has been described in a single human child &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. This child possessed two copies of a G-to-A transition in the noncoding region of the human <italic>MSTN</italic> gene. This mutation results in the mis-splicing of precursor mRNA, which most likely truncates the myostatin protein. The child's mother, a former professional athlete, was heterozygous for this mutation and also appeared muscular, although not to the same degree as her child. Perhaps additional mutations in <italic>MSTN</italic> have yet to be discovered in other species that competitively race, such as the horse or humans. As discussed by others &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030079-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, human athletes could undergo so-called gene doping via disruption of <italic>MSTN</italic>. The potential to increase an athlete's performance by disrupting <italic>MSTN</italic> either by natural or perhaps artificial means could change the face of competitive human and canine athletics. Given the poorly understood consequences for overall health and well-being, caution should be exercised when acting upon these results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Sample collection.</title><p>An initial set of 22 whole-blood samples were collected from whippets that participated in racing, conformation, or were simply privately owned pets.

The standard track length of a straight race is 182.88 m, while the standard oval track is 350 m. A race meet is composed of four heats. Based on their placement in all four heats, dogs are given a total meet score. A dog's racing grade is a simplified assessment of its performance over the last three meets. As a result, a dog's racing grade will vary throughout its career as grade is reassessed following each meet. We used the WRA racing grades: Grade A is 15.0&#x02013;29.0 points, grade B is 10.0&#x02013;14.9 points, grade C is 4.0&#x02013;9.9 points, and grade D is 0&#x02013;3.9 points (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.whippetracing.org/Rules/2006/2006Chapter5.htm">http://www.whippetracing.org/Rules/2006/2006Chapter5.htm</ext-link>).
