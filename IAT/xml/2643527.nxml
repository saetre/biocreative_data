In neurons, stress-induced and constitutively expressed molecular chaperones protect against damage induced by ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases, however the molecular basis of this protection is not known. Here we have investigated the crosstalk between stress-induced chaperones and cysteine string protein (CSP&#x003b1;). CSP&#x003b1; is a constitutively expressed synaptic vesicle protein bearing a J domain and a cysteine rich &#x0201c;string&#x0201d; region that has been implicated in the long term functional integrity of synaptic transmission and the defense against neurodegeneration. We have shown previously that the CSP&#x003b1; chaperone complex increases isoproterenol-mediated signaling by stimulating GDP/GTP exchange of G&#x003b1;<sub>s</sub>. In this report we demonstrate that in response to heat shock or treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, the J protein Hsp40 becomes a major component of the CSP&#x003b1; complex. Association of Hsp40 with CSP&#x003b1; decreases CSP&#x003b1;-CSP&#x003b1; dimerization and enhances the CSP&#x003b1;-induced increase in steady state GTP hydrolysis of G&#x003b1;<sub>s</sub>. This newly identified CSP&#x003b1;-Hsp40 association reveals a previously undescribed coupling of J proteins. In view of the crucial importance of stress-induced chaperones in the protection against cell death, our data attribute a role for Hsp40 crosstalk with CSP&#x003b1; in neuroprotection.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In response to a range of stressful stimuli including hyperthermia and ischemia, an ancient evolutionarily conserved cellular program called the heat shock response is activated and the expression of several chaperones is induced to enhance cell survival to subsequent insults. The heat shock response also involves the translocation of several chaperones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004595-Bechtold1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004595-Chen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the mechanistic basis of chaperone cytoprotection is not yet understood, the chaperone anti-apoptotic activity is thought to be due to the ability of chaperones to rid the cell of misfolded proteins. In addition to the stress-induced chaperones, many molecular chaperones are expressed constitutively and are widely held to have basic and indispensable functions in maintaining protein conformation. Constitutive and stress-induced chaperones maintain an important balance in the cell between protein refolding and protein elimination, however, while transient up-regulation of molecular chaperones is critical for cell survival, chronic up-regulation of chaperones (eg Hsp70) correlates with poor prognosis in some types of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004595-Morano1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Neurons are thought to be especially vulnerable to the risk of protein misfolding due to the conformational flexibility required of the cellular machinery underlying synaptic transmission. Furthermore, post-mitotic cells, such as neurons, cannot dilute aggregated proteins through cell division, leading to the potential accumulation of misfolded proteins. Huntington's, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Prion diseases are caused by defects in protein folding, underlining the biological importance of the problem of aberrant protein folding in neurons. In experimental models, molecular chaperones, either constitutive or stress-induced, are inhibitors of neurodegeneration (reviewed: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004595-Muchowski1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004595-Brown1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>). Pharmacological modulators that directly regulate chaperone and stress-induced chaperone activity have been identified, emphasizing the potential of the heat shock response as a pharmaceutical target (Reviewed: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004595-Brodsky1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>Cysteine string protein (CSP&#x003b1;) is a synaptic vesicle protein bearing a signature J domain and a cysteine rich string region that is implicated in the defense against neurodegeneration. The cytosolic proteins Hsc70 (heat shock cognate protein of 70 kDa), SGT (small glutamine rich tetratricopeptide repeat domain protein) and HIP (Hsc70 interacting protein) form a complex with CSP&#x003b1; which is tethered to the synaptic vesicle. Assembly of the chaperone components is thought to allow for localized activation of Hsc70, a cytosolic ATPase that couples energy from ATP hydrolysis to conformational work on target proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004595-Braun1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004595-Natochin1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Why a specialized synaptic vesicle chaperone system evolved remains a mystery.</p><p>The existence of the heat shock response raises several questions. How do stress-induced chaperones protect synaptic transmission and prevent neurodegeneration? Is there crosstalk between stress-induced chaperones and constituitively expressed chaperones or do these chaperone machines have separate non-overlapping cellular tasks? As a first step toward testing the hypothesis that stress-induced chaperones are coupled to the CSP&#x003b1; chaperone system, we evaluated the components of the CSP&#x003b1; complex during transient expression of stress chaperones. CSP&#x003b1; expression levels do not increase in response to heat shock or geldanamycin treatment in neural cell lines. The previously reported 70 kDa CSP&#x003b1; dimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004595-Braun2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004595-Bai1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> was reduced following heat shock. Suprisingly our findings demonstrate that the stress-induced J protein Hsp40 becomes a major component of the CSP&#x003b1; multimeric complex after heat shock. Following heat shock, Hsp40 expression is increased and Hsp40 localizes to the plasma membrane. Geldanamycin, like heat shock, triggers the assembly of Hsp40 with the CSP&#x003b1; multimeric complex. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the stimulatory effect of CSP&#x003b1; on the steady-state hydrolysis of GTP by G&#x003b1;<sub>s</sub> is enhanced in the presence of Hsp40. Furthermore, transient transfection of CSP&#x003b1; or induction of the heat shock response increased isoproterenol-stimulated phosphorylation of synapsin.</p><p>Our results suggest that the transient assembly of Hsp40 with the CSP&#x003b1; complex is important in the maintenance of synaptic function in the face of environmental stress, and emphasize the complexity and functional elegance of the J protein chaperone machines.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CSP&#x003b1; expression is not altered in response to heat shock</title><p>To begin to test the role of CSP&#x003b1; in the heat shock response, the expression of CSP&#x003b1; and Hsp70 was examined in CAD mouse neuroblastoma cells before and after 40 min of conditioning heat shock at 42&#x000b0;C.

CSP&#x003b1; is constitutively expressed on synaptic vesicles and is thought to tether Hsc70 for conformational work at the synaptic vesicle site. Hsp40 is a cytosolic J protein that is rapidly and transiently induced in response to stress, including, but not exclusive to, heat shock and geldanamycin treatment. Stress-induced expression of several chaperones, including Hsp40, is widely thought to protect cells from the deleterious effects of subsequent stress. Interference with the heat shock response would be expected to have enormous cellular consequences and reduce cell survival. It is fully anticipated that transient expression of stress-induced chaperones <italic>in vivo</italic> occurs routinely in neurons to cope with the stresses rendered by various insults.

In this study, we provide evidence that Hsp40 specifically and directly associates with the constitutive CSP&#x003b1; synaptic vesicle chaperone complex following either a conditioning heat shock or geldanamycin treatment. Following heat shock, Hsp40 expression is increased and both CSP&#x003b1; and Hsp40 undergo redistribution. The association of Hsp40 with CSP&#x003b1; correlates with reduced CSP&#x003b1; dimerization, translocation of Hsp40 to the plasma membrane and enhanced CSP&#x003b1;-mediated augmentation of steady state GTP hydrolysis. Association with CSP&#x003b1; is mediated via C terminal binding sites of Hsp40 and does not involve the J domain. Since neurotransmitter release relies on complex interactions between multiple cellular components, we speculate that the cross-talk between CSP&#x003b1; chaperone machinery and the stress-induced Hsp40 is important in maintaining functionally competent synapses.</p><p>Whether stress-induced chaperones typically perform independent cellular tasks or are coupled to constitutive chaperone machines, such as CSP&#x003b1;, is a current biological question.

Understanding the composition of the CSP&#x003b1; chaperone complex, either basal or following a conditioning stress, is crucial to understanding the physiological role(s) of CSP&#x003b1;. Data presented here show that <italic>in vitro</italic>, Hsp40 increased the CSP&#x003b1;-induced increase in steady state GTP hydrolysis of G&#x003b1;<sub>s</sub>. Furthermore, in CAD cells, induction of the heat shock response decreased CSP&#x003b1; dimerization and increased isoproterenol-stimulated phosphorylation of synapsin. In view of the crucial importance of stress-induced chaperones in protection against cell death, our data attribute a key role to the association of Hsp40 with the CSP&#x003b1; chaperone complex in neuroprotection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents and Chemicals</title><p>Anti-CSP&#x003b1; polyclonal was prepared as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004595-Braun2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.
