Centromeres consist of repeated sequences, which have hindered the study of centromere mitotic recombination and its consequences for centromeric function. We use a chromosome orientation fluorescence in situ hybridization technique to visualize and quantify recombination events at mouse centromeres. We show that centromere mitotic recombination occurs in normal cells to a higher frequency than telomere recombination and to a much higher frequency than chromosome-arm recombination. Furthermore, we show that centromere mitotic recombination is increased in cells lacking the Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b DNA methyltransferases, suggesting that the epigenetic state of centromeric heterochromatin controls recombination events at these regions. Increased centromere recombination in <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>,<italic>3b</italic>-deficient cells is accompanied by changes in the length of centromere repeats, suggesting that prevention of illicit centromere recombination is important to maintain centromere integrity in the mouse.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: CENP-B, centromere protein B; CO-FISH, chromosome orientation FISH; C-SCE, centromere sister chromatid exchange; ES, embryonic stem; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PNA, peptide nucleic acid; Q-FISH, quantitative FISH.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Centromeres are essential for the correct segregation and inheritance of genetic information by ensuring that each daughter cell receives a copy of each chromosome during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pidoux and Allshire, 2000</xref>). Mammalian centromeres are composed of long arrays of tandemly repeated DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sunkel and Coelho, 1995</xref>). The mouse genome contains at least two types of repetitive elements at centromeres, the major satellite repeats (6 Mb of 234-bp repeats) and the minor satellite repeats (&#x0223c;600 kb of 120-bp repeats, varying from 500 kb to 1.2 Mb depending on the chromosome; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kipling et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guenatri et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuznetsova et al., 2005</xref>). The major satellite repeats are located pericentrically, whereas the minor satellite repeats coincide with the centric constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wong and Rattner, 1988</xref>). The centromere protein B (CENP-B) is found at minor satellite DNA and alphoid DNA in mouse and human cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horz and Altenburger, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Earnshaw et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kipling and Warburton, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In addition, centromeres contain epigenetic marks characteristic of compacted heterochromatin domains, including histone lysine trimethylation and DNA hypermethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lehnertz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maison and Almouzni, 2004</xref>). Maintenance of centromeric heterochromatin has been proposed to be important for centromere function. In particular, loss of DNA methylation at pericentromeric regions caused by abrogation of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes Dnmt1 or Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Okano et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2004</xref>) results in defective centromere function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dodge et al., 2005</xref>), although the mechanisms responsible for this are still largely unknown.</p><p>Similar to centromeres, telomeres (or the terminal ends of chromosomes) are also repeated elements, which in all vertebrates consist of tandem repeats of the TTAGGG sequence and associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackburn, 2001</xref>). Telomeres have an essential role in chromosome end protection and chromosomal stability. A proper length of telomeric repeats is maintained by the enzyme telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackburn, 2001</xref>), as well as by the recombination-based alternative lengthening of telomeres or ALT mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Muntoni and Reddel, 2005</xref>). Similarly to centric and pericentric chromatin, telomeres, as well as the adjacent subtelomeric regions, are enriched in epigenetic marks characteristic of constitutive heterochromatin, including histone trimethylation marks and subtelomeric DNA hypermethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brock et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blasco, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, these marks act as independent negative regulators of telomere length and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blasco, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benetti et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, in the absence of Dnmts, telomeres become dramatically elongated concomitant with increased telomere recombination and in the absence of loss of histone trimethylation marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalo et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Although mitotic centromere recombination has been previously described in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liebman et al., 1988</xref>), very little is known on the regulation of mammalian centromeric mitotic recombination and how this may impact on centromeric function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Warburton and Willard, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Warburton et al., 1993</xref>). In this paper, we have established a technique based on chromosome orientation FISH (CO-FISH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 1996</xref>), which allows measuring recombination frequencies specifically at centromeric repeats (cen-CO-FISH). Using this technique, we found that centromeric repeats are highly recombinogenic compared with the rest of the genome. In addition, we describe a role for DNA methylation in preventing centromeric mitotic recombination, as well as in controlling the length of centromeric repeats. Together, these results highlight a role for the epigenetic status of centromeric heterochromatin, and in particular of DNA methylation, in regulating centromere recombination and centromere length in mouse chromosome, which, if disrupted, may conceivably contribute to genomic instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>A FISH-based technique to measure centromere recombination</title><p>To study recombination events specifically at the centromeric regions, we have adapted the previously described two-color CO-FISH to centromeric repeats (cen-CO-FISH; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; Materials and methods). In particular, cells that have undergone a single round of DNA replication in the presence of BrdU are used to prepare chromosome spreads. After HOECHST staining, the bromo-substituted strand is removed by nicking DNA with UV light, followed by digestion with exonuclease III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 1996</xref>). Metaphases are then hybridized with strand-specific peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes against centromeric repeats. In particular, mouse minor satellite is composed of DNA repeats of a 120-bp sequence, which contains the binding site for the CENP-B protein, the so-called CENP-B box (bp 62&#x02013;78; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wong and Rattner, 1988</xref>). To perform cen-CO-FISH, single-stranded PNA probes were designed to hybridize with the lagging and leading strands of the mouse CENP-B box sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, a and b</xref>; Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1999</xref>). In the absence of recombination events at minor satellite repeats, only one chromatid per chromosome will show a signal after hybridization with either the lagging or the leading probes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, b and c</xref>). In contrast, if recombination occurs within minor satellite sequences, labeling will split between the sister chromatids, giving rise to two signals of unequal intensity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, b and c</xref>). We refer to these events as centromere sister chromatid exchange (C-SCE) events. A C-SCE event is considered positive only when the exchange is simultaneously detected with the leading and lagging centromeric probes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref>). As controls for the C-SCE CO-FISH technique, we determined that the frequency of C-SCE events is similar for different slides of the same genotype processed in parallel, suggesting a similar efficiency of ExoIII digestions (Fig. S1 a, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803042/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803042/DC1</ext-link>). Furthermore, the fact that a significant percentage of metaphases (&#x0003e;10%) did not show any C-SCE event indicates that C-SCE events are true recombination events and not consequences of the possible existence of inverted repeats at some chromosome centromeric regions (Fig. S1 b).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>CO-FISH to measure recombination rates at minor satellite sequences.</bold> (a) A scheme of mouse minor satellite repeats and telomere repeats is shown indicating the position of the CENP-B box (bp 62&#x02013;78). PNA probes are also indicated. (b) A diagram explaining the CO-FISH procedure is shown. Cells are allowed to replicate once in the presence of BrdU, giving rise to chromosomes with one BrdU-containing chromatid (dashed line). The BrdU-containing DNA strand is digested and single-stranded minor satellite probes against the lagging (red) or the leading (green) strand are hybridized to the remaining non&#x02013;BrdU-labeled strand. Cen-CO-FISH labels centromeric minor satellite sequences from the lagging or leading strand. An SCE within minor satellite sequences (C-SCE) will lead to two unequal signals per chromosome after hybridization with either the leading or lagging single-stranded probes.

Next, we normalized C-SCE, T-SCE, and SCE values by the approximate length of their respective DNA in kilobases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables I&#x02013;III</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3"/>; Materials and methods) and represented C-SCE and T-SCE frequencies relative to SCE frequencies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 a</xref>; Materials and methods). Notably, the frequency of C-SCE events was sixfold higher than that of T-SCE events in wild-type ES cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 a</xref>). The differences in mitotic recombination at these two highly repeated regions may be the result of their different DNA sequence and/or their distinct chromatin organization. In this regard, telomeres are bound by the so-called shelterin complex, which safeguards telomeres from DNA repair activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Lange, 2005</xref>). In contrast, centromeres are not bound by shelterin and have been described to have a more efficient DNA repair than the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rief and L&#x000f6;brich, 2002</xref>). Interestingly, when calculating the C-SCE/SCE and T-SCE/SCE ratios, centromeres and telomeres appeared to be dramatically more recombinogenic (&#x0223c;175-fold and 27-fold, respectively) than the rest of the genome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 a</xref>). Although we cannot rule out that the different nature of the CO-FISH (T-SCE and C-SCE) and fluorescence-plus-giemsa (SCE) techniques could be underestimating the frequency of global SCE events, our results are in agreement with a recent study showing a 20-fold increase in T-SCE events compared with global SCE events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2004</xref>). These findings suggest that repeated regions are hot spots of recombination compared with the rest of the genome and that mechanisms must exist that prevent illicit DNA recombination at these regions to preserve their integrity.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Recombination events per chromosome at the indicated chromosomal regions in wild-type and <italic>Dnmt</italic>-deficient ES cells.</bold> (a) Error bars correspond to two independent experiments (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 2).

In this paper, we set to determine whether decreased DNA methylation in <italic>Dnmt</italic>-deficient cells results in increased recombination rates at mouse minor satellite repeats as determined by cen-CO-FISH (Materials and methods). Interestingly, <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>,<italic>3b</italic>-deficient ES cells presented significantly increased frequencies of C-SCE per chromosome compared with wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, a and b</xref>, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, P &#x0003c; 0.0001; and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>, C-SCE frequencies corrected by global SCE frequencies), whereas cells deficient for <italic>Dnmt1</italic> showed a similar C-SCE frequency to wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, P &#x0003d; 0.2288, not significant; and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>, C-SCE/SCE ratios). These results demonstrate that abrogation of the Dnmt3a,3b enzymes, which are responsible for de novo DNA methylation, leads to increased recombination at centromeric repeats in mammalian cells. As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalo et al., 2006</xref>), telomere recombination (T-SCE) was also increased in <italic>Dnmt</italic>-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 c</xref>, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, P &#x0003c; 0.0001 for all comparisons; and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>, T-SCE/SCE ratios). However, although <italic>Dnmt1</italic> deficiency significantly increased recombination at telomeric repeats, this was not the case at minor satellite repeats, indicating slightly different requirements for Dnmt1 activity at these two repeated regions.</p><p>Next, we addressed whether increased recombination at pericentric and telomeric repeats in <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>,<italic>3b</italic>-deficient cells was specific to these repeated regions or, instead, was accompanied by a global increase in SCEs throughout the genome. To this end, we analyzed the frequency of global SCE in ES cells deficient for either <italic>Dnmt1</italic> or <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>,<italic>3b</italic> compared with wild-type controls. Interestingly, no significant differences in global SCE frequencies were found between genotypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, d and e</xref>). Finally, we did not detect significant differences in C-CSE frequencies when comparing pluripotent mouse ES cells to differentiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, f and g</xref>), suggesting that centromere recombination is not significantly decreased when associated with differentiation. Collectively, these results support the notion that DNA methylation has an important role in preventing mitotic recombination specifically at highly repetitive regions but does not have a major impact on global genomic recombination.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA methylation of centromeric repeats influences centromere length</title><p>Increased recombination frequencies at telomeric sequences are associated with activation of telomerase-independent alternative pathways for telomere maintenance or alternative lengthening of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bechter et al., 2004</xref>). In particular, in the absence of either Dnmt1 or Dnmt3a,3b activity, there is a dramatic telomere elongation concomitant with increased telomere recombination frequencies in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalo et al., 2006</xref>). To evaluate whether increased recombination at <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>,<italic>3b</italic>-deficient centromeres was also associated with changes in the length of centromeric repeats, we performed centromere quantitative FISH (Q-FISH) on metaphase spreads from wild-type and <italic>Dnmt</italic>-deficient ES cells using a minor satellite-specific PNA probe (Materials and methods). Interestingly, mouse ES cells deficient for either Dnmt1 or Dnmt3a,3b, showed decreased minor satellite fluorescence compared with wild-type controls. These differences were highly significant for both <italic>Dnmt1-</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>,<italic>3b</italic>-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, P &#x0003c; 0.001 for every comparison). Furthermore, the decrease in minor satellite fluorescence was accompanied by higher frequencies of centromeres showing very low minor satellite fluorescence (&#x0003c;500 arbitrary units of fluorescence; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), which is in agreement with shorter centromeres in <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>,<italic>3b</italic>-deficient cells. The fluctuations of centromere fluorescence with increasing passages of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>,<italic>3b</italic>-deficient may be an additional indication of centromeric instability associated with DNA hypomethylation and increased recombination (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Interestingly, abnormal size of centromeric fragments as detected by Southern blotting after digestion with MspI was previously reported by us with increasing passages of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>,<italic>3b</italic>-deficient cells (see Fig. S2 a in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalo et al., 2006</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that repression of centromeric recombination by DNA methylation is an important mechanism for maintaining centromere integrity. In particular, increased mitotic recombination at centromeric sequences as the result of loss of DNA methylation may lead to altered length of centromere repeats, which in turn may affect the binding of important centromeric proteins, such as CENP-B, resulting in genomic instability. In this regard, although CENP-B is not essential for mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hudson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Perez-Castro et al., 1998</xref>), it has been recently described to be necessary for de novo centromere formation by recruiting other CENPs as well as epigenetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Okada et al., 2007</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Quantification of minor satellite length in wild-type and <italic>Dnmt</italic>-deficient ES cells.</bold> Minor satellite fluorescence distribution in arbitrary units of fluorescence (a.u.f) of wild-type (wt), <italic>Dnmt1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, and <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>,<italic>3b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> ES cells at the indicated passage number as determined by Q-FISH using a mouse minor satellite PNA probe (left).

Our results suggest that centromeres are highly recombinogenic compared with chromosome arms as well as with telomeric repeats. In addition, we demonstrate that loss of DNA methylation leads to increased centromere recombination, suggesting that the epigenetic status of centromeric heterochromatin is important to maintain centromere integrity. Importantly, defective DNA methylation did not affect global recombination frequencies, suggesting a specific role of this epigenetic mark repressing illicit recombination at repeated elements but not elsewhere in the genome. We further show that loss of DNA methylation leads to abnormal centromere length, which conceivably could alter the binding of centromeric proteins leading to abnormal centromeric function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Okada et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the CENP-B box contains CpG residues, which are potential targets of the Dnmt enzymes and whose methylation status has been previously reported to affect the binding of the CENP-B protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mitchell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study shows that PTEN-dependent expression of the centromeric protein CENP-C can lead to centromere breaks and genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shen et al., 2007</xref>). Collectively, these findings support a model where the loss of DNA methylation at centromeric repeats may favor illicit DNA recombination, which in turn could favor genomic instability.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Wild-type J1 and <italic>Dnmt1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mutant ES cells or <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>,<italic>3b<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> double mutant ES cells were generated and maintained as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalo et al., 2006</xref>).
