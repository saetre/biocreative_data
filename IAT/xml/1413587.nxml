For several decades, the mechanism has been assumed to be a sequence of three essential steps: formation of a complex between RNA polymerase and a promoter with a locally melted DNA duplex (open complex), synthesis of oligo-RNA (initiation of the chemical reaction), and escape of the RNA polymerase from the promoter associated with the progress of RNA elongation (promoter clearance). However, all prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases so far isolated have been known to perform &#x02018;abortive initiation&#x02019;, which is an iterative synthesis and release of oligo-RNA molecules <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Johnston and McClure, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Carpousis and Gralla, 1980</xref>). As a minimal model based on these pioneering works, abortive transcripts were assumed to be unsuccessful precursor of the full-length transcripts, and thus abortive synthesis has been supposed to be a step of the promoter clearance in a sequential model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Munson and Reznikoff, 1981</xref>).</p><p>This sequential model was first tested in a kinetic study using the <italic>lac</italic>UV5 and a modified &#x003bb;<italic>P</italic><sub>R</sub> (&#x003bb;<italic>P</italic><sub>R</sub>AL) promoter, by comparing the times at which the full-length and abortive syntheses complete under single-round conditions. Surprisingly, abortive synthesis continues long after the full-length synthesis has completed, contradicting the idea that abortive transcripts would be an unsuccessful precursor. The long-lived transcription complex was named a moribund complex, being thus defined as a complex that produces only abortive and no full-length transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kubori and Shimamoto, 1996</xref>). The following characteristics are known for this type of complex. (i) The moribund complex is formed from the same homogeneous fraction of enzyme as the productive complex that synthesizes full-length transcript at &#x003bb;<italic>P</italic><sub>R</sub>AL promoter, and dissociation of the enzyme from the promoter DNA cancels any difference between these complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kubori and Shimamoto, 1996</xref>). (ii) The moribund complexes are structurally different from the productive: they slightly backtracked at the &#x003bb;<italic>P</italic><sub>R</sub>AL promoter or forward-tracked at the T7A1 promoter and have more exposed conserved region 3 of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Sen <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Susa <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). (iii) At several promoters, the moribund complex is further converted into a dead-end complex that still retains short transcript but has no elongation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kubori and Shimamoto, 1996</xref>). Such complexes at &#x003bb;<italic>P</italic><sub>R</sub>AL promoter are irreversibly arrested at the promoter in the form of holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Sen <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). (iv) Initiation at the T7A1 promoter, which have long been shown no kinetic evidence for moribund complex, was found to accumulate moribund complex at a low-salt condition, thereby the initiation mechanism may be generally branching into the productive and non-productive pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Susa <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), and the non-productive pathway can lead to a dead-end as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>. Therefore, the fates of the moribund complex are either inactivation as a dead-end complex, or reactivation by conversion into productive complex, and these conversions occur at different rates depending on the promoter, yielding variations in characteristics of promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kubori and Shimamoto, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Sen <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Susa <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). (v) There are protein factors and mutant &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> that introduce reversibility between the non-productive and productive pathways in a manner that depends on the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Sen <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Tagami and Aiba, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Susa <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). This reversibility is the reason why there is little accumulation of the moribund complex at the T7A1 promoter in standard ionic conditions, converting the moribund complex into productive one rapidly consumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Shimamoto <italic>et al</italic>., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kubori and Shimamoto, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Susa <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). These results indicate the generality of the branched mechanism and explain that the seeming sequential pathway is due to reversibility between the branched pathways. This mechanism provides a concrete example of the molecular memory in the form of conformation of transcription complex on how it has been initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Qi <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bergh&#x000f6;fer-Hochheimer <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Branched initiation pathway and action of Gre factors at branches. The initiation pathway is composed of two branches; one leads to a productive elongation complex and the other to a moribund complex then to a dead-end complex. RNA polymerase holoenzyme and DNA carrying a promoter are, respectively, displayed as grey ovals and double lines. &#x02018;NTPs&#x02019; indicates ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP, and are shown as small dots and transcripts are indicated as dotted lines. Moribund complex is a major source of abortive transcripts, but the absence of abortive synthesis in the other steps has not been established. At the promoters such as &#x003bb;<italic>P</italic><sub>R</sub>AL and <italic>lac</italic>UV5, irreversible branching occurs (thin arrows), and a moribund complex once formed is subsequently converted into a dead-end complex. In the presence of Gre factors, the branching becomes reversible (thick arrows) so that moribund and productive complexes can exchange with each other. In this case, the branched pathway becomes kinetically equivalent to the conventional sequential pathway if the formation of a dead-end complex is negligible. This situation also occurs in initiation at the promoter with intrinsic reversibility such as T7A1. The big black dot is the earliest branching point and could be a binary intermediate or free state depending on a promoter.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi_5058_f1"/></fig><p>All this evidence has been obtained <italic>in vitro</italic>, and thus the most important question should be whether or not the same mechanism works in cells and contributes to the regulation of transcription. The clue to the question is the Gre factors, GreA and GreB. These factors increase reversibility between the branched pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), and consequently increase the productive initiation by enhancing conversion of the otherwise moribund complex into the productive one, in the presence of a physiological concentration of initiating nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) at the &#x003bb;<italic>P</italic><sub>R</sub>AL promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Sen <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). The Gre factors, GreA and GreB, originally isolated as factors inducing cleavage of the nascent transcript in arrested complexes in elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Borukhov <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">1993</xref>), are shown to stimulate productive initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Feng <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hsu <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>). If the branched mechanism works as a regulatory mechanism <italic>in vivo</italic>, a decrease of the amount of the Gre factors should result in the reduction of productive transcription from some promoters. To test this hypothesis, we first constructed a double disruptant, &#x00394;<italic>greA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>greB</italic>, of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and then compared the levels of mRNAs with those in the parental strain. Among approximately 200 genes less transcribed in the mutant, we arbitrarily selected 11 genes. Three genes among them, <italic>atpC</italic> (<italic>uncC</italic>), <italic>cspA</italic> and <italic>rpsA</italic>, passed a test by Northern blotting and then their transcription initiation displayed a branched pathway in a reconstituted transcription system composed of purified components. Furthermore, we confirmed that the level of GreA in the parental strain varied in different culture conditions, suggesting the role of a Gre factor as the regulator. These results provide evidence that the branched mechanism exists <italic>in vivo</italic> and can be exploited in the regulation of transcription initiation from some promoters.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Phenotypes of <italic>&#x00394;greA&#x00394;greB</italic> strain</title><p>We first constructed an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, TK1021, lacking <italic>greA</italic> and <italic>greB</italic>.

In the primary screening using a DNA array, we could not find distinct reduction in the amounts of the cDNAs prepared from the disruptant and its parental strain. Therefore, we gave up to deduce any conclusion from the analysis, and limited its use for selecting rough candidates. Instead of quantification of the arrays by scanning individual signals, we analysed the array by subtracting a density image from another (data not shown). Among the approximately 200 genes hinted by this rough method, we selected 11 candidates showing relatively large differences for examination by Northern analysis (see <italic>Experimental procedures</italic> for selection criteria). We excluded the y-genes from the candidates because their functions have not been estimated in the literature of the lack of further suggestion on cross-talk with other regulatory circuits. Among the candidates, the levels of transcripts were lower in seven cases (<italic>atpC</italic>, <italic>cspA</italic>, <italic>rpsA</italic>, <italic>cspE</italic>, <italic>lpp</italic>, <italic>infC</italic> and <italic>ptsH</italic>). As expected from the roughness of the array analysis, three others (<italic>nagE</italic>, <italic>hlpA</italic> and <italic>pstB</italic>) actually showed increased levels, and one (<italic>hycF</italic>) unchanged in the &#x00394;<italic>greA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>greB</italic> strain (data not shown). Among the seven downshifted genes, the <italic>atpC</italic>, <italic>cspA</italic> and <italic>rpsA</italic> transcripts showed the largest changes: decreased by 60&#x02013;80%, while the control <italic>murE</italic> transcript remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Transcription of these three genes is known to be dependent on &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Porter <italic>et al</italic>., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Pedersen <italic>et al</italic>., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Tanabe <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>), as well as the control <italic>murE</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Michaud <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>). The lower but significant levels of these genes in the disruptant, as well as the fact that <italic>greA</italic> and <italic>greB</italic> are not essential for growth in a standard condition, indicate that <italic>greA</italic> and <italic>greB</italic> are involved in fine-tuning their expression rather than shutting off and turning on.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Effect of disruption of <italic>greA</italic> and <italic>greB</italic> on the levels of <italic>atpC</italic>, <italic>cspA</italic>, <italic>rpsA</italic> and <italic>zraP</italic> transcripts.

The hypersensitivity of the &#x00394;<italic>greA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>greB</italic> strain to Zn<sup>2+</sup> led us to examine a gene involved in resistance against Zn<sup>2+</sup>, <italic>zraP</italic> (<italic>yjaI</italic>), which is known to be induced by Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Noll <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>).

For <italic>atpC</italic>, a member of <italic>atp</italic> operon, the major promoter of the operon was selected because the length of <italic>atpC</italic> transcripts shown in the Northern analysis was consistent with initiation from the promoter. For <italic>rpsA</italic>, two DNA templates were prepared because there are two major promoters, P1 and P3. Transcription was labelled with a [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]-labelled initiating NTP, so that the stoichiometry of the transcripts was measured irrespective of their lengths. The amounts of full-length synthesis initiated at these promoters were all limited in the absence of GreA and GreB, and the levels increased by 2- to 17-fold in their presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). These increases were accompanied by decreases in the amounts of some abortive transcripts, suggesting that the moribund complexes are converted into the productive one. Notably no significant decrease was detected in the amounts of transcripts in size between abortive and the full-length products, indicating that the Gre factors were not acting in elongation. The full-length transcripts from the control promoter, T7A1, showed little changes by the addition of GreA or GreB, if the typical error of &#x000b1;&#x0200a;25% is taken into account (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). This result indicates the absence of any contaminations activating transcription in the preparations of the Gre factors. It also confirms that the Gre factors cannot affect transcription from the promoter where the branched pathway is intrinsically reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Susa <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), being consistent with the introduction of reversibility by the Gre factors. The effects by GreA were equal to or slightly more than GreB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Sen <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). As GreB is generally more active in the relief of elongation arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Borukhov <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>), this tendency may be specific to their action in initiation.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Effects of GreA or GreB on <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription from <italic>atp</italic>, <italic>cspA</italic> and <italic>rpsA</italic> promoters.</p><p>A.

To examine this prediction, we applied the inversed pulse-chase assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kubori and Shimamoto, 1996</xref>) to the <italic>atp</italic> promoter chosen as a representative. This is the most sensitive method for detecting persistent abortive synthesis carried out by a moribund complex, and the result can be the sufficient condition for the existence of moribund complex. In the single-round condition ensured by a template with a bead blocking elongation at its downstream end (see <italic>Experimental procedures</italic>), transcription from the promoter was started with unlabelled NTPs at time zero, and the [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]-GTP, the initiating NTP in this case, was then added at various time points, followed by further incubation for 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The amount of full-length labelled transcript is equal to the amount of binary complexes that still survive at the given time point and can still synthesize long transcripts, i.e. the productive binary complexes surviving at that time. On the other hand, the amounts of labelled abortive transcripts are proportional, but may not be stoichiometric, to the amount of surviving binary complexes that carry out abortive synthesis. Therefore, increase in the ratio of the amount of an abortive transcript to that of the full-length labelled transcript means the existence of a complex that synthesizes only abortive products, namely moribund complex. As expected, the observed ratios of the amounts of 5- or 7-mer abortive transcripts to those of full-length transcripts did increase by two- to threefold in 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">C</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>, the fraction of GreA in the total protein in shaking culture at mid-log phase was almost as twice as that in standing culture at stationary phase. We also confirmed that the amounts of the <italic>atpC</italic>, <italic>cspA</italic> and <italic>rpsA</italic> transcripts were decreased in the latter condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). However, the observed decreases were much larger than that observed in the &#x00394;<italic>greA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>greB</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>) and than that of the level of GreA. These differences may indicate that there are more factors relating in the different growth conditions. For example, factors induced in the anaerobic and stationary condition could inhibit the basal level of the expression of the genes and/or the complete absence of the Gre factors could indirectly increase a basal level of the expression. The result obtained <italic>in vivo</italic> can be explained by many other models, even by those supposing no roles of GreA, but it does not contradict the regulatory function of GreA in initiation. Regulation of GreA has been speculated from the structure of its gene: a terminator-like stem-loop structure followed by U stretch in the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Sparkowski and Das, 1990</xref>).

Near the <italic>greB</italic> promoter, there are no definite structures suggesting its regulation. However, absence of evidence is not evidence for absence. In conclusion, transcription initiation of at least several genes is likely to be under regulation at least partly by using the branched mechanism in response to the level of the GreA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title><italic>&#x00394;greA&#x00394;greB</italic> strain shows pleiotropic phenotype</title><p>We found that our MC1061&#x00394;<italic>greA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>greB</italic> strain, TK1021, grew at 43.5&#x000b0;C but not at 30&#x000b0;C, while the previously reported strains with disrupted <italic>greA</italic> and <italic>greB</italic>, MC4100&#x00394;<italic>greA</italic>&#x00394;(<italic>ompR-greB</italic>) named AD8571 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Orlova <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>) and MG1655&#x00394;<italic>greA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>greB</italic> named N5306 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Trautinger and Lloyd, 2002</xref>), are sensitive to temperatures of 42&#x02013;43&#x000b0;C. Therefore, we transferred our <italic>greA</italic> disruption into the MC4100&#x00394;(<italic>ompR-greB</italic>). We found that the strain was sensitive to temperature of 43.5&#x000b0;C (data not shown), and concluded that the differences between these mutants may well be due to their different genetic backgrounds.</p><p>Our finding of hypersensitivity of our &#x00394;<italic>greA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>greB</italic> strain to Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> may have more physiological significance, because these ions are essential to <italic>E. coli</italic> but their excess is generally toxic. The replacement of an Mg<sup>2+</sup> at the catalytic site of the RNA polymerase with Mn<sup>2+</sup> may induce misincorporation of NTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Niyogi and Feldman, 1981</xref>). As the Gre factors are suggested to stabilize an Mg<sup>2+</sup> at the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Leptenko <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Opalka <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Sosunova <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), it is possible that they prevent the replacement of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and thus contribute to the fidelity of transcription. This model is consistent with the observed prevention of the misincorporation by GreA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Erie <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>), although other interpretations are also possible. The concentration of Zn<sup>2+</sup> in cells is strictly regulated by the balance between its uptake and excretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Outten and O&#x02019;Halloran, 2001</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the ZraP (YJAI) protein, of unknown function, is required for Zn<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis: the upshift of ZraP makes cells more tolerant to Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Noll <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>). Therefore, insufficient induction of <italic>zraP</italic> transcription in the &#x00394;<italic>greA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>greB</italic> strain provides a possible explanation for the hypersensitivity to Zn<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>In our DNA array and Northern analysis, the downshifted genes cover various functional categories, energy production (<italic>atpC</italic>), translation (<italic>rpsA</italic>, <italic>infC</italic>), cold-shock response (<italic>cspA</italic>, <italic>cspE</italic>), membrane component (<italic>lpp</italic>) and sugar metabolism (<italic>ptsH</italic>), implying that the effect of the <italic>gre</italic> genes is pleiotropic in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Recently, an important role of the Gre factors is indirectly suggested; DksA was found to be a critical factor explaining the difference between the large effects of ppGpp <italic>in vivo</italic> and its moderate effects <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Paul <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). According to the structural similarity of DksA to GreA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Perederina <italic>et al</italic>.</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">2004</xref>), these factors seem to share the same binding site on RNA polymerase, the smaller channel. As a consequence of the common binding site, a Gre factor will compete with the DksA, and possibly other unknown factors, for the binding site. Therefore, the changes in the levels of the Gre factors may indirectly affect the alternative regulations by DksA or the other factors sharing the same site on the RNA polymerase, and vice versa. In <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic>, Gfh1, a GreA homologue lacking the cleavage-stimulation activity, competes with GreA for a binding site on the polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Hogan <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), supporting this hypothesis. Therefore, a decrease of a Gre factor could produce not only factor-free RNA polymerase but also the enzyme bound to DksA and possibly other unknown factors, and the enzyme in these forms can contributes to the variation in responses to different conditions. These direct and indirect effects of the Gre factors on transcription regulation may explain the reasons why the transcripts of the three genes decrease more drastically in the stationary aerobic condition than in the disruptant, and why the phenotype of the &#x00394;<italic>greA</italic>&#x00394;<italic>greB</italic> strain is pleiotropic.</p></sec><sec><title>How do Gre factors relieve the initiation arrest?</title><p>Arrest of RNA polymerase occurs in initiation and elongation stages, and Gre factors relieve both arrests. In the elongation arrest, backtracking of the RNA polymerase disengages catalytic centre from the RNA 3&#x02032;-end and inactivates the complex, and the Gre factors allow such enzyme to re-elongate by inducing intrinsic transcript cleavage to expose a newly generated 3&#x02032;-end to the catalytic centre (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Borukhov <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">2005</xref>). Thus, the cleavage-stimulation activity of the Gre factors is essential for their relief of polymerase from the arrest in elongation.</p><p>In initiation, on the other hand, RNA cleavage by the Gre factors may not be necessary for relief of the arrest. The success of the inversed pulse-chase experiment indicates the existence of a binary complex committed to abortive synthesis, binary moribund complex. In addition, a kinetic study indicated that GreA and B have to be bound to RNA polymerase at the binary complex stage to relieve initiation arrest at the &#x003bb;<italic>P</italic><sub>R</sub>AL promoter and that a later binding abolishes the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Sen <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). These results provide the evidence that the binary complex is the target for the Gre factors to bind. The most straightforward speculation would be that the Gre factors relief as an simple allosteric effector without RNA cleavage, but the results do not deny the involvement of RNA cleavage in the relief by GreA. In this context, an interesting example is the effect of cAMP receptor protein (CRP) on the binary complex formed at the <italic>malT</italic> promoter. The binary complex in the absence of CRP satisfies the definition of moribund complex, synthesizing only abortive transcripts. The coexistence of CRP with the binary complex is sufficient to relieve the initiation arrest and its coexistence with a ternary complex, binary complex plus transcript, is not required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Tagami and Aiba, 1998</xref>). Because no RNA cleaving activity has been so far observed for the protein and its presence at the ternary complex stage is not required, this experiment provides the example of the relief from initiation arrest by an allosteric effector. As the position of branching point can be more than one and can depend on a promoter, the existence of abortive synthesis in the productive branch is still an open question.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance of branched mechanisms</title><p>The moribund complex was recently tried to be dismissed as an artefactual inactivation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Vo <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), but the possibility they examined has been already denied in the first article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kubori and Shimamoto, 1996</xref>) by the conversion from productive into moribund complex and by its reverse conversion in the presence of the Gre factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Sen <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). The finding of moribund complex at authentic promoters in this work may be a more convincing answer to the question. Does abortive synthesis occur in the productive pathway? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Vo <italic>et al</italic>. (2003)</xref> claimed the existence of abortive synthesis in the productive branch at the T5N25 promoter, based on the assumption that elongation rates are the same in two branches. However, the rate of non-productive elongation is much slower than that of the productive one at least at the &#x003bb;<italic>P</italic><sub>R</sub>AL promoter, judging from the time-course of elongation retained by moribund complex continues long after the completion of pen question, and its test requires a promoter that has been proved to produce no moribund complex.</p><p>The branched mechanism may contribute to the high fidelity of transcription by aborting transcripts with misincorporation. Several promoters are known to produce abortive transcripts with anomalous mobilities caused by misincorporation, including slippage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Metzger <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>). At the &#x003bb;<italic>P</italic><sub>R</sub>AL promoter, all the transcripts including misincorporation are found in abortive but not the full-length (32 nucleotides) transcripts, and are always elongated 1&#x02013;2 nucleotides beyond the site of misincorporation, allowing a kind of proofreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kubori and Shimamoto, 1997</xref>). We are inclined to explain that misincorporation switches the conformation of transcription complex from productive into moribund, and elongation of the transcript and its dissociation occurs simultaneously. Such a mechanism is impossible in a classic sequential model.</p><p>The branched mechanism in initiation is not limited to the branching into moribund complex. Recently, Travers and Muskhelishvili (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">2005</xref>) proposed the branching of productive initiation into a supercoiling-sensitive pathway involving FIS and a ppGpp-sensitive pathway involving DksA, which supposes complexes interacting differently with the spacer region between &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 hexemer sequences. The regulatory mechanism of the stuttering synthesis must involve another branching mechanism because an event in initiation changes the fate of the transcript at a later step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Qi <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). Caution should be given to the rate-limiting step of a branched mechanism with more than one parallel pathway leading to the product. In such a mechanism, deceleration of a rate-limiting step can make a new rate-limiting step in another pathway, which never happens if the product is formed in a single pathway, allowing contradicting properties of the rate-limiting steps.</p><p>Another caution must be paid when a non-productive branched pathway is handled as a hypothetical step in a sequential pathway, for example, inclusion of the moribund pathway in the promoter escape because transcription initiation can be regulated differently in the classic sequential and the branched mechanisms with productive and non-productive pathways. In the former, the level of initiation can be regulated only at the rate-limiting step, while in the latter the level is determined only by the fraction of enzyme molecules in the productive pathway independently of the position of the rate-limiting step. When some physiological changes shift the rate-limiting step from one process to another, the branched mechanism can provide a unique and robust regulation insensitive to such a change. The second possible benefit of the mechanism is that blocking at the promoter prevents the wasteful queue of RNA polymerase molecules, and that moribund complex can reserve potentially active RNA polymerase for emergency. For the branched mechanism involving moribund complex and GreA, this idea is consistent with the observation that expression of <italic>greA</italic> is greatly stimulated by &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent transcription (C.A. Gross, pers. comm.). The third possible benefit is maintenance of the effect of a regulator. If conversion between two pathways is essentially irreversible, the moribund or productive conformation is maintained long after the dissociation of a factor that has triggered a new conformation. Therefore, the mechanism can work as a molecular memory, and a mechanism involving a memory is described as a branched mechanism. These distinct properties of the branched mechanism provide variety in gene regulation that will be required for the survival in various conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>All strains were grown either in LB medium or in M9 medium supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glycerol, 10 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> thiamine, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.2% (w/v) casamino acids and 10 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup><sc>l</sc>-tryptophan.

RNA polymerase (1.0 pmol) and the immobilized DNA (1.5 pmol) were pre-incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in 8 &#x000b5;l of T-buffer for 10 min. A substrate mixture was then added to give finally 5 &#x000b5;M GTP and 100 &#x000b5;M each of ATP, CTP and UTP. After various reaction times, 3.3 &#x000b5;Ci [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]-GTP was added and the reaction was continued for a further 20 min. The reaction was then stopped by addition of phenol. The transcripts were subjected to 20% sequencing gel electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec><title>Western analysis</title><p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> TK1001 strain was cultured at 37&#x000b0;C overnight in 50 ml of LB medium containing tetracycline in either a 500 ml flask with vigorous shaking (shaking culture) or a 50 ml tube without shaking (standing culture). Cells were harvested at mid-log phase for shaking culture or stationary phase for standing culture. They were suspended in the buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS and 1 mM Pefabloc (Roche) and heated at 70&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was measured with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Total protein of 2&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;g was subjected to SDS-PAGE using 5&#x02013;20% gradient or 15% gel, and then blotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The GreA was immunostained with HRP-1000 Kit (Konica) and GreB with ECL advance (Amersham). The rabbit anti-GreA was raised against purified GreA and the anti-GreB was provided by Dr V. James Hernandez.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Richard S. Hayward for a critical reading of the manuscript, and Dr V. James Hernandez for anti-GreB.
