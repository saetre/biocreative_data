This study was designed to investigate the potential synergy between stimulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and the human T cell receptor complex. Transendothelial T cell migration towards CXCL10 was modified by crosslinking CD3 immediately before addition to the endothelium. When resting endothelium was used, T cells which had been activated by crosslinking CD3 for only 1&#x000a0;min showed a significant reduction (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) in migration when compared with untreated T cells. By contrast, endothelial cells which had been activated by stimulation with interferon-&#x003b3; and tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; supported a specific increase in the migration of activated T cells; this was most apparent after CD3 had been activated for 90&#x000a0;min (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). The molecular basis for synergy between CXCR3 and the T cell receptor complex was investigated by measurement of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. This showed that CXCL10 induced a close (&#x0003c;10&#x000a0;nm) spatial association between CXCR3 and the CD3&#x0025b; subunit on the cell-surface. These data demonstrate that stimulation of both CXCR3 and the T cell receptor has the potential to enhance specifically both the proliferation and extravasation of specific T cells during episodes of local inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>CXCR3</kwd><kwd>T cell receptor</kwd><kwd>Endothelium</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Transendothelial migration of leucocytes from the blood into sites of tissue inflammation is fundamental to the effective operation of the immune system. A multistep model for such migration is now generally accepted (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adams and Shaw, 1994</xref>). Leukocytes initially utilise relatively low affinity, selectin-mediated adhesion to support shear-stress induced rolling contact with the luminal surface of blood vessels. Subsequent encounter with inflammatory chemokines induces integrin activation resulting in leukocyte arrest. This is followed by cell flattening and the development of processes which identify intercellular junctions that can support diapedesis (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ley et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Integrin activation is mediated by the stimulation of G-protein coupled receptors on the surface of leucocytes by heparan sulphate-immobilised chemokines on the apical surface of endothelial cells (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hardy et al., 2004</xref>). There is differential expression of chemokine receptors by functional subsets of leukocyte (<xref rid="bib6 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 2003; Sato et al., 2007</xref>), and differential chemokine expression within specific functional compartments and inflammatory sites. This permits the selective recruitment of appropriate immune cells to specific locations.</p><p>Although appropriate for most leukocytes, the multistep model takes no account of the antigen specificity of T cells. T cells recognise cognate antigen via the T cell receptor (TCR) when it is presented in the context of cell-surface MHC molecules by either specialised or non-specialised antigen presenting cells (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Huppa and Davis, 2003</xref>). The ability of antigen recognition to influence T cell motility and integrin-mediated adhesion has long been recognised (<xref rid="bib11 bib13" ref-type="bibr">Dustin and Springer, 1989; Epler et al., 2000</xref>), but the potential for it to influence transendothelial migration remains a subject for investigation.</p><p>Vascular endothelial cells express high levels of MHC class I and variable levels of MHC class II; both of these can be increased by inflammatory mediators such as IFN&#x003b3; (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Shiao et al., 2007</xref>). These cells can also take up protein antigens and process peptides for presentation to specific T cell receptors in both classes of MHC antigen (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Savage et al., 1995</xref>). Although human endothelial cells do not express costimulatory B7 (CD80 or CD86) molecules, they are capable of inducing specific proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Al-Lamki et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A range of studies <italic>in vitro</italic> have focused on the effect of cognate antigen recognition on transendothelial T cell migration. Depending on the precise system used, the results have been variable. Initial studies suggested increased migration across endothelium which had been pre-treated with IFN&#x003b3; (<xref rid="bib26 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Marelli-Berg et al., 1999; Tay et al., 2003</xref>), whilst antigen-stimulated T cells were retained by resting endothelium (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Tay et al., 2003</xref>). These studies did not define a role for chemokines in this system, although stimulation of endothelial cells with IFN&#x003b3; is known to increase both the production (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Sana et al., 2005</xref>) and heparan sulphate-mediated capture (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Carter et al., 2003</xref>) of chemokines for apical presentation (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hardy et al., 2004</xref>) to immune cells. In particular, the IFN&#x003b3; inducible chemokine CXCL10 is produced at a high level by activated endothelial cells (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Luster and Ravetch, 1987</xref>).</p><p>More recent studies of rapid T cell migration across activated endothelial cells in the presence of shear-stresses, TCR stimulation and chemokines have revealed further complexity. Stimulation of the TCR was shown to reduce CXCL10-driven T cell migration across TNF&#x003b1; activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Manes et al., 2007</xref>). However, TNF&#x003b1; stimulated dermal microvascular endothelial cells supported enhanced T cell migration in the presence of TCR stimulation and the chemokine CX3CL1 (fractalkine), which is expressed by TNF&#x003b1; stimulated microvascular endothelial cells (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Manes and Pober, 2008</xref>). A murine model has provided further evidence of the importance of TCR stimulation for T cell migration by demonstrating that insulin-specific CD8+ T cells require antigen presentation by endothelial cells for efficient homing to pancreatic islets (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Savinov et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The potential for simultaneous chemokine receptor and T cell receptor activation provides a basis to explain chemokine-regulated transendothelial migration of antigen-specific T cells (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Ward and Marelli-Berg, 2009</xref>). The recent demonstration of a CXCL12-dependent spatial association of CXCR4 with the TCR has clear relevance for the integration of these signals. Indeed, it was shown that CXCR4 can utilise immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on components of the TCR complex for signal transduction (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2006</xref>). Such physical and functional association may also allow TCR activation to influence chemokine receptor signalling, with consequent enhancement or inhibition of migration. Whilst the results of this study are of great interest, they are of little relevance to the migration of T cells into inflammatory sites as CXCR4 is predominantly involved in homeostatic trafficking of na&#x000ef;ve T cells to lymph nodes (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is upregulated on activated T cells and plays a fundamental role in recruiting effector cells, including Th1 cells during inflammatory processes such as allograft rejection (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Romagnani, 2005</xref>); indeed, CXCR3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are resistant to acute cardiac allograft rejection (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hancock et al., 2000</xref>). This chemokine receptor is activated by at least three inflammatory chemokines: CXCL9 (monokine induced by IFN&#x003b3;; MIG), CXCL10 (IFN&#x003b3;-inducible protein; IP-10), and CXCL11 (IFN-inducible T cell &#x003b1;-chemoattractant; I-TAC). A recent study has suggested that, like activated CXCR4 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kremer et al., 2003</xref>), ligand activation of CXCR3 induces phosphorylation of the 70&#x000a0;kD tyrosine kinase, Zeta-associated protein (ZAP-70) which is also a critical component of TCR signal transduction (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dar and Knechtle, 2007</xref>). Importantly, it has been suggested that this provides a mechanism for cross-talk between CXCR3 and the TCR, with activation of the TCR modulating the potential for CXCR3-induced signalling, resulting in reduced chemotaxis within a CXCL10 concentration gradient produced by solute diffusion (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dar and Knechtle, 2007</xref>).</p><p>This study was designed to investigate further the regulation of CXCL10-induced transendothelial migration of CXCR3-expressing human T cells by defining the roles of endothelial cell activation with proinflammatory cytokines with and without concurrent TCR activation in the absence of B7-mediated costimulation. A series of sensitive flow cytometric fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments was then performed to examine the potential for CXCL10 to induce a spatial association between CXCR3 and the TCR complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>EA.hy926 cells</title><p>The model human endothelial cell line EA.hy926 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Edgell et al., 1983</xref>) was expanded in 75&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> tissue culture flasks (Corning, UK) containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium supplemented with 10% FBS (both from Sigma, Poole, UK).</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Activated T cells</title><p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained by density gradient centrifugation of heparinized blood samples taken from healthy adult volunteers.

Further experiments also demonstrated the absence of FRET between immunofluorescently labelled CD3&#x0025b; and CCR2 following specific T cell stimulation with the specific ligand 10&#x000a0;nM CCL7 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B).</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>This study was performed to assess downstream functions of the potential synergy between signalling through CXCR3 and the TCR on activated T cells. Initial studies demonstrated that resting human T cells expressed little CXCR3, but this receptor was expressed by the majority of T cells after mitogenic activation for 72&#x000a0;h by culturing with the immobilised CD3 antibody, OKT3. Indeed, previous studies have shown that CXCR3 is stored by resting T cells in cytoplasmic granules allowing release onto the cell-surface within minutes of activation (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Gasser et al., 2006</xref>). This chemokine receptor was shown to function in transendothelial chemotaxis assays in which the ligand CXCL10 was added below the endothelial cell monolayer. In these experiments it was found that activation of the endothelial monolayer with the proinflammatory cytokines IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; greatly increased the number of migrant cells. These data are consistent with previous studies showing increased CXCR3 expression during T cell activation, with this receptor being most highly expressed by memory and effector Th1 cells (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Loetscher et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>The transendothelial migration induced by subendothelial addition of CXCL10 suggests recognition of this ligand on the apical surface of the endothelial cells, where it may be bound and presented by heparan sulphate (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Ranjbaran et al., 2006</xref>). The marked increase in T cell migration observed across activated endothelium is likely to be due to increased expression of a range of factors (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Sana et al., 2005</xref>). These include increased endothelial production of additional chemokines such as CCL2 (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hardy et al., 2004</xref>), the increased potential of modified heparan sulphate to bind and present chemokines on the apical surface of the activated endothelial cells (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Carter et al., 2003</xref>), and increased expression of the critical T cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Alon and Ley, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The induction of T cell proliferation by OKT3 antibodies has been well described and is a specific feature of this IgG2a monoclonal CD3 antibody (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Van Wauwe et al., 1980</xref>); the mitogenic activity is produced by crosslinking the receptor complex. The current study demonstrated that 50% maximal T cell proliferation was produced by treatment of the culture wells with an antibody concentration of approximately 5&#x000a0;ng/ml, which is similar to the mitogenic concentration defined in earlier studies (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Van Wauwe et al., 1980</xref>). However, prior immobilisation of CXCL10 onto the culture wells induced a similar rate of T cell proliferation in the presence of OKT3 at only 1.9&#x000a0;ng/ml. This observation of CXCL10-mediated costimulation is consistent with a previous study which demonstrated that CXCR3 deficient T cells respond poorly in allogeneic mixed leukocyte culture (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hancock et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>It has been reported that stimulation with CXCL12 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nanki and Lipsky, 2000</xref>) or CCL5 (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bacon et al., 1995</xref>) will both enhance T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Although the mechanism for this chemokine-mediated costimulation remains incompletely defined, it has been shown that both CXCR4 and CCR5 migrate to the immune synapse following activation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Contento et al., 2008</xref>); this is associated with reduced T cell migration allowing increased contact with antigen presenting cells (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Molon et al., 2005</xref>). It is also known that stimulation with CXCL12 induces a spatial association between CXCR4 and the TCR complex allowing the chemokine receptor to activate components of the TCR signalling pathway leading to increased CD69 and IL-2 production (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2006</xref>). A similar utilisation of the TCR signalling pathway has been shown for CXCR3 (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dar and Knechtle, 2007</xref>).</p><p>An important validation experiment demonstrated that T cells labelled with CFSE showed a normal chemotactic response towards CXCL10. This result is consistent with previous reports indicating that limited concentrations of CFSE do not impair cell motility (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">De Clerck et al., 1994</xref>). A sensitive flow cytometric assay was developed to allow simultaneous enumeration of T cells which had been either activated with plate-bound OKT3 for 72&#x000a0;h or activated for 72&#x000a0;h and then subjected to a further cycle of CD3 crosslinking to model B7-deficient antigen presentation by endothelial cells (<xref rid="bib2 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Al-Lamki et al., 2008; Manes et al., 2007</xref>). Application of these techniques demonstrated that CD3 activation for 1&#x000a0;min before measuring chemotaxis towards CXCL10 across a resting endothelial monolayer reduced the migration of these cells in comparison with T cells which had not been activated at the time of the assay. However, this retardation was transient as T cells which had been activated for 90&#x000a0;min before the assay showed an equal migration to cells which had not been activated. This observation is consistent with previous reports that specific TCR activation can arrest T cell migration across non-IFN&#x003b3; treated endothelial cell monolayers by activation of Src family tyrosine kinases (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Manes et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Endothelial cell monolayers which have been pre-treated with the proinflammatory cytokines IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; support greater chemotactic responses. However, T cells which had been activated by crosslinking CD3 for either 1&#x000a0;min or 90&#x000a0;min showed a further increase in migration towards CXCL10 across activated endothelium when compared with cells which had not been reactivated. Indeed, T cells which had been reactivated for 90&#x000a0;min before the assay constituted almost 75% of the migrant population. Although the basis for the difference in migration of reactivated T cells across resting and activated endothelial cells is unclear, a previous report has noted that stimulation of endothelial cells with IFN&#x003b3; can increase the migration of antigen-activated T cells by reversing a &#x0201c;stop signal&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Tay et al., 2003</xref>). Studies performed <italic>in vivo</italic> have also shown that IFN&#x003b3; is required for the homing of antigen-specific T cells during autoimmune diabetes (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Savinov et al., 2001</xref>), with endothelial presentation of autoantigen promoting the recruitment of specific T cells (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Greening et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>A series of experiments was performed to identify any change in the spatial relationship between CXCR3 and CD3 following chemokine treatment in order to identify a basis for the synergy observed between these receptors. An established flow cytometric FRET assay was employed for this study using the fluorochromes PE and APC, which transfer fluorescence energy when they are separated by a distance of less than 10&#x000a0;nm (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Batard et al., 2002</xref>). Treatment of activated T cells with 10&#x000a0;nM CXCL10 markedly increased the fluorescence output due to FRET when CXCR3 and CD3&#x0025b; were labelled with antibodies conjugated to these fluorochromes. These data indicate for the first time a ligand-dependent, spatial association between CXCR3 and the TCR complex.</p><p>A similar increase in FRET was not observed when the PE and APC fluorochromes were bound to CXCR3 and the common cell-surface molecule CD45, indicating that the interaction between CXCR3 and CD3&#x0025b; was induced specifically by CXCL10. Importantly, a brief acid wash to remove cell-surface antibodies diminished the FRET signal demonstrating that these receptors were spatially associated on the cell-surface. The remaining, acid resistant FRET signal is indicative of a potentially non-specific fluorochrome association within the endosomal compartment following internalisation. These FRET results are consistent with a previous demonstration that CXCL12 induces a physical association between CXCR4 and CD3 on the surface of T cells (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2006</xref>). However, ligand-induced chemokine receptor association with the TCR complex is not a general finding as treatment of the activated T cells with CCL7 did not induce FRET between CCR2 and CD3&#x0025b;.</p><p>This study has shown that stimulation of CXCR3 on the surface of activated T cells produces signals which can synergise with those transduced by activation of the TCR complex. These signals enhance both T cell proliferation and the specific migration of T cells across cytokine-activated endothelium. The demonstration of a chemokine ligand-induced spatial association between CXCR3 and CD3&#x0025b; is consistent with a previous demonstration that the TCR and CXCR3 chemokine receptor signalling pathways share signal transduction molecules (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dar and Knechtle, 2007</xref>) and suggests a mechanistic basis for the enhanced transendothelial migration observed in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors have no financial or commercial conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Dr TA Booth for assistance with confocal microscopy, Maureen Kirkley for technical support and Catriona Barker for reviewing the manuscript.

(A) Representative flow cytometric dotplots showing analysis of transendothelial chemotaxis assays. Region P1 contains the total T cell population retrieved from the bottom chamber of a well following transendothelial migration. P2 contains the fluorosphere counting beads added to the sample. P3 contains the Alexa 633 labelled T cells within P1. P4 contains the CFSE labelled T cells within P1. Enumeration of events in these regions allowed the number of CFSE and Alexa 633 labelled cells to be calculated for analysis as described in Section <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">2</xref>. (B) Confocal microscopy showing the migration of T cells through cytokine-stimulated endothelium. By separate use of lasers at 488&#x000a0;nm and 633&#x000a0;nm wavelengths it was possible to visualise CFSE labelled (untreated) T cells (green) and Alexa 633 labelled (CD3 crosslinked) T cells (red) in separate images. Overlaying these images allowed the spatial relationship of both cell populations to be compared at different time points. The representative image was captured after 120&#x000a0;min and shows an Alexa 633 labelled cell in the process of migration through the membrane, whilst CFSE labelled cells remain on the surface of the endothelial cell monolayer.

Fluorescence intensity is expressed as a percentage of the maximal median fluorescence intensity (MFI). The increasing percentage values corresponded to increasing anti-CD3&#x0025b; antibody concentrations. (B) Control experiments demonstrated that the FRET signal is not due to non-specific spectral overlap (CD45/CXCR3 control), is specific for CXCR3 (CCR2/CD3 control), is ligand-dependent and is not entirely a consequence of receptor internalisation (reduction following acid wash).
