Cripto-1 plays an important oncogenic role during tumorigenesis and is overexpressed in a wide range of epithelial carcinomas, yet little is known about Cripto-1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).

It is one of the most common cancers in Southeast Asia and Southern China. The incidence rate of NPC in Southern China (20-50/100,000 people per year) is nearly 100-fold higher than that in the western world[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is uniquely present in almost all NPC from endemic regions, whereas absent in NPC from nonendemic regions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Additionally, NPC originates from a hidden anatomical site, and is more closely associated with advanced clinical stage with higher incidence of invasion and metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Hence, the prognosis for NPC patients is poor with a 5-year survival rate of less than 60%. It is of great clinical value to further understand the molecular mechanism of this cancer and find valuable early diagnostic markers as well as novel therapeutic strategies.</p><p>Human Cripto-1, also known as teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor-1 (TDGF-1), is a member of the <italic>Epidermal growth factor-cripto FRL1 cryptic </italic>(EGF-CFC) family (Cripto in humans, FRL1 in Xenopus, and Cryptic in mice), which is indispensable for early embryonic development[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, this 188-amino acid glycoprotein, Cripto-1 has two activity patterns: as a cell surface co-receptor anchored by glycosylphosphatidylinositol and as a soluble protein after cleavage of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although identified as a marker for embryonic stem cells and generally absent from adult tissues, Cripto-1 is overexpressed in 75-80% of human breast, colon, and lung cancers, as well as 50-60% of testicular, stomach, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, Cripto-1 expression is significantly increased in premalignant lesions, such as colon adenomas, intestinal metaplasia of the gastric mucosa and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that plasma Cripto-1 might represent a novel biomarker for the early detection of breast and colon carcinomas[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In an additional study, combined analysis of Cripto-1 and E-cadherin has significant value in evaluating the metastatic potential of gastric cancer and predicting patient prognosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>and transgenic mice studies have shown that cripto-1 play an important oncogenic role during tumorigenesis by promoting cell proliferation, survival, migration and invasion, as well inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition(EMT), transformation, branching morphogenesis and tumour angiogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Until now, there is never any evidence that has shown a relationship between Cripto-1 expression and carcinogenesis of NPC. In this investigation, we examined the Cripto-1 expression in human NPC in both clinical patient samples and tumour cell lines. We also used small hairpin RNA (shRNA) technique based on lentivirus vector to specifically inhibit the expression of Cripto-1 in a NPC cell line CNE-2. Our results provide strong evidences that Cripto-1 is upregulated in human NPC and might play a role in malignant progression of NPC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines</title><p>The human NPC cell lines C666-1, CNE-1, CNE-2, HNE-1, SUNE-1, and HONE-1 were grown in RPMI-1640 medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (ExCell, Shanghai, China) and 1% L-glutamine. NP69, a human immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], was grown in defined-KSFM medium supplemented with EGF (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Human embryonic kidney cell line 293FT was grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). All cell lines were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and tissue specimens</title><p>A total of 37 primary NPC patients treated at the Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University from 2006 to 2007 were enrolled to immunohitochemical study, including 26 males and 11 females with a median age of 49 years (range, 24-82 years). Meantime, 17 samples out of these 37 patients and another 7 chronic nasopharyngitis tissue samples were get freshly from the Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University and frozen in liquid nitrogen until process for RT-PCR examination. All patients were not pretreated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy prior to surgery. For the use of these clinical materials for research purposes, prior consent of the patients and approval from the Ethics Committee of Southern Medical University were obtained. All specimens were confirmed by pathological examination and staging was performed according to the 1992 Fuzhou NPC staging system of China[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Extraction of total RNA and RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from tissues and cell lines with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the user manual. cDNA was prepared from total RNA by using a First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Cripto-1 mRNA expressions were determined in 7 cell lines by real-time RT-PCR and in 17 NPC tissue samples, 7 chronic nasopharyngitis tissue samples by RT-PCR analysis.</p><p>Expressions of Cripto-1 mRNA in NPC cell lines were detected compared to that in NP69 cell line. For real-time RT-PCR, each reaction was done on an MX3000P instrument (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) with the SYBR<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Premix Ex Taq&#x02122; kit (Takara bio, Otsu, Japan) in a 25 &#x003bc;l reaction system with 1 &#x003bc;g cDNA following the manufacturer's protocol. ACTB (&#x003b2;-actin) was used as an internal control, and measurements between samples were compared by the threshold cycle of amplification (C<sub>T</sub>). The fold change in expression levels was determined by a comparative C<sub>T </sub>method using the formula: 2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;CT</sup>(&#x00394;&#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>= (C<sub>T(Cripto-1) </sub>- C<sub>T(&#x003b2;-actin)</sub>)<sub>cancer </sub>- (C<sub>T(Cripto-1) </sub>- C<sub>T(&#x003b2;-actin)</sub>)<sub>NP69</sub>). Primer sequences used for Cripto-1 are: forward 5'- GATACAGCACAGTAAGGAGC -3' and reverse 5'- TAGTTCTGGAGTCCTGGAAG -3'; for &#x003b2;-actin: forward 5'- CACCCAGCACAATGAAGAT -3' and reverse 5'- CAAATAAAGCCATGCCAAT -3'. The primers were designed between different exons and encompassing large introns to avoid any amplification of genomic DNA. QPCR was performed for pre-denaturing at 95&#x000b0;C for 60 seconds, followed by 45 cycles (95&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds, 60&#x000b0;C for 60 seconds and 72&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds). Specificity of amplification products was confirmed by melting curve analysis. All reactions were repeated three times, and the mean fold changes and standard deviation are reported. For RT-PCR reactions, the thermal cycle was defined at 94&#x000b0;C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, annealing at 60&#x000b0;C for 60 s and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining to check for nonspecific amplification.</p></sec><sec><title>Western-blot analysis</title><p>Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed on ice in RIPA buffer (1 &#x000d7; PBS, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) with protease inhibitors PMSF (Sangon, Shanghai, China). After concentration measured by the BCA method, equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed on 12% SDS/polyacrylamide gels and subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF) (Millipore, Billerica, MA) by electroblotting. After blocking for 1 h in Tris buffered saline (pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Tween and 5% non-fat milk) at room temperature, membranes were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with primary mouse monoclonal antibody against Cripto-1 (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA, at 1:1000 dilution), and &#x003b2;-actin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, at 1:2000 dilution) with gentle shaking. After washing, the membrane was then probed with the appropriate secondary antibody for 60 min at room temperature. Protein binding on the membrane was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then band intensity was measured by densitometry using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The protein levels were normalized with respect to &#x003b2;-actin protein level.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry analysis</title><p>Sections (4 &#x003bc;m thick) of formalin fixed, paraffin wax blocks were cut onto polylysine- coated microscope slides. According to the specification of IHC S-P detection kit (Maixin, Fujian, China): after deparaffinisation in xylene and hydration through graded alcohol, sections were washed and then exposed with ready-to-use proteinase K solution (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) for 6 minutes at room temperature to enhance antigenicity. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min and non-specific binding was blocked with 5% normal goat serum in phosphate buffered saline for 15 min. Then sections were incubated with first antibody (mouse-anti-human Cripto-1 monoclonal antibody, R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) at a concentration of 1: 100 at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. Biotinylated antimouse IgG antibody (Boshide, Wuhan, China) was added for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C, following the incubation with streptavidin-biotin/horseradish peroxidase complex for 10 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Finally, sections were colored with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) for 5 min, lightly counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted. Sections immunostained with PBS replacing primary antibody are used as negative control. A positive control was included with each batch of staining to ensure consistency between consecutive runs.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of staining</title><p>The brown-yellow staining of the cytoplasm and the cytoplasmic membrane was considered positive. For each case, the entire stained tissue section was scanned, 5 visual fields at 400&#x000d7; magnification were randomly chosen and 100 cells in each field were counted. The degree of immunointensity was quantified by using the total immunostaining score calculated as the sum of the percent positivity of stained tumour cells and the staining intensity. The percent positivity was scored as '0' (&#x0003c;5%, negative), '1' (5-25%, sporadic), '2' (26-50%, focal), '3' (&#x0003e;50%, diffuse). The staining intensity was score as '0' (no staining), '1' (weakly stained), '2' (moderately stained), and '3' (strongly stained). Cases with weighted scores of less than 3 were defined as negative; otherwise they were defined as positive[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. No folding, and edging-effect fields were chosen during calculation of 100 cells per five fields. The score assessment was performed independently by two pathologists blinded to the clinical parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of shRNA expressing vectors</title><p>The specific siRNA targeting sequence (5'-AATGACTCTGAATTAAAG-3')[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] is homologous to nt 190-208 of the Cripto-1 mRNA(Gene Bank Accession No. NM_003312). Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was synthesized and cloned into the pLVTHM vector, which contained H1 promoter and a reporter gene green fluorescent protein (GFP). An invalid RNAi sequence (5'-GCAGGAGCTATGCTACCATCA-3') was used as negative control. The correct insertion of the specific shRNA was further confirmed by sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment of NPC cells with shRNA-encoding expression construct</title><p>The Cripto-1-specific shRNA-encoding expression construct (pLVTHM-shCripto-1), psPAX2 and pMD2.G were cotransfected to 293FT cell line using the lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to produce lentivirus stock, with negative construct as negative control. The titration of lentiviral vectors were determined as described by Tiscornia et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Briefly, the lentiviral preparation was diluted tenfold serially in PBS (from undiluted to a dilution of 10<sup>-5</sup>). 0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>293FT cells were seeded in each well of the 24-well plate, in a final volume of 500 &#x003bc;l per well. Added 20 &#x003bc;l of each viral dilution to the cells, mixed thoroughly but gently and incubated the cells at 37&#x000b0;C for 48 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS to eliminate leftover virus in the medium. The percentage of labeled cells was determined by FACS. Biological titer (BT = TU/ml, transducing units) was calculated according to the following formula: TU/&#x003bc;l = (P &#x000d7; N/100 &#x000d7; V) &#x000d7;1/DF, where P = % GFP<sup>+ </sup>cells, N = number of cells at time of transduction, V = volume of dilution added to each well = 20 &#x003bc;l and DF = dilution factor.</p><p>After the titer was determined, the lentivirus stock was transduced to NPC cells according to the manufacture recommendations of BLOCK-iT&#x02122; Lentiviral RNAi Expression System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cell lines with stable Cripto-1 knock-down and the negative controls were established by FACS selection for GFP expression and named as CNE-2/GFP<sup>+</sup>/Cripto-1<sup>-</sup>, CNE-2/GFP<sup>+</sup>/mock, C666-1/GFP<sup>+</sup>/Cripto-1<sup>- </sup>and C666-1/GFP<sup>+</sup>/mock, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>In vitro cell growth assay</title><p>MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA.) cell viability assay, routine checks of the cell growth was performed to assess the proliferation of the transduced cells. The cells were incubated in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 10<sup>3 </sup>cells per well and cultured for 1-7 days. Each subsequent day, 20 &#x003bc;l of 5 mg/mL MTT were added to each well. After being incubated for 4 h at 37&#x000b0;C, the supernatants were removed carefully. 150 &#x003bc;l of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) were added to each well and thoroughly mixed for 10 minutes.

Tumour cells in serum-free medium (300 &#x003bc;l containing 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells) were added to the top chamber. The bottom chamber was prepared with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. After 48 h incubation, the noninvasive cells were removed with a cotton swab. The cells that had migrated through the membrane and had stuck to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with methanol for 15 minutes and stained with haematoxylin. For quantification, the cells were counted under a microscope in 5 predetermined fields at &#x000d7;200.</p></sec><sec><title>In vivo experiments</title><p>The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanfang Medical University. A total of 5 mice, 4-5 weeks old and 18-20 g in weight, were provided by the Central Animal Facility of Nanfang Medical University and were bred in a specific pathogen-free condition. All the 5 mice underwent subcutaneous injection of 100 &#x003bc;l cell suspension of CNE-2 (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) in the up axillary dorsal scapula region as control group, and CNE-2/GFP<sup>+</sup>/Cripto-1<sup>- </sup>(1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) in the low inguinal region.

However, there has been no report about the relations between Cripto-1 and NPC. In this study, we presented the first evidence that Cripto-1 was overexpressed at both transcriptional and translational levels in NPC cell lines. Using immunochemistry and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, we found that Cripto-1 protein was expressed in 54.1% (20 of 37 cases) and 76.5% (13 of 17 cases) human NPC tissues, respectively. However, only 28.6% (2 of 7 cases) nasopharygitis showed Cripto-1 positive. We also found that Cripto-1 overexpression was significantly associated with N classification, distant metastasis, and clinical stage. Our results highlight the clinical significance of Cripto-1 in NPC. Expression of Cripto-1 shows 50-80% variance, as detected by immunohistochemistry, in different types of tumour tissues. More recently, Cripto-1 was detected in almost half of the breast cancer tissue samples analyzed and found to correlate with advanced stage disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our results are consistent with these reports and thus, NPC joins the list of the tumors that express Cripto-1.</p><p>Until now, numerous <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>studies have shown that cripto-1 act as an important factor during tumorigenesis by promoting cell proliferation, survival, migration and invasion. Overexpression of Cripto-1 cDNA in normal mouse fibroblasts induce these cells to grow in soft agar and increase growth rates in several human breast cancer cell lines[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Human MCF-7 breast cancer cells that overexpress Cripto-1 proliferate at higher rates in serum-free medium, form increased numbers of colonies in soft agar, are more resistant to apoptosis when grown under anchorage independent conditions, and show increased propensity to invade and migrate <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. MMTV-Cripto-1 transgenic mice and WAP-Cripto-1 transgenic mice that overexpress the human Cripto-1 transgene showed increased incidence of mammary gland tumors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To explore the possible role of Cripto-1 in promoting NPC cell proliferation and invasion, we knocked down the expression of Cripto-1 in CNE-2 and C666-1 by lentivirus-mediated RNAi silencing. Then through a continuous MTT assay, we found that the cell growth was suppressed after the inhibition of endogenous Cripto-1 protein, suggesting a role of Cripto-1 in promoting tumor cell growth. However, flow cytometry analysis showed no significant change on the cell cycle of CNE-2 cells after Cripto-1 silence. This result suggests that Cripto-1 might promote cell growth in other pathway rather than impact on cell cycle. However, due to high proliferative rate of CNE-2 cells and incomplete RNAi suppressive effect (knock-down rather than knock-out), the negative results of cell cycle analysis need to be further verified.</p><p>To investigate the proliferation of the tumor cells <italic>in vivo </italic>after Cripto -1 gene silencing, we employed the xenotransplant nude mice model with whole-body visualizing instrument. Data showed that both the average volume and weight of tumor in CNE-2/GFP<sup>+</sup>/Cripto-1<sup>- </sup>xenotransplant mice group were significantly lower than those in the control group, indicating that the Cripto-1 gene silencing could partially inhibit the growth of CNE-2 cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Ki67, a nuclear protein regulating cell cycle, is a biomarker of cell proliferation. Our results showed that the number of cells immunolabeled for Ki67 in the CNE-2/GFP<sup>+</sup>/Cripto-1<sup>- </sup>xenotransplant tumors was significantly less than that in the control group, suggesting that a decreased proliferation of CNE-2 cells could be achieved by Cripto-1 knock-down.</p><p>Association of Cripto-1 with metastatic potential has been found in a few human cancers. Ciardiello et al. have reported that Cripto-1 mRNA expression is found in 68.2% (30/44) of primary colonic cancers and 61.8% (21/34) of liver metastases, but in only 1.5% (1/65) of normal tissues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, the Cripto-1 expression level was increased in lymph node metastases compared with their primary tumours[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In our study, Cripto-1 mRNA was highly expressed in CNE-2 and C666-1 cell lines which are highly metastatic and proliferative. In the contrary, in CNE-1 cell line with no metastatic ability, Cripto-1 was expressed lowly. We also found Cripto-1 expression correlates with metastasis in NPC patients. In addition, by <italic>in vitro </italic>invasion assay, substantial suppression of cell invasion was observed after endogenous Cripto-1 interference. All of these data suggest an association between Cripto-1 and tumour cell motility, invasion, and metastasis. Thus, our studies have shown that Cripto-1, as a potentially oncogenic protein, might play an important role in the tumorigenesis and progression of NPC.</p><p>However, the possible mechanism and the exact mode of Cripto-1 action during tumor metastasis and progression are still largely unknown. Although, we have not demonstrated clearly the mechanisms underlined the inhibition of Cripto-1 gene silencing, it has been evidenced that in addition to functioning as a Nodal co-receptor, Cripto-1 has been shown to mediate signaling of other TGF-<italic>&#x003b2; </italic>ligands, such as Activin and Xenopus Vg1 and its ortholog in mouse GDF1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In contrast, binding of Cripto-1 to Activin and TGF-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 can inhibit Activin and TGF<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-1 signaling in mammalian cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Moreover, Cripto-1 can also activate the ras/raf/MAPK and PI3-K/AKT/GSK-3<italic>&#x003b2; </italic>intracellular signaling pathways independently of Nodal and ALK4[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Some data suggest that Cripto-1 may be involved in regulating integrin signaling either directly by binding to integrins and subsequently activating integrin signaling or indirectly by regulating the expression of extracellular matrix proteins which are also capable of binding integrins and activating integrin signaling[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Several studies have also suggested that the Wnt/b-catenin/Lef-1 signalling pathway may cross-talk with the Cripto-1 signaling pathway, regulating cell adhesion and migration[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Strizzi et al. have reported that Cripto-1 may promote the increased expression of markers and signaling molecules associated with EMT[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Also, in the Cripto-1 transgenic mammary gland tumors, the zinc-finger repressor transcription factor, Snail, known to down-regulate or interfere with the normal expression of E-cadherin, was detected at significantly higher levels as compared to normal control mammary tissue, thus suggesting a novel link between Cripto-1 expression and Snail activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Since high expression of Cripto-1 can be detected in human cancers, as compared to normal tissues, this signaling pathway might represent a target for cancer therapy. This is supported by findings describing the use of antisense oligonucleotides that reduce Cripto-1 expression and cause significant reduction of cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, neutralizing antibodies against Cripto-1 were able to significantly inhibit tumor cell growth in two xenograft models with testicular and colon cancer cells that express very high levels of Cripto-1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Moreover, rat monoclonal antibodies directed against the EGF-like domain of the Cripto-1 peptide also produced a significant inhibition of <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>growth of colon cancer and leukemia cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Our data also demonstrated that lentivector-mediated RNAi was feasible for the inhibition of the growth and invasion of NPC cells <italic>in vitro and in vivo</italic>, indicating the siRNA sequences targeting Cripto-1 could be a potential target for gene therapy of NPC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, this study demonstrated that the level of expression of Cripto-1 was significantly increased in NPC. Moreover, Cripto-1 expression correlated evidently with the malignant status of NPC. Finally, we showed that Cripto-1 might play a role in the tumorigenesis and progression of NPC by promoting the growth and invasion of NPC cells both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These findings provide new insight into understanding the molecular mechanism involved in NPC carcinogenesis and progression, and may lead to the development of new approaches for effective diagnosis and therapy. However, more work is still needed to clarify the mechanism of Cripto-1 in the development and progression of NPC and its related signaling pathway in NPC.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Wu ZR designed the research.
