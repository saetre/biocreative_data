MET1 maintains CG methylation, and DRM1/2 and CMT3 act redundantly to enforce non-CG methylation. <italic>RPS</italic>, a repetitive hypermethylated DNA fragment from <italic>Petunia hybrida</italic>, attracts DNA methylation when transferred into <italic>Petunia</italic> or other species. In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, which does not contain any <italic>RPS</italic> homologues, <italic>RPS</italic> transgenes are efficiently methylated in all sequence contexts. To test which DNA methylation pathways regulate <italic>RPS</italic> methylation, we examined maintenance of <italic>RPS</italic> methylation in various mutant backgrounds. Surprisingly, CG methylation was lost in a <italic>drm1/2/cmt3</italic> mutant, and non-CG methylation was almost completely eliminated in a <italic>met1</italic> mutant. An unusual cooperative activity of all three DNA methyltransferases is therefore required for maintenance of both CG and non-CG methylation in <italic>RPS</italic>. Other unusual features of <italic>RPS</italic> methylation are the independence of its non-CG methylation from the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway and the exceptional maintenance of methylation at a CC<sup>m</sup>TGG site in some epigenetic mutants. This is indicative of activity of a methylation system in plants that may have evolved from the DCM methylation system that controls CC<sup>m</sup>WGG methylation in bacteria. Our data suggest that strict separation of CG and non-CG methylation pathways does not apply to all target regions, and that caution is required in generalizing methylation data obtained for individual genomic regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>MET1</kwd><kwd>DRM2</kwd><kwd>CMT3</kwd><kwd>DCM-like methylation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA methylation has evolved from an immune function in bacteria to a regulator of gene expression and genome structure in higher eukaryotes. In bacteria, methylation targets are determined on the basis of their DNA sequence, as type II DNA methyltransferases methylate short recognition sequences, providing protection against methylation-sensitive endonucleases that target the same sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Wilson, 1988</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, DNA methylation systems have to fulfil new functions that are not compatible with the universal distribution of DNA methylation marks across the genome. For example, inactivation of parasitic sequences or compartmentalization of heterochromatic regions require selective establishment and clonal inheritance of DNA methylation patterns based on <italic>de novo</italic> and maintenance methylation systems. The evolution and adaptation of prokaryotic DNA methylation systems was probably a requirement for higher eukaryotes to manage their large genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bestor, 1990</xref>), and a comparison of the features of DNA methylation systems present in higher eukaryotes may help us to understand this evolutionary process.</p><p>Plants show three cytosine methylation types, CG, CNG and CNN methylation, which are regulated by three DNA methylation functions. DNMT1-like METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) controls CG methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Finnegan and Dennis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Saze <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) is the main enzyme controlling methylation at CNG sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Lindroth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) but also affects CNN methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bartee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Two members of the DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE family, DRM1 and DRM2, are also responsible for CNN methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cao and Jacobsen, 2002a</xref>), thus CNG and CNN methylation are therefore controlled redundantly by CMT3, DRM1 and DRM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Chan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). While the symmetry of CG methylation targets provides a means for maintenance after replication, non-symmetrical methylation (NSM) patterns can only be maintained via continuous <italic>de novo</italic> methylation, which requires defined helper functions. NSM patterns are maintained by three partially overlapping pathways that can be distinguished by their effects on individual target regions.</p><p>NSM of endogenous repeats at the flowering time locus FWA and at the repeat element MEA-ISR requires a 24 nt siRNA whose production is controlled by the two largest subunits of RNA-DEPENDENT POLYMERASE IV (NRPD1a and NRPD1b), RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2), DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3) and ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4). It has been proposed that, within a nucleolar processing centre, NRPD1a-generated RNA is copied by RDR2 into dsRNA, which DCL3 cleaves into 24 nt siRNAs that assemble with an AGO4/NRPD1b-containing silencing complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Pontes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). This complex guides DRM2 (the more highly expressed member of the DRM family; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cao and Jacobsen, 2002a</xref>) to its target regions, where it induces NSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Chan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>NSM at the SINE element <italic>AtSN1</italic> uses a combination of the RNAi pathway and a second pathway in which CMT3 is guided to the target region by histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), which is established by the suppressor of variegation-enhancer of zeste-trithorax (SET) domain protein SUVH4/KRYPTONITE (KYP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Jackson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). An essential regulator both for the RNAi pathway and the KYP-dependent pathway is the putative SNF2 chromatin remodelling protein DRD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kanno <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). DRD1 works together with the 24 nt siRNA pathway in the establishment of DNA methylation, with DRM2 and CMT3 maintaining DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Chan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>NSM at the pericentromeric retrotransposon <italic>Ta3</italic> does not require the siRNA pathway and is also independent of DRD1. Instead, <italic>Ta3</italic> methylation is regulated by CMT3- and KYP-based histone H3K9me2 methylation in an alternative DRD1-independent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Chan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>We have previously described the <italic>RPS</italic> sequence element from <italic>Petunia hybrida</italic>, which acts as a hot spot for <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation when transferred into the Arabidopsis genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Muller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). There is no indication that the <italic>RPS</italic> element is transcribed, and it has been suggested that <italic>RPS</italic> attracts DNA methylation via its palindromic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Muller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). To test the influence of epigenetic regulators on <italic>RPS</italic>-specific methylation patterns, we crossed a methylated <italic>RPS</italic> transgene into various Arabidopsis mutant backgrounds. Surprisingly, we found that the three methyltransferases MET1, CMT3 and DRM1/2 are all required cooperatively for <italic>RPS</italic> methylation both at CG and non-CG sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The transgenic Arabidopsis line RA5 contains a single copy of the <italic>RPS</italic> transgene, which is heavily methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Muller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). We used this line for crosses with epigenetic pathway mutants to test their effects on maintenance of RPS methylation. RPS methylation was first examined in the putative chromatin remodelling mutants <italic>drd1</italic> and <italic>ddm1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). DDM1 had no influence on the methylation of cytosines in any context but methylation levels were significantly affected in <italic>drd1</italic>, especially at non-CG targets, as CNG and CNN methylation levels dropped to below 10% of the wild-type levels for these targets. CG-specific methylation was also reduced in <italic>drd1</italic>, especially at two CG sites in the 5&#x02032; region. In contrast to the significant hypomethylation of CNG sites, methylation at the second C residue within a CCTGG sequence was only moderately reduced in the <italic>drd1</italic> mutant.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title><italic>RPS</italic> methylation in putative chromatin remodelling mutants</title><p>Methylation is reduced in the <italic>drd1</italic> mutant but unaffected in <italic>ddm1</italic>.

Open bars indicate the methylation frequency for the second C at a CCTGG site, which is only moderately reduced in the <italic>drd1</italic> mutant.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="tpj0056-0814-f1"/></fig><p>As a next step, we compared <italic>RPS</italic> methylation patterns in lines carrying mutations of four genes required for NSM mediated by the RNAi pathway or the KYP-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>). In all four lines, both CNG and CNN methylation levels were reduced, with <italic>kyp2</italic> and <italic>dcl3</italic> having the strongest impact. The only exception was again methylation at the CC<sup>m</sup>TGG site, which was not significantly altered in any of the four mutants. Surprisingly, CG methylation was also reduced in <italic>kyp2</italic>, <italic>dcl3</italic> and <italic>ago4.</italic> In <italic>rdr2</italic>, most CG targets remained hypermethylated, except for the two cytosines in the 5&#x02032; region that were also affected in <italic>drd1</italic>.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title><italic>RPS</italic> methylation in mutants of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway</title><p>All lines show some hypermethylation at CG and non-CG targets, except for the majority of CG sites in <italic>rdr2</italic>, for which the methylation state is maintained. In contrast to other CNG sites, CC<sup>m</sup>TGG methylation is not altered in any of the four mutants.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="tpj0056-0814-f2"/></fig><p><italic>RPS</italic> methylation was then tested in the three DNA methyltransferase mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>). Surprisingly, DNA methylation was significantly reduced in all lines irrespective of the sequence context. In <italic>met1</italic>, hypomethylation affected CG sites, and non-CG methylation was also almost eliminated. The mildest effects were detectable in <italic>cmt3</italic>, in which C residues in all sequence contexts were hypomethylated, but this effect was less pronounced at the CC<sup>m</sup>TGG site, at some central CNN sites and at CG sites in the 3&#x02032; region. The most significant hypomethylation effect was observed in the <italic>drm1/2</italic>mutant double mutant and a <italic>drm1/2/cmt3</italic> triple mutant, in which methylation was almost completely eliminated, with only some traces of CNN methylation. Maintenance of RPS-specific CG methylation can therefore not be guaranteed by MET1 alone but requires both DRM1/2 and CMT3. Equally, DRM1/2 and CMT3 are necessary but not sufficient for maintenance of CNG and CNN methylation, which also requires MET1. Maintenance of methylation at the CC<sup>m</sup>TGG site also required DRM1/2, MET1, and, to a lesser extent, CMT3.</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title><italic>RPS</italic> methylation in DNA methyltransferase mutants</title><p>DNA methylation is significantly reduced in all lines. Non-CG methylation is almost eliminated in <italic>met1</italic>, but a low level of CG methylation is maintained. No CG methylation and only traces of non-CG methylation are retained in the <italic>drm1/2/cmt3</italic> mutant.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="tpj0056-0814-f3"/></fig><p>Although some hypomethylation was detectable in <italic>rdr2</italic>, <italic>kyp2</italic>, <italic>dcl3</italic> and <italic>ago4</italic>, neither CNG nor CNN methylation were eliminated. This result was in accordance with the assumption that, while the RNAi pathway may augment <italic>RPS</italic> methylation, it is not essential for its maintenance. The analysis of <italic>RPS</italic>-specific small RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4</xref>) also supports this model. <italic>Petunia</italic>, which contains a large pool of methylated <italic>RPS</italic> copies and <italic>RPS</italic> homologues, shows a strong signal for <italic>RPS</italic>-specific small RNAs. A very faint signal of similar size was also detectable in the RA5 line, which has a single methylated <italic>RPS</italic> copy, but the small RNA is no longer detectable in the <italic>rdr2</italic> line, which still shows a significant level of <italic>RPS</italic> methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>). The small RNA in RA5 may therefore reflect an enhancement of <italic>RPS</italic> methylation via the RNAi pathway, but basic levels of <italic>RPS</italic> methylation can be maintained without the RNAi pathway. To test whether this independence also applies to initiation of <italic>RPS</italic>-specific methylation, we transformed an <italic>rdr2</italic> mutant with an <italic>RPS</italic> construct and analysed methylation patterns in three independent transformants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5</xref>). All three lines showed a low but significant methylation level for the <italic>RPS</italic> transgene, which suggests that <italic>RPS</italic> methylation is not only maintained but can also be initiated in the absence of the RNAi pathway.</p><fig id="fig05" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title><italic>De novo</italic> methylation of <italic>RPS</italic> does not depend on RDR2</title><p>DNA methylation pattern of the <italic>RPS</italic> region in three transgenic <italic>rdr2</italic> mutant lines.

Hybridization with an miR159 probe was used to determine equal loading of the RNA samples.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="tpj0056-0814-f4"/></fig><p>Apart from the joint requirement for various methyltransferases and the independence of non-CG methylation from the small RNA pathway, another unusual feature of <italic>RPS</italic> was that its methylation was dependent on MET1 but not influenced by DDM1, as these two functions jointly regulate CG methylation for a number of endogenes and transgenic loci. To test whether the plant genome contains other regions with methylation patterns that are independent of DDM1, we cloned genomic DNA of a <italic>ddm1</italic> mutant after digestion with <italic>Gla</italic>I, which requires methylated cytosines for restriction. <italic>Gla</italic>I cleaves fully methylated CGCG sites, ACGC and GCGC sites which contain at least three methylated C residues, and GCGT sites with at least two methylated residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Tarasova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). When digested with <italic>Gla</italic>I, <italic>ddm1</italic> genomic DNA no longer contains the characteristic bands that are indicative of methylated repetitive regions in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6a</xref>). A faint background level suggested that a small fraction of the <italic>ddm1</italic> DNA was digested by <italic>Gla</italic>I. After cloning this fraction, we sequenced nine regions and used the highly integrated single-base resolution maps at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neomorph.salk.edu/epigenome.html">http://neomorph.salk.edu/epigenome.html</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Lister <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) to examine their methylation profiles in wild-type and DNA methyltransferase mutants. Eight of the nine cloned regions represented genes with CG methylation regions located in the central and/or 3&#x02032; coding region. One clone comprised a methylated repeat region next to the 3&#x02032; UTR of At4g14365, which contained CG and non-CG methylation targets. In all cloned regions, CG methylation is abolished in <italic>met1</italic> and retained in the <italic>drm1/2/cmt3</italic> triple mutant. The non-CG methylation pattern in the region near the At4g14365 gene is lost in the <italic>drm1/2/cmt3</italic> triple mutant and retained in <italic>met1</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We selected regions from three clones with CG methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6b</xref>) and from the only clone with CG and non-CG methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Figure 6c</xref>) for bisulfate analysis of <italic>ddm1</italic> DNA, which confirmed that all clones maintained their methylation pattern in <italic>ddm1</italic>. Like <italic>RPS</italic> methylation, methylation in some euchromatic regions is therefore independent of DDM1. In contrast to <italic>RPS</italic>, however, CG and non-CG patterns in these regions are separately controlled by MET1 and DRM1/2/CMT3 activity.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clones isolated after <italic>Gla</italic>I digestion of <italic>ddm1</italic> genomic DNA</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Methylation in<hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wild-type</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>met1</italic></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>drm1/2/cmt3</italic></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Encoded protein</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At1g02010</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SEC1A; protein transporter member of KEULE gene family</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At3g01370</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At3g50040</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At3g53580</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown protein; similar to diaminopimelate epimerase, putative, expressed</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At4g10140</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At4g14365</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG CNG CNN</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CNG CNN</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown protein; similar to zinc finger (C3HC4-type RING finger) family protein/ankyrin repeat family protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At4g32910</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown protein; similar to Os01g0746200 (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, japonica cultivar group) (GB: NP_001044228.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At5g16780</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown protein; encodes a protein belonging to the SART-1 family</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">At5g22130</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown protein; member of glycosyltransferase family 50</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="fig06" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Methylation patterns of cloned genomic regions in <italic>ddm</italic>1</title><p>(a) Digestion of genomic DNA from wild-type and <italic>ddm1</italic> using <italic>Gla</italic>I, which requires cytosine methylation.

DDM1 is therefore essential for DNA methylation of certain but not all genomic regions. It is tempting to speculate that repetitive or heterochromatic regions are prime targets for DDM1, while unique or euchromatic regions are methylated independently of DDM1. Repetitiveness may, however, not be sufficient for a region to come under DDM1 control, as we found a block of methylated CG and non-CG targets in a repetitive region near the 3&#x02032; UTR of At4g14365 that are also independent of DDM1.</p></sec><sec><title>RdDM pathway functions enhance RPS methylation but are not essential for maintenance or initiation of RPS methylation</title><p>The general reduction of DNA methylation levels in <italic>drd1</italic>, <italic>kyp2</italic>, <italic>dcl3</italic>, <italic>ago4</italic> and <italic>rdr2</italic> suggests that RdDM pathways contribute to the maintenance of <italic>RPS</italic> methylation. However, this effect is not specific for non-CG methylation targets, and this is most obvious in <italic>kyp2</italic> and <italic>dcl3</italic> backgrounds for which CG methylation levels fall from 89% to 12% and 21%, respectively. This contrasts with reports regarding the conservation of CG methylation in <italic>dcl3</italic> at <italic>MEA-ISR</italic>, <italic>AtSN1</italic> and <italic>IR-71</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Henderson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). For <italic>kyp</italic>, a moderate reduction of CG methylation from 16% to 6% has been reported for <italic>Superman</italic> (<italic>SUP</italic>), but CG methylation at <italic>FWA</italic>, <italic>TSI</italic>, <italic>TA3</italic> and at a 180-bp centromeric repeat remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Jackson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Although <italic>drd1</italic>, <italic>kyp2</italic>, <italic>dcl3</italic>, <italic>ago4</italic> and <italic>rdr2</italic> all show a hypomethylation effect, none of the mutants inhibits <italic>RPS</italic> methylation completely, and a similar basic level of methylation is also observed in <italic>RPS</italic> transgenes after transfer into <italic>rdr2.</italic> The basic methylation level in all five mutants, the lack of an <italic>RPS</italic>-specific siRNA in the <italic>rdr2</italic> background and the failure to detect <italic>RPS</italic>-specific transcripts suggest that the initial <italic>RPS</italic> methylation level is established independently of RdRM pathways. The enhanced methylation levels and the presence of an <italic>RPS</italic>-specific siRNA in RA5 suggest that basal methylation levels are amplified via the RdRM pathway. It has been suggested that siRNA production requires NRPD1a to transcribe either a methylated target region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Herr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) or locus-specific nascent transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Pontes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) or dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Vaucheret, 2005</xref>). Our data support a signal function for methylated RPS DNA in the initiation of siRNA production.</p></sec><sec><title>The separation between CG and non-CG methylation pathways is lost in RPS</title><p>Another surprising feature of <italic>RPS</italic> methylation is the influence of the various DNA methyltransferases on methylation of cytosines outside their usual target sequence context. These characteristics are not shared by the cloned DDM1-independent methylation targets, for which we see a clear separation between MET1-controlled CG methylation and DRM1/2/CMT3-controlled non-CG methylation. MET1 was therefore expected to regulate <italic>RPS</italic>-specific CG methylation only, which did actually drop from 89 to 11% in <italic>met1</italic>. However, CNG methylation was also reduced from 76% to 3.8% and CNN methylation decreased from 33% to 0.6%. There are a few reports indicating that MET1 is important for the maintenance of CNG methylation at other loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Rangwala and Richards, 2007</xref>), but these effects are relatively modest compared to the very drastic reduction of <italic>RPS</italic>-specific non-CG methylation in <italic>met1</italic>. Equally surprising, <italic>RPS</italic>-specific hypomethylation in the <italic>drm1 drm2</italic> background was not limited to non-CG targets but also included CG methylation, which decreased from 89 to 2% in <italic>drm1/2</italic> and was completely eliminated in the <italic>drm1/2/cmt3</italic> triple mutant. The presence of MET1 is therefore not sufficient to maintain CG methylation of <italic>RPS</italic>. This contrasts with reports on <italic>FWA</italic>, <italic>MEA-IR</italic> and <italic>SUP</italic>, for which CG methylation remains unaltered in the <italic>drm1/2/cmt3</italic> triple mutant, reflecting the primary importance of MET1 for CG methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Cao and Jacobsen, 2002b</xref>). In line with our observations for RPS, the <italic>drm2</italic> single mutation has been shown to cause a moderate reduction in both CG and CNG methylation at 5S rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Mathieu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The unusual influence of DRM1/2, CMT3, DCL3 and KYP on the maintenance of CG methylation, and the participation of MET1 in maintaining CNG and CNN methylation, make <italic>RPS</italic> a very unusual methylation target. Our results suggest that maintenance of <italic>RPS</italic> methylation requires mutual enforcement of symmetrical and non-symmetrical DNA methylation systems, and that all methylation patterns are significantly reduced or lost if either of the two systems is compromised. This may reflect a cooperative effect whereby MET1, DRM1/2 and CMT3 only gain access to <italic>RPS</italic> jointly, or it may be the result of methylation-sensitive auxiliary factors that guide methyltransferases to <italic>RPS</italic>. The latter model implies that, for example, CG methylation is required for binding of DRM1/2 and CMT3 guiding factors, and non-CG methylation enables binding of the MET1 guiding factors. Loss of CG methylation would then compromise maintenance of non-CG methylation and <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>A DCM-like methylation site is independent of RDM functions</title><p>Although RPS is so far the only target requiring the cooperative activity of MET1, CMT3 and DRM1/2, its special regulation indicates that sequence- or locus-specific factors should be taken into account to understand the composition of DNA methylation patterns. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that CG methylation patterns at certain loci are controlled by DDM1, while CG targets at other loci are independent of DDM1. In addition, some of our results highlight how careful we need to be in interpreting methylation data for individual sites as indicators for a locus. Among the seven CG sites in the analysed <italic>RPS</italic> region, for example, we detected at two sites a 90% reduction of DNA methylation in <italic>rdr2</italic>, but methylation at the other five sites does not change at all. The most significant exception, however, is the conservation of CNG methylation at a CC<sup>m</sup>TGG site in RDM mutant backgrounds. This implies that CC<sup>m</sup>TGG methylation at this site is independent of a small RNA pathway. DRD1 may have a moderate influence on maintenance of CC<sup>m</sup>TGG methylation, probably by facilitating access to the region for regulatory proteins or methyltransferases.</p><p>The presence of a CCWGG methylation system in mammals illustrates the transmission of DCM-like methylation systems into eukaryotes. Initially, CC<sup>m</sup>WGG methylation was interpreted as maintenance of CNG methylation when it was detected in CC<sup>m</sup>WGG-methylated plasmid DNA that had been transferred into the genome of mouse cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Clark <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>). The discovery of CC<sup>m</sup>WGG methylation in retroviral DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Lorincz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>) and in endogenous promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Malone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), however, argues in favour of a <italic>de novo</italic> CC<sup>m</sup>WGG methylation activity in mammals. This is also the most likely explanation for our results. Due to the absence of CC<sup>m</sup>WGG methylation in <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gomez-Eichelmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>), the transferred T-DNA is unmethylated when transferred into the plant genome, and CC<sup>m</sup>TGG methylation is established <italic>de novo</italic> in the transformed plant. CC<sup>m</sup>TGG methylation is significantly reduced or lost in all DNA methyltransferase mutants, which implies that MET1, DRM1/2 and CMT3 either help to recruit an unknown CCTGG methyltransferase to the <italic>RPS</italic> region, or that the CCTGG site is efficiently labelled as a target for methylation, mediated by joint activity of the three methyltransferases.</p><p>Our date demonstrate that, at least for certain loci, DNA methylation patterns cannot exclusively be interpreted as the result of a specific DNA methylation function or pathway. To fully understand the dynamics of DNA maintenance, it will be important to consider target-specific characteristics that influence the accessibility and cooperativity of methyltransferases or their auxiliary factors. This may also contribute to a better understanding of the high levels of methylation polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Vaughn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and locus-specific methylation variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Fischer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Plant material</title><p>All plants were grown under 8 h short-day conditions at 22&#x000b0;C. <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> mutants used in this study and their ecotypes are described in Appendix S1.
