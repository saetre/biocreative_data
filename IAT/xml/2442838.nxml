SRF interacts as a dimer with DNA at the serum response element (SRE), a 10 base pair AT-rich sequence [CC(AT)<sub>6</sub>GG] also known as the CArG box (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). The SRE sequence is present in a wide variety of genes, including those encoding for immediate early proteins (e.g. Fos, Jun, HSP70), neuronal nuclear receptors (e.g. Nurr1, Nur77) and numerous contractile and cytoskeletal proteins (eg. actins, myosins). Expression of SRF is essential in early development as SRF-null embryos die during gastrulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. SRF is required for development of mesoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The expression pattern of genes under SRF control is regulated in a combinatorial fashion by SRF's ability to interact with a variety of accessory factors such as Elk-1 and SAP-1 to regulate expression of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation, and myocardin and related family factors to control myogenic gene expression (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]).</p><p>SRF plays a critical role in myogenesis. Early studies established the expression of SRF in cells of the myogenic lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and SRF has been shown to be required for appropriate skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle cell growth and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. SRF gene knockout studies from our laboratory indicate that disruption of SRF in cardiomyocytes leads to severe defects in the contractile apparatus, including Z-disc and stress fiber formation, as well as mislocalization and/or attenuation of sarcomeric protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Consistent with these observations, <italic>in vivo </italic>cardiovascular-specific knockout of SRF results in embryonic death via cardiovascular failure due to perturbations in normal muscle cytoarchitecture and contractile assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Numerous studies suggest that disordered myogenic gene expression is due to defective SRF-mediated regulation of the smooth muscle cell-specific regulatory factor myocardin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>SRF is a key regulator in development of the coronary vasculature. Coronary vasculature is derived from a transient embryonic structure termed the proepicardium (PE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The PE is characterized as a small, grape cluster-like aggregate of cells developing at embryonic day 9 (E9) from an extension of the septum transversum, lying beneath the developing heart tube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Cells of the PE undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migrate over the surface of the heart. Some cells form the primitive epicardium, and others appear to continue to infiltrate into the subepicardial space. Once dispersed into the heart tissue, these subepicardial mesenchymal cells (SEMC) differentiate into the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and vascular endothelial cells (VEC) that comprise the coronary vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated expression of SRF within cells of the PE and newly formed coronary vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Landerholm and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] have shown that inhibitory SRF constructs block differentiation of avian PE to VSMC, indicating a central role for SRF in differentiation of PE-derived cells to VSMC.</p><p>A role for SRF in differentiation and function of VSMC is well established, however, little is known about the role of SRF in VEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Using primary HUVEC cultures, Chai and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] have shown that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling pathways require SRF. Endothelial cells in which SRF has been knocked down fail to respond to intercellular VEGF signalling and show abolished VEGF-induced <italic>in vitro </italic>angiogenesis, impaired endothelial cell migration and proliferation, and inhibited VEGF-induced actin polymerization and immediate early gene expression.</p><p>These studies indicate that SRF likely plays an important role in endothelial cell function. The <italic>in vivo </italic>role of endothelial SRF, however, has not been addressed. Therefore, in the current study we investigated the role of SRF in VEC function by carrying out endothelial cell-specific ablation of the SRF gene. Mice homozygous for <italic>Srf</italic>-Lox P (<italic>Srf</italic><sup><italic>f</italic>/<italic>f</italic></sup>) alleles were bred to mice expressing the Cre recombinase protein under <italic>Tie2 </italic>promoter control (<italic>Tie2Cre</italic><sup>+/-</sup>). Tie2 is a vascular endothelial-specific tyrosine kinase receptor for the angiopoietin family of vascular remodelling factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The onset of <italic>Tie2Cre </italic>expression is concurrent with the appearance of endothelium in E7.5 embryos and continues in adult tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In embryos expressing the mutant genotype <italic>Tie2Cre</italic><sup>+/-</sup><italic>Srf</italic><sup><italic>f</italic>/<italic>f</italic></sup>, we observed hemorrhaging by E11.5 and near complete lethality by E14.5. Examination of cardiac morphology revealed smaller hearts as well as mild ventricular-septal defects in mutant embryos as compared to wild-type littermates. Immunohistochemical analysis suggests VEC properly differentiated and assembled blood vessels. However, the appearance of blood pools and segmented blood vessels observed in embryos and yolk sacs of E11.5&#x02013;E13.5 embryos indicated disrupted vascular networks consistent with a defect in vascular remodelling. Further analysis of yolk sac tissues by electron microscopy demonstrated a lack of desmosomal-type junction complexes as well as a paucity of collagen matrix between the endodermal and mesodermal cell layers. E-cadherin protein detected by immunofluorescence showed a dramatic decrease in signal along the apical brush-border of endothelial cells in the extraembryonic endodermal layer in yolk sac. These results provide the first <italic>in vivo </italic>evidence in support of a role for SRF in endothelial cell function and strongly suggest SRF is required for appropriate vascular remodelling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Conditional ablation of SRF protein in endothelium causes hemorrhaging in developing embryos</title><p>Inspection of embryos harvested from <italic>Tie2Cre</italic><sup>+/-</sup><italic>Srf</italic><sup><italic>f</italic>/+ </sup>&#x000d7; <italic>Srf</italic><sup><italic>f</italic>/<italic>f </italic></sup>matings revealed internal hemorrhaging and blood pooling consistent with loss of vascular organization (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Mutant embryos appeared to develop normally until E10.5 (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). However, by E11.5 embryos expressing the mutant genotype <italic>Tie2Cre</italic><sup>+/-</sup><italic>Srf</italic><sup><italic>f</italic>/<italic>f </italic></sup>began to exhibit internal hemorrhaging (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, arrowhead). The extent of bleeding continued to progress with embryonic age (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, F</xref>, &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). Wild-type littermates showed intact vascular formation in contrast to mutant embryos (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). Upon closer examination, loss of vascular formation in the mutant embryos becomes more obvious (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

Embryos harvested from timed-pregnant female mice were subjected to fixation for analysis of morphology or for quantification of whole body and isolated heart weights. Hearts of wild-type embryos correctly formed atrial and ventricular chambers, and major vessels of the atrial tree were present (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

Consistent with this, SRF is required for differentiation of PE-derived precursors to VSMC during coronary vascular development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We have previously shown, however, that SRF is expressed in the PE prior to detectable expression of VSMC markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], raising the possibility that SRF may play a role in differentiation of PE-derived coronary VEC as well. To begin to address this idea, we have sought to investigate the role of SRF in endothelial cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, and whether endothelial SRF is required for normal vascular development. Towards that end, we crossed mice expressing Cre recombinase under the VEC-specific <italic>Tie2</italic>-derived promoter with mice carrying floxed <italic>Srf </italic>alleles. Our data demonstrate that SRF plays a crucial role in appropriate VEC function beginning early in embryonic development.</p><p>Mutant embryos lacking SRF expression in VEC die by E14.5. Examination of heart structure reveals that hearts of <italic>Tie2Cre</italic><sup>+/-</sup><italic>Srf</italic><sup><italic>f</italic>/<italic>f </italic></sup>embryos undergo looping and chamber formation; however, hearts of mutant embryos are measurably smaller with increasing gestational age compared to wild-type littermates. We did not detect a difference in the percentage of cardiomyocytes in heart tissue between wild-type and mutant embryos despite noting a small decrease in cardiomyocyte proliferation. Analysis of apoptotic activity by cleaved caspase 3 immunoreactivity also showed no discernible difference between wild-type and mutant embryos. Based on the well-documented specificity of the <italic>Tie2Cre </italic>driver, it is unlikely that the small decrease in cardiomyocyte proliferation observed is due to direct Cre-mediated excision of the <italic>Srf </italic>allele in cardiomyocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. One possible explanation for the reduction in cardiomyocyte proliferation in mutant embryos is that there is a defect in signalling to cardiomyocytes. In support of this idea, a variety of studies have demonstrated the importance of reciprocal signalling pathways between endocardial endothelial cells and the developing myocardium (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]). This raises the possibility that impaired signalling from SRF-null endocardial endothelial cells is contributing to reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation and the overall decrease in heart size observed in <italic>Tie2Cre</italic><sup>+/-</sup><italic>Srf</italic><sup><italic>f</italic>/<italic>f </italic></sup>embryos. The apparent reduction in endocardial cell proliferation we observed in mutant embryos further suggests that loss of SRF in endothelial cells results in impaired endocardial endothelial cell function; however, which endothelial signalling pathways are impaired in SRF-null cells remains to be determined.</p><p>Endocardial cushion tissues are present; however, septal tissues appear poorly formed in mutant embryos, and in some cases exhibit a failure to form ventricular septa. Nevertheless, <italic>in utero </italic>lethality lacking gross defects in heart structure supports the idea of vascular failure as a cause of death. Lethal vessel malfunction may be occurring within the atrial tree, embryonic or extra-embryonic vasculature, or yolk sac vasculature. Consistent with this, mutant embryos exhibit hemorrhaging within the head, abdomen, and limbs as early as E12.5, a time when blood vessel remodelling is occurring. Yolk sac vasculature is also disrupted, suggesting a common mechanism of vessel malfunction in both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues.</p><p>Initial vessel formation in the heart begins at approximately E11.5 and is completed with establishment of mature coronary arteries by E16.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Early coronary vasculogenesis appears to occur normally in embryos lacking SRF in VEC as shown by the presence of PECAM-1-positive vessels in hearts from both wild-type and mutant E12.5 embryos. Nevertheless, mutant embryos die by E14.5, leaving the issue of SRF's role in coronary vasculature remodelling and maturation unclear. Determining the precise requirement for SRF in VEC specification is also complex since the <italic>Tie2Cre </italic>construct begins expression presumably after hemangioblast specification. Examination of blood smears from E12.5 embryos reveals no grossly observable differences between wild-type and mutant samples (data not shown). This may suggest that early VEC progenitors in the yolk sac are not influenced by excision of the <italic>Srf </italic>gene; however since the SRF protein has a relatively long half-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], we cannot rule out the possibility that residual SRF protein levels remain sufficient to sustain specification and differentiation of early VEC. These questions are better suited to investigation using <italic>in vitro </italic>model systems of VEC specification and differentiation, and are the object of ongoing studies.</p><p>While it is evident that SRF protein levels are reduced in VEC of mutant embryos, detectable SRF protein in both wild-type and <italic>Tie2Cre</italic><sup>+/-</sup><italic>Srf</italic><sup><italic>f</italic>/<italic>f </italic></sup>embryos suggests a significant degree of mosaicism. Also, the stringency of our method for quantitation of SRF protein in VEC may result in an underestimation of the number of cells displaying detectable SRF protein. We have observed varying degrees of <italic>Srf</italic>-floxed allele excision efficiency based on the Cre recombinase driver, as well as possible variability from cell to cell. This results in a mosaic expression pattern between individual cells; however, the phenotypic effects of the excision still manifest in the tissue as a whole. Nevertheless, it is likely that more complete ablation may result in a more severe phenotype.</p><p>Yolk sac vascular networks undergo extensive remodelling during the course of embryogenesis. In our study, yolk sac vascular networks appear to form normally, echoing what was observed in initial coronary vessel development. However, yolk sac vascular networks became severely disrupted by E12.5, indicating a failure of the blood vessels to remodel and mature. Disintegration of yolk sac vasculature was accompanied by separation of endodermal and mesodermal cell layers. Further analysis revealed a lack of desmosomal junctions and intralaminar collagen as well as dramatic loss of E-cadherin in cells of the endodermal layer. Anchoring-type desmosomal junctions are plentiful in tissues subject to persistent mechanical stress, such as yolk sac, skin, and heart. Proper junction formation relies on appropriate expression of cytoskeletal and cell surface anchoring proteins such as actins, cadherins, and integrins. Recent work in our laboratory has shown that SRF-null cardiomyocytes have decreased levels of a number of genes associated with cell adhesion and cytoskeletal function including integrins &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;9, tight junction protein ZO-1, and protocadherins 7 and 18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], raising the possibility that the same genes may be affected in SRF-null endothelial cells, resulting in deficient cell-cell contacts.</p><p>Previous research has shown cadherins are also required for pericyte-endothelial interactions during angiogenic sprouting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, VE-cadherin, a major component of adherens junctions between endothelial cells, has been shown to promote angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Consistent with these findings, putative SRF-binding sites have been identified in the VE-cadherin-2/protocadherin12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], integrin-&#x003b2;1, integrin-&#x003b2;1 binding protein 2, protocadherin7 and protocadherin18 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These observations suggest the involvement of SRF in regulation of cell-cell contacts; however as of yet, no experimental studies have addressed whether SRF is a significant player in these interactions, or whether SRF is a regulator of these genes in VEC.</p><p>Our results also raise the possibility that SRF may play a role in periendothelial cell/pericyte recruitment and vessel stabilization via involvement in angiopoietin (Ang) signalling. PECAM staining of yolk sac from Ang1-null mice shows a loss of vascular integrity similar to that seen in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Ang1, a member of the angiopoietin family of ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], activates the Tie2 receptor by binding to it and inducing its tyrosine phosphorylation. Ang1 is generated by non-endothelial cells, such as VSMC and other vascular pericytes recruited to vessels. Early in development between E9 to E11, Ang1 is found most prominently in the heart myocardium surrounding the endocardium. Later, it becomes more widely distributed, most often detected in the mesenchyme surrounding developing vessels and in close association with endothelial cells. Ang1-dependent vessel stabilization occurs by supporting reciprocal interactions between the vascular endothelium, pericytes, and surrounding extracellular matrix and mesenchyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Tie2 mediates Ang1 signalling via several known signalling pathways, including the Akt, RhoA/Rac1, MAPK, and ERK1/2 pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Since SRF is a known mediator of all these pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], this suggests that a role for SRF in Tie-2 mediated angiogenic remodelling may also lie as a downstream effector in the Ang1/2 signalling cascade in endothelial cells.</p><p>The results presented here unequivocally establish SRF as a critical regulator of endothelial cell function <italic>in vivo </italic>and indicate that appropriate SRF protein expression is required for remodelling of vascular networks. However, these results do not directly address the role of SRF in endothelial specification and differentiation since the <italic>Tie2Cre </italic>construct is expressed in differentiated endothelial cells. Our results suggest that disruption of anchoring-type proteins may play a significant role in the observed vascular failure, although the precise underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be addressed. Development of reagents that allow functional analyses of SRF loss of in endothelial precursors as well as vessel maturation will be required to more fully address these questions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study provides the first <italic>in vivo </italic>experimental evidence of a role for SRF in VEC function during embryonic development.

Amnionic membrane was reserved for genotypic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Histology, Immunohistochemistry, and Microscopy</title><p>Embryos were harvested from timed pregnant females, photographed, and then fixed in either 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS or Tris-buffered zinc fixative (0.1 M Tris pH7.4 with 3.2 mM calcium acetate, 22.8 mM zinc acetate, and 36.7 mM zinc chloride). Yolk sac tissues selected for whole mount immunostaining were processed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. After staining, tissues were photographed and further processed for paraffin-embedding. All other samples were processed for paraffin-embedding, and subsequent sections (7 &#x003bc;m) were used for either hematoxylin &#x00026; eosin staining, alcian blue staining, immunohistochemistry or confocal microscopy as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Reagents utilized were: anti-E-cadherin (BD Bioscience, clone 36); anti-sarcomeric myosin (University of Iowa Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, clone MF-20); anti-PECAM-1 (BD Biosciences, clone MEC13.3); anti-phospho-Histone H3 (Millipore, Ser-10); anti-SRF (ProteinTech custom). Digital image capture was performed using a Nikon SM2100 microscope with a Nikon CoolPix995 camera (whole mount), Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope with a SpotII digital camera (tissue sections), or a Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope imaging system (confocal imaging). For electron microscopy, embryos were harvested from timed pregnant females and fixed in glutaraldehyde/sodium arsenate buffer. Subsequent processing and image collection were performed by the Electron Microscopy Core Facility at the Medical College of Wisconsin.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MLH and RPM contributed equally to this project.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>Additional file 1</title><p><bold>Mitotic marker phospho Histone H3 appears decreased in <italic>Tie2Cre</italic><sup>+/-</sup><italic>Srf</italic><sup><italic>f/f </italic></sup>endocardial endothelial cells compared to wild-type littermates</bold>.

Decreased myocardial mass is likely a secondary effect of inadequate signalling from SRF-null endocardial endothelial cells rather than Cre-mediated direct excision of SRF in cardiomyocytes. Also, consistent with previous reports (Nelson et al., <italic>Circ. Res. </italic>2004), presumed epicardium is negative for PECAM-1 staining in both wild-type and mutant embryos (asterisks).
