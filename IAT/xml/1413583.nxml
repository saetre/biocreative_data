Resolution of dimers to monomers requires the action of the XerCD site-specific recombinase at <italic>dif</italic> in the chromosome replication terminus region. This reaction requires the DNA translocase, FtsK<sub>C</sub>, which activates dimer resolution by catalysing an ATP hydrolysis-dependent switch in the catalytic state of the nucleoprotein recombination complex. We show that a 62-amino-acid fragment of FtsK<sub>C</sub> interacts directly with the XerD C-terminus in order to stimulate the cleavage by XerD of BSN, a dif-DNA suicide substrate containing a nick in the &#x02018;bottom&#x02019; strand. The resulting recombinase&#x02013;DNA covalent complex can undergo strand exchange with intact duplex <italic>dif</italic> in the absence of ATP. FtsK<sub>C</sub>-mediated stimulation of BSN cleavage by XerD requires synaptic complex formation. Mutational impairment of the XerD&#x02013;FtsK<sub>C</sub> interaction leads to reduction in the <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation of BSN cleavage by XerD and a concomitant deficiency in the resolution of chromosomal dimers at <italic>dif in vivo</italic>, although other XerD functions are not affected.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>After termination of bacterial chromosome replication, the two sister chromosomes need to be physically separated before segregation can be completed. Two potential impediments to such separation are catenation of the two monomeric sister chromosomes and circular chromosome dimer formation by crossing over during homologous recombination (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Espeli and Marians, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Barre and Sherratt, 2005</xref>). Topoisomerase action is required for decatenation, while XerCD site-specific recombination at the recombination site <italic>dif</italic>, located in the <italic>ter</italic> region converts bacterial chromosome dimers to monomers. FtsK, a 1329-amino-acid integral membrane protein that localizes to the FtsZ ring, functions directly in dimer resolution and facilitates decatenation by topoisomerase IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Espeli <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). In addition, FtsK may contribute directly to decatenation during XerCD recombination at <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Ip <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). The 179-amino-acid N-terminal membrane domain of FtsK is required for cytokinesis, while the &#x0223c;500-amino-acid C-terminal domain (FtsK<sub>C</sub>) is a DNA translocase that functions in chromosome segregation and dimer resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Draper <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Yu <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aussel <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Therefore, FtsK links chromosome segregation with cell division via its C- and N-terminal domains. The DNA sequence-directed translocation activity of FtsK<sub>C</sub> promotes synapsis of <italic>dif</italic> sites in the vicinity of the septum before recombination activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">P&#x000e9;rals <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bigot <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Barre and Sherratt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Pease <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). FtsK<sub>C</sub> action may also facilitate chromosome segregation by organizing newly replicated <italic>ter</italic> regions at midcell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Lesterlin <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).</p><p>It has been proposed previously that FtsK<sub>C</sub> activates XerCD recombination at <italic>dif</italic> by catalysing an ATP-dependent switch in the conformation of XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic> nucleoprotein complex, thereby allowing XerD to initiate recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aussel <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>). Here we dissect the activation process by showing that a biochemically active form of FtsK<sub>C</sub>, FtsK<sub>50C</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aussel <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>), can stimulate cleavage by XerD of a <italic>dif</italic>-DNA suicide substrate, BSN, containing a nick in the &#x02018;bottom&#x02019; strand. This occurs only in synaptic complexes containing two BSN DNA fragments. Furthermore, we show that interaction between a 62-amino-acid non-motor subdomain of FtsK<sub>C</sub> and the C-terminus of XerD is required for stimulation of BSN cleavage. This stimulation can also lead to intermolecular recombination between BSN and intact linear <italic>dif</italic> duplex in the absence of ATP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>FtsK<sub>50C</sub> stimulates XerD-mediated cleavage of BSN DNA</title><p>Previous work has demonstrated that FtsK<sub>50C</sub>-dependent activation of a complete Xer recombination reaction at <italic>dif</italic> requires ATP hydrolysis by FtsK<sub>50C</sub> and a DNA extension adjacent to the XerD binding site on at least one of the two participating <italic>dif</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aussel <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Massey <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). This reaction requires a specific interaction between FtsK<sub>50C</sub> and the XerCD recombinase that leads to an ATP hydrolysis-dependent switch in the catalytic state of the recombination complex, so that recombination is initiated by XerD to give a Holliday junction (HJ) intermediate that is resolved to complete recombinant product by XerC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aussel <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Yates <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In order to dissect the molecular basis of this activation mechanism, we designed experiments to test whether FtsK<sub>50C</sub>, or parts of it, could activate the initial chemical step of the recombination reaction, cleavage of DNA by XerCD to form a recombinase&#x02013;DNA covalent complex. Short DNA substrates containing the 28 bp <italic>dif</italic> site with a nick in either of the two strands at the centre of the <italic>dif</italic> site can be used to monitor recombinase-mediated DNA cleavage, as after cleavage a trinucleotide can diffuse away, or the DNA can dissociate into two fragments, thereby capturing the covalent complex between the recombinase and <italic>dif</italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Nunes-D&#x000fc;by <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Blakely <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>FtsK<sub>50C</sub> stimulates XerD-mediated cleavage of BSN. <list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>Schematic of XerCD-mediated cleavages of nicked suicide substrates, BSN and TSN.

Addition of a 200 bp extension to the XerD binding side of BSN generated BSNe, whose cleavage by XerD was stimulated by FtsK<sub>50C</sub> to a comparable extent as BSN. We conclude that activation of BSN cleavage by XerD does not require the loading of FtsK<sub>50C</sub> onto duplex DNA, as the 13 bp flank adjacent to the XerD binding site of BSN is insufficient to facilitate FtsK<sub>50C</sub> loading onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Massey <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>).</p><p>There was no stimulation of XerC-mediated cleavage by FtsK<sub>50C</sub> on these substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>), consistent with our demonstration that FtsK<sub>50C</sub> activates XerD in a complete XerCD <italic>dif</italic> intermolecular recombination reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Aussel <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).

Incubation of the two DNA substrates with XerCD and FtsK<sub>50C</sub> in the absence of ATP generated, in addition to the expected recombinase&#x02013;BSN covalent complexes, a spectrum of novel radiolabelled DNA species, most of which were dependent on FtsK<sub>50C</sub>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A and B</xref>).

Therefore, intermolecular complexes can form and react efficiently under the reaction conditions used. Assuming that the FtsK<sub>50C</sub>-dependent products arise from reactions initiated by XerD, HJ-D, which has a 3 nt gap, must have arisen from two XerD-mediated cleavages, one of which is accompanied by strand exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Nicked HJs, which are present in low amount only at later times, could result from two completed strand exchanges by XerD; this is expected to occur inefficiently as it would require that the 3 nt oligonucleotide be retained in the recombining complex. Both HJ-D and HJ can be processed by a pair of XerC-mediated strand exchanges, generating linear recombinant products, LP-D and LP respectively. We imagine that it is easier for XerC strand exchanges to occur on HJ than on HJ-D. Formally, LP-D could also arise from XerD-mediated cleavage of linear nicked recombinant product (LP), although this is unlikely because LP-D accumulates before LP. Gapped LP or HJ could also arise from LP-D or HJ-D by phosphotyrosine hydrolysis.</p><p>Although the data on the relative amounts of reactions products and the kinetics of their production and turnover support the hypothesis that all of the observed FtsK<sub>C</sub>-dependent products arise from reactions that were initiated by XerD, we cannot yet formally prove that this is the case. Nevertheless, we note that if strand exchange by XerC precedes XerD in reactions with synapsed duplexes, it would generate labelled intermediates [nicked HJ (HJ) and XerC covalently linked to a three-armed junction (HJ-C)]. Consistent with this, HJ and HJ-C are the two FtsK<sub>C</sub>-independent products resulting from strand exchange between BSN and 197<italic>dif</italic>200 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>, left). We expect these reactions to be initiated by XerC. Although these initial products might be acted on by XerD to produce BSN-D, HJ-D, LP-D and LP in the presence of FtsK<sub>50C</sub>, we believe this unlikely because the reaction kinetics of intermolecular product formation show that the products of XerD-mediated cleavage and strand exchange appear before any that could be produced by XerC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>, right). Furthermore, the kinetics of HJ-C and HJ appearance and turnover are not readily compatible with them being processed by XerD. Indeed, <italic>dif</italic> HJ intermediates made by XerC do not show significant resolution by XerD under any conditions tested and we have never been able to show stimulation of XerD activity by FtsK<sub>C</sub> on HJ intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arciszewska <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Massey <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). In contrast, intact or nicked <italic>dif</italic> HJs are excellent substrates for resolution by XerC (not shown).</p><p>These results on FtsK<sub>50C</sub>-dependent intermolecular recombination support the view that the stimulation of XerD-mediated cleavage of BSN by FtsK<sub>50C</sub> represents a reaction that is functionally relevant. Also consistent with this conclusion is the observation that FtsK<sub>50C</sub>-dependent stimulation of BSN cleavage requires the presence of both XerC and XerD (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>FtsK<sub>50C</sub>-mediated stimulation of BSN cleavage by XerD occurs in synaptic complexes</title><p>The results above, which show that intermolecular complexes containing two duplexes form and react quickly, are consistent with the idea that the FtsK<sub>50C</sub>-dependent stimulation of BSN cleavage by XerD requires synaptic complex formation. In order to test this hypothesis, we first determined whether FtsK<sub>50C</sub>-independent cleavage of BSN by XerC and XerD is synapsis-dependent, by assaying cleavage reaction efficiency on TSN and BSN as a function of DNA concentration. In all of the experiments, a constant level of radiolabelled BSN or TSN was mixed with unlabelled BSN or TSN in varying amounts before reaction with the indicated proteins. The 3 min, 15 min and 60 min reactions were analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> and not shown). If cleavage of labelled BSN or TSN is synapsis-independent, its efficiency (measured by initial rate) will not vary as a function of concentration of unlabelled <italic>dif</italic> substrate (at saturating protein concentrations). In contrast, if stimulation is synapsis-dependent, the efficiency will increase as a function of DNA concentration. The results were unambiguous with substrate TSN; cleavage by XerC is synapsis-dependent, the level of cleavage increasing as DNA concentration increases from 5 to 45 nM. In contrast, cleavage by XerD on this substrate does not increase as intermolecular reaction between two duplexes increases and therefore is synapsis-independent. The complementary result was obtained with BSN; cleavage by XerD is synapsis-dependent, while cleavage by XerC is synapsis-independent (not shown). Consistent with the synapsis-independent cleavage of BSN by XerC, we observed that high concentrations of XerC alone can cleave BSN; we would not expect that XerC alone can mediate synaptic complex formation. We note that in Cre&#x02013;<italic>loxP</italic> recombination, the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> for synapsis is &#x0223c;10 nM; our results are consistent with the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> for XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic> synapsis being of a similar order. If this is the case, at the high DNA and protein concentrations we use, much of the radiolabelled DNA will be in synaptic complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Ghosh <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Synapsis-dependent and -independent reactions.

Reactions were analysed by SDS-PAGE after 3 min, 15 min and 60 min reactions, with essentially the same overall results, although some of the 3 min reactions had very low levels of cleavage for one or the other recombinases. The 15 min (TSN) and 60 min (BSN) reactions are shown. The concentration dependence of the FtsK<sub>C</sub>-stimulated cleavage of BSN by XerD was essentially identical to BSN-D cleavage alone (the difference between the two BSN-D curves). FtsK<sub>50C</sub> had no effect on the TSN reactions or on cleavage of BSN by XerC (not shown).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi_5033_f4"/></fig><p>Next, we tested whether the FtsK<sub>50C</sub>-stimulated cleavage of BSN by XerD is synapsis-dependent. Again the result was unequivocal; the stimulated cleavage like all catalysis by XerD on BSN is synapsis-dependent, with the concentration dependence being identical to that of cleavage of BSN by XerD in the absence of FtsK<sub>50C</sub>. This result provides a possible explanation of why FtsK<sub>50C</sub> fails to stimulate cleavage by XerD on TSN. The stimulation by FtsK<sub>50C</sub> requires formation of synaptic complexes that are in the XerD-active configuration; TSN cleavage by XerD is synapsis-independent. Also consistent with the synapsis-dependent cleavage of BSN by XerD is the observation that XerD alone can cleave BSN (not shown). This cleavage is not stimulated by FtsK<sub>50C</sub>, thereby reinforcing the view that FtsK<sub>50C</sub>-stimulated cleavage by XerD requires synaptic complex formation, as XerD alone is unlikely to mediate synapsis between two BSN fragments. Finally, FtsK<sub>50C</sub> failed to stimulate cleavage of BSN by XerD in the presence of XerC[Y275F], which is mutated for the catalytic tyrosine (not shown); the equivalent mutants of Cre are synapsis-defective (G.D. Van Duyne, pers. comm.).</p><p>The demonstration that cleavage of BSN by XerD, in the presence of XerC, is synapsis-dependent reinforces the view that all FtsK<sub>C</sub>-mediated effects on XerCD recombination are mediated by promoting the formation of heterotetrameric synaptic complexes that have a conformation appropriate for catalysis by XerD (later). Furthermore, our observation with TSN and BSN that catalysis by one recombinase is synapsis-dependent and the other independent (with a switch in which recombinase requires synapsis as one goes from TSN to BSN) is reminiscent of the demonstration that in Cre&#x02013;<italic>loxP</italic> recombination, &#x02018;bottom strand&#x02019; cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic> requires synapsis, while &#x02018;top strand&#x02019; cleavage is synapsis-independent, although in these latter experiments duplexes with a bridging phosphorothioate were used rather than nicked duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Ghosh <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).

In this conformation, XerC is active as a consequence of its C-terminal donor region interacting within the acceptor region of an XerD molecule bound to the same duplex; this positions the catalytic tyrosine of the active XerC molecule adjacent to the scissile phosphate (view from the C-terminal side of the complex). The switch from the &#x02018;XerC-active&#x02019; to the &#x02018;XerD-active&#x02019; configuration in a heterotetramer requires either dissolution of all recombinase&#x02013;recombinase interactions and reformation of new interactions that lead to an altered DNA conformation, or dissociation of each DNA duplex from one of its recombinase binding sites and reformation of a complex with altered DNA paths. The action of FtsK<sub>C</sub> could be through pathway a, in which it directs the formation of the XerD-active state on duplex, and/or through pathway b, where the heterotetramer is the substrate for FtsK<sub>C</sub> action.</p></list-item></list></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mmi_5033_f8"/></fig><p>In order to gain some insight into where the possible determinants of interaction with XerD are located in &#x003b3;2, we made comparison of the &#x003b3;2 regions from <italic>Ec</italic> and <italic>Hi</italic> FtsK<sub>C</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8B</xref>).

In particular, we have characterized the specific interaction that leads to activation of the XerD recombinase. The recognition between a small region of the FtsK<sub>C</sub>&#x003b3; subdomain and a region close to the C-terminus of XerD is necessary for the stimulation of BSN cleavage by XerD, and for the reaction of such a complex with intact linear <italic>dif</italic> duplex in the absence of ATP binding or hydrolysis. This interaction is functionally relevant because its impairment leads to the <italic>in vivo</italic> loss of XerCD recombination at <italic>dif</italic> and the concomitant loss of chromosomal dimer resolution. As yet we do not know whether this interaction alone is sufficient for FtsK<sub>C</sub> to activate XerD, although all of the determinants for the interaction reside in the 62-amino-acid &#x003b3; subdomain.</p><p>The structures of a whole range of intermediates in Cre&#x02013;<italic>loxP</italic> recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Gopaul and Van Duyne, 1999</xref>) provide a paradigm that can be applied to FtsK<sub>C</sub>-dependent XerCD recombination at <italic>dif</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8D</xref>). In this paradigm, the heterotetrameric synaptic complex can adopt one of two configurations, &#x02018;XerC-active&#x02019; (bottom), or &#x02018;XerD-active&#x02019; (right). The active recombinase has its C-terminal &#x02018;donor&#x02019; region engaged into a specific &#x02018;acceptor&#x02019; region of its partner recombinase bound to the same duplex. This positions the catalytic tyrosine of the active recombinase close to the scissile DNA phosphodiester. Donor&#x02013;acceptor interactions between recombinases bound to the different duplexes participate in synapsis. In the absence of FtsK<sub>C</sub>, the XerCD&#x02013;<italic>dif</italic> heterotetrameric complex preferentially adopts the &#x02018;XerC-active&#x02019; conformation when the duplex DNA is intact. In order for the &#x02018;XerD-active&#x02019; configuration to be adopted, FtsK<sub>C</sub> must convert a &#x02018;XerC-active&#x02019; heterotetramer to the &#x02018;XerD-active&#x02019; heterotetramer through a remodelling reaction (pathway b), and/or stimulate the formation of the &#x02018;XerD-active&#x02019; state on duplex (pathway a), two such duplexes forming a &#x02018;XerD-active&#x02019; heterotetramer. The latter pathway could occur before synapsis or after a &#x02018;XerC-active&#x02019; synaptic complex has been dissociated by FtsK<sub>C</sub> action. In either scenario, we propose that the specific interaction of FtsK<sub>C</sub> with XerD identified here promotes formation of the &#x02018;XerD-active&#x02019; state. Formally, this could be achieved by compromising the interaction that leads to XerC being active in the absence of FtsK<sub>C</sub> and/or facilitating the interaction that makes XerD active. Our data are most easily accommodated in a model in which the interaction of the C-terminus of XerD with an acceptor region in XerC is facilitated, as the C-terminal region of XerD, identified as being necessary for the interaction with FtsK<sub>C</sub>, is more likely to comprise part of the putative XerD donor region than the XerD acceptor region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hallet <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Because of the expected intimate association of XerD with XerC in a synaptic complex, it is not impossible that FtsK<sub>C</sub> might additionally interact, although weakly, with XerC during the formation of the &#x02018;XerD-active&#x02019; state. Examination of the Cre&#x02013;<italic>loxP</italic> structures suggests that a recombinase C-terminal donor region docked with the acceptor region of a partner recombinase would have the potential to interact with a surface-located peptide ligand present in the &#x003b3; subdomain.</p><p>The ability of FtsK<sub>C</sub> derivatives to stimulate the formation of an &#x02018;XerD-active&#x02019; synaptic complex on BSN is facilitated by the bottom strand nick present in BSN, which allows formation of some &#x02018;XerD-active&#x02019; heterotetrameric state in the absence of FtsK<sub>C</sub>. Presumably DNA flexibility arising from the nick allows the &#x02018;XerD-active&#x02019; conformation to form, thereby relieving the requirement for ATP-dependent remodelling by FtsK<sub>C</sub>. We do not know whether FtsK<sub>C</sub>, in addition, stimulates catalysis by XerD once the &#x02018;XerD-active&#x02019; synaptic complex has formed; we have no evidence to support the existence of such a second step.</p><p>The conversion of an &#x02018;XerC-active&#x02019; heterotetramic complex, which forms readily in the absence of FtsK<sub>C</sub>, to an &#x02018;XerD-active&#x02019; complex requires either the dissolution of all initial recombinase&#x02013;recombinase interactions and the creation of new ones, or a switch in the path of DNA in the synaptic complex that would require recombinase&#x02013;DNA interactions be broken and re-made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8D</xref>). Whether this would require a complete dissociation of the heterotetrameric complex into two separated duplexes is unclear. We imagine that when the FtsK<sub>C</sub>&#x003b3; subdomain fragment interacts with XerD bound to BSN, a single &#x003b3; determinant interacts with a single XerD molecule, although we do not yet know whether both XerD molecules in a heterotetrameric BSN complex need to undergo such interactions for stimulation of cleavage by XerD. With wild-type multimeric FtsK, multiple &#x003b3; subdomains are potentially available for binding to the recombinases.</p><p>Future experiments need to address precisely how interaction of FtsK<sub>C</sub> with XerCD leads to recombination activation in a two-duplex heterotetrameric complex, how DNA sequence-directed FtsK<sub>C</sub> translocation facilitates the simple synapsis of distant <italic>dif</italic> sites, and how FtsK<sub>C</sub> switches from being a DNA translocase to a nucleoprotein remodelling machine once it encounters XerCD bound to <italic>dif</italic>-DNA.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains</title><p><italic>In vivo</italic> assays of XerCD and FtsK<sub>C</sub> function were carried out in <italic>Ec</italic> AB1157 derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bachmann, 1972</xref>).

Short linear or nicked, <italic>dif</italic>-containing, DNA fragments were produced by annealing appropriate oligonucleotides, followed by purification by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The longest strand was <sup>32</sup>P-labelled at the 5&#x02032; end before annealing. BSNe was constructed by ligating a 200 bp fragment to BSN; its radiolabel was at the same position as that in BSN.</p><p>Recombination reactions were carried out in 10 &#x000b5;l of reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and contained 0.5 mg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BSA, 60 mM NaCl and 8% glycerol, 2.5 mM ATP, 2 nM labelled DNA, 2 nM unlabelled DNA, 500 nM XerC, 250 nM XerD, 500 nM FtsK<sub>50C</sub> or 1&#x02013;5 &#x000b5;M MBP-FtsK&#x003b3; derivatives.

Poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) was added to a final concentration of 125 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and sufficient XerCD and FtsK<sub>50C</sub> were added to ensure saturation at the highest DNA concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Physical interaction assay</title><p>His-tagged proteins were loaded and immobilized on cobalt chelated affinity agarose (Pierce) in 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl and 40 mM imidazole. After series of washes to remove any unbound His-tagged protein, the untagged protein of interest was loaded. Proteins that were not retained due to physical interaction with His-tagged protein were removed in the subsequent washing steps. Interaction was assessed on 0.1% SDS-10% PAGE gels following a selective co-elution of the interacting proteins by 300 mM or 400 mM imidazole.
