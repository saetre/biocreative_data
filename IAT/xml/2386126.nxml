Chorismate synthase (CS) is the seventh enzyme of this route and catalyzes the NADH- and FMN-dependent synthesis of chorismate, a precursor of aromatic amino acids, naphthoquinones, menaquinones, and mycobactins.

The bifunctionality of <italic>Mt</italic>CS was determined by measurements of both chorismate synthase and NADH:FMN oxidoreductase activities.

Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects show that C<sub>4</sub>-<italic>proS </italic>hydrogen is being transferred during the reduction of FMN<sub>ox </sub>by NADH and that hydride transfer contributes significantly to the rate-limiting step of FMN reduction reaction. Solvent kinetic isotope effects and proton inventory results indicate that proton transfer from solvent partially limits the rate of FMN reduction and that a single proton transfer gives rise to the observed solvent isotope effect. Multiple isotope effects suggest a stepwise mechanism for the reduction of FMN<sub>ox</sub>.

Its causative agent, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, has been estimated to infect approximately one-third of the world's population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and approximately 30 million people have died from the disease in the past decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The World Health Organization estimated a total of 9 million new cases of TB and approximately 2 million deaths from this disease in 2004, second only to AIDS among infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The emergence of drug resistant isolates of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, particularly of multi drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), defined as resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], imposes a great challenge to public health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Treatment of MDR-TB requires the administration of second-line drugs that are more toxic and less effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. More recently, it was reported cases of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB, which are defined as cases in persons with TB whose isolates were resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin and at least three of the six main classes of second-line drugs (aminoglycosides, polypeptides, fluoroquinolones, thioamides, cycloserine, and <italic>para</italic>-aminosalicylic acid) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. XDR-TB has a wide geographic distribution and it raises the bleak prospect of a future epidemic of virtually untreatable TB. New antimycobacterial agents are thus needed to improve the treatment of MDR- and XDR-TB, to shorten the treatment course and increase patient compliance, and to provide more effective treatment of latent TB infection.</p><p>A valuable approach to the development of selective antimicrobial chemotherapy is to exploit the inhibition of targets unique and vital to the pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The enzymes of the shikimate pathway are attractive examples of these targets because this route is essential in higher plants, fungi, bacteria and algae and is absent in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the shikimate pathway leads to the biosynthesis of a wide range of primary and secondary metabolites, including aromatic amino acids, folate, naphthoquinones, menaquinones and mycobactins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Disruption of <italic>aroK</italic>-encoding shikimate kinase gene has recently shown that the shikimate pathway is essential for <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which establishes the enzymes of this pathway as potential targets for the development of new antimycobacterial agents.</p><p>Homologues to the shikimate pathway enzymes were identified in the complete genome sequence of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>H37Rv [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Among them, chorismate synthase (CS; EC 4.2.3.5; 5-<italic>O</italic>-(1-carboxyvinyl)-3-phosphoshikimate phosphate lyase) encoding gene (<italic>aroF</italic>, Rv2540c) was proposed to be present by sequence homology. CS catalyzes an unusual 1,4-<italic>anti</italic>-elimination of the 3-phosphate group and the C-(6<italic>pro</italic>R) hydrogen from 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) forming chorismate and phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although there is no overall change in its redox state, there is an absolute requirement for a reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMN<sub>red</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Another interesting feature of CSs from different organisms is how reduced FMN<sub>red </sub>is obtained, which divides these enzymes into two classes: monofunctional and bifunctional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The CSs from fungi are bifunctional as they display a second enzymatic activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), an NAD(P)H-dependent (dependent of reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) flavin reductase (described as "diaphorase" activity in a number of papers), which confers them an intrinsic ability to reduce flavin using NAD(P)H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The CSs from plants and <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>are monofunctional as they do not possess this activity and are active only in anaerobic conditions in the presence of either chemically or enzymatically reduced flavin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, there has been no report on both confirmation of the correct assignment of Rv2540c (<italic>aroF</italic>) as the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>chorismate synthase (<italic>Mt</italic>CS) coding sequence and functional characterization of its protein product. Moreover, there has been no report on whether <italic>Mt</italic>CS is bifunctional or monofunctional.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Reactions catalysed by bifunctional CSs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-9-13-1"/></fig><p>Here we report the amplification and cloning of Rv2540c DNA sequence (putative <italic>aroF </italic>gene) from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and heterologous overexpression of the <italic>Mt</italic>CS protein. The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity using a three-step purification protocol and its identity was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The oligomeric state of <italic>Mt</italic>CS was determined by gel filtration. We also show that CS from <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>is bifunctional, as in fungi, based on activity measurements of both chorismate synthase and NADH-dependent flavin reductase activities. Moreover, FMN appears to be bound to <italic>Mt</italic>CS based on ionic exchange chromatography, and FMN<sub>ox </sub>(oxidized flavin mononucleotide) and NADH binding to <italic>Mt</italic>CS were assessed by spectroscopic measurements at equilibrium. The apparent kinetic constants for the holoenzyme <italic>Mt</italic>CS-FMN<sub>ox </sub>for NADH were determined. The NADH-dependent flavin reductase activity was characterized by isotope effects. Measurements of primary deuterium and solvent kinetic isotope effects were carried out to probe the nature of the rate-limiting step of the redox reaction. Multiple isotope effects were also determined showing that a stepwise mechanism is involved in this reaction. Proton inventory on the maximal velocity allowed us to address the number of kinetically important transferred protons. The results presented here are important to understand the reaction mechanism of this enzyme, which should pave the way for the rational-based design of <italic>Mt</italic>CS inhibitors with potential antitubercular activity and low toxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Molecular cloning, expression, and purification of <italic>Mt</italic>CS</title><p>PCR amplification of Rv2540c DNA sequence (putative <italic>aroF </italic>gene) from genomic <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>DNA yielded a fragment with the expected length (1206 bp). The fragment was cloned into pET23a(+) expression vector, and the <italic>aroF </italic>gene was sequenced, which confirmed its identity and the absence of PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)-introduced mutations. A number of <italic>E. coli </italic>host strains were employed to express <italic>Mt</italic>CS, including BL21(DE3), Origami(DE3), and BL21<italic>trxB</italic>(DE3), but no expression could be obtained. Different cultivating temperatures (25&#x000b0;, 30&#x000b0; and 37&#x000b0;C) and presence or absence of isopropyl &#x003b2;-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) were also employed to no avail (data not shown). <italic>Mt</italic>CS overexpression could only be achieved in <italic>E. coli </italic>Rosetta(DE3) host cells, which provide tRNAs for codons that are rarely used by <italic>E. coli</italic>. In agreement, ten rare codons were identified on <italic>M. tuberculosis aroF </italic>sequence (7 &#x000d7; CCC, AUA, CUA, GGA). Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis revealed a cell extract containing a significant amount of a soluble protein with an apparent molecular weight in agreement with the predicted value based on amino acid sequence for <italic>Mt</italic>CS (41.8 kDa) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, recombinant protein expression was achieved in <italic>E. coli </italic>Rosetta(DE3) host cells grown for 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C in the absence of IPTG induction. It has been previously shown that the <italic>lac</italic>-controlled systems, including the pET system, could have a high-level protein expression, in the absence of inducer. This phenomenon occurs in the cell stationary phase, when there is the presence of a complex medium, cyclic AMP, acetate and low pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Recently, another shikimate pathway enzyme from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, 3-Deoxy-D-<italic>arabino</italic>-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase, was reported to be expressed only in the absence of IPTG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The three-step purification protocol yielded approximately 55 mg of <italic>Mt</italic>CS from 6 liters of cell culture. No other protein can be observed on SDS-PAGE, which indicates the high level of <italic>Mt</italic>CS purity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The <italic>Mt</italic>CS activity before the purification can hardly be measured, probably due to interfering compounds, and thus only the amount of total recombinant protein could be assessed. The ammonium sulfate precipitation of purified <italic>Mt</italic>CS resulted in total inactivation of the enzyme (data not shown). Homogeneous recombinant protein was thus instantaneously frozen in liquid nitrogen in the absence of ammonium sulfate, which proved to be a convenient protocol for active homogeneous recombinant <italic>Mt</italic>CS protein storage.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Recombinant <italic>Mt</italic>CS protein expression and purification</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Analysis of <italic>Mt</italic>CS expression using <italic>E. coli </italic>Rosetta(DE3) host cells by SDS-poliacrilamide gel 12%.

The first 16 N-terminal amino acid residues were identified as MLRWITAGESHGRALV, which confirmed the identity of homogeneous <italic>Mt</italic>CS and presence of N-terminal methionine residue. Analytical gel filtration chromatography revealed a single peak of approximately 104 kDa, suggesting that <italic>Mt</italic>CS is a dimer in solution, which is in agreement with the hydrodynamic properties of the recombinant protein assessed by sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The CS activity of <italic>Mt</italic>CS</title><p>The synthesis of EPSP was carried out in a vial containing the enzymes <italic>Mt</italic>SK and <italic>Mt</italic>EPSPS, which convert shikimate, ATP and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP), ADP and Pi. The equilibrium of the forward reaction was displaced using Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (PNP), which consumes Pi, increasing the final concentration of EPSP in the reaction mixture. The enzymes were removed by ultrafiltration to avoid any residual <italic>Mt</italic>EPSPS enzyme activity that could release Pi in solution, which would thus interfere with specific measurements of <italic>Mt</italic>CS enzyme activity. Conversion of EPSP to chorismate and Pi catalyzed by <italic>Mt</italic>CS enzyme activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) was determined by measuring the release of Pi using PNP, which converts 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (MESG) and Pi to ribose-1-phosphate and 7-methyl-6-thio-guanine base, monitoring absorbance of the latter at 360 nm. The enzymatic activity of homogenous <italic>Mt</italic>CS was dependent on enzyme volume added to the reaction mixture (data not shown), showing that the initial velocity is proportional to total enzyme concentration and that true initial velocities are being measured. The conversion of EPSP to chorismate in aerobic conditions by the addition of FMN<sub>ox </sub>and NADH is the first solid evidence that <italic>Mt</italic>CS is bifunctional, since the monofunctional CSs can only be assayed under strictly anaerobic conditions in the presence of chemically or enzymatically reduced flavin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The specific activity of bifunctional <italic>Mt</italic>CS (0.004 U.mg<sup>-1</sup>) is approximately 175-fold lower than the specific activity of bifunctional <italic>Neurospora crassa </italic>CS (<italic>Nc</italic>CS; 0.7 U.mg<sup>-1</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the presence of oxygen the CS activity is limited by the reoxidation of FMN<sub>red </sub>cofactor; but in bifunctional CSs, NAD(P)H is used in consecutive cycles to maintain the FMN in its reduced form (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Moreover, the structures of CS complexed with FMN from <italic>Helicobacter pylori </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] have shown that there are a number of positively charged amino acids in the FMN binding pocket, which could increase the reduction potential of FMN<sub>ox</sub>/FMN<sub>red </sub>couple, likely permitting the decrease of the rate of reoxidation. Indeed, in bifunctional <italic>Nc</italic>CS the redox potential of the couple FMN<sub>red</sub>/FMN<sub>ox </sub>was determined to be -167 mV, <italic>i.e</italic>. 40 mV more positive than that of the free couple in solution (-207 mV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The NADH:FMN-oxidoreductase activity of <italic>Mt</italic>CS</title><p>The NADH-dependent reduction of FMN<sub>ox </sub>was measured in the forward reaction monitoring the decrease in NADH concentration. The NADH:FMN-oxidoreductase activity of homogenous <italic>Mt</italic>CS is dependent on the enzyme volume added to the reaction mixture; therefore the initial velocity is proportional to total enzyme concentration, and true initial velocities are being measured. To verify the stability of the <italic>Mt</italic>CS-FMN<sub>ox </sub>complex, <italic>Mt</italic>CS was incubated with excess FMN<sub>ox </sub>and loaded on an anion exchange column. Two peaks were observed and collected into separated fractions measuring absorbance at 280 nm and 445 nm, and pooled (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). To roughly estimate the presence of protein in the two pools, coomassie-blue was added to them and only the second pool was shown to contain protein (indicating presence of recombinant <italic>Mt</italic>CS), while the first was not stained (indicating absence of recombinant <italic>Mt</italic>CS). The UV-Vis spectrum for the second pool containing recombinant <italic>Mt</italic>CS protein showed that all the characteristic absorbance peaks of FMN<sub>ox </sub>(267, 373, and 445 nm) could be observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> inset). These results suggest that <italic>Mt</italic>CS and FMN<sub>ox </sub>form a stable binary complex.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Elution profile of incubated <italic>Mt</italic>CS and FMNox, and UV-Vis spectrum showing stable binary complex formation</bold>.

CSs from other organisms, such as that from <italic>E. coli</italic>, showed low affinity for FMN<sub>ox</sub>; but the value of Kd for FMN<sub>ox </sub>depends strongly on EPSP binding, decreasing ca. 1000-fold in the presence of this substrate (from 30 &#x003bc;M to 20 nM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. On the other hand, EPSP has a much smaller effect on the affinity of bifunctional <italic>Nc</italic>CS to FMN<sub>ox </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, the purified <italic>Mt</italic>CS is FMN-free, which could be an effect of the insufficient intracellular concentration of FMN, probably due to <italic>Mt</italic>CS overexpression into the host cell. As described below, FMN appears to have a value lower than 20 &#x003bc;M for the overall dissociation constant for <italic>Mt</italic>CS-FMN binary complex formation at equilibrium. Accordingly, it appears to be more likely that FMN is lost during the protein purification protocol because of a rather weak affinity of <italic>Mt</italic>CS for FMN. Accordingly, the kinetic data were collected considering the holoenzyme as the <italic>Mt</italic>CS-FMN<sub>ox </sub>complex brought about by incubating <italic>Mt</italic>CS and near-saturating FMN<sub>ox </sub>concentration.</p><p>The oxidoreductase activity is functionally independent of CS activity, since the consumption of NADH occurs in the absence of EPSP. Considering the low specific activity of NADH:FMN-oxidoreductase in <italic>Mt</italic>CS, all measurements were made in triplicate, including the controls. Accordingly, the apparent kinetic parameters for the oxidoreductase activity were determined in the absence of EPSP in steady-state kinetic experiments. No activity was observed when NADPH was used at concentrations ranging from 100 to 500 &#x003bc;M (data not shown).

This enzyme catalyses the cleavage of MESG by the inorganic phosphate molecule which is released by <italic>Mt</italic>CS, and formation of 2-amine-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine is monitored at 360 nm (&#x003b5; = 11.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup>M<sup>-1 </sup>cm<sup>-1</sup>). The assay was performed at 25&#x000b0;C and monitored using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer.

The mixture was injected into a HiTrapQ HP anion exchange column previously equilibrated with buffer A. The sample was eluted with a linear gradient from 0.0 to 1 M NaCl. Absorption spectrum of the pool of fractions containing FMN<sub>ox </sub>and <italic>Mt</italic>CS was measured at wavelengths values ranging from 210 to 600 nm by a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer.</p></sec><sec><title>FMN<sub>ox </sub>and NADH binding to <italic>Mt</italic>CS measured by, respectively, spectrophotometry and spectrofluorimetry</title><p>The binding of FMN<sub>ox </sub>to <italic>Mt</italic>CS (35 &#x003bc;M) was assessed as described by Kitzing et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. UV-visible difference absorbance spectra were monitored at 25&#x000b0;C in a double beam spectrophotometer UV-2550 (Shimadzu) with photometric accuracy of &#x000b1; 0.002 absorbance units in the range 0 &#x02013; 0.5 absorbance. The difference spectra were recorded using quartz cells with two chambers (Hellma GmbH &#x00026; Co) placing identical arrangements in both the sample (sample cuvette) and reference beam (reference cuvette). Spectra were recorded from 300 to 600 nm. Differences between solutions were minimized by filling both sides (sample and reference cuvettes) from single stock solutions of FMN<sub>ox</sub>. Microliter additions of FMN<sub>ox </sub>to both one chamber of the reference cuvette and to the sample cuvette, followed by mixing of enzyme and FMN<sub>ox </sub>solutions for the latter, allowed direct measurements of the difference spectra. This procedure is almost mandatory when change in absorbance signal is relatively small on interaction. All solutions were in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 (buffer A).</p><p>Fluorescence titration was performed at equilibrium in a RF-5301PC Spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu) at 25&#x000b0;C by making microliter additions of NADH stock solution (10 mM) to 2 mL of 1 &#x003bc;M <italic>Mt</italic>CS (active site concentration) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 (buffer A). Controls were determined, following exactly the same procedure, by microliter additions of buffer A to account for changes in protein fluorescence due to dilution. In order to assess the NADH inner-filter effect in the fluorimeter, two cuvettes were placed in series so that the contents of the first cuvette acted as a filter of the excitation light and the light emitted from the second cuvette detected. To the first cuvette, NADH was added, while the second cuvette contained <italic>Mt</italic>CS. In this manner, NADH inner-filter effects upon the protein fluorescence could be assessed. The binding of NADH to <italic>Mt</italic>CS causes a quench in protein fluorescence (&#x003bb;<sub>exc </sub>= 290 nm; 310 &#x02264; &#x003bb;<sub>em </sub>&#x02264; 510 nm), and fluorescence values at the maximum emission wavelength (345.5 nm) were plotted against increasing NADH concentrations. The data were fitted to a hyperbolic function, yielding a value of 156 (&#x000b1; 12) &#x003bc;M for the dissociation constant of <italic>Mt</italic>CS-NADH binary complex formation.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Mt</italic>CS enzymatic assay for NADH:FMN-oxidoreductase activity</title><p>FMN-reductase activity of <italic>Mt</italic>CS was monitored for the forward reaction 25&#x000b0;C in buffer A. The activity measurements were based on the decrease of NADH concentration upon FMN reduction. Owing to the high absorption coefficient of FMN at 360 nm, the consumption of NADH was monitored at 380 nm (&#x003b5; = 0.893 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>M<sup>-1 </sup>cm<sup>-1</sup>). The apparent steady state kinetic parameters Km and Vmax of FMN reductase activity were determined for holoenzyme <italic>Mt</italic>CS-FMN<sub>ox </sub>in the presence of varying concentrations of NADH (10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300 &#x003bc;M).
