Recently, mutants of the <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic> ERC/CAST family protein Bruchpilot (BRP) were shown to lack dense projections (T-bars) and to suffer from Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel&#x02013;clustering defects. In this study, we used high resolution light microscopy, electron microscopy, and intravital imaging to analyze the function of BRP in AZ assembly. Consistent with truncated BRP variants forming shortened T-bars, we identify BRP as a direct T-bar component at the AZ center with its N terminus closer to the AZ membrane than its C terminus. In contrast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Liprin-&#x003b1;, another AZ-organizing protein, precedes BRP during the assembly of newly forming AZs by several hours and surrounds the AZ center in few discrete punctae. BRP seems responsible for effectively clustering Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels beneath the T-bar density late in a protracted AZ formation process, potentially through a direct molecular interaction with intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel domains.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The arrival of action potentials mediates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through strategically localized clusters of voltage-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at the synaptic active zone (AZ) membrane. Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggers exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, and tight coupling between release-ready vesicles and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels seems important for efficient neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>). AZs are further characterized by macromolecular cytomatrices named dense bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhai and Bellen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Siksou et al., 2007</xref>). The role of these electron-dense specializations and of AZ-enriched proteins in the assembly of the AZ and/or the synaptic vesicle exo-endocytosis cycle is under intense investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Owald and Sigrist, 2009</xref>). Protein architectures constituting and controlling dense bodies remain to be revealed, and their contributions to AZ assembly in general and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering in particular must be defined genetically.</p><p>The most straightforward approach would be to use immunolabeling combined with light microscopy. However, individual AZs measure only a few hundred nanometers in diameter, rendering this approach difficult. Recently, stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hell, 2007</xref>) has proven valuable for high resolution light microscopic studies of synapse architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kittel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin and Garner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Westphal et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a leading model for genetic analyses of synapse structure and assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Featherstone et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collins and DiAntonio, 2007</xref>). In this preparation, dense body structures termed T-bars may take part in activity-dependent changes of synaptic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prokop and Meinertzhagen, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel &#x003b1;1 subunit Cacophony (Cac) was shown to dominate neurotransmitter release at NMJ synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawasaki et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Proteins of the conserved CAST (CAZ-associated structural protein)/ERC (ELKS&#x02013;Rab6-interacting protein CAST) family are generic AZ proteins. In mice, CAST/ERC proteins have been shown to localize to AZs of various synapses and to bind other AZ proteins such as RIM (Rab3a-interacting molecule) and Liprin-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ohtsuka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deguchi-Tawarada et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the CAST/ERC family member ELKS (glutamine-, leucine-, lysine-, and serine-rich protein) appears to operate genetically downstream of Syd-2/Liprin-&#x003b1; during the assembly of AZs at vulval synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patel et al., 2006</xref>). Recently, the CAST/ERC family member Bruchpilot (BRP), a coiled-coil rich protein of nearly 200 kD, was identified via its localization to <italic>Drosophila</italic> AZs. Mutants of <italic>brp</italic> lacked T-bars, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels were mislocalized at AZs, leading to inefficient vesicle release and changes in synaptic short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kittel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wagh et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we provide evidence that BRP takes up an elongated conformation and is a direct component of the T-bar. The N terminus of BRP is found superimposed on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters at the AZ center. BRP and Cac arrive at an advanced stage of the protracted synapse assembly process, and both proteins interact in vitro. In contrast, a further AZ-organizing protein, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Liprin-&#x003b1; (DLiprin-&#x003b1;), localizes to a different subcompartment of the AZ and enters nascent AZs substantially earlier than BRP. Thus, the assembly of the T-bar is instructed by BRP, which seems essential for clustering higher numbers of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at an advanced stage of AZ maturation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The AZ protein BRP was recently shown to be crucial for efficient neurotransmission at <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs.

As previously reported, T-bars were missing at <italic>brp</italic><sup>69</sup> AZs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>, compare A and B), and the BRP<sup>Nc82</sup> label (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>) was absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kittel et al., 2006</xref>). The BRP<sup>N-Term</sup> label was also completely absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), indicating that the predicted residual protein (corresponding to aa 1&#x02013;282) is unstable or at least does not localize to the NMJ.

To enter into a structure-function analysis of BRP in T-bar assembly, additional <italic>brp</italic> alleles were looked into. First, a piggyBac-transposon insert (<italic>brp</italic><sup>c04298</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, blue; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bellen et al., 2004</xref>) located toward the middle of the locus was characterized. At <italic>brp</italic><sup>c04298</sup> NMJs, the BRP<sup>Nc82</sup> label was absent, whereas the BRP<sup>N-Term</sup> label was dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Comparable with our observations for <italic>brp</italic><sup>69</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kittel et al., 2006</xref>), electron microscopic analysis of <italic>brp</italic><sup>c04298</sup> showed a complete lack of T-bars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), and only traces of electron-dense material remained at AZ membranes. Thus, as this allele is a site-specific insertion but not a deletion (which in principle might eliminate control elements of genes other than <italic>brp</italic>), this allele provides further proof that BRP is essential for T-bar assembly. However, as the molecular alterations of <italic>brp</italic><sup>c04298</sup> cannot be predicted easily, we sought to analyze aa point mutations in <italic>brp</italic>. To do so, a chemical mutagenesis screen (ethyl methyl sulfonate [EMS]) selecting for reduced viability over <italic>brp</italic>-null alleles was performed.</p><p>The <italic>brp</italic><sup>5.45</sup> allele is characterized by a stop codon at aa position 867 (&#x0223c;50% protein length), which leads to pupal lethality over <italic>brp</italic> null with weak escapers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). As expected, the BRP<sup>Nc82</sup> label was absent from <italic>brp</italic><sup>5.45</sup> NMJs. Although the number of BRP<sup>N-Term</sup> clusters was reduced over the whole NMJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812150/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>), those remaining in <italic>brp</italic><sup>5.45</sup> were slightly smaller, although of comparable intensity as in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>; and Fig. S1, B and C). Despite extensive analysis, T-bars were not detected at <italic>brp</italic><sup>5.45</sup> NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>).</p><p>The EMS allele <italic>brp</italic><sup>1.3</sup> delivered paralyzed adult escapers over <italic>brp</italic> null as the result of a premature stop codon at aa 1,390 (generating a protein 523 aa longer than predicted for <italic>brp</italic><sup>5.45</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Although the number of BRP<sup>N-Term</sup> clusters was reduced to &#x0223c;40% (Fig. S1 A), their sizes and intensities were comparable with controls. At the same time, the BRP<sup>Nc82</sup> label was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). T-bar&#x02013;like structures were observed at <italic>brp</italic><sup>1.3</sup> NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>), although at lower frequency than in controls (not depicted). However, upon closer inspection, the T-bar&#x02013;like structures typically appeared truncated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>For EM, conventional room temperature embedding procedures, including aldehyde fixation and dehydration of the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A&#x02013;E</xref>), are prone to shrinkage artifacts. To use an alternative conservation method for the analysis of <italic>brp</italic><sup>1.3</sup>, we introduced high pressure freezing (HPF)/freeze substitution (FS) EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gray et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rostaing et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Siksou et al., 2007</xref>) to larval NMJs. With HPF/FS, NMJ tissue appeared well preserved, as judged by the smooth membrane surfaces of, for example, mitochondria (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812150/DC1">Fig. S2, A and B</ext-link>) or presynaptic boutons (not depicted). Furthermore, electron-dense structures appeared taller, which was likely caused by a reduced loss of material during HPF/FS embedding (e.g., the synaptic cleft; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Unlike T-bars visualized in conventionally embedded tissues, HPF/FS-processed T-bars were characterized by filamentous elements at their distal ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>, arrowheads). At <italic>brp</italic><sup>1.3</sup> NMJs, HPF/FS EM (similarly to our observations obtained with standard EM) typically revealed shortened T-bars (Fig. S2 C, quantification). In conclusion, elimination of aa 1,390&#x02013;1,740 of BRP did not prevent the formation of T-bar&#x02013;like assemblies per se. However, these assemblies were significantly smaller than in controls. This result is in line with the assumption that BRP operates as a building block shaping the T-bar.</p><p>To both confirm and extend our results, BRP-encoding cDNA fragments (C-terminally GFP tagged for in vivo visualization) were expressed in motoneurons of <italic>brp</italic><sup>69</sup> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, G and H</xref>). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kittel et al., 2006</xref>), full-length BRP localized to AZs and restored T-bar formation (not depicted). The C-terminally truncated fragment D1-3<sup>GFP</sup> (BRP<sup>D1-3GFP</sup>; &#x00394; aa 1,227&#x02013;1,740; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>) localized to presynaptic sites but was not sufficient for T-bar formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>). Thus, expression of BRP<sup>D1-3GFP</sup> further suggests that the C-terminal region of BRP (distal of aa 1,226; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>) is important for T-bar formation.</p><p>By expressing D2-4<sup>GFP</sup> (BRP<sup>D2-4GFP</sup>; &#x00394; aa 1&#x02013;267; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), the role of the N-terminal region of BRP was tested. The expressed protein was found close to individual AZs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>). Although T-bars were never observed, small electron-dense aggregates (clearly smaller than T-bars) localized to the AZ membrane at high frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 H</xref>). Thus, the N-terminal region of BRP seems important for the formation of proper, full-sized T-bars, whereas the C-terminal region is required for the assembly of T-bars by itself.

As our in vivo imaging experiments show (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), AZs go through a long, protracted assembly process before finally reaching their fully mature size. Thus, we wondered whether BRP may be more important for maturation and potentially less so for initialization of Cac clustering. To address this, we visualized Cac in intact, living <italic>brp</italic><sup>c04298</sup> mutant larvae together with DGluRIIA as a reference for synapse maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). In <italic>brp</italic><sup>c04298</sup> larvae, nascent synapses, identified by their small DGluRIIA accumulations, seemed to accumulate Cac at normal density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, B and C</xref>). However, larger, more mature synapses with more substantial DGluRIIA accumulations showed reduced Cac density in the absence of BRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, B and C</xref>). In clear contrast, the recruitment of Cac<sup>GFP</sup> to AZs appears to be independent of presynaptic DLiprin-&#x003b1;, as the localization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels appears normal in <italic>dliprin-&#x003b1;</italic> mutants (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812150/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>).</p><p>Our data imply the following scenario: BRP, an integral component of the T-bar, is recruited to AZs later than DLiprin-&#x003b1;. BRP seems largely dispensable for the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel accumulation. However, the matrix organized by BRP is required for maintaining the continuous clustering of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels beneath the T-bar base during the maturation process, which lasts several hours.</p><p>Alternatively, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel&#x02013;clustering defect in <italic>brp</italic> could be caused by impaired Cac transport. To address this, Cac trafficking dynamics were measured using FRAP experiments. Notably, Cac FRAP was slow, with a recovery half-time of &#x0223c;12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>), which is similar to other synaptic membrane proteins such as DGluRIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmid et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, however, Cac FRAP was essentially unaltered at <italic>brp</italic> boutons, indicating that the long-range transport of Cac to the AZ is not affected by the loss of BRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 D</xref>). Thus, BRP seems to be directly required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering at AZs but not for its recruitment to the terminal. We aimed to further address the relation between T-bar assembly and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering. Notably, <italic>brp</italic><sup>1.3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>) showed partially restored Cac clustering. Moreover, those AZs positive for BRP<sup>N-Term</sup> in <italic>brp</italic><sup>1.3</sup> corresponded to the AZs of restored Cac clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref>). Thus, AZ accumulation of the C-terminally truncated but N-terminally intact BRP protein seems to permit the assembly of a distally truncated T-bar, which still functions in clustering Cac.</p><p>To further explore this, we prepared larval NMJ AZs via HPF/FS. In this study, a gap between the AZ membrane and the T-bar pedestal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 F</xref>, arrows) was observed, where peg-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harlow et al., 2001</xref>) structures extended from the AZ membrane and distally contacted (or even slightly penetrated) the T-bar pedestal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 F</xref>, top, arrowheads). Such pegs were also observed at <italic>brp</italic><sup>1.3</sup> AZs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 F</xref>, middle, arrowheads) but not at AZ membranes of the <italic>brp</italic><sup>69</sup>-null allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 F</xref>, bottom). Thus, these data further support the notion that Cac clustering beneath the T-bar pedestal is restored at <italic>brp</italic><sup>1.3</sup> AZs. Moreover, the cytoplasmic domains of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels might well extend from the AZ membrane, possibly allowing for a direct interaction with BRP.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible direct interaction between the C terminus of Cac and the N terminus of BRP</title><p>To address a possible interaction between BRP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, we tested for protein&#x02013;protein interactions in vitro.

Only the C-terminal domain of Cac and the N-terminal domain of BRP showed positive for interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref>). Thus, in agreement with our hypothesis concerning the orientation of BRP within the T-bar, the BRP N terminus may interact with the Cac C-terminal domain. To further investigate this interaction, we double transfected Schneider S2R+ cells with a GFP-tagged N-terminal construct of BRP (aa 1&#x02013;617) and Myc-Cac<sup>C-Term</sup> (aa 1,420&#x02013;1,848). Pull-downs directed against Myc, GFP, and BRP (using a polyclonal antibody directed against aa 268&#x02013;617 of BRP; see Materials and methods) confirmed a direct interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>The N terminus of BRP physically interacts with the C terminus of Cac in vitro.</bold> (A) Scheme of yeast two-hybrid analysis using Cac bait constructs and overlapping BRP prey constructs.

Thus, BRP might be involved in providing slots in the AZ cytomatrix, which define sites of stable Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel incorporation, whereas the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels themselves are not involved in clustering BRP.

In this study, we provide evidence that BRP is a direct T-bar component. Immuno-EM identifies the N terminus of BRP throughout the whole cross section of the T-bar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>), and genetic approaches show that a truncated BRP, lacking the C-terminal 30% of the protein&#x02019;s sequence, forms truncated T-bars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>). Immuno-EM and light microscopy consistently demonstrate that N- and C-terminal epitopes of BRP are segregated along an axis vertical to the AZ membrane and suggest that BRP is an elongated protein, which directly shapes the T-bar structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 C</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>brp</italic><sup>5.45</sup> (predicted as aa 1&#x02013;866), T-bars were not detected, whereas <italic>brp</italic><sup>1.3</sup> (aa 1&#x02013;1,389) formed T-bar&#x02013;like structures, although fewer and smaller than normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>; and Fig. S2 C). Moreover, the BRP<sup>D1-3GFP</sup> construct (1&#x02013;1,226) did not rescue T-bar assembly. Thus, domains between aa 1,226 and 1,390 of BRP may also be important for the formation of T-bars. Clearly, however, the assembly scheme for T-bars is expected to be controlled at several levels (e.g., by phosphorylation) and might involve further protein components. Nonetheless, it is highly likely that the C-terminal half of BRP plays a crucial role.</p></sec><sec><title>BRP, the dense body, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering</title><p>As BRP represents an essential component of the electron-dense T-bar subcompartment at the AZ center, it might link Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel&#x02013;dependent release sites to the synaptic vesicle cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>).

Overall, this study is one of the first to genetically identify a component of an electron-dense synaptic specialization and thus paves the way for further genetic analyses of this subcellular structure.</p><p>The N terminus of BRP is found significantly closer to the AZ membrane than the C terminus, where it covers a confined area very similar to the area defined by the Cac<sup>GFP</sup> epitope. Electron tomography of frog NMJs suggested that the cytoplasmic domains of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, reminiscent of pegs, are concentrated directly beneath a component of an electron-dense AZ matrix resembling ribs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harlow et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, freeze-fracture EM identified membrane-associated particles at flesh fly AZs, which, as judged by their dimensions, might well be Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feeney et al., 1998</xref>). We observed peg-like structures beneath the T-bar pedestal. Similar to fly T-bars, the frog AZ matrix extends up to 75 nm into the presynaptic cytoplasm. Based on the amount of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Catterall, 1998</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harlow et al. (2001)</xref> concluded that Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are likely to extend into parts of the ribs. Thus, physical interactions between cytoplasmic domains of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and components of ribs/T-bars might well control the formation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clusters at the AZ membrane. However, a short N-terminal fragment of BRP (aa 1&#x02013;320) expressed in the <italic>brp</italic>-null background was unable to localize to AZs efficiently and consistently failed to restore Cac clustering (unpublished data).</p><p>The mean Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel density at AZs is reduced in <italic>brp</italic>-null alleles. In vitro assays indicate that the N-terminal 20% of BRP can physically interact with the intracellular C terminus of Cac. Notably, we found that the GFP epitope at the very C terminus of Cac<sup>GFP</sup> was closer to the AZ membrane than the N-terminal epitope of BRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). It is conceivable that parts of the Cac C terminus extend into the pedestal region of the T-bar cytomatrix to locally interact with the BRP N terminus. This interaction might play a role in clustering Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels beneath the T-bar pedestal.</p><p>Clearly, additional work will be needed to identify the contributions of discrete protein interactions in the potentially complex AZ protein interaction scheme. Our study should pave the way for a genetic analysis of spatial relationships and structural linkages within the AZ organization.

BRP is a late player in AZ assembly, arriving hours after DLiprin-&#x003b1; and also clearly after the postsynaptic accumulation of DGluRIIA. Accumulation of Cac was late as well, although it slightly preceded the arrival of BRP, and impaired Cac clustering at AZs lacking BRP became apparent only from a certain synapse size onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, B and C</xref>). In this study, we report that new AZs, similar to PSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rasse et al., 2005</xref>), form at sites distant from preexisting ones and grow to reach a mature, fixed size. Thus, the late, BRP-dependent formation of the T-bar seems to be required for maintaining high Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel levels at maturing AZs but not for initializing Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering at newly forming sites. As the dominant fraction of neuromuscular AZs is mature at a given time point, the overall impression is that of a general clustering defect in <italic>brp</italic> mutants. In reverse, it will be of interest to further differentiate the molecular mechanisms governing early Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering.

A further candidate involved in early Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel clustering is the Fuseless protein, which was recently shown to be crucial for proper Cac localization at AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Long et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In summary, during the developmental formation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ synapses, the emergence of a presynaptic dense body, which is involved in accumulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, appears to be a central aspect of synapse maturation. This is likely to confer mature release probability to individual AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kittel et al., 2006</xref>) and contribute to matching pre- and postsynaptic assembly by regulating glutamate receptor composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmid et al., 2008</xref>). Whether similar mechanisms operate during synapse formation and maturation in mammals remains an open question.</p></sec><sec><title>Outlook: dense body architectures and synaptic plasticity</title><p>In this study, we concentrated on developmental synapse formation and maturation. The question arises whether similar mechanisms to those relevant for AZ maturation might control activity-dependent plasticity as well and whether maturation-dependent changes might be reversible at the level of individual synapses.
