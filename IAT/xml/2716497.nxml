These pre-invasive mammary lesions originate from the luminal epithelial cells that line the ducts and lobules of the mammary glandular epithelium and have a disrupted epithelial architecture characterized by hyperproliferative cells occupying the normally hollow luminal spaces of the ducts and lobules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The amplification and overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 is observed in approximately 50% of pre-invasive lesions; however, in most cases, the genetic and epigenetic abnormalities that promote pre-invasive tumor growth are poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Since such a wide range of molecular perturbations can induce and enhance tumor growth, there are probably shared molecular signaling modules that integrate biochemical signals from the suite of genetic contexts found in epithelial tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. To explain how normal cells become tumorigenic, a molecular framework that underpins the pre-invasive stage of tumor growth must be established. Such a molecular framework can assist in the identification of patients amenable to targeted therapeutics, in the development of novel therapeutics to treat pre-invasive cancer, and, in the future, in the introduction of preventative treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Attempts to identify the core signaling modules that promote these pre-invasive growth characteristics through the analysis of genetic abnormalities and gene expression patterns of pre-invasive tumor lesions have to date been unsuccessful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The Raf&#x02013;MEK1/2&#x02013;ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction module transmits extracellular and oncogenic stimuli, resulting in cellular responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In this module, Raf isoforms phosphorylate their primary substrates, the dual-specificity kinases MEK1/2. Once activated, MEK1/2 phosphorylate ERK1/2 on tyrosine and threonine residues, substantially increasing ERK1/2 catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The Raf&#x02013;MEK1/2&#x02013;ERK1/2 module is activated by growth factors and proteins overexpressed in human breast cancer epithelium, by cytokines and hormones produced by fibroblasts and macrophages in the mammary stromal compartment, and by increased tissue stiffness observed during tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, the sequencing of breast cancer patient genomes suggests that infrequent mutations may drive tumor progression through known signaling pathways, such as the Raf&#x02013;MEK1/2&#x02013;ERK1/2 cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Considering the array of stimuli known to activate the Raf&#x02013;MEK1/2&#x02013;ERK1/2 module, it may be complicit in tumorigenesis in a variety of contexts.</p><p>Consistent with a role for the Raf&#x02013;MEK1/2&#x02013;ERK1/2 module in mammary carcinogenesis, ERK1/2 are activated in primary breast cancer tissue and in associated lymph node metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The activation of ERK1/2 is not associated with a specific genetic signature, however, as ERK1/2 is active in ER-positive breast cancer, HER2-positive breast cancer and in triple-negative breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. ERK1/2 phosphorylate transcription factors, kinases, proteases and non-enzymatic regulatory proteins, thus potentially integrating the Raf&#x02013;MEK1/2&#x02013;ERK1/2 module into a range of cellular activities associated with tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Accumulating evidence, however, has shown that results obtained in one cell type should not be generally applied across all classes of cancer without experimental validation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. For example, the K-Ras2 oncogene has distinct effects on tumor progression depending on both the cell type of origin and the genetic context in which it is mutated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, extrapolating the role of protein kinases in promoting breast cancer progression based on either their known substrate profile or biological behaviors induced in two-dimensional culture models has proven to be unreliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. For example, the chemically induced homodimerization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is sufficient to induce focus formation in Rat 1 cells and the proliferation of MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells in monolayer cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. EGFR homodimerization of EGFR, however, is not sufficient to induce the proliferation of differentiated MCF-10A cells grown in organotypic culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Considering the uncertainty in predicting the response of cells to the activation of a signaling pathway, determining the response of differentiated mammary epithelial cells to Raf&#x02013;MEK&#x02013;ERK activation can better define the early events of mammary tumorigenesis.</p><p>Three-dimensional organotypic culture models have been indispensable tools in deciphering the molecular and cell biological mechanisms underlying the disruption of differentiated epithelial architecture that is characteristic of pre-invasive mammary epithelial lesions. In organotypic culture models, individual mammary epithelial cells plated on reconstituted basement membrane proliferate to form a hollow sphere of polarized, growth-arrested cells (termed acini), thus recapitulating the salient features of the mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Since the mammary epithelial cells differentiate and form a hollow monolayer of cells, organotypic cultures provide a more accurate reconstitution of the biochemical and cell biological growth restraints found in mammary glandular epithelium than is achieved using traditional two-dimensional cell culture models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Once cells become proliferative, they are confronted with similar local environmental selection pressures to those found during tumorigenesis. Namely, cells are required to become resistant to cell death triggered by the induction of either apoptosis or autophagy when cells enter the luminal space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Organotypic culture models therefore provide both the biochemical signaling barriers that must be overcome for initial proliferation to occur, and the microenvironmental context in which pre-invasive tumor cells must survive and propagate.</p><p>We have previously developed a method for imaging cells in Raf:ER-induced acini at single-cell resolution through imaging a histone&#x02013;green fluorescence protein (GFP) correct fusion protein, H2B-GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Using this unbiased discovery approach we have found that Raf:ER activation induces a disruption of epithelial architecture through promoting a non-invasive form of motility, cell proliferation and the survival of cells in the lumen. These findings suggest that ERK1/2 activation can promote the early events of tumorigenesis and that the induction of motility can, in principle, occur before tumor cell invasion. To determine how ERK1/2 signaling promotes the early events of tumorigenesis we have examined the intracellular signaling pathways that promote proliferation, cell survival and motility in response to ERK1/2 activation in mammary epithelial acini.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>MCF-10A human mammary epithelial cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection.

To activate Raf, a 4-HT-inducible, constitutively active variant of Raf-1, termed Raf:ER, was stably expressed in the MCF-10A cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The Raf:ER fusion protein consists of the kinase domain of Raf fused to a modified ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor at the C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Treatment of cells with 4-HT activates Raf:ER by increasing Raf:ER protein stability and perhaps inducing conformational changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Using real-time imaging we have previously demonstrated that the activation of Raf:ER promotes the disruption of epithelial architecture of MCF-10A acini through the induction of a new non-invasive form of mammary epithelial cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In addition to cell motility, our real-time imaging analysis of Raf:ER-induced acini showed some cells transitioning through mitosis and that cells occupying the luminal space did not undergo apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. If Raf:ER induction was indeed inducing significant proliferation and cell survival, the size of acini should increase over time. To test this possibility we first grew Raf:ER-MCF-10A cells for 12 days in three-dimensional organotypic culture to generate acini with differentiated epithelium and a hollow lumen that are identical to wild-type MCF-10A acini (data not shown). These fully formed acini were then treated with diluent or 100 nM 4-HT for 5 days. To simplify interpretation, exogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF), which is normally present at 1 ng/ml in organotypic culture growth medium, was omitted from the medium at the time of treatment with 4-HT in all experiments.</p><p>Acini treated with 4-HT at day 12 lost their spherical shape and were larger then control acini (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>), as judged by differential interference contrast microscopy. Raf:ER expression was typically increased in at least 90% of cells within an individual acinar structure 48 hours after administration of 4-HT (data not shown), and the induction of Raf:ER promoted a large increase in the level of activated ERK1/2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Examination of the arrangement of cells, as judged by the position of nuclei and appearance under differential interference contrast microscopy, revealed a loss of spherical architecture and of cells occupying the lumens of acini (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a,c</xref>), consistent with our previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Activation of Raf:ER induces pre-invasive epithelial growth in cultured acini.

Only 17% of the control acini contained three or more cells expressing Ki-67, whereas 65% of the acini treated with 4-HT had three or more cells expressing Ki-67, indicating that the activation of ERK1/2 is sufficient to stimulate an increased rate of proliferation in cultured acini (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c,d</xref>).</p><p>A key step in the development of breast cancer is survival of cells in the luminal space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].

Considering ERK1/2 are active in epithelial cancers, including breast cancer, if ERK1/2 requires autocrine activation of EGFR, than the therapeutic blockade of EGFR will block ERK1/2-driven tumorigenic responses.

Raf:ER cells were co-cultured with MCF-10A-H2B:GFP cells at a 1:1 plating ratio. The cultures were grown with diluent or 100 nM 4-HT in the absence of EGF for 13 days. In the control cultures treated with diluent, neither Raf:ER cells nor the MCF-10A-H2B:GFP cells proliferated to form acini. On the other hand, when Raf:ER was activated by 100 nM 4-HT, both the Raf:ER cells and the MCF-10A-H2B:GFP cells grew to form acini (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Over 85% of Raf:ER and MCF-10A/H2B:GFP cells grew to acini of at least 30 &#x003bc;M in diameter.</p><p>The acini are not mixed groups of cells, because acini are entirely formed from cells that express H2B:GFP or from cells that do not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). The ability of acini expressing activated Raf:ER to promote growth of co-cultured normal MCF-10A acini in the absence of EGF indicates that activated Raf:ER acini secrete autocrine growth factors that complement the absence of EGF. We confirmed that the growth-promoting autocrine growth factors were acting on EGFR by growing the co-cultures in the presence of 300 nM AG1478 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Only one or two acini out of 100 MCF-10A/H2B:GFP cells counted grew larger than five cells in three independent experiments. Activation of ERK1/2 in differentiated mammary epithelium does indeed therefore induce the production of autocrine growth factors that act on EGFR. One candidate factor is heparin-binding EGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Raf:ER activation promotes the induction of c-Fos and the decreased expression of Bim</title><p>We next explored the intracellular targets of ERK1/2 that promote proliferation and cell survival.

Whether c-Fos expression is elevated in response to ERK1/2 activation or any oncogenic stimuli in differentiated epithelium in organotypic culture is not known. We examined c-Fos expression in day 10 acini or later acini after treatment with 100 nM 4-HT for 48 hours by immunostaining, and found that c-Fos protein levels were increased in acini treated with 100 nM 4-HT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). The elevated expression of c-Fos suggests that ERK1/2-stimulated proliferation could in part be regulated by c-Fos. The single-cell-level analysis provided by our immunofluorescence analysis also demonstrates that c-Fos expression does not directly correlate with the degree of disruption of epithelial architecture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>).

The intracellular signaling architecture of epithelial cells must therefore be altered for cells to survive in the luminal space.

This apoptotic trigger is counterbalanced by unknown biochemical signals stimulated by cell attachment to the surrounding basement membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Reduced expression of Bim is sufficient to delay apoptosis of cells in lumens of MCF-10A acini and the developing mammary gland, which suggests that the differentiation-dependent increase in Bim expression triggers apoptosis of centrally located cells and formation of a lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].

The sufficiency of acute ERK1/2 activation to reduce Bim expression in differentiated mammary epithelium, however, has not been tested.

The stochastic nature of AKT phosphorylation we observed is consistent with the pattern of AKT phosphorylation in normal MCF-10A acini earlier in their development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

The stochastic pattern of AKT serine 473 phosphorylation is therefore unlikely to be due to variations in Raf:ER expression or ERK1/2 activity, but it does depend on ERK activation. We did not detect phospho-Ser473-AKT until 24 hours after Raf:ER activation, whereas increased expression of c-Fos and phosphorylation of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK), a direct target of ERK1/2, were first observed 2 hours after 4-HT treatment (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Raf:ER activates AKT in organotypic culture.

How cells become motile in response to either ERK1/2 activation or prior to invasion is not known. Defining both how ERK1/2 activation induces movement and also how movement is induced in multicellular epithelial acini is necessary to understand how cells become motile and invasive during breast cancer progression.

Each of these factors activates receptors or receptor combinations that are capable of activating PI-3K, and thus one or more of these autocrine ligands could promote the phosphorylation and activation of PI-3K and AKT in our model.</p></sec><sec><title>PI-3K activity is necessary for ERK-stimulated motility</title><p>Our understanding of how cells become motile in response to ERK1/2 activation is limited. ERK1/2 can phosphorylate myosin light-chain kinase to promote myosin contraction and can also phosphorylate calpain to promote the severing of integrin attachment to substratum in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. We have shown that ERK1/2 promotes MLC2 phosphorylation through myosin light-chain kinase in mammary epithelial acini; however, a pharmacological inhibitor of calpain has had no effect on cell motility in our model (GW Pearson, unpublished observation). The targets of ERK1/2 signaling that regulate cell motility in general or in mammary epithelial acini are therefore a mystery. We have discovered that PI-3K signaling is upregulated by ERK1/2, and that PI-3K activity is necessary for cell motility in mammary epithelial acini. Although PI-3K and the phospholipid products of PI-3K activity can be elevated through mutation of the catalytic domain of PI-3K or deletion of the phosphatase and tensin homolog lipid phosphatase or amplification and activation of transmembrane receptor proteins, the activation of PI-3K in breast cancer does not require these mutagenic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. It is then possible that ERK1/2 activity could drive cell movement, in part, through the activation of PI-3K in some breast cancers.</p></sec><sec><title>PI-3K activity is necessary for cell motility in mammary epithelial acini</title><p>How cells become motile in mammary epithelial acini is not well understood. We have recently determined that cells can become motile in the absence of invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This finding has potential clinical relevance, because motile cells could be present in pre-invasive lesions, such as DCIS, and thus portend a greater risk of future invasive growth. Whether there are indeed motile cells in pre-invasive lesions is not yet known. A step towards determining how cells become motile during tumorigenesis is the identification of the intracellular signaling pathways that are necessary or sufficient to induce cell movement in these multicellular structures. We have already found that ERK1/2 activation is sufficient to induce movement and that this ERK1/2-driven motility requires MLC2 phosphorylation and a reduction in E-cadherin expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We have now determined that PI-3K activity is necessary for the induction of motility induced by ERK1/2 signaling in mammary epithelial acini.</p><p>The requirement of PI-3K activity for Raf:ER-stimulated cell motility is independent of MLC2 phosphorylation or E-cadherin expression, which suggests that PI-3K regulates at least one additional process that is necessary for cells to become motile in mammary epithelial acini. PI-3K signaling has been extensively studied in the regulation of chemotaxis in the slime mold <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. In these model systems, PI-3K contributes the production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate at the leasing edge of the cell, which is necessary for the polarization of the cell and the directional migration towards a chemoattractant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. PI-3K activity is necessary for the chemotaxis of additional cell types, including some patient-derived breast cancer cell lines, possibly through an analogous mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Whether cells in epithelial acini are moving by chemotaxis is not known. In fact, cells move in different directions within an acinus &#x02013; which suggests that chemotaxis, and by extension a requirement for sustained polarization of cells, is not necessary for the movement observed. Considering this possibility, PI-3K activity probably regulates motility in mammary epithelial acini through a mechanism distinct from the polarization necessary for chemotaxis observed in other model systems. In the future, determining how PI-3K regulates movement in mammary epithelial acini will serve to further explain how cells become motile during breast cancer progression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results demonstrate that the activation of the Raf&#x02013;MEK1/2&#x02013;ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase module is sufficient to induce cell proliferation, survival and motility in cultured mammary epithelial acini. In addition, PI-3K activity was required for proliferation and survival induced by ERK1/2 activation. Each of these cell behaviors could contribute to recurrent and invasive breast cancer growth after lumpectomy, which suggests that the activity state of the two signaling pathways should be investigated in DCIS patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>DCIS: ductal carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic>; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EGF: epidermal growth factor; EGF: epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK: extracellular-signal regulated kinase; GFP: green fluorescence protein; 4-HT: 4-hydroxytamoxifen; MEK: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PI-3K: phosphoinositide-3 kinase.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>GWP conceived of the study, designed and performed the experiments, and wrote the manuscript.
