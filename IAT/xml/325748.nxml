This recombinant plasmid was used to transform E. coli chi 1776 to screen 1445 tetracycline resistant colonies. Nine clones (pGETI - 9) containing cDNA coding for the human epsilon chain were recognized by colony hybridization and Southern blotting analysis with a nick-translated human IgE genome fragment. The nucleotide sequence of the longest cDNA contained in pGET2 was determined. The results indicate that the sequence of 1657 nucleotides codes for 494 amino acids covering a part of the variable region and all of the constant region of the human epsilon chain. Most of the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence is in substantial agreement with that reported. Furthermore a termination codon after the -COOH terminal amino acid marks the beginning of a 3' untranslated region of 125 nucleotides with a poly A tail. Taking this into account, the structure of the human epsilon chain mRNA, except a part of the 5' end, is conserved fairly well in the cDNA insert in pGET2.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0174-a" xlink:role="722"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0171.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="719"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0172.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="720"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0173.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="721"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0174.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="722"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0175.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="723"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0176.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="724"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0177.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="725"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00348-0178.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="726"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
