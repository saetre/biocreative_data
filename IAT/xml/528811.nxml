In addition to a proposed general role in non-homologous end joining of double-strand breaks, its mutagenic potential and preferential expression in secondary lymphoid tissues support a role in somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin genes. Here, we show that human Pol &#x003bc; protein is expressed in the nucleus of centroblasts obtained from human tonsils, forming a characteristic foci pattern resembling that of other DNA repair proteins in response to DNA damage. Overexpression of human Pol &#x003bc; in Ramos cells, in which the SHM process is constitutive, augmented the somatic mutations specifically at the variable (V) region of the immunoglobulin genes. The nature of the mutations introduced, mostly base substitutions, supports the contribution of Pol &#x003bc; to mutation of G and C residues during SHM. <italic>In vitro</italic> analysis of Pol &#x003bc; misincorporation on specific templates, that mimic DNA repair intermediates and correspond to mutational hotspots, indicated that many of the mutations observed <italic>in vivo</italic> can be explained by the capacity of Pol &#x003bc; to induce transient template&#x0002f;primer misalignments.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The primary repertoire of antibody specificities is created in the bone marrow by a DNA rearrangement process involving immunoglobulin (Ig) V (variable), D (diversity) and J (joining) gene segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c1">1</xref>). Following antigen encounter, germinal center (GC)-B cells (centroblasts) proliferate rapidly and undergo a further round of diversification through the somatic hypermutation (SHM) process. In SHM, a large number of mutations (10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> mutations&#x0002f;bp&#x0002f;generation) are introduced specifically in rearranged IgV genes [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c2">2</xref>)]. Most mutations consist of single-nucleotide substitutions, although deletions and insertions also occur. Ig gene hypermutation exhibits a distinctive nucleotide misincorporation pattern, favoring transitions over transversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c3">3</xref>) and preferentially targeting G&#x0002f;C residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c5">5</xref>). Moreover, extensive sequence analyses have defined the consensus sequences R<underline>G</underline>YW and W<underline>A</underline> (most mutable nucleotide underlined; R is purine, Y is pyrimidine and W is A or T) as highly mutable DNA sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c7">7</xref>).</p><p>Dissection of the SHM process has yielded clear clues as to <italic>cis</italic>-acting factors [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c8">8</xref>)], but the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. At present, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is the only enzymatic activity found to be indispensable for SHM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c10">10</xref>). Although initially described as an RNA editing enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c11">11</xref>), AID is also reported to deaminate dC residues directly on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c15">15</xref>). Recent data suggest that DNA strand breaks could trigger SHM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c20">20</xref>), and it seems very likely that generation of these DNA breaks, defining the SHM hotspots, is closely related to AID activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c23">23</xref>). The &#x02018;DNA deamination&#x02019; model proposes that AID deaminates deoxycytidine residues to uracil directly on DNA at the hypermutation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c24">24</xref>); this would generate mismatches that, in the course of DNA repair, would originate the DNA breaks. Other recent work suggests the existence of AID-independent mechanisms for DNA break generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c28">28</xref>). Independently of the way in which these breaks are generated (as nicks and&#x0002f;or double-strand breaks, DSBs), most SHM models suggest that they trigger the mechanism(s) underlying somatic mutation. This invokes the involvement of an error-prone &#x02018;DNA break repair&#x02019; process at the heart of the mutasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c29">29</xref>), which would include participation of DNA polymerase(s) and nucleolytic activities [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c30">30</xref>)].</p><p>The mammalian DNA polymerase family has grown considerably in the last three years, and we currently know that human cells encode at least 13 template-dependent DNA polymerases, several with clear error-prone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c33">33</xref>). Initial analyses discarded the direct involvement of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c34">34</xref>) and DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c35">35</xref>) in SHM. Novel candidates for the mutagenic DNA polymerase activity (Pols &#x003b9;, &#x003ba;, &#x003b7;, &#x003b6; and &#x003bc;) have thus emerged [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c30">30</xref>)]. Convincing data indicate that Pol &#x003b7; is an A&#x0002f;T mutator in the SHM process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c36">36</xref>), and that inhibition of Pol &#x003b6; expression results in reduced SHM frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c38">38</xref>). The participation of Pol &#x003b9; in SHM is unclear since induction of SHM in BL2 cells is dependent on Pol &#x003b9; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c39">39</xref>), but Pol &#x003b9; <italic>knockout</italic> mice show no significant alteration in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c40">40</xref>). A putative role for Pol &#x003ba; in SHM is not supported by the analysis of its <italic>KO</italic> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c42">42</xref>). In any case, these data suggest that more than one error-prone DNA polymerase is involved in process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c43">43</xref>).</p><p>Human DNA polymerase &#x003bc; (Pol &#x003bc;) was the first identified novel member of the mammalian DNA Pol X family, showing both amino acid sequence and functional domain organization closely related to TdT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c44">44</xref>). Although various biological roles were proposed for Pol &#x003bc; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c45">45</xref>), they are still matter of speculation. Based on the <italic>in vitro</italic> polymerization properties of highly purified human Pol &#x003bc;, which shows unprecedented error-prone DNA synthesis on template-primer structures, and preferential mRNA expression in secondary lymphoid organs, Pol &#x003bc; was suggested to be involved in SHM of Ig genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c45">45</xref>). Pol &#x003bc; was recently reported to have a unique ability to promote microhomology-mediated template-primer realignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c46">46</xref>), to be up-regulated in response to ionizing radiation-induced DNA DSBs, and to form complexes with Ku 70&#x0002f;80 and XRCC4&#x0002f;DNA ligase IV heterodimeric complexes in the presence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c47">47</xref>). These data support a role for Pol &#x003bc; in the non-homologous end joining pathway for DSBs repair. Analysis of Pol &#x003bc;-deficient mice did not support a putative role for Pol &#x003bc; in SHM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c48">48</xref>), but showed a mild impairment of Ig gene rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c49">49</xref>), supporting a previously suggested role for Pol &#x003bc; in V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c45">45</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that human Pol &#x003bc; is preferentially expressed in GC-B cells, forming discrete nuclear foci that resemble DNA damage-induced DNA repair factories. Overexpression of human Pol &#x003bc; in a Burkitt's lymphoma-derived B cell line (Ramos), in which SHM is constitutive, induced an increase in somatic mutations specifically targeted to G&#x0002f;C residues in IgV genes. <italic>In vitro</italic> analyses using DNA substrates corresponding to hotspot sequences also support the ability of Pol &#x003bc; to generate these mutations.

Specificity was confirmed, as pre-incubation of anti-Pol &#x003bc; IgG with purified recombinant human Pol &#x003bc; greatly diminished staining; this pattern was not observed after incubation with anti-Pol &#x003bb; antibody (data not shown).</p><p>To further evaluate the cellular distribution of Pol &#x003bc; in GC-B cells, we analyzed the expression in purified human centroblasts (B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>PNA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> tonsil B cells) using indirect immunofluorescence. Pol &#x003bc; showed nuclear localization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f1">1</xref>D), distributed in discrete spots resembling the foci in which the cellular DNA repair machinery co-localizes after the induction of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c55">55</xref>). This expression pattern was specific, as it was not found in control peripheral B cells (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f1">1</xref>B) or when a control IgG fraction was used in the same conditions (data not shown). This protein distribution is similar to that reported for Pol &#x003bc; after DSB induction in a human cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c47">47</xref>). Pol &#x003bc; expression data are thus consistent with a putative contribution of Pol &#x003bc; in IgV gene SHM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c45">45</xref>), a process that occurs specifically in the GC centroblast nucleus.</p></sec><sec><title>Human Pol &#x003bc; overexpression in a B cell line with constitutive SHM</title><p>The Ramos cell line is characterized as an IgM-expressing Burkitt's lymphoma line that shows a high rate of constitutive IgV diversification during standard <italic>in vitro</italic> culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c16">16</xref>). Since Ramos V<sub>H</sub> diversification shows the major hallmarks of Ig gene hypermutation, this cell line is considered a good <italic>in vivo</italic> model for SHM analysis. The functional consequences of human Pol &#x003bc; overexpression in Ramos cells were evaluated after retroviral transduction with human Pol &#x003bc; cDNA (see Materials and Methods). Construction of empty and human Pol &#x003bc;-cloned retroviral vectors, infection and clonal selection of either parental or transduced Ramos cells, were as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f2">2</xref>A, western blot analysis of two of the selected clones (P1 and P2) showed a marked overexpression of human Pol &#x003bc; (8- and 59-fold, respectively) relative to the levels in control (empty vector-transduced) clones C1 and C2, and parental Ramos clones (data not shown). Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of clone C2 cells using anti-Pol &#x003bc; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f2">2</xref>B) showed endogenous Pol &#x003bc;, levels as for Ramos cells, distributed in foci-like structures similar to those described in GC-B cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f1">1</xref>D). Ramos and clone C2 cells showed this pattern in equivalent proportions (&#x0223c;5&#x02013;10%). In contrast, a large proportion (&#x0003e;85%) of P2 clone cells presented a more pronounced and intense foci (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f2">2</xref>B), in good agreement with its 59-fold higher expression of Pol &#x003bc;. No positive signal was detected either in Ramos cells or in clone C2 or P2 cells when pre-immune antiserum was used for analyses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f2">2</xref>B). These results clearly indicated that Pol &#x003bc; can be overexpressed in the Ramos cell line with no major alteration in viability, and that the excess protein accumulates in the natural nuclear reservoirs, forming foci-like structures.</p></sec><sec><title>Human Pol &#x003bc; overexpression in Ramos cell line promotes an increase in the somatic mutation rate</title><p>To evaluate the putative implication of Pol &#x003bc; in the hypermutation mechanism, we analyzed whether human Pol &#x003bc; overexpression affected the final products of the SHM process. At 3.5 months post-transduction, genomic DNA was prepared from selected clones corresponding to either the parental or transduced Ramos cell line, all cultured in parallel, and Ig locus V<sub>H</sub> and C&#x003bc; regions were amplified specifically by PCR (Materials and Methods). The cloned PCR products were fully sequenced for a total of 206 clones, 184 corresponding to V<sub>H</sub> 4&#x02013;34 Ig gene and 22 corresponding to the C&#x003bc; region. V<sub>H</sub> diversification in Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing Ramos cells was not influenced by a general mutator phenotype, since mutations did not occur in C&#x003bc; regions (data not shown). A database was created for specific mutational events that included mutations detected in 82 sequences from both the parental Ramos cells and from the vector-transduced clones (collectively referred to as control Ramos), and those in 102 sequences from Pol &#x003bc;-overproducing clones. Mutations were defined by comparison with the canonical V<sub>H</sub> sequence from the parental Ramos cell line (GenBank sequence AY786364). The mutational database was created after the sequences (mutations) had been evaluated for phylogenetic relationships, to avoid multiple iteration of a specific mutation. The composite database consisted of 184 distinct, unselected mutated&#x0002f;unmutated V<sub>H</sub> sequences, covering 27.962 and 34.782 bp for control and Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing Ramos cells, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh929tb1">1</xref>). Data analysis indicated that average mutation frequency in Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing Ramos subclones increased by 290% (3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> mutations&#x0002f;base) compared to control Ramos cells (1.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> mutations&#x0002f;base). Excess human Pol &#x003bc; appeared to be integrated physiologically in the SHM machinery, as it specifically increased the mutation rate but did not induce a high frequency loss of cell surface-expressed IgM (data not shown), at difference from overexpression of TdT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c16">16</xref>), the closest DNA polymerase relative of Pol &#x003bc; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c44">44</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>V<sub>H</sub> mutations in Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing Ramos cells</title><p>Most independent mutations in Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing Ramos cells were single-nucleotide substitutions (109 out of 111; 98%), in accordance with reported SHM features. This is consistent with a role for Pol &#x003bc; in the generation of somatic mutations in the hypermutation domain. The transition&#x0002f;transversion ratio (Ts&#x0002f;Tv) in Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing Ramos cells was 0.75 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh929tb1">1</xref>), in contrast to the known preference for transitions over transversions in SHM. The Ts&#x0002f;Tv ratio in our control (parental and vector-transduced) Ramos cells was even more pronounced toward transversions, however, with a Ts&#x0002f;Tv ratio of 0.46 (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh929tb1">1</xref>).</p><p>Human Pol &#x003bc; overexpression influenced nucleotide target selection in Ramos cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh929tb1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh929tb2">2</xref>). The majority of mutations were found in C (59.6%) and G (36.8%) residues, rather than in A&#x0002f;T residues (3.6%); this nucleotide-targeting preference was similar to that showed by our control (parental and vector-transduced) Ramos cells, although more pronounced. Detailed analysis of the mutational spectra obtained following the Pol &#x003bc; overexpression (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh929tb2">2</xref>) showed that C&#x02192;G transversion dominated (34%), followed by C&#x02192;T transition (23%); the least frequent point mutations corresponded to T&#x02192;C transition and T&#x02192;A transversion (1% each).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f3">3</xref> shows a summary of the nucleotide sequences surrounding the residues targeted by the hypermutator machinery in control and Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing Ramos cells. Data analysis indicated that the sequences most frequently mutated in Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing cells (nucleotide positions 66, 74, 156 and 218) and the mutations introduced exactly matched those in control Ramos cells. Many control cell-derived mutations were also represented in sequences from Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing Ramos cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f3">3</xref>). The analysis also showed good correlation between point mutations and consensus RGYW&#x0002f;WRCY motifs (indicated with boxes in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f3">3</xref>), predicted as mutational hotspots in the SHM process. Both control and Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing Ramos cells showed hotspot mutability, with about 45% of mutations targeted to these consensus motifs, concurring with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c16">16</xref>).</p><p>It could be inferred that Pol &#x003bc; overexpression in Ramos cells reinforces the C&#x0002f;G mutational efficiency of the constitutive SHM machinery, regardless of whether the mutations are embedded in a RGYW&#x0002f;WRCY motif. This would affect the proportions of each individual mutation in the final spectrum and mutate C&#x0002f;G residues at the same rate.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> human Pol &#x003bc; activity on template-primer structures from Ramos IgV<sub>H</sub> region is largely compatible with the <italic>in vivo</italic> mutation spectrum</title><p>Purified recombinant human Pol &#x003bc; behaves as an error-prone DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, acting as a strong mutator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c56">56</xref>). To test whether the biochemical features of human Pol &#x003bc; are compatible with the mutation pattern in Pol &#x003bc;-overproducing Ramos cells, we analyzed <italic>in vitro</italic> misincorporation by human Pol &#x003bc; on several template-primer molecules representing natural sequences. Polymerization substrates were selected according to mutational spectra from Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing Ramos cells, to generate a set of molecules corresponding to the most frequent IgV<sub>H</sub>4&#x02013;34 gene mutational hotspots, irrespective of their inclusion in a RGYW&#x0002f;WRCY consensus motif (nucleotide positions 66, 74, 156, 193, 210 and 218; see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f4">4</xref>). Template-primer structures were obtained by hybridization of synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the mutational hotspots, such that the <italic>in vivo</italic> mutated nucleotide was presented either as the first templating base (positions 66, 156, 193, 210 and 218; white letters on black background in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f4">4</xref>), or as the first nucleotide to be inserted (position 74). Using a standard <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA polymerization assay and appropriate oligonucleotide primers, Pol &#x003bc; misincorporation was evaluated in the presence of all complementary and non-complementary dNTPs. Nucleotide position 74 was frequently mutated from G to T (10 and 3 times in Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing and control Ramos cells, respectively; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f3">3</xref>). Pol &#x003bc; was able to introduce T in front of the template C, generating a C:T mismatch that was subsequently extended to establish the <italic>in vivo</italic> G&#x02192;T transversion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f4">4</xref>). This C:T mismatch occurs at a concentration (2 &#x003bc;M) similar to that of the correct nucleotide. A similar result was obtained when position 218 was tested as template (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f4">4</xref>); in this case, the efficiency of the Pol &#x003bc;-generated C:A mismatch was similar to that for correct C:G base pair. After replication of the mutated strand, this misinsertion led to a C&#x02192;T transition, as also observed (15 times) in Pol &#x003bc;-overproducing Ramos cells. These preferred mutations could be explained by a mechanism involving misalignment of the primer terminus to be paired to the adjacent templating base, through a dislocation mechanism originally described for Pol &#x003b2; [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c57">57</xref>)], and Pol &#x003bc; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c46">46</xref>). In addition to the changes introduced at positions 74 and 219, those at positions 22, 167 and 338 can be also explained by such a mistemplating mechanism (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f3">3</xref>).</p><p>When nucleotide position 193 was tested as template, the preferred Pol &#x003bc;-generated mismatch was G:T. After one replication round, it originated the same single base substitution (G&#x02192;A transition; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f3">3</xref>) detected <italic>in vivo</italic> (four times) in Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing Ramos cells. The preference for the G:T mismatch can be explained if Pol &#x003bc; is also able to use the adjacent template nucleotide (dA) without realignment of the primer, favoring insertion of a T residue. A mechanism in which template misalignment is stabilized by an incoming dNTP was originally described for Pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c58">58</xref>). A similar &#x02018;misincorporation&#x02019; preference was observed when position 210 was tested as template (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f4">4</xref>); in this case, the G&#x02192;A transition observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (four times) was also compatible with a dNTP-stabilized transient misalignment event promoted by Pol &#x003bc; <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition to the changes introduced at positions 193 and 210, those at positions 52, 81, 86, 134, 143, 189, 216, 231, 237, 240, 254, 256, 288, 290, 293, 301, 311 and 324 can be also explained by such a mistemplating mechanism (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f3">3</xref>).</p><p>When position 156 was tested as template, Pol &#x003bc; generated the C:C mismatch (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f4">4</xref>), which resulted in a C&#x02192;G transversion like that obtained (15 times) <italic>in vivo</italic> in Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing Ramos cells after one replication round. In this case, however, a higher concentration of non-complementary dNTPs (50 &#x003bc;M) was necessary, and other mismatches (C:T, C:A) were also generated. In contrast, when position 66 was tested as template (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f4">4</xref>), no misincorporation was observed <italic>in vitro</italic>, and the <italic>in vivo</italic> mutations found at this position (14 C&#x02192;G transversions; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f3">3</xref>) thus could not be explained directly by the sole action of Pol &#x003bc;.</p></sec><sec><title>Pol &#x003bc; mutator ability is stimulated on DNA strand break repair intermediates</title><p>Since single or double-strand breaks could be one of the initiator events for the SHM mechanism, and assuming that Pol &#x003bc; may have a role in DNA DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c47">47</xref>), we examined whether different substrates representing DNA repair intermediates affected Pol &#x003bc; mutator ability <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is worth noting that human Pol &#x003bc;, like other X family DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c61">61</xref>), shows a marked preference for binding DNA substrates that contain short gaps (J.F. and L.B., unpublished results). We thus examined the mutational ability of Pol &#x003bc; on nicked versus gapped (1 or 2 nt) DNA substrates compared to DNA template-primer substrate.</p><p>Pol &#x003bc; used a nicked DNA substrate, preferentially inserting the nucleotide complementary to the template base immediately adjacent to the nick (data not shown), which suggests Pol &#x003bc; capacity for limited strand-displacement. Pol &#x003bc; inserted the other 3 nt very poorly, indicating that nicked DNA is a poor substrate for Pol &#x003bc; mutagenesis compared to the template&#x0002f;primer, in which several templating bases are available (unpaired).</p><p>When position 74, previously described as a mutational hotspot in Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing Ramos cells, was evaluated in a 1 nt gapped DNA substrate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f5">5</xref>A), Pol &#x003bc; preferentially inserted the nucleotide (dG) complementary to the only available templating base (C), although it was also able to insert dT at the same nucleotide concentration (10&#x02013;20 nM). As for template&#x0002f;primer sequences, this &#x02018;mismatch specificity&#x02019; can be explained by a slippage-mediated dislocation mechanism, in which the next adjacent base (dA) can be used for templating dT insertion (see the scheme at Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f5">5</xref>A). In this case, availability of the adjacent base as template implies minimal displacement of the downstream DNA strand. After realignment and potential ligation of the mismatched terminus to the downstream strand, the G&#x02192;T base substitution would be established at position 74.</p><p>When position 74 was tested in a 2 nt gapped substrate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f5">5</xref>B), two bases were available for templating the first insertion, with no strand displacement required. The template misalignment potential of Pol &#x003bc; was thus enhanced on this substrate, since incorporation of the non-complementary dTTP was even more efficient than that of the complementary nucleotide. As depicted in the scheme at Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f5">5</xref>B, immediate ligation of this dislocation intermediate after TMP insertion would lead to a frameshift mutation, concurring with previous speculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c46">46</xref>). A second insertion event leading to a &#x0002b;2 product was readily obtained with dTTP alone, however, suggesting that the dislocation event is transient. After primer realignment, formation of a new A:T pair would establish the C:T mismatch as a single base substitution, precluding formation of a &#x02212;1 frameshift product. It is also possible that, after template realignment and mismatch formation, a mismatch-extender DNA poymerase such as Pol &#x003b6;, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c62">62</xref>) could enhance the reaction. A final ligation step, implying a matched primer terminus, would generate the base substitution seen in <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments.</p><p>When position 193 was tested as template in gapped-DNA substrates (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f6">6</xref>A and B), the preferred Pol &#x003bc;-catalyzed misincorporation observed (G:T) was compatible with the G&#x02192;A transition found in Pol &#x003bc;-overproducing Ramos cells. This specificity again supports a mistemplating mutation mechanism that does not require template iteration, since the distortion in the template strand is favored&#x0002f;maintained by an incoming nucleotide complementary to an adjacent templating base (see schemes at Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f6">6</xref>), and may (1nt-gap; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f6">6</xref>A) or may not (2 nt gap; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh929f6">6</xref>B) require strand displacement. Template distortion is also sufficiently transient in this case to allow creation of a G:T mismatch that can be further elongated (in the case of the 2 nt gap) to avoid the formation of a &#x02212;1 frameshift product.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Human DNA Pol &#x003bc; is a recently identified DNA polymerase of the mammalian Pol X family, closely related to TdT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c44">44</xref>). Recombinant purified Pol &#x003bc; nonetheless has intrinsic biochemical properties differentiable from those of TdT; thus, although Pol &#x003bc; shows mild terminal transferase activity, its catalytic polymerization efficiency is strongly enhanced by the presence of a template strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c44">44</xref>). Pol &#x003bc; and TdT also differ in their expression patterns: while TdT expression is specifically restricted to primary lymphoid tissues, Pol &#x003bc; mRNA expression is preferentially associated to secondary lymphoid tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c44">44</xref>). Here, we confirmed this preferential expression at the protein level, showing association of human Pol &#x003bc; to tonsil-derived GC-B cells. Moreover, Pol &#x003bc; is localized entirely in the nuclear compartment of purified human centroblasts, forming foci-like structures very similar to those formed by several DNA repair proteins in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c55">55</xref>). Pol &#x003bc; was proposed to be part of the cellular response to DNA DSB, because it directly interacts with protein factors involved in the end joining pathway, and it forms nuclear foci which coincide with those formed by &#x003b3;H2AX histone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c47">47</xref>). However, the Pol &#x003bc; foci observed in Ramos, as those observed in sorted centroblasts (this manuscript) do not require exogenous damage suggesting a more specific role of Pol &#x003bc; in processes, as SHM, that could correlate with the appearance of specific (targeted) DSBs. In agreement with Pol &#x003bc; participation in SHM, murine Pol &#x003bc; expression is up-regulated in response to immunization, and Pol &#x003bc; protein is found in GC that developed in immunized spleen (D. Lucas, M. T. Lain, M. A. Gonzalez, O. Dominguez, J. F. Ruiz, J. Chamorro, C. Martinez-A, L. Blanco and A. Bernad, manuscript submitted).</p><sec><title>Pol &#x003bc; activity could contribute to the SHM process</title><p>As shown in this paper, human Pol &#x003bc; overexpression in an <italic>in vivo</italic> system that recreates the SHM process, such as the Burkitt's lymphoma-derived Ramos cell line, did not alter cell viability and physiology parameters, but increased the mutational rate at IgV<sub>H</sub> regions of Ramos cells (2.8-fold compared to control cells). This effect was specific of IgV<sub>H</sub> genes, as no mutations were detected in the of IgM locus constant region (C<sub>&#x003bc;</sub>), and IgM surface expression was unaffected. Mutations in Pol &#x003bc;-overexpressing cells were mainly base substitutions, targeted preferentially to C and G residues (94% of all mutations detected). This indicates that human Pol &#x003bc; overexpression enhances the previously reported natural bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c16">16</xref>), increasing mutation at G&#x0002f;C residues. In contrast to our data, TdT overexpression in Ramos cells did not increase base substitutions, but significantly affected the membrane IgM expression as a consequence of untemplated nucleotide insertions at DNA breaks scattered throughout the IgV domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c16">16</xref>).</p><p>In accordance with the mutation spectra from the Ramos <italic>in vivo</italic> model, analysis of Pol &#x003bc; polymerization activity on hotspot-containing DNA substrates supported the Pol &#x003bc; ability to generate the same specific mutations <italic>in vitro</italic>. Biochemical analysis showed that Pol &#x003bc; mutational specificity is dictated largely by the sequence context; whereas a single-nucleotide repeat is sufficient to induce slippage-mediated template misalignment (dislocation), as reported by Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c46">46</xref>), other sequence contexts are less predictable, but effectively trigger misalignments. As shown here for positions 193 and 210, and for other non-specific sequence contexts (data not shown), Pol &#x003bc; can promote mutations based on a dNTP stabilization-mediated mechanism of template misalignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c58">58</xref>). Based on its dislocation capacity, a simplistic model was proposed, in which Pol &#x003bc; would promote mainly frameshift mutations rather than base substitutions, as an argument against a role of Pol &#x003bc; in SHM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c46">46</xref>). Our data indicate that <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in vitro</italic> Pol &#x003bc;-dependent mutations led preferentially to single-nucleotide substitutions. This suggests that Pol &#x003bc;-induced template distortions are transient, leading to the mismatched pairs responsible for the base substitutions. Moreover, Pol &#x003bc; mutational abilities are greatly enhanced on gapped DNA substrates, concurring with a &#x02018;DNA repair&#x02019; model that fixes certain mutations throughout the SHM process.</p><p>These findings support a potential role for Pol &#x003bc; in the physiological SHM process acting preferentially by promoting mutation on G&#x0002f;C base pairs in the course of error-prone DNA breaks-mediated repair.</p></sec><sec><title>How many polymerases contribute to SHM?</title><p>Considering all mechanistic evidences, a plausible model for SHM envisions formation of programmed DNA breaks (single- or double-strand breaks) in the hypermutation domain of the Ig locus, to recruit several unique DNA polymerases (Pol&#x003b9;, Pol &#x003bc;, Pol&#x003b7;, mutator polymerases, and Pol &#x003b6;, mismatch-extender polymerase) that could act in concert for the error-prone repair of initial or further-processed lesions (after exonucleolytic action). The notion that multiple DNA polymerases are involved in SHM has been previously proposed by several groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c43">43</xref>). However, the preferential participation of any of the DNA polymerases involved would be determined by the nature of the initiating lesion, or controlled by other proteins responsible for their specific recruitment. The final output of the reaction would be conditioned by the biochemical properties of each enzyme and the sequence context in which it can act. This concurs with evidence for the existence of two distinct mutators or mutational phases, one directed to A&#x0002f;T residues and other to G&#x0002f;C residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c63">63</xref>). Indeed, it was suggested that Pol &#x003b7; promotes A&#x0002f;T mutations during SHM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c64">64</xref>), and here we show that Pol &#x003bc; would act preferentially on G&#x0002f;C residues, as also proposed for Pol &#x003b9; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c39">39</xref>). Finally, after resolution and ligation, several cellular repair systems could allow fixation of some of the mutations introduced, erasing others. Mouse knockout models analyses were expected to provide a definitive answer to the putative individual roles of the various DNA polymerases involved in SHM. Nonetheless, homozygous knockout mice for the Pol &#x003b6; gene suffer early embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c65">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c67">67</xref>), and direct analysis of its role in Ig SHM remains unevaluated. Moreover, analyses of Pol &#x003bc; [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c48">48</xref>); D. Lucas, M. T. Lain, M. A. Gonzalez, O. Dominguez, J. F. Ruiz, J. Chamorro, C. Martinez-A, L. Blanco and A. Bernad, manuscript submitted] and Pol &#x003b9; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh929c40">40</xref>) homozygous knockout mice show no gross defect in the hypermutation mechanism. It is thus possible that the lack of an SHM-deficient phenotype is due to redundancy among the specialized DNA polymerases for the short gap-filling highly error-prone DNA synthesis that seems to be linked to SHM process. Further analyses, including generation of double or multiple knockout mice, are needed to define the contribution of Pol &#x003bc; and the other error-prone DNA polymerases to the SHM process.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh929f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Human Pol &#x003bc; is expressed preferentially in GC-B cells forming nuclear foci.
