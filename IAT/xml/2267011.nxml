This allowed identification of candidate host factors in a simple non-redundant, genetically tractable system. From a library of 7,216 double stranded RNAs (dsRNA), we identified &#x0223c;226 host genes, including two tyrosine kinases, Abelson (Abl) kinase and PDGF- and VEGF-receptor related (Pvr), a homolog of the Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). We further examined the role of these two kinases in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> binding and internalization into mammalian cells. Both kinases are phosphorylated upon infection and recruited to the site of bacterial attachment, but their roles in the infectious process are distinct. We provide evidence that PDGFR&#x003b2; may function as a receptor, as inhibition of PDGFR&#x003b2; by RNA interference or by PDGFR&#x003b2; neutralizing antibodies significantly reduces bacterial binding, whereas depletion of Abl kinase has no effect on binding. Bacterial internalization can occur through activation of PDGFR&#x003b2; or through independent activation of Abl kinase, culminating in phosphorylation of the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Vav2, and two actin nucleators, WAVE2 and Cortactin. Finally, we show that TARP, a bacterial type III secreted actin nucleator implicated in entry, is a target of Abl kinase. Together, our results demonstrate that PDGFR&#x003b2; and Abl kinases function redundantly to promote efficient uptake of this obligate intracellular parasite.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> infections are a worldwide problem; they are the leading cause of preventable blindness in developing nations and the most common cause of sexually transmitted disease in the Western world.

Infection is initiated by binding and internalization of the extracellular infectious form, the elementary body (EB), which is small (0.3 &#x000b5;m) and metabolically inactive, into target host cells. EBs enter into a membrane-bound compartment, which quickly dissociates from the endocytic pathway and avoids phagolysosomal fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000021-Hackstadt1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Within a few hours, EBs differentiate into larger (1 &#x000b5;m) reticulate bodies (RBs) that represent the metabolically active, replicative form. The RBs replicate by binary fission within the enlarging inclusion over a 48&#x02013;72 hour time period, and then undergo a second differentiation process back to infectious EBs, which are released from host cells.</p><p>The mechanisms involved in binding and uptake, including the identity of the bacterial ligand and the host cell receptor, are incompletely defined. The fact that chlamydiae can productively infect most cultured cells suggests that the receptor(s) may be widespread, that chlamydiae utilize multiple means of entry, and/or that these organisms inject their own receptor, possibly by type III secretion. For some species and serovars, including the more invasive Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV) serovar L2, heparan sulfate has been suggested to act as a bridging molecule for a relatively weak and reversible interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000021-Zhang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000021-Wuppermann1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> that is followed by a stronger, more specific binding to an unidentified secondary receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000021-Carabeo1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000021-Fudyk1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Genetically tractable organisms, including <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> provide an attractive alternate avenue of exploration. The ease and availability of using RNA interference (RNAi) to inactivate gene expression and the lack of redundancy in the genome compared to mammals affords the opportunity to uncover complicated or redundant signaling pathways that might otherwise be overlooked. In this paper, we describe a high throughput RNAi based screen to identify host factors required for early steps in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection. We have focused on a subset of candidates known to be important for Rac-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements, including PDGF- and VEGF-receptor related (Pvr; a homolog of the Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)), Abelson (Abl) kinase, Vav, WAVE, and Cortactin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000021-Liu1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000021-Boyle1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Using genetic, chemical, and biochemical approaches, we examined the role of these signaling molecules in mammalian infections. We demonstrate that PDGFR&#x003b2; functions as a receptor for <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>. Once bound, bacterial internalization can occur either through activation of PDGFR&#x003b2; or through independent activation of Abl kinase. Activation of these kinases leads to phosphorylation of the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Vav2, and several actin nucleators, including WAVE2, Cortactin, and TARP, that likely promote efficient uptake of this obligate intracellular parasite.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>RNAi screen to identify host proteins required for <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection</title><p>We have previously shown that <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> S2 cells recapitulates early steps in the interaction of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> with mammalian cells, including binding, entry, and escape from phagolysomal fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000021-Elwell1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

This observation could explain why the significantly diminished phosphorylation of EBs in Abl/Arg<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells did not affect entry, especially given that TARP encodes many tyrosine residues that could serve as putative phosphorylation sites. Alternatively, TARP phosphorylation was not completely abolished in the Abl/Arg<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, suggesting that other tyrosine kinases, such as Src family kinases, may target TARP. This residual TARP phosphorylation could be sufficient to mediate bacterial entry.

Our results further suggest that these two pathways function in parallel and are thus functionally redundant. Since STI571 can inhibit both Abl and PDGFR kinases, this finding may explain why bacterial entry is diminished with this drug but unaffected in Abl/Arg<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells.

Abl kinase is recruited to and activated at the site of EB binding in a PDGFR-independent manner and phosphorylates TARP. Activation of PDGFR and Abl kinase leads to recruitment and activation of downstream targets, including Vav2, WAVE2, and Cortactin. Rac and Arp 2/3 are recruited to the site of entry. Actin polymerization is stimulated through the WAVE2/Arp2/3 pathway, Cortactin/Arp2/3 pathway, and/or directly by TARP. Since binding and entry of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> was not completely abolished under our experimental system, this bacterium most likely utilizes other receptors and pathways that converge with these molecules to ensure efficient Rac and Arp2/3 activation for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> uptake.
