The role of the endogenous lectin, galectin-1, in attachment, spreading, and migration of human RPE cells was investigated from a therapeutic perspective.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Human RPE cells were treated with galectin-1 concentrations that ranged 0&#x02013;250 &#x000b5;g/ml. Cell viability was tested by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. Galectin-1 binding to the RPE cells was investigated by immunocytochemistry. Attachment of RPE cells was assessed on 96-well plates coated with laminin, or fibronectin, or galectin-1, or the glycoprotein-lectin combinations and subsequent MTT-testing. RPE migration in the absence or presence of galectin-1 on the respective substrates was tested using a modified Boyden chamber assay with platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB as the chemoattractant. Cellular spreading was characterized by cytoplasmic halo formation of RPE cells after three hours in contact with the surface coating.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Galectin-1 bound to the cell surface. Binding could be inhibited by a &#x003b2;-galactoside. MTT assays revealed no toxicity within control limits for the concentration range tested. When added to the medium, galectin-1 dose-dependently inhibited RPE cell attachment, spreading, and migration by more than 70%, irrespective of the substratum tested. When coated onto the plastic surface, galectin-1 alone impaired spreading and migration of RPE cells, and reduced attachment to and migration on fibronectin by up to 80%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Galectin-1 inhibits RPE cell attachment, migration, and spreading in vitro with no apparent cytotoxicity.

Clinically, PVR is characterized by the dispersion of a variety of cells into the vitreous and subsequent formation of scar-like fibrocellular membranes on the surfaces of the neuroretina, which gives rise to subsequent tractional retinal detachment or re-detachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>].</p><p>PVR membranes typically contain a predominance of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Thus, it is assumed that the development of PVR critically depends on the capacity of these cells for proliferation, migration, and matrix remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Following a retinal injury, RPE cells, which normally form a monolayer of polarized, highly specialized nonproliferating cells at Bruch&#x02019;s membrane, disseminate and attach to multiple loci on the neuroretina and the vitreous. There, they undergo a pseudometaplastic transformation into fibroblast-like cells, which then spread along the retinal surface, actively dividing and migrating. These processes are suggested to be the key cellular events in the onset of PVR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>].</p><p>Blocking these early cellular responses could be viewed as a potential therapeutic target for improving the overall prognosis of surgical treatment. In the past, pharmacologic prevention of PVR membrane formation has been based chiefly on anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. However, the results from these approaches have been disappointing, largely because of their ineffectiveness or their ensuing retinal toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. As a consequence, no pharmacological adjuvant has yet been established as part of a routine treatment for PVR, and a need remains for nontoxic agents that will specifically block cellular activities such as RPE proliferation and attachment in PVR. One promising approach would involve the use of endogenous effectors that normally exert control over cell movement and proliferation. Our report focuses a protein that is known to regulate cell adhesion, attachment, migration, and proliferation.</p><p>Accumulating evidence reveals the role of cell surface glycans as versatile biochemical signals that operate via translation of sugar-encoded information by carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. The range of lectin-protein recognition processes in situ covers an extensive activity profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. In this respect, the galectin family figures prominently, due to their multifunctionality. These proteins are characterized functionally by their affinity for &#x003b2;-galactosides and structurally by their &#x003b2;-sandwich fold with a central Trp residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>].</p><p>Because they are often positioned at branch ends of glycan chains, &#x003b2;-galactosides or derivatives thereof represent ideal docking sites for galectins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Of the many members of the galectin family, galectin-1 is perhaps the best characterized, and is found expressed intracellularly, on the cell surface, and also within the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. When externalized, galectin-1 participates in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions through binding with distinct glycoconjugates present on the cell surface as well as in the extracellular matrix (ECM). These glycoconjugates may include neutral glycolipids and ganglioside GM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>], the &#x003b1;1/&#x003b1;5/&#x003b1;7/&#x003b2;1-integrin subunits in a cell-type specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>], laminin (Lam) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>], fibronectin (Fn) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>], or suitably glycosylated mucin or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan chains, as well as several immune cell CD markers. Many of these listed components have been shown to be present in PVR membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>].</p><p>Depending on the counter-receptor and its glycosylation, galectin-1 can differentially affect a variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>], adhesion and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>], apoptosis in activated T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>], and induction of anoikis in pancreatic carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. However, it must be noted that these effects are highly cell type-specific and therefore the response to galectin-1 binding may vary with the cell type under study.</p><p>Most of the cell-adhesion molecules and ECM proteins that favor the adhesion and migration of RPE cells contain substantial numbers of &#x003b2;-galactosyl residues, which are ligands for lectins in general and galectins in particular. Previous work with the agglutinin from the edible mushroom <italic>Agaricus bisporus</italic> has revealed substantial inhibition of RPE migration and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated the presence of galectin-1 in PVR membranes and also have shown that human RPE cells produce galectin-1 both in vivo and in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. Galectin-1 has been implicated in the regulation of cell adhesion, migration, and cell growth in a wide variety of cell types, including activated T cells, vascular smooth muscle, neuroblastoma, and pancreatic carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>].</p><p>It was therefore of interest to further investigate the potential role of extracellular galectin-1 in the in vitro behavior of RPE cells. Treatment with an endogenous lectin, such as galectin-1, may disclose a new perspective for re-programming key cellular PVR-related events, using an endogenous substance synthesized by RPE cells themselves. Our report is a first step toward establishing the validity of this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Galectin-1 purification, labeling, and quality controls</title><p>Galectin-1 was purified after recombinant production by affinity chromatography on lactosylated Sepharose 4B as critical step and elution with 100&#x000a0;mM lactose in PBS (20&#x000a0;mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>/Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 150&#x000a0;mM NaCl, pH 7.2) followed by dialysis against the same buffer without lactose. The purity of the final product was checked by gel electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide running gel and mass spectrometry on a YTOF instrument type Q-Tof2 (Waters Micromass, Manchester, UK), as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. Biotinylation was performed under optimized activity-preserving conditions with biotinyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (0.5&#x000a0;mg/mg of protein; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), predissolved in dimethylformamide, in carbonate reaction buffer (0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>; pH 8; 0.9% NaCl, 20&#x000a0;mM lactose). The degrees of labeling and carbohydrate-binding activity were measured by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and solid-phase and cell assays, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. In detail, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed using an Amersham Biosciences IPGphorTM isoelectric focusing (IEF) unit (Freiburg, Germany) for the first dimension followed by separation on 12.5% polyacrylamide running gels for the second dimension using an Amersham Biosciences Hoefer SEM 600 model (Freiburg, Germany). Gels were stained by application of reagents of a silver staining kit (Amersham Biosciences) and were processed using an ImageScanner (Amersham Biosciences). For solid-phase assays, the surface of microtiter plate wells (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen) was coated with 50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l PBS (20&#x000a0;mM, pH 7.2) containing the lectin-reactive glycoprotein (0.5&#x000b5;g asialofetuin obtained by desialylation of commercial fetuin; Sigma) at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C overnight.

Quantitative determination of carbohydrate-dependent galectin-1 binding using streptavidin/R-phycoerythrin (1:40) as a fluorescent marker (Sigma) was performed by flow cytofluorometry in a FACScan instrument (Becton-Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of human RPE cells and human RPE cell culture</title><p>Eyes from five human donors (three male, two female) were obtained from the Munich University Hospital Eye Bank and were processed within 4&#x02013;16 h after death. Donors ranged from 22 to 59 years of age. None of the donors had a known history of eye disease. Methods for securing human tissue were humane, included proper consent and approval, complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, and were approved by the local ethics committee. Human RPE cells were harvested following the procedures described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>].</p><p>In brief, whole eyes were thoroughly cleansed in 0.9% NaCl solution, immersed in 5% poly(1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-iodine (Jodobac, Bode-Chemie, Hamburg, Germany), and rinsed again in the sodium-chloride solution. The anterior segment from each donor eye was removed and the posterior poles were examined with the aid of a binocular stereomicroscope to confirm the absence of gross retinal disease. Next, the neural retinas were carefully peeled away from the RPE-choroid-sclera using fine forceps. The eye cup was rinsed with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> -free Hank&#x02019;s balanced salt solution, and filled with 0.25% trypsin (GibcoBRL, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 4 min at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The trypsin was carefully aspirated and replaced with Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagles medium (DMEM, Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS, Biochrom). Using a pipette, the media was gently agitated, releasing the RPE into the media by avoiding damage to Bruch&#x02019;s membrane. The RPE cell suspension was transferred to a 6-well plate containing 2&#x000a0;ml of DMEM (Biochrom) supplemented with 20% FCS (Biochrom), checked for cross contamination using a microscope and maintained at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

RPE cells of passages 3&#x02013;7 were used for experiments. When indicated, different concentrations of galectin-1 were included in the culture medium. The tetrazolium dye-reduction assay, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5&#x02013;126 diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich), was used to test for cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>].

After the respective incubation times with or without galectin-1 in the medium cells were rinsed with PBS, and 150&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of MTT working solution (1.5&#x000a0;ml MTT stock, 2&#x000a0;mg/ml in PBS, plus 28.5&#x000a0;ml DMEM) was added and incubation was continued at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 20 min. Within this incubation period cells were repeatedly monitored by light microscopy to assure that the blue formazan crystals did not form outside of the cell. The formazan crystals were then dissolved by the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 70&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l/well).

Cells were observed by phase-contrast microscopy. Regular cell spreading with intercellular spaces was invariably seen in untreated controls 90 min after plating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the galectin-1-treated cells, however, both the morphology and the cell density were markedly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). Cell spreading was less frequent, with a predominance of rounded cells or loose cell clusters, which suggested that adhesion between cells was stronger than adhesion between cells and the substratum. This may in part arise from the cross-linking activity of the homodimeric lectin, which&#x02013;when able to bind cells&#x02013;has the capacity to agglutinate cells. To pinpoint carbohydrate-dependent binding as relevant, we included the inhibitor, &#x003b2;-lactose, in the assay panel.

In parallel experiments, RPE cells were initially incubated with soluble Fn alone, followed by incubation with 125&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml galectin-1. Alternatively, cells were either left untreated (control) or treated with soluble Fn alone or with 125&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml galectin-1 alone. Saturation of RPE cells with Fn alone had no effect on RPE attachment when compared to untreated control cells. However, preincubation with soluble Fn, followed by addition of galectin-1, or addition of Fn that had been initially incubated with galectin-1 resulted in an inhibitory effect on RPE attachment that was equivalent to that induced by galectin-1 alone (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of galectin-1 on RPE attachment may most likely arise from cell surface-binding of galectin-1, rather than from binding to or saturating Fn. This possibility would be in agreement with the immunocytochemical data. Furthermore, the presence of an excess of Fn or binding of galectin-1 to Fn does not interfere with the inhibitory effects of galectin-1.</p><p>As part of delineating whether galectin-1 itself is a substratum for RPE cell attachment, we coated 96-well plates with 2&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/cm<sup>2</sup> of either galectin-1, Fn, or Lam, or a mixture of galectin-1 and glycoprotein. The overall attachment rate of RPE cells was higher on Fn- than on Lam-coated wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). In terms of numbers of attached cells per well, galectin-1, Lam, and uncoated plastic were equally attractive for RPE cells, suggesting that Lam does not promote, but also does not inhibit, attachment of RPE cells to tissue culture plastic. Fn markedly increased RPE cell adhesion to levels 231% higher than in the control uncoated wells.

In this study, we found that galectin-1 added to the medium of cultured RPE cells is an effective inhibitor of many of the processes involved in these early events of PVR pathogenesis. With no visible toxicity or effects on RPE viability, the lectin inhibited RPE attachment, spreading, and migration at concentrations less than 62.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/ml. The galectin-1-mediated effects were dependent on the binding of &#x003b2;-galactosides, as ascertained by haptenic inhibition by &#x003b2;-lactose. As a substratum, galectin-1 impaired spreading and migration of RPE cells and profoundly reduced attachment to and migration on Fn. As previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>], we confirmed a clear substratum preference of RPE cells to Fn over Lam. Since Fn is a main component of the provisional ECM in early PVR, galectin-1-mediated inhibition of RPE attachment and migration on Fn, both when added exogenously and as a component of the ECM, underscores the potential of galectin-1 to modify the behavior of RPE cells on this important substratum.</p><p>When localized extracellularly, galectins are active in modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in a positive or negative manner, depending on the biologic and physiologic context, as has been shown experimentally for various types of human tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. Relevant bridging ligands include the poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains present on Lam, Fn, or integrins and branched glycans in glycoproteins or glycolipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>]. In the present study, galectin-1 added to the medium in the dose range studied caused a marked reduction in adhesion, spreading, and migration levels of cultured RPE cells, accompanied by rounding and agglutination of the cells.</p><p>In view of the cell-surface binding of galectin-1, as determined by biotinylated galectin-1, it is possible that this lectin can exert its inhibitory activities on RPE behavior by blocking access of physiologic ligands to cell surface receptors. This would have the effect of disrupting focal adhesions, which could then result in the observed morphological alterations. For example, in carcinoma cells, relevant glycoprotein ligands of galectin-1 were identified as lamp-1 and lamp-2, carcinoembryonic antigen, and the fibronectin receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>]. In skeletal myocytes and human smooth muscle cells, galectin-1 interacts with &#x003b1;7&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;1&#x003b2;1 integrins, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>]. Of note, &#x003b2;1-integrin plays an important role in RPE adhesion and migration on Fn and Lam. It has been shown in other cell types that galectin-1 modulates adhesive properties of cells by interacting with &#x003b2;1 integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>], thus modifying their ability to adhere to components of the ECM such as Lam and Fn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>].</p><p>Although the nature of the galectin-1 counter-receptors on the RPE cell surface is not yet known, it is likely that galectin-1 might be involved in the modulation of cell-matrix interactions. The result would be a decrease in the adhesive and motile properties of dedifferentiated RPE cells via interaction with functional glycans on the cell surface. This notion is further underscored by the finding that RPE cell behavior was sensitive to the presence or absence of galectin-1 on the culture substratum. When exposed to surface-presented Fn and galectin-1, the level of attachment and migration was markedly reduced when compared to Fn as a substrate alone. This again raises the possibility that galectin-1 may compete with Fn for ligands, or may block its access on the cell surface. In contrast, none of the activities tested was sensitive to galectin-1 as a substratum bound to Lam, most likely because Lam, per se, reportedly has only weak affinity for RPE cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>].</p><p>As noted previously, a salient aspect of galectin-1 activity is its specificity in a given cell type. In agreement with our findings, galectin-1 can decrease migration in different cell types including colon cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>], smooth muscle cells, and eosinophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>]. In contrast, in astrocytic tumors, galectin-1 increases cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>], and has recently been reported to increase adhesion, proliferation and migration, in combination with vascular endothelial growth factor, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, as a result of neuropilin-1 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>]. Comparable cell type-dependent functional divergence has been reported for cell attachment: galectin-1 can stimulate tumor cell attachment to Lam and Fn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>], but adhesion and spreading of skeletal myoblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells on Lam is inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Clearly, it will now be essential to provide insights into the molecular and regulatory mechanisms involved in the inhibitory effects of galectin-1 on RPE behavior.</p><p>In their review, Gabius et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>] noted galectins may interact with various types of (glyco)protein, depending on their cellular location. In a previous study, we found reduced RPE migration on Lam after silencing galectin-1 expression by siRNA transfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. At first sight, these results may appear conflicting. However, reduced overall galectin-1 transcription will likely have ramifications on gene expression, which could account for the observed effect. Stable inhibition of galectin-1 expression in a glioblastoma cell line diminished the expression of several genes that either directly or indirectly influence adhesion and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r59">59</xref>]. Only recently, Kleinman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r60">60</xref>] revealed that, irrespective of its target, siRNA binds to cell-surface toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3) on RPE cells and triggers TLR-3 signaling, thus altering RPE function independent of any RNA-interference effect. This raises the possibility that the TLR-3-mediated siRNA-class effect may have accounted for the observed reduced migratory activity following galectin-1 siRNA transfection. However, this contribution may have been only partial, since scrambled siRNA did not significantly reduce RPE migration.</p><p>In summary, our results indicate that galectin-1 is able to inhibit early cellular events in PVR pathogenesis&#x02013;namely, attachment, migration, and spreading of RPE cells&#x02013;in a dose-dependent manner and at nontoxic concentrations. When looking at lectins, it should be noted that working with an endogenous protein will likely exclude the immunogenicity encountered with plant proteins, such as the mushroom lectin aforementioned. At any rate, it is wise to view these in vitro data with adequate caution. During PVR or vitreoretinal surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r61">61</xref>], serum (glyco)proteins containing a considerable number of potential glycan ligands may attenuate the inhibitory effect of added galectin-1 on RPE cell behavior; thus, increased lectin concentrations may be required. In addition, a panel of ECM proteins beyond Fn and Lam has been found in PVR but has not yet been studied. Furthermore, ligands for galectin-1 are present in the interphotoreceptor matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r63">63</xref>] or on endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r64">64</xref>]. Therefore, for a future in vivo application, possible deleterious effects of intravitreally administered galectin-1 on neighboring tissues certainly will have to be excluded.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have shown that an endogenous lectin, produced by human RPE cells, can profoundly and differentially affect the behavior of RPE cells in contact with major ECM components present in PVR. Given the combined effect of galectin-1 on RPE attachment, migration, and spreading, and its dose-dependent titratability on RPE behavior, this lectin deserves further investigation as a possible novel agent for the management of PVR or other anomalous wound-healing disorders.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Katja Obholzer and Barbara Amann for expert technical assistance, and we thank the reviewers for the constructive advice.
