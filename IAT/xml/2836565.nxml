The Vts1 protein has been implicated in post-transcriptional regulation of a specific set of mRNAs that contains its-binding site at their 3&#x02032;-untranslated region. In this study, we identified <italic>VTS1</italic> as a multi-copy suppressor of <italic>dna2-K1080E</italic>, a lethal mutant allele of <italic>DNA2</italic> that lacks DNA helicase activity. The suppression was allele-specific, since overexpression of Vts1 did not suppress the temperature-dependent growth defects of <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> devoid of the N-terminal 405-amino-acid residues<italic>.</italic> Purified recombinant Vts1 stimulated the endonuclease activity of wild-type Dna2, but not the endonuclease activity of Dna2&#x00394;405N, indicating that the activation requires the N-terminal domain of Dna2. Stimulation of Dna2 endonuclease activity by Vts1 appeared to be the direct cause of suppression, since the multi-copy expression of Dna2-K1080E suppressed the lethality observed with its single-copy expression<italic>.</italic> We found that <italic>vts1&#x00394; dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> and <italic>vts1&#x00394;dna2-7</italic> double mutant cells displayed synergistic growth defects, in support of a functional interaction between two genes. Our results provide both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence that Vts1 is involved in lagging strand synthesis by modulating the Dna2 endonuclease activity that plays an essential role in Okazaki fragment processing.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotes requires the coordinated action of a large number of replication factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5">1&#x02013;5</xref>). Unlike leading strand DNA synthesis, lagging strand DNA synthesis proceeds discontinuously via the generation of Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerase (pol) &#x003b1;-primase first synthesizes &#x0223c;10 nucleotides (nt) of RNA, followed by the addition of short DNA stretches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), which are designated &#x02018;RNA&#x02013;DNA primers&#x02019;. These are different from the RNA-only primers observed in prokaryotes. The second DNA polymerase, pol &#x003b4;, extends the RNA&#x02013;DNA primers to form new Okazaki fragments with the aid of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and replication factor C (RFC). Pol &#x003b4; not only extends the newly synthesized Okazaki fragments but it also creates flap structures by displacing the 5&#x02032;-end region of downstream Okazaki fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Flaps can be processed by nucleases to form ligatable nicks, which are sealed by DNA ligase I to produce continuous double-stranded (ds) DNA. Short flap regions can be removed by the activity of flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1), which is a structure-specific endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>). However, when the flap region is relatively long (&#x0003e;20 nt), flap cleavage requires Dna2, an endonuclease/helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Replication protein A (RPA) can bind efficiently to DNA flaps longer than 27 nt in length, which inhibits Fen1 activity. In contrast to Fen1, RPA-bound flaps are efficiently cleaved by Dna2 because its endonuclease activity is markedly stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Thus, RPA can act as a nuclease switch for the sequential processing of long flaps that are processed first by Dna2, and then by Fen1 to form a nick.</p><p>Although the majority of Okazaki fragments appear to be removed <italic>in vitro</italic> via generation of short flaps in a Fen1-dependent manner, a substantial fraction of flaps generated <italic>in vitro</italic> are long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and their processing requires both Fen1 and Dna2. Therefore, both pathways are essential for processing of all flaps. <italic>In vivo</italic>, however, the level of long and/or short flaps formed is not known. The production of long flaps can be influenced by the failure of cleavage at the early stages in strand displacement reaction due to inadequate Fen1 activity, enhanced strand displacement by pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) or the failure of 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; proofreading function of pol &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Alternatively, there may be sequences that can be more readily displaced by pol &#x003b4;. All of these factors can lead to elevate the levels of long flaps.</p><p>In order to gain more insights into the processing of long flaps by Dna2, we searched for genetic suppressors that could rescue a particular defect caused by a mutation in <italic>DNA2</italic>. This approach identified the non-essential <italic>VTS1</italic> gene of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as a suppressor of the <italic>dna2-K1080E</italic> mutant (glutamate substitution for lysine at position 1080, the ATP-binding motif), which lacks ATPase/helicase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>). <italic>VTS1</italic> was originally identified in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as a multi-copy (and low-copy) suppressor of <italic>vti1&#x02013;2</italic> mutant cells that displayed defects in growth and vacuole transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). However, it is not clear whether Vts1 is directly involved in vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). One notable structural motif present in Vts1 is the sterile-&#x003b1; motif (SAM) domain. This domain is highly abundant in eukaryotes and known to mediate protein&#x02013;protein interactions for transcription regulation, signal-transduction cascades and nucleic acid binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>). A subclass of SAM domain can bind RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24 B25">22&#x02013;25</xref>). For example, both Vts1 of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and Smaug of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> recognize and bind RNAs possessing a specific structure (named SRE, SMAUG recognition element) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). This structural element consists of a RNA stem and a pentanucleotide loop (pentaloop; CNGGN, N for any nucleotide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Disruption of the stem or a single base change in any of the three conserved nucleotides in the pentaloop significantly reduced the RNA-binding activity of Smaug or Vts1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Conversely, a single amino acid substitution in the SAM domain of Smaug or Vts1 abolished its ability to bind the RNA-stem-loop structure. Consistent with the role of Smaug in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Vts1 regulated the stability of artificial mRNAs containing an SRE at their 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, target mRNAs that are regulated by Vts1 have not been identified yet.</p><p>The SAM domain has also been implicated in DNA binding. For example, the RuvA subunit, a component of the prokaryotic RuvABC complex that processes recombination intermediates, contains this domain that is required for binding Holliday junction structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Since <italic>VTS1</italic> was isolated as a suppressor of defects in Okazaki fragment processing, we investigated its biochemical interactions with Dna2 and Fen1. In this study, we present both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that Vts1 is involved in Okazaki fragment processing by modulating the endonuclease activity of Dna2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals, nucleotides, enzymes and DNA</title><p>The oligonucleotides (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) used to construct various DNA substrates were synthesized commercially from Genotech (Daejeon, Korea) and gel-purified prior to use.

The <italic>VTS1</italic> gene was disrupted from YPH499 and YJA2 by replacing it with the <italic>HIS3</italic> gene. In order to perform one-step gene disruption, two primers were used: VH-F (5&#x02032;-GTT AAT GGT TAT ACA GCT GCC ATT TGA CCG TGC ACC ACA GCA AAT TAT Cct gag agt gca cca taa ttc-3&#x02032;) and VH-R (5&#x02032;-GTT AAG TAA ATA GTT TTA TGC CAT TAA ACG GTG CAA AAA CAG GTG TAA TCg cat atg atc cgt cga gtt c-3&#x02032;). The sequences in capital letters are homologous to the flanking sequences of the <italic>VTS1</italic> open reading frame (ORF), while sequences in small letters are homologous to <italic>HIS3</italic>. Using these two primers and pRS303 (with <italic>His3<sup>+</sup></italic> as a selection marker) as the template, the <italic>HIS3</italic> gene was amplified. The amplified fragments thus contained the <italic>HIS3</italic> gene flanked by upstream and downstream sequences of <italic>VTS1</italic> and were transformed into YPH499 and YJA2. Transformants that grew in the histidine-dropout medium were analyzed for correct disruption.</p><p>The <italic>VTS1</italic> gene was also disrupted in 7720-x strains, which possess different point-mutations in <italic>DNA2</italic>, by replacing it with the <italic>LEU2</italic> gene. Two primers, VL-1 (5&#x02032;-GCa agc ttG ACT TTC TCA TCG ATG TTG TGC CTA GAA G-3&#x02032;) and VL-2 (5&#x02032;-GCg gat ccG ATT TCT TTG CTG ACA ATT ACT TTA TAT G-3&#x02032;), were used to amplify the upstream region of <italic>VTS1</italic> ORF.

Small letters in these sequences indicate restriction enzyme sites for ligation into the pRS305 vector. The PCR products (each, 350 bp) were cloned into pRS305 (with <italic>Leu2<sup>+</sup></italic> as a marker) and digested with HindIII. The resulting linearized DNA was transformed into each of the 7720-x <italic>dna2</italic> mutant strains. Transformants were then spread on leucine-dropout media and analyzed by PCR and Southern blotting.</p><p>YPH499 (VTS1-FLAG) is a strain in which the endogenous <italic>VTS1</italic> gene was 5&#x000d7;FLAG-tagged at its C-terminus. The 5&#x000d7;FLAG sequence with the <italic>KanMX</italic> gene was from the pKL258 vector.

The sequences in capital letters in VFLAG-1 and VFLAG-2 are homologous to the upstream and downstream sequences, respectively, of the stop codon in the <italic>VTS1</italic> ORF. The sequences in small letters in both primers are homologous to flanking sequences of the 5&#x000d7;FLAG plus <italic>KanMX</italic> gene in pKL258 vector. Thus, the amplified fragments contained the 5&#x000d7;FLAG and <italic>KanMX</italic> gene flanked by sequences upstream and downstream of the <italic>VTS1</italic> stop codon and were used for integration into the C-terminus of <italic>VTS1</italic> ORF by homologous recombination.

Since this mechanism would likely require the binding of Vts1 to DNA, we examined this possibility with different structures using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The substrates tested included single-stranded (ssDNA, 50-nt), double-stranded (dsDNA, 50-bp), 1-nt 5&#x02032;-flap, 27-nt 5&#x02032;-flap (5&#x02032;FL), 5&#x02032;-overhang, 3&#x02032;-overhang, nicked duplex and 1-nt gapped duplex DNAs. All substrates were constructed with a common 50-nt oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, oligonucleotide 1). The interaction of Vts1 with ssDNA yielded a smeared electrophoretic mobility shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;4) at relatively high protein levels (&#x0003e;2 pmol), suggesting that binding, if it occurred, was not stable. In contrast, all other substrates containing a duplex DNA region were more efficiently complexed than the ssDNA substrate. Among them, Vts1 bound the 27-nt 5&#x02032;-flap DNA with the greatest affinity and stability, since it formed the highest level of a discrete nucleoprotein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, lanes 13&#x02013;16). The binding of Vts1 to the 1-nt 5&#x02032;-flap DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, lanes 9&#x02013;12) was similar to that observed with the other partial duplex DNA substrates. Thus, Vts1 appears to bind preferentially to a duplex containing a long 5&#x02032;-ssDNA flap region. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Vts1 is a flap DNA-specific-binding protein.

The amount of DNase I required for optimal partial cleavage was 0.1U per reaction (data not shown). The 35-nt 5&#x02032;FL DNA was first complexed with increasing levels (0.5&#x02013;16 pmol) of Vts1 and then treated with DNase I (0.1U) to cleave unprotected regions in the DNA. Two changes in the protection pattern were detected. At high Vts1 concentrations (4&#x02013;16 pmol), the double-stranded region of the flap-containing strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;7) was effectively protected from DNase I digestion. This protection was more pronounced near the duplex end and progressed toward the ssDNA&#x02013;dsDNA junction with increasing concentrations of Vts1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, compare lanes 5&#x02013;7). We noted that Vts1 had an intrinsic property to bind to duplex DNA ends.

These cells are viable in the presence of low levels of hydroxyurea that do not affect the growth of wild-type cells (data not shown). These findings suggest that the helicase activity of Dna2 is not essential and is dispensable under certain growth conditions unlike its endonuclease activity. Thus, it is likely that the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of the Dna2 helicase activity can be replaced by other helicases or enzymes. These considerations prompted us to screen for the genes that suppress the growth defects of the <italic>dna2-K1080E</italic> helicase-deficient mutant to find a new helicase involved in Okazaki fragment processing in eukaryotes. During the course of this work, we identified Vts1 as a genetic suppressor of helicase-negative <italic>dna2-K1080E.</italic> Contrary to our expectation, we found that Vts1 is devoid of helicase activity and has no effect on the Dna2 helicase activity (data not shown). Although Vts1 was originally reported to play a role in cytoplasmic events such as posttranscriptional regulation, our findings suggested that Vts1 affects nuclear events as well, particularly in Okazaki fragment processing in yeast. This conclusion is supported by a substantial number of results presented here. These include the following: (i) The double mutants such as <italic>vts1&#x00394; dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> and <italic>vts1&#x00394; dna2-7</italic> grew more slowly than single mutants alone. (ii) The stimulation of Dna2 endonuclease activity by Vts1 required specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions between the two proteins. Not only the physical interaction between Vts1 and Dna2 but also the stimulation of the Dna2 endonuclease activity by Vts1 required the N-terminal 405-amino-acid domain of Dna2. (iii) Vts1 was shown to be a flap-structure-specific DNA-binding protein. (iv) Vts1 stimulated yeast Fen1, another endonuclease essential for processing of Okazaki fragments in eukaryotes. (v) Finally, we showed that Vts1 was present in yeast nuclei, consistent with its function in Okazaki fragment processing.</p><p>Our biochemical and genetic data indicate that the stimulation of Dna2 endonuclease activity by Vts1 is a major factor contributing to its suppression of the <italic>dna2-K1080E</italic> mutation. This is supported by our findings that the suppression of <italic>dna2-K1080E</italic> was observed when the mutant <italic>dna2-K1080E</italic> allele was provided in a multi-copy plasmid. In addition, the extent of suppression depended on the levels of Dna2-K1080E expression; suppression was more pronounced when Dna2-K1080E expression was driven by the strong <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Thus, elevated levels of Dna2 endonuclease activity are required to overcome the helicase deficiency caused by this mutation. Since the stimulation of Dna2 endonuclease activity by Vts1 requires its DNA-binding activity, it is possible that the binding of Vts1 to DNA substrates could alter the DNA structure and render it more susceptible to Dna2 cleavage. However, this notion is unlikely because the stimulation was allele-specific. Vts1 stimulated wild-type Dna2, but not Dna2&#x00394;405N. In addition, Vts1 interacted with wild-type Dna2, but not Dna2&#x00394;405N in ELISA assays. These results indicate that the stimulation of Dna2 endonuclease by Vts1 requires its DNA-binding activity and its ability to interact with Dna2. For these reasons, we conclude that the specific and stable binding of Vts1 to flap DNA substrates contributes to efficient Okazaki fragment processing by targeting Dna2 efficiently to flap DNA.</p><p>Although Vts1 significantly stimulated yeast Fen1, it was unable to reverse the RPA inhibition of the endonuclease activity of Fen1 (data not shown). This finding suggests that Vts1 cannot displace RPA from RPA-coated flaps. Thus, it is possible that Vts1 binds to the flap structure less strongly, individually or cooperatively, than RPA. In the presence of both RPA and Vts1, Vts1 stimulated the degradation of flaps shorter than 20 nt, at which RPA binds poorly (data not shown). Though Vts1 robustly stimulated Fen1 activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, it is unlikely that this effect contributes to the suppression of the <italic>dna2-K1080E</italic> mutation since Vts1 in a multi-copy plasmid failed to suppress <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N.</italic> If suppression of the <italic>dna2-K1080E</italic> mutation occurred solely by the stimulation of Fen1, we would expect that overexpression of Vts1 could suppress both <italic>dna2-K1080E</italic> and <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> because overexpression of Fen1 suppressed both <italic>dna2-K1080E</italic> (data not shown) and <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Therefore, it appears that the stimulation of Fen1 by Vts1 <italic>in vivo</italic> may not be sufficient to suppress <italic>dna2&#x00394;405N</italic>. However, it is possible that the stimulation of Fen1 by Vts1 could provide an explanation for more severe growth defects observed with the double mutants, <italic>vts1&#x00394; dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> and <italic>vts1&#x00394; dna2-7.</italic> The following scenario would be possible; in <italic>vts1&#x00394;</italic> cells, the deletion of <italic>VTS1</italic> may reduce the function of Fen1 compared to that found in wild-type cells. Despite the normal protein levels of Fen1, the absence of Vts1 (and lack of Fen1 stimulation) could lead to a decrease of Fen1 activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. This scenario could account for the more severe growth defects observed with <italic>vts1&#x00394; dna2&#x00394;405N</italic> or <italic>vts1&#x00394; dna2-7</italic> compared to the single mutation.</p><p>It is noteworthy that Vts1 can bind to duplex ends efficiently. This property was especially evident in the presence of high levels of Vts1 and with substrates containing a 1-nt overhang at its 3&#x02032;-end (data not shown). If this were the case, the DNase I protection observed near the duplex ends would not be physiologically relevant during Okazaki fragment processing since duplex ends are not available for the binding. However, it is possible that the duplex end binding activity of Vts1 could function in other DNA transactions.</p><p>In summary, we suggest that Vts1 is involved in the processing of Okazaki fragments, and possibly other DNA events such as repair and recombination. During repair and recombination, flap-like structures can be formed and they can be efficiently removed by Fen1 and Dna2 in the presence of Vts1.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Korea Science and Engineering Foundation Grants funded by the ministry of Education, Science and Technology.
