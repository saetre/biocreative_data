It was originally identified as the protein kinase that phosphorylated and inactivated glycogen synthase in rabbit muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Two highly related forms of GSK3 (GSK3&#x003b1; and GSK3&#x003b2;) are expressed from distinct genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. They share greater than 95% identity in their kinase domains and appear to be ubiquitously expressed in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In resting cells GSK3 activity is high and inhibition of the kinase is achieved by at least two mechanisms, firstly through phosphorylation of an N-terminal serine residue (Ser-21 in GSK3&#x003b1;, Ser-9 in GSK3&#x003b2;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and secondly through protein protein interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Insulin promotes the phosphorylation of Ser-9/21 of GSK3 by activation of protein kinase B (PKB, also known as c-AKT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], while canonical wnt signalling inhibits GSK3 independently of this N-terminal phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In liver, inhibition of GSK3 reduces expression of the Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (PEPCK) and Glucose-6 Phosphatase (G6Pase) genes, two rate limiting enzymes in hepatic glucose production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], as well as the IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP1) gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These gene promoters share a related DNA sequence termed the thymine-rich insulin response element (TIRE) that plays an important role in their response to insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Expression of these genes as well as GSK3 activity is abnormally high in insulin resistant states such as Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Meanwhile overexpression of GSK3 antagonises insulin regulation of IGFBP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore inhibition of GSK3 is proposed as a potential target for the treatment of T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Indeed selective GSK3 inhibitors significantly reduce hepatic glucose output and blood glucose levels in several animal models of obesity and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, GSK3 is reported to have over 30 substrates, and mutation of one of these, APC, is linked to the development of colonic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In addition, genetic deletion of one of the isoforms (GSK3&#x003b2;) leads to liver cell death, possibly due to increased sensitivity to TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Hence great care and consideration is being given to the development of GSK3 inhibitors for use in humans. With this in mind we have initiated a search for molecules that link GSK3 to the gluconeogenic gene promoters and in particular the TIRE, since inhibition of GSK3 is sufficient to repress the isolated DNA element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Identification of the GSK3 substrate(s) that regulates IGFBP1, G6Pase and PEPCK gene expression, may permit manipulation of this specific interaction without affecting other GSK3 targets, thereby reducing potential side effects. GSK3 is an unusual kinase in that most substrates must be phosphorylated (primed) on a Ser/Thr four or five residues C-terminal to the GSK3 target residue (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] for review). Priming of the substrate is performed by a distinct protein kinase, therefore inhibition of the priming kinase indirectly inhibits GSK3 regulation of the substrate, but only those substrates primed by that particular priming kinase. Priming kinases are potential targets for more specific interference with GSK3 function.</p><p>The basic leucine zipper transcription factor, CAAT-enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP&#x003b1;) is a potential link between GSK3 and the gluconeogenic genes based on the following information in the literature; 1) C/EBP&#x003b1; is phosphorylated on two residues (T222 and T226, numbers refer to rodent sequence) by GSK3, although the functional effect of phosphorylation is not yet clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], 2) C/EBP&#x003b1; is a key molecule in the regulation of the PEPCK and G6Pase gene promoters by cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and T3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], 3) C/EBP&#x003b1; is regulated by wnt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] in brown adipocytes, and the insulin regulation involves PKB (a regulator of GSK3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], 4) PEPCK and G6Pase expression, as well as glucose and glycogen metabolism is abnormal in animals lacking C/EBP&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and 5) binding of a TIRE-interacting protein is blocked using an oligonucleotide representing a known C/EBP&#x003b1; binding sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, we attempted to determine whether C/EBP&#x003b1; could modulate the activity of the isolated TIRE, or the gene promoters of interest, in a GSK3 regulated manner. In addition, although T222/T226 of C/EBP&#x003b1; were identified as targets for GSK3 it has not previously been established whether S230 was a target for a 'priming' kinase, so we have also investigated whether mutation of S230 influences C/EBP&#x003b1; regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>C/EBP&#x003b1; regulates the TIRE independently of T222/226 phosphorylation</title><p>We have previously shown that insulin, or pharmacological inhibition of GSK3, reduced the expression of endogenous PEPCK, G6Pase and IGFBP1 genes and also the activity of the isolated thymine-rich insulin response element (TIRE) found in these gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In an attempt to further characterise the GSK3 regulation of PEPCK, G6Pase and IGFBP1 we assessed whether a target for GSK3, namely C/EBP&#x003b1;, could regulate TIRE activity. In the hepatocyte C/EBP&#x003b1; activity is linked to cAMP induction of genes, so insulin inhibition of C/EBP&#x003b1; could explain repression of these genes by insulin. In this model, phosphorylation of C/EBP&#x003b1; by GSK3 would have to induce C/EBP&#x003b1; activity toward the TIRE. Interestingly, C/EBP&#x003b1; overexpression had a repressive effect on TIRE activity in the rat hepatoma H4IIE cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), and the repression was lost when the TIRE sequence was mutated at two residues to produce an insulin insensitive sequence (DM5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]; Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Hence C/EBP&#x003b1; regulated the TIRE in a sequence specific and insulin-like manner. However, mutation of the GSK3-regulated residues on C/EBP&#x003b1; (T222/T226/S230) to alanines (C/EBP&#x003b1;-AAA) did not alter the ability of C/EBP&#x003b1; to repress TIRE activity (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). One possibility is that the dephosphorylated form of C/EBP&#x003b1; <italic>repressed </italic>the TIRE, and that the overexpressed C/EBP&#x003b1; was not substantially phosphorylated by GSK3. Consistent with this hypothesis, co-expression of an active form of GSK3 reduced the effect of wild-type C/EBP&#x003b1; on the TIRE (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Unfortunately, increased GSK3 activity also blocked the repressive action of the C/EBP&#x003b1;-AAA (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) clearly demonstrating that phosphorylation of T222/T226/S230 was not required for the action of GSK3 on the isolated TIRE in H4IIE cells. This data questioned the functional importance of T222/T226 phosphorylation in the regulation of C/EBP&#x003b1; activity.</p></sec><sec><title>GSK3 phosphorylates C/EBP&#x003b1; in intact cells</title><p>It was therefore important to establish whether T222 and T226 were actually phosphorylated by GSK3 in intact cells. Cells were transfected with wild-type and mutant C/EBP&#x003b1; and total and phosphorylated C/EBP&#x003b1; visualised by Western Blotting. T222/226 phosphorylation, measured with this antibody, was clearly present in intact cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Incubation with 1 or 2 &#x003bc;M of the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] for 6 or 24 h significantly reduced the phosphorylation of T222/226 of wild-type C/EBP&#x003b1; (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), confirming that GSK3 was a T222/226 kinase in these cells. At shorter incubations, 1 &#x003bc;M CHIR99021 was sufficient to give maximal reduction in T222/226 phosphorylation, while 2 &#x003bc;M had a greater effect at 24 h incubation. This is similar to the effect of these concentrations on &#x003b2;-catenin activation in the H4IIE cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Meanwhile, co-expression of active GSK3&#x003b1; (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) only produced a marginal induction of phosphorylation (around 1.2 fold) suggesting that the expressed C/EBP&#x003b1; was either almost fully phosphorylated at T222/226 or that it was not a particularly good substrate for GSK3. Mutation of T222/226 to alanines made the mutant C/EBP&#x003b1; unresponsive to the phosphospecific antibody (see later). Interestingly, the dephosphorylation of C/EBP&#x003b1; in H4IIE cells treated with CHIR99021 was rapid, but not complete (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). However, there was no significant reduction in T222/226 phosphorylation following up to 2 h incubation with insulin (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), even though insulin promoted phosphorylation of Ser9/Ser21 of GSK3&#x003b2; and GSK3&#x003b1; respectively. Insulin reduced GSK3 activity around 50% in the H4IIE cell line but this is clearly not sufficient to reduce T222/226 phosphorylation. Therefore it appears that insulin does not regulate T222/226 phosphorylation in these cells through inhibition of GSK3. However, the data suggested that some level of T222/226 phosphorylation by GSK3 occurs on the overexpressed protein (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>C/EBP&#x003b1; is a relatively poor substrate for GSK3 in vitro</title><p>We next characterised C/EBP&#x003b1; phosphorylation by GSK3 <italic>in vitro </italic>(Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Incubation of C/EBP&#x003b1; with GSK3&#x003b2; for up to one hour resulted in a slow incorporation of less than 0.03 mol phosphate per mol of protein (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In comparison, p42MAP kinase phosphorylation of C/EBP&#x003b1; increased over 60 min peaking around 1.5 mol per mol (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Phosphorylation of C/EBP&#x003b1; by p42MAP kinase did not occur at T222, T226 or S230 (see below) and is more likely to be on S21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Interestingly western blot analysis of C/EBP&#x003b1; following incubation with GSK3&#x003b2; gave little indication of this slow increase in phosphorylation, and a very strong signal was obtained with the phosphospecific antibody even at low stoichiometry of phosphorylation (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). These data demonstrated that C/EBP&#x003b1; was a relatively poor substrate for GSK3 <italic>in vitro </italic>,but that the phospho-T222/226 antibody was highly sensitive. It is difficult to directly compare phosphorylation of C/EBP&#x003b1; with other substrates of GSK3 as most are poorly phosphorylated prior to priming. For example CRMP phosphorylation by GSK3 (under identical conditions to those used for C/EBP&#x003b1; in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) incorporates around 0.2 mol/mol phosphate within 2 h of incubation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. However, this increases more than 5-fold if the substrate is first primed. Of course we can never rule out the possibility that an intrinsic factor improves the GSK3-C/EBP&#x003b1; interaction <italic>in vivo </italic>,either promoting priming at an unidentified residue or allowing greater phosphorylation by GSK3.</p></sec><sec><title>GSK3 phosphorylation of T222/226 in cells does not require S230 phosphorylation</title><p>Many substrates of GSK3 are primed for kinase recognition by prior phosphorylation at a S/T residue four amino acids C-terminal to the target site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. S230 lies within this 'consensus' GSK3 targeting sequence (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Therefore S230 phosphorylation could prime for T226 phosphorylation by GSK3, permitting subsequent phosphorylation of T222 by GSK3. However, mutation of S230 to alanine had no effect on T222/226 phosphorylation in intact cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This argued that S230 phosphorylation did not prime for T226 phosphorylation by GSK3 in resting cells, or that the wild-type C/EBP&#x003b1; is not being efficiently phosphorylated at S230. Since the amino acid immediately following S230 is a proline (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), we hypothesised that priming may only occur after induction of a proline-directed kinase such as a member of the MAP kinase family. Therefore we attempted to induce S230 phosphorylation by incubation of cells with serum, which stimulates the classical MAP kinase and several other proline-directed kinases such as cyclin-dependent kinases. However, T222/226 phosphorylation of wild-type or S230A C/EBP&#x003b1; was not altered in serum treated cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), despite activation of the p90RSK downstream of the p42/p44MAP kinase (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). This demonstrated we could not alter S230 phosphorylation by incubating cells with or without serum. Interestingly, serum treatment induced phosphorylation of S21/9 of GSK3&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), suggesting some inhibition of GSK3 occurs in the serum treated cells. This was not sufficient to reduce C/EBP&#x003b1; phosphorylation but did partially reduce glycogen synthase phosphorylation (a known substrate of GSK3 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]; Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Similarly, treatment of the cells with CHIR99021 did not completely inhibit T222/226 phosphorylation (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), despite a complete loss of glycogen synthase phosphorylation (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Therefore T222/226 must be relatively resistant to dephosphorylation or a distinct T222/226 protein kinase must be present in these cells. Again, potential substrates for GSK3 have been reported that have their priming at a residue more distant from the GSK3 target site, and we cannot discount that possibility. However, our data strongly argues against priming through S230 phosphorylation.</p><p>Prephosphorylation of CEBP&#x003b1; by p42 MAP kinase did not prime for subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3 <italic>in vitro </italic>(Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), confirming that S230 is not targeted by p42 MAP kinase. Similarly, incubation of cells with either a p42MAP kinase inhibitor (PD98059) or a p38MAP kinase inhibitor (SB203580) had no effect on phosphorylation of CEBP&#x003b1; at T222/226 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>C/EBP&#x003b1; induced a consensus binding element while repressing the TIRE in H4IIE cells</title><p>In contrast to the repressive action on TIRE activity, overexpression of C/EBP&#x003b1; in H4IIE cells induced the activity of a consensus C/EBP binding element (CBE) (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). We were therefore able to investigate whether the GSK3 regulation of T222/T226 was dependent on the DNA sequence analysed. Mutation of T222/226/S230 to alanines (in any combination) made no difference to the induction of the CBE by C/EBP&#x003b1; (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Similarly, inhibition of GSK3 using CHIR99021 or insulin had no effect on CBE activity (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Therefore GSK3 phosphorylation of T222/226 does not regulate either induction of the CBE or repression of the TIRE in the H4IIE cells. Interestingly CBE activity was induced in the presence of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone to a similar level as that seen with C/EBP&#x003b1; overexpression (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>C/EBP&#x003b1; overexpression does not regulate endogenous TIRE-containing genes</title><p>In order to establish whether changes in C/EBP&#x003b1; phosphorylation could alter expression of the insulin regulated genes IGFBP1 and G6Pase, we overexpressed C/EBP&#x003b1; in H4IIE cells using an adenoviral vector to produce almost 100% transfection efficiency (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). We observed no effect of C/EBP&#x003b1; expression on IGFBP1 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) or G6Pase (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) gene expression, and no alteration in regulation of either gene by dexamethasone, insulin or CHIR99021. However, there was a significant repression of the co-expressed BP1-TIRE by C/EBP&#x003b1; when compared with its effect on the insulin resistant TIRE (DM5) (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). This suggests that C/EBP&#x003b1; overexpression represses the isolated element but has no effect on this element when it is in the context of the intact gene promoters. This is an example of the dangers of studying isolated promoter elements and extrapolating to intact gene promoters without examining endogenous regulation. Interestingly, a postnatal knockout of C/EBP&#x003b1; resulted in reduced basal expression of PEPCK and G6Pase but did not alter regulation of these genes by cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Again, this would argue against a repressive effect of this factor on the endogenous genes.</p></sec><sec><title>C/EBP&#x003b1; regulation of the CBE in preadipocytes is greater when T222/226 are mutated</title><p>C/EBP&#x003b1; has an important role in adipocyte differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], therefore we transfected 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with C/EBP&#x003b1; and measured CBE activity (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11A</xref>). In contrast to the H4IIE cells, mutation of T222/226 to alanines resulted in a significant increase in transactivation potential compared to wild-type C/EBP&#x003b1; (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11A</xref>). This suggested that phosphorylation of these residues was inhibiting C/EBP&#x003b1; activity in these cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, inhibition of GSK3 using CHIR99021 or insulin induced wild-type C/EBP&#x003b1; activity (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11A</xref>). In addition, the C/EBP&#x003b1; S230A mutant had similar transactivation potential to the AA mutant (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11A</xref>), strongly suggesting that S230 was a priming site for T222/T226 phosphorylation in these cells. However we could find no evidence that phosphorylation of T222/226 was reduced in the S230A mutant (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11B</xref>). Although there was a great deal of inter-experiment variation in the phosphorylation of T222/T226 in the WT and the S230A mutant there was not a significant difference between the two, and in 2 out of the three experiments the S230A mutant exhibited higher phosphorylation than the WT protein (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11B</xref>). Therefore, changes in phosphorylation of these two sites cannot account for the difference in C/EBP&#x003b1; activity when the S230 site is mutated to alanine. Ideally it would be beneficial to confirm these data on endogenous gene expression in the adipocyte cell line, however these cells do not transfect efficiently with the adenoviral constructs making it impossible to examine their effect on endogenous genes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, C/EBP&#x003b1; is not the link between GSK3 and the hepatic TIRE-containing gene promoters. However, C/EBP&#x003b1; can regulate the TIRE, at least when overexpressed, and the residues T222/226 and S230 all influence C/EBP&#x003b1; function in preadipocytes. Interestingly we demonstrate opposite effects of C/EBP&#x003b1; overexpression on TIRE and CBE activity, and a tissue specific role for the T222/226 motif in this activity. Our data also provides further evidence of the differences in transcription factor activity when measured using isolated promoter elements as opposed to intact gene promoters. During the course of this study a regulation of C/EBP&#x003b2; by GSK3 in adipocytes was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Therefore it will be of interest to confirm whether this C/EBP isoform is the link between GSK3 inhibition and TIRE regulation in hepatocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Material</title><p>Radioisotopes [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) and [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]UTP (ICN, Thame, Oxfordshire, UK) were purchased from the indicated sources.
