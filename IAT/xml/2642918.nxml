The ocular manifestations of OI are not usually sight threatening and typically consist of blue sclerae. Other ocular manifestations that may occur include perinuclear or cortical cataract, megalocornea, microcornea, keratoconus, nystagmus, glaucoma, ptosis, etc. The minimum prevalence of OI is estimated to be 1/10,000-1/30,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Traditionally, it is usually classified into four types depending on phenotype and severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Type I is the most common and mildest deforming. Type II is the most severe and is lethal in the perinatal period. Type III is severely deforming, and fractures are often present at birth. Type IV is moderately deforming; its severity is between Type I and Type III.</p><p>More than 250 mutations in one of the two genes, <italic>COL1A1</italic> and <italic>COL1A2</italic>, which encode the pro&#x003b1;1 and pro&#x003b1;2 chains of collagen I, respectively, have been found in unrelated probands with the disease. Most of these mutations are single nucleotide changes, mostly resulting in a substitution for a glycine residue and disrupting the continuous Gly-X-Y sequence of the collagen triple helix. Others are in-frame, single exon splicing defects, and a few are deletions, duplications, or insertions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>].</p><p>To identify the genetic defect of OI type I in a large Chinese family of five generations, we carried out linkage analysis and identified a <italic>COL1A1</italic> nonsense mutation in a Chinese OI type I family. In exon 36 of <italic>COL1A1</italic> gene, a C to T transition at position 2,464 resulted in a glutamine (Gln) to stop codon substitution at codon 644 (Q644X).

OI is clinically characterized by increased bone fragility with a propensity to fracture, often resulting in skeletal deformity. Typical manifestations also include hearing loss, dental abnormalities, and blue sclerae.</p><p>Although the spectrum of clinical features is wide, and an OI patient with Rieger's anomaly has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], the typical ocular finding is blue sclera. The sclerae of OI can vary in color from normal to a slightly bluish or slate color to a bright blue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. The blue sclerae may result from thinning of the abnormal sclera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], the uniformity of the scleral collagen fibers, the reduced number of collagen bundles, and the increased mucoid components within the sclera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. All of these alterations in the ultrastructure of the sclera may, in essence, allow it to behave more like corneal tissue, transmitting the light reflected from the underlying uveal pigment and giving it the bluish color observed clinically. Histopathologic and electron-microscopic examination of an eye from an OI patient revealed that the sclera was moderately thinned especially at the equator; the Bowman's layer in the cornea was absent; and the collagen fibers of the cornea and the sclera were narrower than in the control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>].</p><p>As observed in our study, the CCT of OI patients is often low while the vision is usually not affected. Moreover, both CCT and ocular rigidity are negatively correlated with the presence of blue sclerae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Therefore, for such patients, an ophthalmologist must be aware of an artificially low intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement resulting from the low CCT and the decreased ocular rigidity. Furthermore, when considering a keratorefractive treatment, the clinician should evaluate carefully the CCT to avoid unexpected results or complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. In our study, the IOP of the left eye of the proband was 18.3 mmHg, and it may be harmful to such a low CCT. It was suggested to the proband that he come back to the hospital for eye examinations every six months.</p><p>The cornea and the sclerae are known to be thinner in OI patients due to the defective collagen synthesis. The eyeball may distend because of the IOP. We expected longer ocular anteroposterior diameter in such patients, and we measured this parameter. However, the ocular axis lengths of our 14-year-old proband were within the normal range. We speculate that the ocular axis length of OI patients may be in correlation with their age. As the patient ages, the "cumulative effect" of the persistent intraocular pressure on the relatively thin and weak eyeball may lengthen the ocular axis.</p><p>Since 1980s, when the mutations in <italic>COL1A1/COL1A2</italic> were first described, over 250 mutations in these two genes have been found in OI patients with various phenotype from diverse racial and ethnic groups (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.le.ac.uk/genetics/collagen/">database of human type I and type III collagen mutations</ext-link> and the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hgmd.org/">Gene Mutation Database</ext-link>). The vast majority are missense point mutations that convert codons for the obligate glycines in the triple helix of type I collagen to codons for amino acids with bulkier side chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. The helical domain of type I collagen is composed of uninterrupted repeats of the sequence Gly-X-Y, in which Gly is glycine, and X and Y could be any residue but cysteine or tryptophan. The presence of glycine at every third residue is crucial to helix formation because its small side chain can be accommodated in the spatial constraints of the interior of the helical trimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Therefore, the substitution of a glycine residue by an amino acid with a bulky, polar, or charged side chain will distort the conformation of the triple helix and perturb normal collagen assembly in the cell, secretion from the cell, or fibril assembly in the extracellular spaces, and finally, often lead to a severe OI phenotype (type II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>].</p><p>Although several, apparently more common, mutations have been reported in more than one unrelated individual or family with a similar OI phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>], the relationships between the phenotype and genotype are not clear yet. In the vast majority of cases, the mutations are "private" in that they have only been reported in one person or family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. In spite of this, we can still obtain some rough correlation between the phenotype and genotype, such as the more NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal a serine substitution is located, the more severe the phenotype tends to be [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Glycine substitutions at the COOH-terminal half of the protein result in a more severe phenotype, while mutations at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal half tend to manifest in a less severe phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. The missense point mutation occurring at glycine codon tends to result in a lethal phenotype, while the mutation creating a premature stop codon often leads to a mild, type I phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>] etc. In conclusion, the severity of the phenotype is strongly associated with the specific site of the mutation.</p><p>The mutation analysis of OI is a labor intensive, expensive process due to the "private" nature of offending mutations and their nonclustered distribution in considerably sized genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. Therefore, in our study, members of the family were genotyped first with microsatellite markers at the two known loci of OI. Haplotype analysis showed that the affected individuals in this family shared a common haplotype with four markers, within the region of 17q11.2-22, where the <italic>COL1A1</italic> gene is located. After screening <italic>COL1A1</italic> for mutations by direct sequencing, we identified a C&#x0003e;T transition in exon 36 of the gene. The transition C2464T located in exon 36 was predicted to cause a substitution of Gln to a stop codon at codon 644 (Q644X). DHPLC was used as a rapid, inexpensive method to confirm the mutation. The results showed that this mutation cosegregated with all affected individuals and was not observed in unaffected family members or 100 normal unrelated individuals.</p><p>The nonsense mutation in our study, Q644X, could cause one &#x003b1;1(I) allele to be functionally void. The transcription products of such a <italic>COL1A1</italic> gene are usually unstable and subjected to degradation via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathways (NMD), ultimately producing a truncated protein. The NMD is a universal phenomenon and describes the degradation of mRNA transcripts that contain premature termination signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. For the <italic>COL1A1</italic> gene, NMD is a nuclear phenomenon. It targets mRNA rather than hnRNA for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. The recognition and decay of nonsense containing COL1A1 mRNA occurs either during or after splicing but prior to cytoplasmic translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Regardless of the position of the mutation within the gene or its relative position within an exon, the steady-state amounts of mRNA from the mutant allele can be reduced markedly by NMD in both cellular and nuclear RNA extracts of cells from affected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Bioinformatic analyses also showed that Q644 is located in a highly conserved region (data not shown). As a result, a reduced amount of structurally normal collagen type I chains are expressed by fibroblasts of affected individuals, thus leading to OI type I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. This study confirms that the decreased expression of pro&#x003b1;1(I) chains resulting from premature-termination codons or RNA-splicing defects in the <italic>COL1A1</italic> gene often leads to the mildest OI.</p><p>To our knowledge, 13 nonsense mutations have been described at the collagen domain of <italic>COL1A1</italic>: R42X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>], R75X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>], R183X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>], R237X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>], R294X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>], R420X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>], E500X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>], R519X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>], R704X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>], Q779X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>], R848X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>], R963X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>], and Q644X (in our study). Two have been found at the COOH-terminal domain: W1269X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>], W1325X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. All of the aforenamed nonsense mutations predictably led to OI type I except W1269X, which resulted in OI type IV. The majority of these converted CGA, which encodes arginine to TGA and creates a premature stop codon. Our study is the second reported nonsense mutation converting a glutamine codon to a premature stop codon. These results suggest that close attention should be paid to arginine codons when screening the <italic>COL1A1</italic> for mutations.</p><p>Until our report, there were seven point mutations in exon 36 of <italic>COL1A1</italic> that were registered in the Human Type I and Type III Collagen Mutation Database. All of these mutations were missense mutations that converted a glycine codon to a serine, asparagine, or an arginine codon. Most of these mutations resulted in the severe OI type II. The Q644X in our study is the first nonsense mutation observed to occur in exon 36, and it also indicates that the coding sequence in exon 36 is essential for <italic>COL1A1</italic>'s function.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the family for participation in this project.
