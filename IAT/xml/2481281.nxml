This protein binds CXCR4 and displays an exceptional degree of conservation (99&#x00025;) in mammals. CXCL12&#x003b3; is formed by a protein core shared by all CXCL12 isoforms, extended by a highly cationic carboxy-terminal (C-ter) domain that encompass four overlapped BBXB heparan sulfate (HS)-binding motifs. We hypothesize that this unusual domain could critically determine the biological properties of CXCL12&#x003b3; through its interaction to, and regulation by extracellular glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and HS in particular. By both RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, we mapped the localization of CXCL12&#x003b3; both in mouse and human tissues, where it showed discrete differential expression. As an unprecedented feature among chemokines, the secreted CXCL12&#x003b3; strongly interacted with cell membrane GAG, thus remaining mostly adsorbed on the plasmatic membrane upon secretion. Affinity chromatography and surface plasmon resonance allowed us to determine for CXCL12&#x003b3; one of the higher affinity for HS (K<sub>d</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.9 nM) ever reported for a protein. This property relies in the presence of four canonical HS-binding sites located at the C-ter domain but requires the collaboration of a HS-binding site located in the core of the protein. Interestingly, and despite reduced agonist potency on CXCR4, the sustained binding of CXCL12&#x003b3; to HS enabled it to promote <italic>in vivo</italic> intraperitoneal leukocyte accumulation and angiogenesis in matrigel plugs with much higher efficiency than CXCL12&#x003b1;. In good agreement, mutant CXCL12&#x003b3; chemokines selectively devoid of HS-binding capacity failed to promote <italic>in vivo</italic> significant cell recruitment. We conclude that CXCL12&#x003b3; features unique structural and functional properties among chemokines which rely on the presence of a distinctive C-ter domain. The unsurpassed capacity to bind to HS on the extracellular matrix would make CXCL12&#x003b3; the paradigm of haptotactic proteins, which regulate essential homeostatic functions by promoting directional migration and selective tissue homing of cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The CXC chemokine, stromal cell-derived factor 1/CXCL12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Tashiro1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> is a constitutive and broadly expressed chemokine that exerts its functions through the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) CXCR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Bleul1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Here, we have characterized for the first time the expression of CXCL12&#x003b3; at the protein level. The apparent exclusion of both <italic>Cxcl12&#x003b3;</italic> mRNA and protein from discrete places suggests that the expression of this isoform is tightly regulated by a RNA-splicing regulatory mechanism. Remarkably, CXCL12&#x003b3; seems to be expressed in anatomical sites, such as small vessels and lower respiratory tract, where it could be involved in the diapedesis of inflammatory leukocytes and other cells from hematopoietic origin. In embryo, its enhanced capacity to form haptotactic gradients could be critical for guiding discrete cell precursors into their final localization during organogenesis.</p><p>The tight array of BBXB motifs in the CXCL12&#x003b3; C-ter domain, that distinguish this protein from other CXCL12 isoforms, is unprecedented among HS-binding proteins. The C-ter domain has on its own a marked affinity for heparin that decreases dramatically when HS-binding motifs are mutated. This observation is in keeping with our results issued from a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis of the soluble form of this chemokine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Laguri1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, which revealed that the C-ter peptide is unfolded and could offer an accessible, highly cationic surface for the molecular recognition in the interaction with GAG. Our interpretation of SPR findings is that the high affinity for the oligosaccharide displayed by &#x003b3;-wt largely relies in the low k<sub>off</sub> of the HP/&#x003b3;-wt complexes which has been estimated to be 0.0019 M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, contrasting with the rapid dissociation from HP observed for &#x003b1;-wt (k<sub>off</sub> 0.111 M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Laguri1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. This is well exemplified by the SPR profile obtained with the mutant &#x003b3;-m1. This mutant dissociates more rapidly from HP and shows a marked, reduced interaction with HP as compared to the wild type counterpart. However, it retains a substantial affinity for HP that might result from the stabilization of the complex through the collaboration between the conserved BBXB motif in the core of the chemokine and the remaining positive charges in the yet highly cationic C-ter domain. Collectively, these data underline the important contribution of the C-ter BBXB motifs to the formation of high-affinity and stable HP/&#x003b3;-wt complexes.</p><p>The chemokine-binding experiments carried out in intact cells proved the specificity and high affinity of &#x003b3;-wt for cellular HS structures, thus validating the biological relevance of the <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis. The astounding strong interaction of &#x003b3;-wt with cell GAG was also observed in an alternative assay. Indeed, our findings prove that &#x003b3;-wt is massively adsorbed at the cell surface following secretion. The simplest explanation for this phenomenon is that the secreted &#x003b3;-wt could be rapidly trapped on cell-surface HS structures. Alternatively, the high affinity of &#x003b3;-wt for HS might result in the formation of an intracellular complex before being expressed at the cell surface, a phenomenon previously described for the Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Nickel1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. On view of the low dissociation rate of HS-&#x003b3;-wt complexes, it can be speculated that the secreted, free form of the chemokine hardly would reach the equilibrium of interaction with immobilized HS and that under physiological conditions, the binding of natural CXCL12&#x003b3; to extracellular HS structures is tight and long-lasting.</p><p>Using lymphoid T cells, we confirm that &#x003b3;-wt signals through CXCR4 with diminished agonist potency as compared to &#x003b1;-wt. This can be accounted for by the decreased affinity of &#x003b3;-wt for CXCR4 that was previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Laguri1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. It can be hypothesized that, either the electrostatic interactions of the highly cationic C-ter domain with the negatively charged N-ter domain and extracellular loops of CXCR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Brelot1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, or the steric hindrance promoted by the bulky basic residues in the &#x003b3;-wt C-ter domain, impair the specific interaction with CXCR4 and therefore reduce the agonist potency of &#x003b3;-wt.</p><p>Importantly, neutralization of positive charges in the BBXB motifs of &#x003b3;-wt (&#x003b3;-m1 and &#x003b3;-m2) leads to an increased affinity for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Laguri1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and activation of CXCR4 comparable to this achieved either by &#x003b1;-wt or &#x003b1;-m, two proteins that preserves similar overstructure and efficiency towards CXCR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Amara1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Collectively, these findings conclusively identify the charged C-ter domain as responsible for the distinctive structural and cell-signaling properties showed by &#x003b3;-wt. In contrast to the situation observed for CXCR4, &#x003b3;-wt binding to CXCR7 is comparable to this of &#x003b1;-wt, suggesting that molecular determinants of CXCL12 for binding to CXCR4 and CXCR7 are different.</p><p>The demonstration of <italic>in vivo</italic> consequences of chemokine/GAG interactions have been hampered by conformational changes consecutive to the mutagenesis of BBXB consensus sites that leads frequently to an overall reduced affinity of the chemokine for the corresponding receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Proudfoot1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The naturally occurring CXCL12&#x003b3; protein is free of this bias and offers an unprecedented opportunity to ascertain the importance of chemokine/GAG complexing in the regulation of <italic>in vivo</italic> cell migration in adult life.</p><p>The capacity of endogenous CXCL12&#x003b1; to promote leukocyte attraction in the peritoneum has been proved previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Soriano1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

The secreted signalling protein Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A) is another potent and specific angiogenic factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Ferrara1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Vegf-A</italic> isoforms are produced by alternative splicing from a single gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Tischer1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> and their levels are exquisitely regulated through transcriptional control and mRNA stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Neufeld1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly to CXCL12, these isoforms differ by the absence or presence of protein domains that confer the ability to bind heparin and therefore could mediate their capacity to interact differentially with GAG components in the extracellular environment of VEGF-secreting cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Houck1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. In keeping with this assumption, it has been shown that the absence of the heparin-binding isoforms of VEGF-A alters the distribution and gradients of VEGF-A protein without heparin-binding capacity in tissues and leads to a reduced vascular branching complexity and increased microvessel calibre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002543-Ruhrberg1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. This situation is reminiscent of our observation showing that &#x003b3;-wt displays an enhanced capacity to induce <italic>in vivo</italic> recruitment of cells as compared to &#x003b1;-wt, which is due to its enhanced affinity for HS.
