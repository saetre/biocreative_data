As expected, a portion of the encoded protein, containing the homeodomain, is capable of sequence-specific DNA-binding. Outside the homeodomain, Prh, possesses an N-terminal region extremely rich in proline residues and a C-terminal acidic portion, either of which may function as transcription regulatory domains. Since, among the chicken tissues tested, its transcription is restricted to haematopoietic cells, lung and liver, it may function in tissue-specific patterns of gene regulation. Human and murine Prh homologues have also been identified; so it is likely that such genes are a general feature of vertebrate genomes.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0150-a" xlink:role="5664"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0151-a" xlink:role="5665"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5661"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5662"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5663"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5664"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5665"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0152.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5666"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0153.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5667"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
