In contrast, the expressions of TLR-4 and CD14 were not significantly different between groups, and the response to lipopolysaccharide (a TLR-4 ligand) stimulation was not significantly different either. At discharge from hospital TLR-2 expression was down-regulated in peripheral blood monocytes from AECOPD patients. This could be due to the treatment with systemic steroids because, <italic>in vitro</italic>, steroids down-regulated TLR-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner.

COPD is also associated with systemic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which is likely to contribute significantly to some important extra-pulmonary consequences of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], namely cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and cachexia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Both, pulmonary and systemic inflammation, flare-up during the episodes of acute exacerbation (AECOPD) that occur often in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is generally accepted that some form of bacterial and/or viral infection is the main cause of AECOPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], but the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these episodes have not been fully characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Further, the relationship between bacterial airway colonization and the abnormal pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response that characterizes COPD is unclear.</p><p>Mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLR) comprise a family of germ line-encoded trans-membrane receptors which recognize conserved microbial structures, the so called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Activation of TLRs leads to the induction of inflammatory responses and to the development of antigen specific adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Among this family of receptors, TLR-2 and TLR-4 have received great attention. TLR-4 is essential for the recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of Gram-negative bacteria, whereas TLR-2 recognizes a large number of ligands including bacterial lipotheicoid acid and lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. CD14 is a 55-kDa GPI-linked glycoprotein that also participates in pathogen recognition and uses TLRs as co-receptors in signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It has been shown that microbial components interact primarily with CD14 and subsequently with the TLRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Because many patients with stable COPD present airway colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and bacterial infection is a key trigger of AECOPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], we hypothesized that TLR may participate in the regulation of inflammation in COPD, particularly during the episodes of AECOPD. To investigate it, we first compared the expression of TLR-2, TLR-4 and CD14 in circulating monocytes harvested from COPD patients (both during AECOPD and when clinically stable), smokers with normal lung function and never smokers. Then, we investigated the functionality of these receptors upon stimulation with specific ligands. Finally, we studied the effect of steroids, a drug routinely used in the treatment of AECOPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and IL-6, a cytokine known to be elevated in the systemic circulation of COPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], upon the expression of TLR-2, TLR-4 and CD14.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Population and ethics</title><p>All participants gave their written consent after being fully informed of the study, which was previously approved by the Ethics Committee of our institution. Patients with COPD were considered clinically stable if they had not had an AECOPD episode and/or had required a change in their usual therapy during the last 3 months. COPD patients were treated with long-acting inhaled bronchodilators and 6 received inhaled steroids but none was under oral steroid therapy. Subjects with atopic diseases, allergic rhinitis and asthma were excluded. To avoid any potential effect of acute smoking, active smokers refrained from smoking 12 hours before examination; exhaled carbon monoxide concentration was lower than 10 ppm in all subjects. Patients with AECOPD were studied within the first 24 hours of hospital admission; at discharge and 3 months later, when clinically stable again. Healthy subjects and smokers with normal lung function were recruited from the pulmonary function laboratory of our institution.</p><p>Because of the small volume of blood collected (5 to 8 ml), we could not perform all the analysis for each patient and therefore the cell stimulation experiments were performed only with a small group of them. Indeed, performing all the experiments with the cells of the same patient was not allowed by the Ethics Committee because of the large blood volume (30 ml) needed and since many of them was hospitalized due to a worsening of their clinical status.</p></sec><sec><title>Bacterial isolation</title><p>AECOPD and COPD patients spontaneously expectorated sputum samples when the clinics visit.

Recently it has been shown that the commercial PGN preparation used in this work contains lipoteichoid acid which is the true TLR-2 agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

Finally, monocytes from AECOPD patients expressed similar amounts of CD14 (407 &#x000b1; 70.76 <italic>mfi</italic>) than monocytes from never smokers (395 &#x000b1; 117.2 <italic>mfi</italic>), stable COPD patients (439 &#x000b1; 116.8 <italic>mfi</italic>) or smokers (422 &#x000b1; 154.4 <italic>mfi</italic>) (fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, panel C).</p></sec><sec><title>TLR functionality</title><p>To study the functional response of TLRs, purified monocytes harvested from AECOPD patients at admission, stable COPD patients, smokers or never smokers were stimulated with PGN or highly purified LPS (stimuli that signal through TLR-2 and TLR-4 respectively) and the amounts of TNF&#x003b1; and IL-6 secreted taken as read-out for monocyte activation. No differences were observed in the amount of TNF&#x003b1; secreted by unstimulated monocytes from never smokers, smokers, AECOPD and COPD patients (20 &#x000b1; 4 pg/ml, 27 &#x000b1; 9 pg/ml 24 &#x000b1; 8 pg/ml and 22 &#x000b1; 4 pg/ml respectively). The basal secretion of IL-6 was also similar in the three groups (110 &#x000b1; 10 pg/ml, 127 &#x000b1; 22 pg/ml, 95 &#x000b1; 8 pg/ml and 116 &#x000b1; 15 pg/ml respectively). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> (panels A and B) shows that monocytes from AECOPD (n = 5) and stable COPD (n = 5) stimulated with PGN secreted significantly higher amounts of both cytokines than similarly treated monocytes obtained from never smokers (n = 5) and smokers (n = 5). Monocytes from never smokers secreted similar amounts of both cytokines than monocytes from smokers. When LPS was used as stimulus, monocytes from patients secreted similar amounts of both cytokines than monocytes obtained from never smokers or smokers (fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, panels C and D). These results are in agreement with the fact that TLR-2 expression, but not that of TLR-4, was up-regulated in monocytes from AECOPD and stable COPD patients. We did not find significant differences in the secretion of cytokines between monocytes harvested from AECOPD or stable COPD patients independently of the stimuli used.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of steroids on TLR expression</title><p>According to international guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], patients with AECOPD were treated during hospitalization with intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone 2 mg/Kg/day during 3 days with a progressive reduction of the drug in the following 11 days), bronchodilator (salbutamol 2.5&#x02013;5 mg every 6 h) and antibiotics (levofloxacin 500 mg/day during 7&#x02013;10 days or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 875 mg/8 h during 7&#x02013;10 days). In parallel, we found a significant reduction of TLR-2 expression in AECOPD patients studied at discharge (fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> panel A) that was no longer different from that of never smokers (5.56 &#x000b1; 2.20 <italic>mfi </italic>vs 4.01 &#x000b1; 1.94 <italic>mfi </italic>respectively; p = 0.11). In contrast, neither the expression of TLR-4 (fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> panel B) nor that of CD14 (fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> panel C) changed during hospitalization. In 6 of these AECOPD patients, TLR-2 expression was monitored 3 months after hospital discharge and an increase in TLR-2 expression was found (7.02 &#x000b1; 1.52 <italic>mfi</italic>). Actually, these levels were not significantly different from those determined in AECOPD patients at admission (7.02 &#x000b1; 1.52 <italic>mfi </italic>vs 6.78 &#x000b1; 0.47 <italic>mfi </italic>respectively; p = 0.31), suggesting that TLR-2 downregulation is transient.</p><p>To further characterize the effect of steroids upon TLR-2 expression, monocytes harvested from patients with AECOPD (5 different patients) were incubated <italic>in vitro </italic>with increasing doses of methylprednisolone (3 h; 0.01 to 1 &#x003bc;M). We found that steroids down-regulated the expression of TLR-2 in a dose-dependent fashion (fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). A similar effect was seen when dexamethasone was used instead of methylprednisolone (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Role of systemic inflammation in TLRs expression</title><p>We found that the plasma concentration of IL-6 was significantly higher in sera from AECOPD patients (5.19 &#x000b1; 1.03 pg/ml) and stable COPD patients (5.75 &#x000b1; 0.86 pg/ml) than in never smokers (2.61 &#x000b1; 0.13 pg/ml, p = 0.02). To investigate the functional role of IL-6 upon TLRs expression, purified monocytes from never smokers were incubated in the presence of IL-6 and TLRs expression was evaluated by flow cytometry. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows that IL-6 up-regulated the expression levels of TLR-2 (panel A; 10 &#x000b1; 1.2 <italic>mfi </italic>in the presence of IL-6 versus 3.8 &#x000b1; 0.9 <italic>mfi </italic>in absence of IL-6; p = 0.001) whereas the levels of TLR-4 (panel B; 2.5 &#x000b1; 1.3 <italic>mfi </italic>in the presence of IL-6 versus 2.2 &#x000b1; 0.5 <italic>mfi </italic>in the absence of IL-6; p &#x0003e; 0.05) and CD14 (data not shown) were unaffected. In parallel experiments we observed that neither IL-8 nor IL-1&#x003b2; modified TLR-2 expression (data not shown), thereby arguing against a general non-specific effect due to the incubation of monocytes with cytokines.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study shows that the expression of TLR-2 was up-regulated in peripheral blood monocytes harvested from COPD patients, either when clinically stable or during an exacerbation of the disease, as compared to never smokers or smokers with normal lung function. Furthermore, upon stimulation with agonist signalling through TLR-2, monocytes from COPD patients secreted increased amounts of IL-6 and TNF&#x003b1; than similarly stimulated monocytes from never smokers and smokers with normal lung function. In contrast, the expressions of TLR-4 and CD14 were not significantly different between groups and the response to LPS stimulation (a TLR-4 specific ligand) was not significantly different. We also showed that at discharge, TLR-2 expression was down-regulated in peripheral blood monocytes from AECOPD patients. This could be due to the treatment with systemic steroids because, <italic>in vitro</italic>, steroids down-regulated TLR-2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, we demonstrated that IL-6, whose plasma levels are elevated in patients, up-regulated TLR-2 expression <italic>in vitro </italic>in purified monocytes from never smokers, thereby connecting the systemic inflammation that characterizes COPD and TLR-2 expression. Altogether, these findings may be relevant for a better understanding of, first, the mechanisms triggering the abnormal inflammatory response that characterizes COPD, particularly during the episodes of AECOPD, and, second, the molecular effects of some therapeutic options available to date.</p><p>TLRs are key molecules in host defence against microbial pathogens. TLRs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) who trigger the expression of proinflammatory genes and the development of antigen specific adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Most of our current knowledge of TLR signalling has emerged from studies of gene-targeted mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The contribution of TLR function to human disease is less advanced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. So far research has mainly focused on the relationship between presence of TLRs polymorphisms and susceptibility to a disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Since the available data indicate that there would not be a TLR polymorphism associated with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] in this study we analyzed whether the expression and/or functionality of TLRs was altered. We reasoned that the increased secretion of inflammatory mediators found in COPD patients could be due to an up-regulation of TLRs expression. This hypothesis was based on studies showing that macrophages overexpressing TLRs release higher amount of inflammatory mediators upon TLR engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Indeed we found that TLR-2 (but not TLR-4) expression was up-regulated in monocytes of COPD patients (both when clinically stable and during AECOPD), and that these cells secreted elevated levels of inflammatory mediators upon challenge with preparations containing TLR-2 agonists (but not with LPS) (fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However it could be possible that the upregulation of TLR-2 could not be the only explanation behind the increased levels of inflammatory mediators. Thus different levels of molecules of the TLR intracellular signalling pathway might also account for the increased secretion of mediators. However this possibility seems unlikely given the facts that TLR-2 only transduces the signal via the MyD88-dependent signalling pathway which is also used by TLR-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and that TLR-4 dependent responses were not affected. On the other hand, recently it has been shown that NOD2 recognizes PGN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and therefore activation of NOD2 dependent signalling pathway might also account for our results. However it is important to note that activation of this receptor requires an intracellular presentation of PGN which it is not the case in our experimental set up. Nevertheless it cannot be ruled out that function and/or expression of the elements of this signalling pathway could be altered in COPD patients. Future studies will address this issue.</p><p>TLR-2 up-regulation in peripheral blood monocytes can contribute significantly to the systemic inflammation that occurs in COPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Interestingly, Riordan et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] have reported similar findings in patients with liver cirrhosis, a disease that, like COPD, is associated with systemic inflammation. The airways of patients with stable COPD are often colonized by bacteria, and bacterial pathogens (mainly nontypable <italic>Haemophilus influenzae </italic>and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>) can be isolated in more than 70% of AECOPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Importantly, PAMPs of these pathogens activate inflammatory responses via TLR-2 among other TLRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These bacteria are highly fragile and tend to autolysis, thereby facilitating that their PAMPs reach the systemic circulation. Hence, PAMPs-mediated activation of monocytes via TLR-2 can contribute to the systemic inflammation of COPD. Likewise, TLRs also recognize endogenous ligands ("danger signals") produced by cells undergoing stress or necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Considering that COPD is characterized by considerable tissue injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], it is also possible that these endogenous ligands could engage TLRs and contribute to systemic inflammation even in the absence of bacterial PAMPs.</p><p>Several potential mechanisms can contribute to up regulate TLR-2 in monocytes from COPD patients. Smoking is not likely to be one of them because cells from smokers with normal lung function expressed similar amounts of TLR-2 than cells from never smokers (fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Bacterial PAMPs may also contribute to TLR-2 upregulation in patients. In fact, it has been shown that the PAMPs'of <italic>H. influenzae </italic>up-regulate TLR-2 expression but not that of TLR-4 in eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Yet, sputum cultures in the majority of patients studied here were negative, although it is known that airway bacterial colonization can occur despite the negativity of sputum cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Finally, inflammatory cytokines may also alter TLRs expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Indeed, we found that IL-6 up-regulated TLR-2 expression <italic>in vitro </italic>in monocytes obtained from never smokers (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the pro-inflammatory milieu known to occur in COPD has a similar effect.</p><p>One limitation of our study is that we have not evaluated whether TLR-2 expression is up-regulated in other peripheral blood cells. Sabroe et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] have shown that neutrophils and basophils express TLR-2 and TLR-4 albeit at lower levels than monocytes. Of note these authors demonstrated that neutrophils responses to bactetial PAMPs, specifically the up-regulation of CD11b and shedding of L-selectin, were heavily dependent upon the presence of monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These adhesion molecules are up-regulated in neutrophils of COPD patients but not in cells from smokers with normal lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Future studies will address, on one hand, the expression of TLR by neutrophils and, on the other hand, the role of monocytes from COPD patients in the response of neutrophils from COPD patients to PAMPs and endogenous ligands.</p><p>Another, obvious, limitation of our study is that we analyzed circulating monocytes and not alveolar macrophages. We used this approach because of the difficulties to obtain pulmonary cells during AECOPD and because we decided to start exploring the role of TLRs in COPD using the less invasive technique possible. While this manuscript was under revision, Droemann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] reported that alveolar macrophages from COPD patients and smokers express less TLR-2 than never smokers and recently we have obtained similar results (Regueiro and Bengoechea, unpublished findings). Droemann and colleagues also examined TLR-2 expression in peripheral blood monocytes and, in contrast to our results, they did not find a significant increase in TLR-2 expression in monocytes from COPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. At present we cannot explain this discrepancy although the patients recruited in our study are more homogeneous in terms of age, smoking story and FEV1 than the ones recruited by Droemann et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This may explain the differences in terms of SD between our studies when the results obtained using flow cytometry are compared which undoubtedly affect the outcome of the statistical analysis.</p><p>Care should be taken to directly extrapolate findings obtained in systemic circulation to the pulmonary compartment and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Monocytes enter into the lungs both constitutively to keep alveolar macrophage homeostasis as well as during lung inflammation. It will be interesting to study the contribution of monocytes overexpressing TLR-2 to the lung inflammation of COPD patients and also the possible effect of lung environment on the expression of TLR-2 after monocytes have been recruited. In this context, a recent study using a mice model of acute lung inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] shows that inflammatory recruited monocytes up-regulate gene expression of chemokines, TNF&#x003b1; and lysosomal proteases and down-regulate TLR-2 expression. Several studies have reported that alveolar macrophages from COPD patients show also these features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Our findings may have some clinical implications. First, we showed that steroids reduce TLR-2 expression <italic>in vitro </italic>(fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and, this may happen also <italic>in vivo </italic>(fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) arguing against the recently postulated steroid-resistance of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Second, systemic inflammation is a significant contributor to many of the systemic consequences of COPD, including skeletal muscle dysfunction and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The latter may be particularly relevant in this context because TLR's have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Thus therapeutic strategies to control TLR-2-dependent signalling might be useful in COPD. However, paralysing the TLR-2 -dependent activation of the innate immunity may increase the risk of bacterial infections. An alternative approach would be to diminish TLR-2 expression. This could be achieved by blocking the effect of IL-6 on TLR-2 expression using an antibody against the receptor of this cytokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] or blocking the IL-6 intracellular signalling pathway through the induction of SOCS3, an endogenous signalling repressor of cytokine signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies are currently going on in our laboratory to test the feasibility of these approaches in COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our study reveals abnormalities in TLRs expression in peripheral blood monocytes from COPD patients, highlights its potential relationship with systemic inflammation in these patients and identifies potential novel therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All author(s) declare that they have no competing interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Most of the experiments of this study were done by J Pons, V Regueiro and C Santos.
