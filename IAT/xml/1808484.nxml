At present, little is known about how the SNARE complexes mediating these two distinct pathways differ in structure. Using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular synapse as a model, we show that a mutation modifying a hydrophobic layer in syntaxin 1A regulates the rate of vesicle fusion. Syntaxin 1A molecules share a highly conserved threonine in the C-terminal &#x0002b;7 layer near the transmembrane domain. Mutation of this threonine to isoleucine results in a structural change that more closely resembles those found in syntaxins ascribed to the constitutive secretory pathway. Flies carrying the I254 mutant protein have increased levels of SNARE complexes and dramatically enhanced rate of both constitutive and evoked vesicle fusion. In contrast, overexpression of the T254 wild-type protein in neurons reduces vesicle fusion only in the I254 mutant background. These results are consistent with molecular dynamics simulations of the SNARE core complex, suggesting that T254 serves as an internal brake to dampen SNARE zippering and impede vesicle fusion, whereas I254 favors fusion by enhancing intermolecular interaction within the SNARE core complex.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Most living cells constantly renew their membrane compositions and frequently communicate with neighboring cells by delivering cargo molecules from small vesicles. A key step in cargo delivery requires the fusion of the vesicle membrane with the target membrane mediated by SNARE proteins. In most cellular compartments, fusion occurs constitutively, requiring little participation of other molecules. In other cellular compartments, such as synapses in the nervous system, vesicle fusion is predominantly triggered by intracellular calcium ions. At present, constitutive and regulated fusion modes are not well understood.</p><p>In this study, we found that a mutant SNARE protein, syntaxin at the synapse, contained a building block commonly conserved for syntaxins functioning along constitutive secretory pathways. Further, our modeling predicted that the mutant syntaxin could form a tightly packed SNARE bundle closely resembling that found in the endosome, but differing from the relatively loosely packed bundle found at the wild-type synapse. Our experimental data support the hypothesis that the mutant syntaxin lowered the energy barrier for vesicle fusion by tightening the SNARE bundle. These findings reveal a novel, intrinsic structural feature of the SNARE complex that regulates vesicle fusion rate at different cellular compartments.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A syntaxin 1A threonine to isoleucine mutation is found to enhance SNARE complex formation and vesicle fusion.

As vesicles undergo fusion, the SNARE complex rearranges from a <italic>trans</italic> to a <italic>cis</italic> configuration such that all the SNARE proteins are localized to one membrane. The <italic>cis</italic> complex is then thought to be rapidly disrupted by the ATPase NSF &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b010">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, allowing the v-SNARE to be recycled into synaptic vesicles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Although the specific mechanism of vesicle fusion is still in debate, it is now widely accepted that the formation of this four-helix bundle is essential for the fusion of the vesicle phospholipid bilayer with the plasma membrane phospholipid bilayer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Vesicle fusion can be constitutive or triggered by calcium ion (Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. In the latter case, the putative Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensor synaptotagmin I plays a critical role &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Constitutive vesicle fusion differs from regulated secretion in that it is relatively less dependent on intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. This has been demonstrated in reconstituted secretory cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; and at synapses, including mammalian &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; and invertebrate nerve terminals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. In these preparations, removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or reduction of intraterminal &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d; by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> chelators does not stop spontaneous vesicle fusion. At the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-free saline containing ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) does not alter the rate of spontaneous release &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. These observations collectively suggest that spontaneous vesicle fusion can occur even when intracellular &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d; is reduced. This implies that a mechanism exists to overcome the energy barrier for vesicle fusion at low-Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> conditions. Because SNARE complexes also mediate vesicle fusion along the constitutive secretory pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, it is conceivable that this mechanism lies within the different structural and/or biochemical properties of SNARE complexes used for constitutive secretion and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-regulated exocytosis.</p><p>The synapse offers an ideal site to test this hypothesis because both forms of secretion co-exist and the SNARE proteins involved in the process are well studied. Furthermore, vesicle fusion can be readily detected at single-vesicle levels using electrophysiology &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. In this study, we focused on a point mutation, T254I in syntaxin 1A, located at the &#x0002b;7 layer of the SNARE core complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;, and its role in SNARE complex assembly and synaptic transmission in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In an earlier study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, it was demonstrated that this mutation <italic>(syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup>)</italic> completely abolished the assembly of the SNARE complex at the restrictive temperature. Consequently, synaptic transmission was fully blocked and the fly paralyzed. Along with previous genetic deletion or mutation studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b022">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, these results provided important in vivo evidence that SNARE complex assembly was essential for synaptic vesicle fusion. However, our re-investigation of the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant shows that the T254I mutation blocks neither the assembly of the SNARE complex nor synaptic transmission at the restrictive temperature. Instead, we find that the T254I mutation promotes the formation of the SNARE complex as well as vesicle fusion at permissive temperatures. These findings are consistent with a molecular model of the SNARE complex, suggesting that the T254I mutation causes a structural change of the &#x0002b;7 layer so that the mutant layer more closely resembles those found along constitutive secretory pathways. By enhancing the hydrophobic core of the molecule in the vicinity of layer &#x0002b;7, towards the C-terminal transmembrane helix, the mutant SNARE complex favors &#x0201c;constitutive-like&#x0201d; vesicle secretion either by increasing intermolecular interactions among the SNARE bundles or by stimulating vesicle docking and/or priming. These results suggest an evolutionarily conserved mechanism intrinsic to the structure of SNARE complexes that could act as a molecular switch to regulate the rate of vesicle fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> Mutation Does Not Block Synaptic Transmission or SNARE Complex Assembly at Restrictive Temperatures</title><p>Syntaxin 1A is a critical component of the SNARE complex and is thought to be essential for synaptic vesicle fusion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. A previous study showed that mutation of threonine (T) to isoleucine (I) at position 254 in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> syntaxin 1A was sufficient to abolish the assembly of SNARE complexes at restrictive temperatures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. However, this conclusion is questionable if we take into consideration the conservation and divergence of residues at this position among different syntaxins. Our sequence analysis shows that, with the exception of syntaxin 4, most syntaxins found at the plasma membrane have a highly conserved T254 residue at the &#x0002b;7 layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Notably, the T254-containing syntaxins, such as syntaxin 1, 2, and 3, are typically used for regulated vesicle fusion at either synapses or neurosecretory cells in a diverse range of animal species &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b025">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, syntaxins involved in most constitutive secretion pathways in both animals and plants have one of the following amino acids at their equivalent positions: isoleucine, leucine (L), or valine (V) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g001">Figure 1</xref>B; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050072-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Valine, leucine, and isoleucine are similar in that they are hydrophobic, branch-chained amino acids. Therefore, this substitution of the residue at position 254 among syntaxins in the constitutive pathways is highly conserved throughout evolution. There are a few exceptions to this generalization. The yeast plasma membrane syntaxin orthologs have a threonine at the equivalent position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g001">Figures 1</xref>B and S1). Furthermore, T254-containing syntaxins could also function in non-synaptic secretions, such as syntaxin 2 in postsynaptic membrane trafficking &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; and <italic>Drosophila</italic> syntaxin 1A in cuticle secretion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Nonetheless, the overall feature emerging from our analysis is that syntaxins with conserved isoleucine at the &#x0002b;7 layer appear to be selectively involved in regulated secretion at synapses or neurosecretory cells.</p><p>It is particularly interesting to note that the T254I mutation found in the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant approximates a reversion to a residue of wild-type syntaxins found in the constitutive secretory pathway. Notably, syntaxin 5 isoforms place an isoleucine at the site equivalent to position 254. Syntaxin 5 clearly functions in mammal <italic>cis</italic> Golgi networks at normal body temperature, similar to the temperature at which the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant is reported to lose the ability to form SNARE complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. This prompted us to reconsider whether the T254I mutant syntaxin 1A indeed ceases to function at restrictive temperatures. To this end, we thoroughly re-examined the behavior, synaptic transmission, and SNARE complex formation of the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant fly at elevated temperatures. Our tests showed that <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant flies were rapidly paralyzed at 38 &#x000b0;C and recovered within 3 min when returned to permissive temperature after a 20-min period of paralysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g002">2</xref>B). The paralysis and recovery rates were identical to those shown previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. However, different from the previous observations, we noted that the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant fly was paralyzed, but not motionless: the flies constantly shook their legs and abdomens during the period of paralysis at 38 &#x000b0;C (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050072-sv001">Video S1</xref> with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050072-sv002">Video S2</xref>). We used a wild-type fly <italic>(Canton-S &#x0005b;CS&#x0005d;)</italic> and two other temperature-sensitive paralytic flies, <italic>Shibire<sup>ts1</sup> (Shi<sup>ts1</sup>)</italic> and <italic>paralytic<sup>ts1</sup> (para<sup>ts1</sup>)</italic> as controls. As expected, <italic>Shi<sup>ts1</sup></italic> and <italic>para<sup>ts1</sup></italic> flies were completely paralyzed due either to a block of synaptic vesicle recycling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; or a failure of action potential propagation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, respectively, and did not exhibit the shaking seen in the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant. Upon returning to room temperature, <italic>Shi<sup>ts1</sup></italic>, <italic>para<sup>ts1</sup>,</italic> and <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> flies all resumed their normal activities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050072-sv003">Video S3</xref>).</p><p>These behavioral observations suggest that synaptic transmission persists in <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> flies at the restrictive temperature. To further test this idea, we examined leg movement upon the activation of the giant fiber pathway in adult flies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. We stimulated the giant fiber neurons located in the head and observed the movement of fly legs (the body and wings were anchored with wax on a slide). Repetitive and phase-locked leg shaking was readily observed in <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> flies at both the permissive temperature (20 &#x000b0;C; unpublished data) and restrictive temperature (38 &#x000b0;C) following each stimulus of the giant fiber neurons (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050072-sv004">Video S4</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Shi<sup>ts1</sup></italic> flies moved their legs in response to each stimulus only at the permissive temperature (20 &#x000b0;C; unpublished data), but not at the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050072-sv005">Video S5</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g002">Figure 2</xref>C (rightmost panels) summarizes the spontaneous and electrical stimulation&#x02013;evoked leg movement in <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> flies and the lack of such movement in <italic>Shi<sup>ts1</sup></italic> flies at restrictive temperatures.</p><p>The persistence of synaptically evoked leg movements at the restrictive temperature suggests that synaptic transmission remains intact through multiple synapses (an electrical synapse and two chemical synapses) along the giant fiber pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. To directly measure synaptic transmission, we next recorded the synaptic response of the dorsal longitudinal indirect flight muscles (DLMs) from <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> flies maintained at 38 &#x000b0;C. Our results show that evoked synaptic transmission and the resulting action potential persisted at 38 &#x000b0;C (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). During the course of these experiments, we noted that intracellular electrodes were often dislodged from DLMs only from <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> flies, and there was a high incidence of spontaneous action potentials in the mutant DLMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g002">Figure 2</xref>D, inset).

Hence, synaptic transmission is not blocked at restrictive temperatures in <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> flies. As shown below, it is likely that paralysis of the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant is caused by excessive or uncoordinated release of transmitter, rather than a complete block of exocytosis as suggested previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Consistent with the observation that synaptic transmission persists along the giant fiber pathway, light-induced &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; transient potentials of electroretinograms (ERGs) were not blocked by exposure of the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> fly to the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

In our experiments, we carefully monitored the temperature of the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> fly by placing a temperature probe adjacent to the experimental fly. Additionally, we mounted another <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> fly beside the experimental fly so that we could observe the paralysis during the exposure at 38 &#x000b0;C and the recovery afterward. In a total of eight experiments, we never saw a loss of these transient potentials. In fact, our results showed that the &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; transient potential was slightly increased in amplitude at 38 &#x000b0;C (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Additionally, we also observed spontaneous and light-induced high-frequency &#x0201c;bursting&#x0201d; activities typically indicative of enhanced neuronal activity in both the wild-type and the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> flies (see arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g003">3</xref>C; see also &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;). Hyperactivity of the thoracic ganglion was also observed independently by Dr. Bruno van Swinderen's laboratory when <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> flies were exposed to the restrictive temperature (B. van Swinderen, personal communication).</p><p>Taken together, both our behavioral tests and electrophysiological analyses support the notion that synaptic transmission is not blocked in <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutants at restrictive temperatures. These results further suggest that the formation of the SNARE complex is not abolished in <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutants at the restrictive temperature. To test this hypothesis, we measured the level of SNARE complexes using the methods described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our results showed that the amount of the 7S SNARE complex and high molecular weight SNARE multimers (or oligomers) remained at wild-type levels in <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant flies at the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g004">4</xref>B). The <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant fly was exposed to 38 &#x000b0;C for 20 min prior to rapid freezing with liquid nitrogen and extraction of the SDS-resistant SNARE complex, as described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. In 50 separate experiments, we consistently observed the SNARE complex. This result has also been independently noted in Dr. Leo Pallanck's laboratory (L. Pallanck, personal communication). In a number of experiments, we also included the <italic>comatose (comt)</italic> mutant in our Western analysis and detected a consistent accumulation of the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), which is thought to be caused by dysfunction of NSF at restrictive temperatures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b010">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Taken together, all our observations show that the T254I mutation in syntaxin 1A does not block SNARE complex formation nor does it block synaptic transmission at restrictive temperatures. Because our results differ markedly from those reported earlier &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, we sought to confirm whether the mutant fly we studied indeed carried the T254I mutation as shown in the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant. Sequencing confirmed that there is a single base change from ACC to ATC in the open reading frame of syntaxin 1A (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050072-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Furthermore, we were able to rescue the paralysis (unpublished data) and electrophysiological defects by neuronal expression of the wild-type syntaxin 1A in the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant background (see below). These results leave little doubt that the phenotype we study here is specifically caused by the T254I mutation in <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant flies.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Structural Modeling Suggests That the T254I Mutation Tightens SNARE Complexes</title><p>To account for the hyperactivity observed in <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> flies, we next examined whether the T254I mutation in syntaxin 1A has any effect on SNARE assembly and synaptic function at permissive temperatures. Upon examination of the available crystal structures of SNARE core complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;, we found that many of the central layers are tightly packed with hydrophobic residues contained within the four helical bundles. An example of this tight packing in the &#x0002b;1 layer of the synaptic SNARE core complex is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g005">5</xref>B. The interactions of Leu57 and Ile178 from SNAP-25, Ile230 from syntaxin 1A, and Leu60 from synaptobrevin form square-planar geometry typical of the leucine zipper motif. In contrast, the &#x0002b;7 layer containing the wild-type syntaxin 1A is relatively loosely packed due to the presence of a conserved polar threonine residue at position 251 (equivalent to position 254 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> syntaxin 1A) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, which packs against more hydrophobic partners. Results of examination of homologous neuronal SNARE syntaxin proteins implied a similar loosely packed configuration in this layer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, the homologous layer of the endosomal SNARE X-ray structure (1GL2) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d; shows more reliance on hydrophobic, branched-chain amino acids, than the synaptic SNARE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). The resulting interaction may contribute more hydrophobic stability of the zippered endosomal complex relative to the wild-type synaptic SNARE complex. We therefore propose that the tightened &#x0002b;7 layer in the SNARE complex containing the T254I mutant syntaxin 1A may mimic the function of the endosomal complex.</p><p>Our modeling results do not support the observation that the T254I mutation debilitates SNARE complex assembly, as previously reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. To further verify this, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations of the SNARE complex in a water bath at 300 K for 5 ns using GROMACS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. After equilibration was achieved, there was no gross difference between the interactions of wild-type SNARE components and the mutant SNARE components. Also, the wild-type SNARE structure shows some degree of &#x0201c;fraying&#x0201d; at the termini of the complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Although this fraying effect is probably not physiologically relevant, per se, it does illustrate the looser packing of residues at the periphery of the wild-type complex. In our simulations, one would expect a destabilization of the termini (increase in fraying) if this mutation were indeed unstable; however, none was observed. Our simulation shows that the T254I mutation does not destabilize the complex, nor does it obviously increase the fraying at the terminus relative to wild-type.</p><p>Based on this structural analysis and modeling, we predict that the T254I mutation facilitates the formation or stability of the SNARE complex by enhancing intermolecular hydrophobic interactions among the four SNARE &#x003b1;-helices. Because this layer is near the C-terminal of the SNARE core complex, a tighter zippering of the SNARE complex may make fusion more probable by lowering the energy barrier for fusion and thereby partially abrogate the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependence of exocytosis. The mutant protein could also promote vesicle fusion by enhancing vesicle docking/priming. In other words, the T254I mutation may increase the rate of spontaneous release, turning the synapse into a constitutive secretion site. Alternatively, the T254I mutation could stabilize the <italic>cis</italic> SNARE complex such that it impedes vesicle recycling and ultimately reduces exocytosis upon repetitive nerve stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The Assembly of SNARE Complexes Is Enhanced in the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> Mutant at the Permissive Temperature</title><p>To test these structural predictions, we first investigated the biochemistry of SNARE complex assembly in the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant at room temperature.

This observation is consistent with the working model that I254-containing syntaxin 1A has a dominant positive effect on vesicle fusion.</p><p>We next recorded evoked release in heterozygotes and showed that the amplitude of evoked EPSPs (39 mV; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9) was similar to that in the homozygote (37.3 mV; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 1), but significantly higher than that in the wild type (25.3 mV, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g009">Figure 9</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g009">9</xref>E). These results indicate that the T254I mutant syntaxin 1A also has a dominant positive effect on Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-triggered vesicle fusion. However, it is clear that dilution of the mutant SNARE complex by the wild-type syntaxin 1A does not reduce evoked release, as it does to constitutive secretion. This observation is inconsistent with the possibility that the T254I mutant syntaxin 1A enhances Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx, as one would expect a greater increase in evoked release in the homozygote. A likely explanation we suggest is that the T254I mutant syntaxin 1A stimulates the formation of SNARE complexes in a dominant fashion. For a given level of SNARE complexes, the energy barrier for fusion correlates negatively with the amount of the T254I mutant syntaxin 1A. Although this energy barrier is increased for constitutive fusion in the heterozygote compared to the homozygote, this barrier should be overcome easily by the rise of intraterminal Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Our measurement of the SDS-resistant complex confirmed that the amount of SNARE complex was similar between homozygotes and heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050072-sg004">Figure S4</xref>).</p><p>This model further predicts that the increase in evoked release should occur in both homozygotes and heterozygotes at both low and high &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;. To this end, we recorded EPSPs at two additional Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations (1 mM and 0.4 mM). These Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations did not alter resting potentials (unpublished data), but they did affect transmitter release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050072-g009">Figure 9</xref>F). At 1 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, the average EPSP amplitude was similar in the heterozygote (<italic>syx/</italic>&#x0002b;<italic>,</italic> 48.6 mV, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 7) and homozygote (<italic>syx/syx,</italic> 49.5 mV, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6), but was consistently larger than the wild type (&#x0002b;<italic>/</italic>&#x0002b;, 42.7 mV, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 8; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). At 0.4 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, the amplitude of EPSPs in the wild type was quite small (3.5 mV, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9). In comparison, the amplitude of EPSPs was significantly larger in both heterozygotes (13.5 mV, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 8) and homozygotes (15.4 mV, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9) of <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

The relatively smaller increase of EPSP amplitude at increasingly higher &#x0005b;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d; reflects the ceiling effect due to non-linear summation.

Importantly, this enhancement of constitutive secretion persists in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-free saline and when intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is further reduced by chelation. This implies that spontaneous vesicle fusion is less dependent upon Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, a conclusion consistent with those reported in a number of synapses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b016">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, including the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Although we do not suggest that vesicle fusion is absolutely independent of intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, our studies support the notion that the T254I mutation makes vesicle fusion more efficient, regardless of whether it is constitutive or Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-regulated fusion.</p><p>Another major finding is that despite the high rate of constitutive fusion, the vesicle pool is not depleted, implying that vesicle docking or priming is enhanced in the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant via a yet unidentified mechanism. Consistent with the increase in mini frequency, evoked transmitter release is significantly increased in the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant. Thus, the T254I mutation stimulates both constitutive and evoked vesicle fusion. This increase in evoked transmitter release correlates well with the enhanced assembly of SNARE complexes in the mutant fly.</p><p>The third interesting finding is that the T254I mutant syntaxin 1A exerts a dominant positive effect on vesicle fusion. In heterozygous <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant (<italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic>/&#x0002b;), the rate of spontaneous fusion is slightly higher than that in the wild-type larvae, whereas evoked release remains at the homozygote level. Two lines of genetic and electrophysiological evidence suggest that this dominant positive effect is specifically associated with the T254I mutation in the <italic>syntaxin</italic> locus. First, the dominant positive effect persists in larvae carrying only one copy of the T254I mutation in the null mutant background (i.e., <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic>/<italic>syx<sup>&#x00394;229</sup></italic>). Second, neuronal overexpression of the wild-type syntaxin 1A effectively rescues the effect of the T254I mutant in the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic>/null mutant background. It is important to note that neuronal overexpression of the wild-type syntaxin 1A protein in the wild-type background has little effect on both spontaneous and evoked vesicle fusion. Therefore, the counterbalance exerted by the wild-type syntaxin 1A is specific to the T254I mutant syntaxin 1A. Taken together, these observations lend further support to the notion that the I254 mutant syntaxin 1A is more efficacious than the wild-type T254 syntaxin 1A in promoting vesicle fusion.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Potential Mechanisms Underlying the Effect of the T254I Mutant Syntaxin 1A</title><p>How might the T254I mutation exert such a dramatic effect on vesicle fusion? The precise mechanism is unknown; however, we believe the effect of the mutant protein can be better explained by examining the structural impact of the point mutation on the SNARE complex. The formation of the SNARE complex is generally accepted as an essential step in vesicle fusion. This conclusion is supported by considerable evidence accumulated over the last decade using a variety of experimental methods, including the use of specific neurotoxins to cleave SNARE proteins, and genetic mutations or deletion of SNARE genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.

Nonetheless, the zipper model serves as a good starting point for experimental testing of SNARE structure and function.</p><p>The T254I mutation is located at a strategic location near the end of the zipper, a presumed final step before vesicle fusion takes place. We have made three interesting observations of the &#x0002b;7 layer by sequence and structural comparison. First, with a few exceptions, nearly all syntaxins involved predominantly in regulated vesicle exocytosis at synapses or neurosecretory cells have a common hydrophilic residue, threonine, at position 254 in the &#x0002b;7 layer. In contrast, most syntaxins acting in the constitutive secretory pathways have one of the highly conserved hydrophobic residues (I, L, or V). Second, there is a conserved switch in the &#x0002b;7 layer packing among SNARE complexes used in different secretory pathways. This layer is loosely packed in &#x0201c;synaptic&#x0201d; SNAREs, but tightly bundled together in &#x0201c;constitutive&#x0201d; SNAREs, where hydrophobic residues (I, L, or V) may enhance direct intermolecular interactions among the four &#x003b1;-helices. Third, our structural modeling suggests that the T254I mutant &#x0002b;7 layer is more tightly packed than is the wild type, and that it resembles more the tight packing found in the endosomal SNARE core complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Based on our sequence and structural analyses, we favor the idea that a structural alteration of the &#x0002b;7 layer induced by the T254I mutation in syntaxin 1A may best account for our experimental observations. The extraordinarily high rate of spontaneous fusion detected in the <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant appears to support the &#x0201c;zipper model&#x0201d; or a modified zipper model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that tightening the SNARE complex does promote vesicle fusion. That overexpression of T254 syntaxin 1A specifically counteracts I254 mutant syntaxin 1A in vesicle fusion implies that the relatively loose packing of the &#x0002b;7 layer containing the wild-type syntaxin 1A may serve as an internal brake to dampen vesicle fusion. Once this brake is removed by the T254I substitution, the mutant SNARE complex lowers the energy barrier for vesicle fusion beyond a point of no return in a manner that is relatively less dependent on intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. This working model also explains why evoked release is enhanced in both homozygotes and heterozygotes.</p><p>We should stress that our results do not permit us to conclude whether or not SNARE complexes directly mediate vesicle fusion. Although pairing of SNARE proteins has been shown to mediate liposomal vesicle fusion in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;, the rate of liposomal fusion is slow. More importantly, new evidence suggests that SNARE proteins alone may bring the membranes in close apposition, but do not drive vesicle fusion under more physiological conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. The failure to mediate fusion in vitro suggests that other factors may either assist SNARE function or directly mediate vesicle fusion in vivo. Consistent with this idea, the vesicular ATPase (Vo) and synaptotagmin I have been reported to act either downstream of, or synergistically with, the SNAREs in vesicle fusion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. It is interesting to note that a G50E mutation in the N-terminal domain of SNAP-25 has previously been found to enhance both constitutive secretion and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-evoked release in <italic>Drosophila</italic> at the permissive temperature &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. Unlike the T254I mutation, this G50E (G43E in mammals) mutation is thought to cause a conformation change of SNAP-25 such that the mutant SNARE complex is more ready to mediate vesicle fusion. The precise mechanism by which the G50E mutation promotes vesicle fusion remains to be resolved. Nonetheless, the T254I and G50E mutations offer two alternative structural changes to promote SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion. It is evident that much is still to be discovered about SNARE structure and function. The results presented here reveal a novel intrinsic mechanism by which SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion is regulated. These findings not only advance the understanding of synaptic transmission, but also have broad implications on vesicle fusion at different cellular pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly strains.</title><p>The <italic>syx<sup>3&#x02013;69</sup></italic> mutant fly &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; was obtained from the laboratories of Drs.

The effect of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> chelation was monitored at the end of the mini recording.

Basal release was monitored at 0.2 Hz prior to a 5-min repetitive stimulation at 10 Hz. Usually, the recovery from the 10-Hz stimulation was also monitored by 0.2-Hz stimulation immediately afterwards. The basal amplitude of EPSPs was averaged from at least three consecutive EPSPs and used to normalize the average EPSP amplitude during the 10-Hz stimulation. At the onset of repetitive stimulation, three consecutive EPSPs were used to give the average amplitude at time 0, at 30 sec, and at every minute during the remaining the 10-Hz stimulation periods.

(1) Synaptobrevin forms a partial <italic>trans</italic> SNARE complex with syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25. (2) By zippering in an N- to C-termini direction, the SNARE proteins form a <italic>trans</italic> complex and bring the synaptic vesicle close to the plasma membrane. SNARE-mediated synaptic vesicle exocytosis occurs either spontaneously (3) or evoked by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (4). (5) <italic>cis</italic> SNARE complexes are thought to be disassembled by NSF ATPase prior to vesicle recycling. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PM, plasma membrane; SV, synaptic vesicle.</p><p>(B) Alignment of amino acids (aa) around position T254 in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> syntaxin 1A or equivalent residues in syntaxin orthologs from a variety of animals, yeast, and the plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The top panel shows a cartoon of syntaxin 1A and the region of the alignment. Syntaxins are organized as &#x0201c;plasma membrane&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;intracellular compartments&#x0201d; according to their cellular distributions. With the exception of syntaxin 4, most plasma membrane syntaxins are known to function in presynaptic terminals or neurosecretory cells for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-regulated exocytosis. Note that T254 is highly conserved among &#x0201c;presynaptic&#x0201d; syntaxin 1A, 2, and 3A molecules. We call all other syntaxin orthologs shown here &#x0201c;constitutive&#x0201d; syntaxins because they are used for constitutive secretion on the plasma membrane (PM) and intracellular compartments, such as the endosome and the lysosome, the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> Golgi network (Golgi network), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050072-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. The yeast plasma membrane syntaxin orthologs SSO1 and SSO2, and syntaxins 4 and 131 from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are also shown here. (A more complete alignment can be see in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050072-sg001">Figure S1</xref>.) Unlike the synaptic syntaxins, syntaxin 4 and most syntaxin 11s have a valine (V) at the 254 equivalent position, syntaxins 6, 7, 12, 16, and 17 a leucine (L), and syntaxin 5 an isoleucine (I).
