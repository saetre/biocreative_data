During development, reelin is crucial for the correct cytoarchitecture of laminated brain structures and is produced by a subset of neurons named Cajal-Retzius. After birth, most of these cells degenerate and reelin expression persists in postnatal and adult brain. The phenotype of neurons that bind secreted reelin and whether the continuous secretion of reelin is required for physiological functions at postnatal stages remain unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Combining immunocytochemical and pharmacological approaches, we first report that two distinct patterns of reelin expression are present in cultured hippocampal neurons. We show that in hippocampal cultures, reelin is secreted by GABAergic neurons displaying an intense reelin immunoreactivity (IR). We demonstrate that secreted reelin binds to receptors of the lipoprotein family on neurons with a punctate reelin IR. Secondly, using calcium imaging techniques, we examined the physiological consequences of reelin secretion blockade. Blocking protein secretion rapidly and reversibly changes the subunit composition of N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDARs) to a predominance of NR2B-containing NMDARs. Addition of recombinant or endogenously secreted reelin rescues the effects of protein secretion blockade and reverts the fraction of NR2B-containing NMDARs to control levels. Therefore, the continuous secretion of reelin is necessary to control the subunit composition of NMDARs in hippocampal neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our data show that the heterogeneity of reelin immunoreactivity correlates with distinct functional populations: neurons synthesizing and secreting reelin and/or neurons binding reelin. Furthermore, we show that continuous reelin secretion is a strict requirement to maintain the composition of NMDARs. We propose that reelin is a trans-neuronal messenger secreted by GABAergic neurons that regulates NMDARs homeostasis in postnatal hippocampus. Defects in reelin secretion could play a major role in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly those associated with deregulation of NMDARs such as schizophrenia.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reelin is a large secreted protein of the extracellular matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-DArcangelo1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> and a signaling molecule whose best characterized pathway involves two lipoprotein receptors, apolipoprotein E receptors 2 (ApoER2) and very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-DArcangelo2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-Herz1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

BFA dramatically altered the distribution of reelin staining intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005505-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) but not the density of reelin immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005505.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) and specifically abolished the detection of punctate reelin IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005505-g002">Figure 2A, C</xref>). The time course of action of BFA shows that the fraction of punctate reelin IR neurons after 9 and 16 hours of BFA treatment was decreased to 4.5&#x000b1;2.1&#x00025; and 4.3&#x000b1;0.5&#x00025; (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5 and 6), values significantly different from 18.0&#x000b1;1.4&#x00025; before treatment (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8; F<sub>(2,16)</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;33.05, P&#x0003c;0.001). The BFA-dependent blockade was fully reversible following drug washout: the fraction of neurons with punctate reelin IR following BFA recovery was not different from the value obtained prior treatment (21.5&#x000b1;1.4&#x00025;, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6 versus 18.0&#x000b1;1.4&#x00025;, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005505-g002">Figure 2B, C</xref>). The vehicle had no effect on either population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005505.s001">Figure S1B</xref>).

Double labeling of reelin with GAD67 or GAD65, two different isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase, showed that virtually all intense reelin IR were GAD67- or GAD65-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005505-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005505-t001">Table 1</xref>). To determine whether intense reelin IR could be present in excitatory neurons, we performed double immunostaining of reelin with the vesicular glutamate transporters, VGlut1 or VGlut2. The immunoreactivity for VGlut1 and VGlut2 was predominantly distributed along neurites. Therefore, in most cases determining whether VGlut1- or VGlut2-positive neurites belong to intense reelin IR somata was very ambiguous. However, the few intense reelin IR somata from which neurites could be tracked with sufficient confidence (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12) were mostly VGlut negative (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9). A small population (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3) displayed a faint VGlut staining that was just above background threshold. To further prove that neurons secreting reelin are exclusively GABAergic, dual labeling of reelin with GAD67 or GAD65 was performed in conditions in which only intense reelin IR neurons are present. To obtain a homogeneous population of intense reelin IR neurons, we treated cultures with BFA.

These data demonstrate that soluble reelin is necessary and sufficient to rescue the effects of secretion blockade and to regulate NMDARs homeostasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study provides new insights into the interactions between extracellular matrix proteins and glutamate receptors. First, we demonstrate that two distinct neuronal populations of expressing reelin IR coexist in the hippocampus in vitro to serve different functions. A subpopulation of purely GABAergic neurons synthesize and secrete reelin which in turn binds the lipoprotein receptors of another neuronal subpopulation. Second, we discovered that continuous reelin secretion is a strict requirement to maintain the composition of NMDARs.</p><p>The two types of somatic reelin IR we described here have been reported in different brain areas of adult primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-MartinezCerdeno1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether they also correlate with distinct physiological functions in the primate brain is unknown. During embryonic development, reelin is secreted by Cajal-Retzius neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-DArcangelo1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-Ogawa1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent evidences indicate that Cajal-Retzius neurons are glutamatergic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-Hevner1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-Ina1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Together with our results, these data suggest that the multiple and different functions of reelin during development and adulthood are linked to diverse reelin producing cell types. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether GABAergic neurons also produce reelin in other postnatal structures.</p><p>We used different approaches to deplete the availability of reelin. We either blocked the secretion with BFA or the protein synthesis with cycloheximide. BFA treatment selectively abolished the fraction of punctate reelin IR whereas cycloheximide selectively decreased the intense reelin IR population. These data show that the intense reelin IR pattern is associated with synthesis and secreting functions. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that intense reelin IR neurons were not detected in non-permeabilized conditions suggesting that intense reelin IR is intracellular (not shown). One might expect treatment with cycloheximide to diminish the punctate reelin IR population by limiting the pool of synthesized reelin available for binding. Several explanations can account for the lack of effect within the time scale of the experiment; the turnover rate of unbound reelin could be very slow or alternatively, the pool of secretable reelin may not be sufficiently depleted and and thus still be readily releasable even after synthesis have been blocked for a long period of time. Finally, our observation is compatible with reelin recycling in punctate reelin IR neurons since it is known that after binding to lipoprotein receptors, reelin undergoes endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-DArcangelo2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-Jossin1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. BFA can inhibit recycling whereas cycloheximide should not affect this mechanism, consistent with our observation that BFA but not cycloheximide decreased the fraction of punctate reelin IR neurons.</p><p>The present data and our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-Sinagra1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, show that ApoER2 is expressed in most hippocampal neurons and that VLDLR-positive neurons represent a much smaller population (25&#x00025;). As a consequence, a large fraction of hippocampal neurons would be expected to display a punctate IR pattern. In contrast, at the plateau of reelin expression, the neuronal population associated to receptor-bound reelin represented a small percentage of hippocampal neurons (22&#x00025;). This could be due to the presence of neurons that do not reach the detection threshold for immunocytochemistry or that levels of unbound reelin in the culture medium is not high enough to bind all receptors. Strickingly, the fractions of punctate reelin IR neurons and VLDLR-positive neurons are very similar, and reelin could preferentially bind to neurons expressing VLDLR or both VLDLR and ApoER2. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that all punctate reelin IR neurons express VLDLR.</p><p>Several studies have shown that, in the postnatal and adult brain, reelin modulates neuronal plasticity, including long-term potentiation, dendritic branching, maturation and surface diffusion of NMDARs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-Groc1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-Beffert1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-Sinagra1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, whether the continuous secretion of reelin is required for its physiological function at postnatal stages was never addressed. So far, BFA is the only inhibitor known to block reelin secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-Lacor1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, thus we treated hippocampal cultures with BFA to assay the physiological consequences of the lack of reelin secretion. Blockade of the secretory pathway perturbed the homeostasis of NMDARs and changed the NR2B-/NR2A-NMDARs ratio. BFA could either block the basal insertion of NR2A-NMDARs or increase the number of functional NR2B-NMDARs, therefore enhancing in both cases the fraction of ifenprodil sensitive-NMDARs. Noteworthy, this effect was reversed following the addition of endogenous or recombinant reelin showing that the continuous secretion of reelin is necessary to maintain the subunit composition of NMDA receptors.</p><p>Several molecular mechanisms could account for the effects of reelin secretion. First, the activation of the reelin signaling pathway could result in the phosphorylation of NMDARs thus upregulating NR2B-dependent responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-Qiu1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The fact that a long incubation period with endogenous or recombinant reelin is needed to rescue secretion blockade does not favor this hypothesis. Second, we have previously shown that reelin controls the surface mobility of both synaptic and extrasynaptic NR2B-containing NMDARs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-Groc1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. We reported that the lack of reelin, selectively affected the surface mobility of NR2B- versus NR2A-containing NMDARs. Reelin depletion significantly decreased the surface mobility of extrasynaptic NR2B-containing NMDARs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-Groc1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The effect of increasing the availability of NR2B-containing NMDARs could in turn contribute to the enhancement the fraction of functional NR2B-containing receptors. Finally, the fact that reelin is a protein of the extracellular matrix suggests that its site of action may be located in perineuronal nets. Blockade of the secretory pathway perturbed the homeostasis of NMDARs and selectively abolished one type of reelin IR. These data not only suggest that diffusion of reelin is crucial for its physiological action, but also favor the hypothesis that reelin diffuses broadly into the interstitial space to act as a trans-neuronal messenger. This does not rule out a possible autocrine function for reelin through cell surface diffusion and/or vesicular transport.</p><p>Based on our data, we propose that defects in reelin secretion could play a major role in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. Particularly those associated with deregulation of NMDARs homeostasis and lower expression levels of reelin, such as schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-Guidotti1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005505-Mohn1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Hippocampal cultures</title><p>Hippocampi were dissected from postnatal day 0 Swiss mice brains.
