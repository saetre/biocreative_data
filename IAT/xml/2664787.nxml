The initial step of atherosclerosis is inflammatory cell invasion into the intima upon the onset of inflammation. This process is predominantly mediated by the interaction of complementary cellular adhesion molecules on the endothelium and the inflammatory cells. The endothelial adhesion molecules, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin, are expressed on the vascular endothelium when the endothelial cells (ECs) undergo inflammatory activation in response to cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. E-selectin is involved in the rolling and tethering of leukocytes on the vascular wall, whereas VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 induce firm adhesion of inflammatory cells at the vascular surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Several lines of evidence support a crucial role of endothelial adhesion molecules in the development of atherosclerosis and plaque instability. Expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and E-selectin has been observed in ECs of human atherosclerotic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Moreover, mice genetically deficient in any of these endothelial adhesion molecules have reduced atherosclerotic lesion formation in atherosclerosis-prone ApoE-/- or LDLR-/- mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO), an important vasoprotective factor, is produced from the substrate L-arginine by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition to the functions in regulation of vascular tone and inhibition of platelet aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], NO has also been shown to inhibit leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which might be partially attributable to the inhibition of endothelial VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Recent research work provides accumulating evidence for the involvement of arginase in decreased endothelial NO production through competition with eNOS for the substrate L-arginine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. There is increasing number of studies showing that enhanced arginase gene expression and/or activity contribute to endothelial dysfunction in various cardiovascular disorders including atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Most recently, it was reported that in vivo pharmacological treatment of ApoE-/- mice with arginase inhibitors improves endothelium-dependent relaxations and reduces atherosclerotic plaque lesion formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], implicating the potential role of endothelial arginase in pathogenesis of vascular diseases. It has however, not been confirmed whether the beneficial effects of arginase inhibitors are indeed attributable to the inhibition of arginase, in another word, whether the endothelial arginase is indeed involved in inflammatory responses. In the present study, we elucidated the pharmacological effects of arginase inhibitors on endothelial inflammations and the role of arginase in endothelial inflammation was then clarified by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based specific knocking down of the enzyme in the cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Reagents were purchased from the following sources: recombinant human TNF&#x003b1; was purchased from Brunschwig (Basel, Switzerland); S-12-bromoethyl-L-cystine-HCl (BEC) was from Calbiochem; L-norvaline and anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody were from Sigma (Buchs, Switzerland).

Although inhibition of NOS activity in the endothelial cells with L-NAME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] could significantly augment TNF&#x003b1;-induced expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, it was unable to reverse the anti-inflammatory effects of L-norvaline. The results implicate that basal level of NO exerts a weak but significant anti-inflammatory effects, which is consistent with the previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The results with L-NAME suggest that L-norvaline inhibits endothelial inflammation via a mechanism(s) independently of NO production and/or arginase. To further confirm the role of arginase-II, the prominent isoform expressed in HUVECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] in the inflammatory responses, another arginase inhibitor BEC and adenoviral mediated siRNA silencing of arginase-II were employed. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of arginase activity with BEC at the concentration (200 &#x003bc;mol/L) exerts similar inhibition of arginase activity (51.9 &#x000b1; 7.0% inhibition) as 20 mmol/L L-norvaline (52.4 &#x000b1; 3.9% inhibition); however, it did not show any effects on TNF&#x003b1;-induced expression of the adhesion molecules. Moreover, efficient knocking down of arginase-II with two different targeting sequences (shRNA-ARGIIa and -ARGIIc) did not affect endothelial expression of the inflammatory molecules stimulated by TNF&#x003b1; either. Both pharmacological and specific siRNA silencing approaches therefore reinforce our conclusion that L-norvaline exerts anti-inflammatory effects in endothelial cells independently of arginase and NOS activity.</p><p>Another important finding of this report is the role of S6K1 in up-regulation of E-selectin by TNF&#x003b1;. In an effort to analyse the possible underlying mechanisms of L-norvaline-mediated inhibition of endothelial inflammatory responses, we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory effects of L-norvaline are attributable to its ability to interfere with signaling pathway(s) that could regulate the expression of adhesion molecules. Various signalling pathways such as NF-&#x003ba;B, JNK, p38mapk have been shown to be involved in the up-regulation of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These mechanisms were however, not affected by L-norvaline, demonstrating that the compound inhibits endothelial inflammation independently of the signalling mechanisms. Interestingly, we found that TNF&#x003b1;-induced S6K1 activation was strongly inhibited by L-norvaline, indicating that the compound may inhibit endothelial inflammation via inhibition of S6K1. To confirm this hypothesis, we took the siRNA approach to knock-down the expression and activity of S6K1. Remarkably, silencing experiments revealed that suppressing S6K1 expression and the enzymatic activity inhibited the expression of E-selectin, but not that of VCAM-1 or ICAM-1 in response to TNF&#x003b1;. The results demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory properties of L-norvaline are partially attributable to its ability to inhibit S6K1. This is the first study showing that S6K1 plays an important role in the expression of endothelial inflammatory molecule E-selectin. The mechanisms that are involved in L-norvaline-mediated inhibition of endothelial VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression remain to be investigated in the future study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our results demonstrate that the arginase inhibitor L-norvaline exhibits anti-inflammatory properties independently of its effect on inhibition of arginase activity and increased NO production. The anti-inflammatory effects are partially attributable to its ability to inhibit S6K1. This effect of L-norvaline has to be taken into account, when the drug is used to study functions of arginase or NO production in biological systems. The results of our study also implicate that L-norvaline or its derivatives may be useful drugs to treat inflammatory responses in cardiovascular system and to prevent cardiovascular diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ARG II: arginase II; BEC: S-12-bromoethyl-L-cystine-HCl; ECs: endothelial cells; ECGS: endothelial cell growth supplement; eNOS: endothelial nitric oxide synthase; HUVEC: human umbilical vein endothelial cells; ICAM-1: intercellular adhesion molecule-1; JNK: c-jun N-terminal kinase; NO: nitric oxide; o/n: overnight; p.t.: post transduction; rAd: recombinant adenovirus; SEM: standard error of mean; shRNA: short hairpin RNA; siRNA: small interfering RNA; TNF&#x003b1;: tumor necrosis factor alpha; VCAM-1: vascular cell adhesion molecule-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>XFM conceived the study, performed Western blot analysis, constructed rAd/U6-shRNAs and drafted the manuscript.
