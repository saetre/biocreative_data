Its widely used model is experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an organ-specific autoimmune inflammatory disease induced in susceptible animals, shows significant similarities to MS in both clinical and pathological aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Both diseases are assumed to be mediated by myelin-specific CD4<sup>+ </sup>T lymphocytes, and more specifically by Th1 and Th17 cells. Although the relative contribution of each Th subset has not been clearly defined, there are reports of an encephalitogenic potential of both Th1 and Th17 cells and their signature cytokines, IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Glucocorticoids (GC) are used to treat a wide range of inflammatory, allergic and autoimmune diseases, and they have been shown effective in the treatment of acute relapses in MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], as well as of EAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Multiple mechanisms are proposed to explain glucocorticoid therapeutic efficacy in autoimmune damage to the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], since GC down-regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. Namely, GC have been shown to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and lymphocyte expression and production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators (e.g. IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;), while enhancing the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-10, TGF-&#x003b2;), T-cell apoptosis and redistribution, a shift in the population of Th cells from Th1 to Th2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and the proportion of regulatory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We have recently demonstrated that methylprednisolone (MP), a synthetic glucocorticoid, inhibits the <italic>in vitro </italic>expression and production of IL-17 in myelin basic protein (MBP)-stimulated draining lymph node cells (DLNC) and cells infiltrating CNS of EAE rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Although abundant data about diverse glucocorticoid effects have been accumulated, the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of glucocorticoids and the major site of their action relevant to therapeutic efficiency in T cell-mediated CNS autoimmune diseases, such as MS and EAE, are not fully understood. Recent evidence from EAE induced in C57BL/6 mice suggests that the major targets of GC action are peripheral rather than CNS-residing T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. On the contrary, plentiful data convincingly demonstrate that GC directly influences cells within the target tissue [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]]. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effect of the synthetic glucocorticoid methylprednisolone (MP), on the expression and production of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 by T lymphocytes infiltrating CNS tissue in a rat model of EAE. We found that MP applied <italic>in vivo </italic>inhibited IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 generation by the cells infiltrating the CNS. This inhibition correlated with a reduction of clinical signs of EAE in MP-treated animals, thus suggesting that the inhibition of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 within the CNS contributes to the beneficial effects of glucocorticoids in neuroinflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental animals and EAE induction</title><p>Inbred Dark Agouti (DA) rats were obtained from the animal breeding facility of the Institute for Biological Research "Sini&#x00161;a Stankovi&#x00107;" (Belgrade).

(B, C) CLNC from healthy animals were stimulated with ConA (1 &#x003bc;g/ml) in the presence or absence of MP (10 ng/ml) and/or RU486 (5 ng/ml) for 24 hours. Cell-free supernatants of the cultures were analyzed with ELISA for IFN-&#x003b3; (B) and IL-17 (C) concentrations. (D) SCC were isolated from DA rats immunized with SCH-CFA and injected with PBS, or with MP, or with MP+RU486, as described in Methods. Cell-free supernatants of cultures of SCC grown in medium for 72 hours were analyzed with ELISA for IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 concentrations. *p &#x0003c; 0.05 represents a statistically significant difference between the MP and PBS treatment groups, and 'p &#x0003c; 0.05 represents a statistically significant difference between the MP and MP+RU486 treatment groups.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-2094-6-37-4"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates that MP given <italic>in vivo </italic>to DA rats with first signs of EAE, by a regimen that leads to significant amelioration of the disease, inhibits the expression and production of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 by CNS-infiltrating cells, thus suggesting that the beneficial effect of MP in EAE is partly mediated through restraining immune responses within the CNS. Limitation of production of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 in the CNS is of importance for the beneficial effects of MP, as abundant data confirm the pathogenic role for IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 in autoimmune diseases, although their contribution to the disease process probably depend on the epitope-specificity of encephalitogenic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], localization of the disease process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and conditions present during initial exposure to antigen, including the quality/quantity of Toll-like receptor stimulation and type of antigen-presenting cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the EAE model in DA rats used in this study, it appears that both Th1 and Th17 cells with their marker cytokines play a role in the disease process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The effects of glucocorticoids on immune cells can be mediated through glucocorticoid receptor-dependent and independent actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In fact, glucocorticoids bring about the majority of their effects upon interaction with a cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) which, subsequent to ligand binding, dissociates from chaperone proteins, forms dimers, and translocates into the nucleus where it modulates gene expression either by direct binding to its cognate response elements or via interaction with other transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Recently, a new concept of non-genomic actions of glucocorticoids emerged which assumes that activated glucocorticoid receptor may produce effects without an action on gene transcription [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]]. Moreover, some effects of glucocorticoids may also be exerted without involvement of a GR; they are mediated by membrane-bound GRs, or as a result of direct, nonspecific interactions with cell membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of RU486, an antagonist of glucocorticoid receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], in our experimental system and showed that this drug counteracted MP in its effect on EAE course, as well as in its <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>effects on IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 generation. These results exclude the possibility that the effect of MP might result from its binding to membrane receptors or subcellular structures other than the glucocorticoid receptor. Moreover, since RU486 prevents the translocation of the glucocrticoid-GR complex to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], these results confirm that the observed inhibition of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 represents a genomic effect of MP.</p><p>In this study MP treatment commencing with the first clinical signs of actively induced EAE was applied to mimic application of the drug in acute relapses of MS in humans. In accordance with previously published results showing beneficial effects of GC treatment on EAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], MP treatment led to a significant amelioration of clinical signs of EAE in DA rats. The inhibitory effect of MP in this model of EAE was maintained throughout the follow-up evaluation period, 8 days after methylprednisolone withdrawal, with no relapse of disease. This observation is in agreement with a previously published report in which the authors applied a similar concentration of dexamethasone by the same application regime in active EAE in C57BL/6 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, if glucocorticoids are applied in lower concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], or they are applied <italic>per os </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] or they are applied for a longer time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and then withdrawn, worsening of clinical features, reappearance of the CNS inflammatory infiltrate and lymphocyte reactivity to the encephalitogen are reported. Thus, it seems that the mode of glucocorticoid application is of utmost importance for their effect on EAE.</p><p>Multiple mechanisms have been postulated to be responsible for the beneficial effect of glucocorticoids on CNS autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], while peripheral T lymphocytes have been considered as the main therapeutic target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, an extensive literature demonstrates that glucocorticoids are effective in reducing CNS inflammation by direct action on cells within the CNS [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]]. Here, we show that the number of cells isolated from the spinal cord of MP-treated animals was significantly lower than the number of cells isolated from control rats in EAE. This could be a consequence of the inhibition of encephalitogenic cell infiltration into the CNS that has been previously reported following treatment of EAE with glucocorticoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The limitation of the infiltration might be explained by increased apoptosis and weaker activation of encephalitogenic cells in lymphoid organs, by decrease in expression of adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier (BBB), as well as by increased integrity of BBB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. On the other hand, fewer infiltrating cells within the CNS of MP-treated rats might also be a consequence of increased rate of apoptosis of these cells in the CNS, as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, we could not detect increased cell death rate under the influence of MP in EAE rats, which is in accordance with a recent investigation performed in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We have to emphasize that there is a possibility that a number of apoptotic cells was lost in the procedure of cell isolation, and that in vivo numbers of apoptotic cells in MP-treated animals might be higher within the CNS. However, this would still mean that among cells isolated from the CNS there is no difference in apoptosis regardless of the treatment with MP. The absence of increased apoptosis within the CNS of MP-treated rats might be explained by the dual death-related influence of glucocorticoids on T cells, as glucocorticoids induce apoptotic death of T cells but also protect them against CD95-mediated apoptosis, including activation-induced cell death, probably due to suppression of FasL expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and/or an increase in Bcl-2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Still, the number of immune cells was down-regulated across various peripheral lymphoid tissues and blood under the influence of MP, and it seems reasonable to assume that apoptosis of these cells is at least partly responsible for the effect of MP. Apoptosis in the periphery could also be one of the major reasons for the decreased number of cells infiltrating the CNS.</p><p>In addition to the limitation of immune cells infiltration in the CNS, the restriction of pro-inflammatory potential of infiltrated cells could also be of importance for the beneficial effects of MP in EAE. Indeed, if equivalent numbers of spinal cord-infiltrating cells from MP-treated and control rats are compared, a significant difference in IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 expression and production is observed. Thus, besides diminishing the number of infiltrating cells within the CNS, MP also restrains their pro-inflammatory i.e. autoimmune potential. As the major producers of these cytokines in the CNS of EAE rats are CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells, the downregulation of cytokine production and expression in SCC might be a consequence of a reduced CD4<sup>+ </sup>cell proportion among CNS-infiltrating cells. However, again in agreement with the findings of W&#x000fc;st and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], we do not find a difference in the percentage of CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells among CNS-infiltrating cells. Moreover, there is no difference in the proportion of naive and activated cells within the population of CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells, thus excluding the possibility that MP affects IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 production through specific reduction of activated CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells among CNS infiltrating cells.</p><p>While a large body of evidence shows that glucocorticoids inhibit Th1 and IFN-&#x003b3; in EAE [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]], the influence of glucocorticoids on Th17 and their signature cytokine IL-17 has not been investigated in detail so far. We have recently shown that MP inhibits IL-17 <italic>in vitro</italic>, but to a lesser extent than it influences IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and to that we add the similar observation from this study about IL-17 inhibition in the CNS of MP-treated rats. The eventual importance of other cytokines, or other regions which could also be affected, is not excluded.</p><p>Interestingly, when SCC were stimulated with PMA+ionomycin and intracellular detection of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 was performed, the proportion of IFN-&#x003b3;-producing, but not of IL-17-producing cells, was reduced in cells isolated from MP-treated rats in comparison to control rats. The proportion of these cells that are capable of expressing both cytokines, and that have recently been described in DA rat EAE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], was also not affected by MP treatment, thus suggesting that these cells are more similar to Th17 than to Th1, at least regarding sensitivity to glucocorticoid regulation. This implies that although MP applied <italic>in vivo </italic>restrains generation capacity of both cytokines within the CNS, SCC released from the CNS environment and stimulated with strong unspecific stimulus regain the potential to produce IL-17, but not IFN-&#x003b3;. Importantly, the same observation was valid for SCC in general and for CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells i.e. Th1 and Th17 cells. Thus, it seems that after PMA+ionomycin treatment, spinal cord-derived T cells display an apparent shift from Th1 to Th17 cells Although we do not yet have an explanation for these findings, it is tempting to speculate that the influence of MP on Th1 might be direct, while the drug might affect Th17 cells and their cytokines through its effect on CNS resident cells, which have previously been shown to modulate IL-17 production at least <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Alternatively, there might be a difference in the duration of the inhibitory effect of MP on Th1 and Th17 cells, and stimulation with PMA and ionomycin takes 4 hours, which is enough time to express cytokines in lymphocytes. Also, there is a possibility that PMA+ionomycin, as a strong artificial treatment, may skew the result through stimulation of both encephalitogenic and bystander cells. It remains for future investigations to determine the mechanism underlying the observed difference between <italic>ex vivo </italic>and post-activation IL-17 expression in SCC from MP-treated animals. It would also be important to find out if this property of Th17 cells might be of relevance for the pathology of CNS neuroinflammation, especially regarding contribution of endogenous glucocorticoids to pathology resolution.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data reveal a significant influence of MP on the expression and production of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-17 within the CNS in EAE.
