Further, a dominant negative Hsc70 mutant that cannot hydrolyze ATP, interfered with RNAP II degradation during HSV-1 infection, and an increase in ubiquitinated forms of RNAP II was observed.

In addition to protein folding, it has also been demonstrated that Hsc70 and an interacting co-chaperone U-box protein termed CHIP (C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein), target aberrant forms of CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) protein for proteasomal degradation by promoting their ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-Meacham1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Burch and Weller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-Burch1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> reported that in herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infected cells, Hsc70 was sequestered in nuclear foci that also contained components of the 26S proteasome and ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. In subsequent studies, these authors also found that Hsp90 and Hsp40 were redistributed to these sites, which they termed VICE-domains, for virus-induced-chaperone-enriched <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-Burch2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The formation of these domains or foci at the periphery of viral replication compartments suggests that they may function to rid virus-infected nuclei of misfolded and ubiquitinated proteins via the proteasome, perhaps to prevent premature apoptosis, which would adversely affect viral replication.</p><p>We recently reported that during HSV-1 infection when viral transcription is robust, cellular RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), and specifically the serine-2 phosphorylated form of the C-terminal domain (CTD) found in elongating transcription complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-Ahn1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-Dahmus1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-DaiJu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. We speculated that this may occur because HSV-1 encodes transcripts from both genomic strands, and it encodes multiple sets of transcripts that initiate at the same promoter but have different polyadenylation sites or which initiate at different promoters but share a single polyadenylation site. At times of active transcription of all kinetic classes after DNA replication ensues, it is quite possible that elongating RNAP II complexes may collide if both strands are being transcribed at the same time, or may pile up on each other if 3&#x02032; processing lags behind elongation. It has been shown in yeast and mammalian cells that stalled RNAP II complexes become ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome to allow 3&#x02032; processing factors to access the RNA or to allow trailing transcription complexes to proceed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-Conaway1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-Gillette1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, viral replication compartment formation was greatly impaired, viral transcription was severely reduced, and proteasomal degradation of RNAP II was significantly diminished in infections with these ICP27 mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-DaiJu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Based upon the reported composition of the Hsc70 nuclear foci or VICE domains, we asked whether the formation of these discrete nuclear structures at the periphery of viral replication compartments was related to active viral transcription and RNAP II degradation. Here, we show ICP27 also interacts with Hsc70 and that Hsc70 nuclear focus formation required ICP27 expression. During infection with ICP27 mutants that cannot interact with RNAP II, viral transcription-replication compartments were poorly formed and Hsc70 focus formation was substantially delayed. Expression of a dominant negative Hsc70 mutant reduced RNAP II degradation, and this had adverse effects on viral replication. The results presented here lead us to postulate that Hsc70 foci serve an important role during viral infection, which includes, but is likely not limited to, aiding in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of stalled RNAP II complexes on viral genomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ICP27 Is Required for the Formation of Hsc70 Nuclear Foci</title><p>To determine if ICP27 played any role in the formation of Hsc70 nuclear foci, as has been shown for the HSV-1 immediate early protein ICP0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-Burch1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, we analyzed the distribution of Hsc70 in wild type HSV-1-infected cells compared to cells infected with 27-LacZ, an ICP27 null mutant virus. In wild type HSV-1 infected cells at 6 h after infection, staining of Hsc70 was seen to concentrate in distinct nuclear foci, which occurred at the periphery of viral transcription-replication compartments. These compartments were marked by staining with antibody to the HSV-1 transcriptional activator ICP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001491-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

In cells infected with WT HSV-1, Hsc70 focus formation was clearly seen by 6 h after infection, a time when ICP27 is still strongly nuclear, but it has begun to shuttle to the cytoplasm in its role as a viral RNA export factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001491-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The shuttling of ICP27 can be seen more clearly at 8 h after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001491-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, in dLeu-infected cells, Hsc70 foci were not observed even by 8 h after infection; while in n406-infected cells, small Hsc70 foci were seen but not until 8 h after infection, when larger foci are apparent in WT-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001491-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Because viral replication is both curtailed and delayed in n406 infected cells, the smaller foci seen at 8 h in n406 infections, probably reflect the timing of the beginning of DNA replication.

The phospho-serine 2 form of the CTD, found in the elongating complex, is most severely affected. Further, prevention of RNAP II degradation by proteasome inhibitors resulted in decreased levels of viral late proteins and reduced viral yields <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-DaiJu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The degradation of RNAP II occurred earlier in infection and was more profound in wild type HSV-1 infected cells compared to infections with viral mutants that either did not express ICP27 or in which the mutant ICP27 was unable to interact with and recruit RNAP II to viral replication sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-DaiJu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. These mutants accumulate low levels of viral transcripts and have greatly reduced DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-DaiJu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001491-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These results led us to postulate that when HSV-1 genomes are undergoing robust transcription and DNA replication, elongating RNAP II complexes may collide, especially in regions of the genome where transcripts are being transcribed on both strands; in regions where several transcripts share the same polyadenylation sites, and in regions where the 3&#x02032; end of a gene is juxtaposed or even overlaps the promoter region of another gene. Resolution of these stalled complexes by proteasomal degradation may be necessary to allow 3&#x02032; processing factors to access the transcript or to clear the road for transcription complexes approaching the stalled complexes.</p><p>ICP27 is a multifunctional protein that interacts with a multitude of proteins, and which functions at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Its stimulation of viral transcription appears to stem from its recruitment of RNAP II to viral replication sites. Thus, ICP27 acts indirectly in transcription, that is, it recruits RNAP II. ICP27 was also found to interact with Hsc70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001491-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001491-g003">3</xref>), and to be required for its redistribution to nuclear foci or VICE domains. We postulate that these foci either serve as sites where misfolded or ubiquitinated proteins are targeted and are consequently degraded, or more likely, that these foci serve as reservoirs or storage sites for the proteasomal degradation machinery, much like splicing speckles are thought to serve as storage sites for mRNA processing factors. The localization of the foci at the periphery of viral transcription-replication compartments would provide an efficient access to stalled transcription complexes, which would then be ubiquitinated and degraded. Hsc70 may even promote ubiquitination of RNAP II for degradation by the proteasome because the dominant negative mutant partly blocked this occurrence.</p><p>A model to explain the role of ICP27 in this process is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001491-g011">Figure 11</xref>. ICP27 interacts with the CTD of RNAP II early in infection and recruits RNAP II to sites of viral DNA, which develop into replication compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-deBruynKops1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-Lukonis1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. The HSV-1 genome encodes transcripts on both strands, as well overlapping transcripts that share 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; ends. Thus, during robust viral transcription, it is conceivable that elongating RNAP II complexes may collide and thus stall as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001491-g011">Figure 11</xref>. Additionally, elongating RNAP II complexes may pile up in regions where there are several transcripts that share 3&#x02032; ends, and which may be transcribed with different kinetics. Clearance of these roadblocks is required to allow transcription to continue and to allow 3&#x02032; end formation. Components of the nuclear foci or VICE domains, including Hsc70 may then be called into action to ubiquitinate and degrade the stalled complexes. Hsc70 appears to play an important role in HSV-1 replication because when its action was blocked by the dominant negative mutant, viral yields were reduced, just as occurred with the addition of proteasome inhibitors.</p><fig id="pone-0001491-g011" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001491.g011</object-id><label>Figure 11</label><caption><title>Model of RNAP II Degradation during HSV-1 Transcription.</title><p>ICP27 interacts with the CTD of RNAP II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-DaiJu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and recruits RNAP II to a viral replication compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-DaiJu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-Rice4">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, which is represented in magenta. Elongating RNAP II complexes on opposite DNA strands may collide causing one or both complexes to stall. At least one of the stalled complexes may then be ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. The other transcription complex is now free to continue. Hsc70 foci, which form at the same time as replication compartments, and which lie at their periphery, may aid this process by providing a ready source of chaperone proteins as well as other components of the 26S proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-Burch1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001491-Burch2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001491.g011"/></fig><p>These studies have uncovered yet another layer to the complexity of activities that are mediated by ICP27.
