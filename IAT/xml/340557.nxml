The exon-intron organization has been established by electron microscopy using genomic DNA-cDNA or -mRNA hybrid duplexes and by sequencing the exons and exon-intron junctions. The overall organization within and around the pS2 gene is the same in placental and MCF-7 cell DNA and the exonic sequences are identical to those previously determined from the cDNA. The 5'-flanking region of the pS2 gene is also identical (with the exception of two base transitions) in the two tissues. Thus no gene rearrangement nor sequence modification has occurred in the pS2 gene of the malignant and polyploid MCF-7 cells. A TATA-box, a CAAT-box and a GC-rich motif are present in the 5'-flanking region of the pS2 gene, but the latter motif is unusually located between the TATA-box and the capsite. No significant homology could be detected between the 5' flanking sequences of the pS2 gene and those of other oestrogen-responsive genes from different species.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0063-a" xlink:role="1406"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0065-a" xlink:role="1408"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0058.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1401"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0059.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1402"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0060.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1403"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0061.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1404"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0062.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1405"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0063.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1406"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0064.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1407"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0065.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1408"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0066.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1409"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0067.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1410"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0068.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1411"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0069.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1412"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0070.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1413"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00248-0071.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1414"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
