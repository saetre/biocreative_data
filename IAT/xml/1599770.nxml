The aberrant cell-size phenotypes caused by mutations in the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor pathway are consistent with a role in size checkpoint control, but indirect effects on size caused by altered cell cycle kinetics are difficult to rule out. The multiple fission cell cycle of the unicellular alga <named-content content-type="genus-species">Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</named-content> uncouples growth from division, allowing direct assessment of the relationship between size phenotypes and checkpoint function. Mutations in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. reinhardtii</named-content> RB homolog encoded by <italic>MAT3</italic> cause supernumerous cell divisions and small cells, suggesting a role for MAT3 in size control. We identified suppressors of an <italic>mat3</italic> null allele that had recessive mutations in <italic>DP1</italic> or dominant mutations in <italic>E2F1,</italic> loci encoding homologs of a heterodimeric transcription factor that is targeted by RB-related proteins. Significantly, we determined that the <italic>dp1</italic> and <italic>e2f1</italic> phenotypes were caused by defects in size checkpoint control and were not due to a lengthened cell cycle. Despite their cell division defects, <italic>mat3, dp1,</italic> and <italic>e2f1</italic> mutants showed almost no changes in periodic transcription of genes induced during S phase and mitosis, many of which are conserved targets of the RB pathway. Conversely, we found that regulation of cell size was unaffected when S phase and mitotic transcription were inhibited. Our data provide direct evidence that the RB pathway mediates cell size checkpoint control and suggest that such control is not directly coupled to the magnitude of periodic cell cycle transcription.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>All cell types have a characteristic size, but the means by which cell size is determined remain mysterious. In proliferating cells, control mechanisms termed checkpoints are thought to prevent cells from dividing until they have reached a minimum size, but the nature of size checkpoints has proved difficult to dissect. The unicellular alga <named-content content-type="genus-species">Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</named-content> divides via an unusual mechanism that uncouples growth from division, and thereby allows a direct assessment of how different genetic pathways contribute to size control. The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor pathway is a critical regulator of cell cycle control in plants and animals and is thought to act as a transcriptional switch for cell cycle genes, but it had not been directly implicated in cell size checkpoint function. The authors found that mutations in genes that encode key proteins of the RB pathway in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> affect cell size and cell cycle control by altering size checkpoint function. Unexpectedly, the predicted transcriptional targets of the RB pathway were not affected by the mutations, and blocking transcription did not alter cell size control. These data link the RB tumor suppressor pathway directly to size control and suggest the possibility that cell size and cell cycle control by the RB pathway may not be coupled to its transcriptional output.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Fang SC, de los Reyes C, Umen JG (2006) Cell size checkpoint control by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor pathway.

Mutants or RNAi knockdowns that alter growth rate or cell cycle progression show size phenotypes in such screens, but these phenotypes do not necessarily result from altered checkpoint control.

It is not clear whether these effects are due to altered size checkpoints or are caused by overall changes in cell cycle and/or growth rates that override checkpoint control. Moreover, a direct role for the RB pathway in size control is not precluded by the existence of its well-established role as an integrator of extracellular growth factor signals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</named-content> is a unicellular green alga that contains single copy genes encoding homologs of RB, E2F, and DP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; and provides a simplified model for analysis of the RB pathway.

Post-Commitment cells do not immediately initiate S phase, but instead remain in G1 for an additional 5 to 10 h, where they can continue to grow and then finally undergo a rapid series of (n) alternating S phases and mitoses (S/M)<sub>n</sub> to produce 2<sup>n</sup> daughters. A critical aspect of size regulation occurs during S/M where mother cell size&#x02014;which can vary over a wide range depending on growth conditions&#x02014;controls the number of S/M cycles to produce a uniform size distribution of daughters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;.

Thus, similar to its role in animals and plants, MAT3/RB acts as a negative regulator of cell cycle progression. While it was postulated to be involved in cell size checkpoint control, it was not clear whether MAT3 acted through DP and E2F proteins and, if so, whether E2F and DP controlled rate limiting steps in cell size regulation.</p><p>Here we identified bypass suppressors of an <italic>mat3</italic> null allele that have mutations in the <italic>Chlamydomonas DP1</italic> and <italic>E2F1</italic> genes. We found that <italic>dp1</italic> null mutants had a large-cell phenotype caused by an increased Commitment threshold size and a failure to initiate enough rounds of division during S/M, opposite to the size checkpoint phenotypes of <italic>mat3</italic> mutants. Two classes of dominant <italic>e2f1</italic> suppressors were found that displayed different degrees of severity of cell cycle and cell size phenotypes. Importantly, the suppression of <italic>mat3</italic> by <italic>dp1</italic> and <italic>e2f1</italic> mutations was not due to a lengthened cell cycle but rather to a defect in size checkpoint function. Surprisingly, however, we found no significant transcriptional defects for periodically expressed cell cycle genes in <italic>dp1, e2f1,</italic> or <italic>mat3</italic> mutant strains. Moreover, we found that inhibition of periodic cell cycle transcription had no effect on the number of cell divisions carried out by either wild-type or <italic>dp1</italic> mother cells and no influence on daughter cell size. These data suggest that the RB pathway controls size-dependent cell division in a manner that is not quantitatively linked to transcriptional output during cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation and Characterization of <italic>mat3</italic> Bypass Suppressors</title><p>To investigate the downstream targets of MAT3 that are required for regulation of cell division, we carried out an insertional mutagenesis screen for bypass suppressors of a null allele, <italic>mat3&#x02013;4</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Approximately 20,000 insertion lines were screened, from which 19 suppressors were isolated, including 12 <italic>DP1</italic> alleles and three <italic>E2F1</italic> alleles, all of which showed strong suppression: The <italic>dp1</italic> mutants caused a large-cell phenotype, while the <italic>e2f1</italic> mutants restored cells to approximately wild-type size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020167-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Mutations in the <italic>E2FR1</italic> locus were not recovered in this screen.</p><p>Some of the <italic>DP1</italic> alleles contained deletions that completely removed the locus and some surrounding DNA, while two alleles contained insertions without any other detectable alterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g001">Figures 1</xref>B and S1 and unpublished data). Reference allele <italic>dp1&#x02013;1</italic> contains a 4.7-kb plasmid insertion in the first exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g001">Figures 1</xref>B and S1) that is predicted to block production of a functional protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). <italic>dp1&#x02013;1</italic> behaved indistinguishably from a deletion allele, <italic>dp1&#x02013;3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020167-sg003">Figure S3</xref> and unpublished data), and was used for most of the experiments.</p><p>The three <italic>e2f1</italic> suppressor mutants isolated in this screen all contained insertions in the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>E2F1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g001">Figures 1</xref>D and S1) that would be predicted to allow production of a C-terminally truncated protein that retains DNA binding, dimerization, and Marked Box domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). These three <italic>E2F1</italic> alleles&#x02014;<italic>e2f1&#x02013;1, &#x02013;2,</italic> and <italic>&#x02013;3</italic>&#x02014;behaved identically, and reference allele <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g001">Figure 1</xref>D) was used for most of the experiments. A fourth suppressor allele, <italic>e2f1&#x02013;4</italic>, was isolated fortuitously from a population of transformed <italic>mat3&#x02013;4</italic> cells and contains an internal deletion that removes exon 5 and fuses parts of exons 4 and 6 in-frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The phenotype of <italic>e2f1&#x02013;4</italic> is described in more detail below. Based on their repeated isolation, the screen appears to be saturated for the <italic>DP1</italic> and <italic>E2F1</italic> loci. Possible reasons for the absence of obvious <italic>e2f1</italic> null alleles are presented in the Discussion.</p><p>In principle, any mutation that slows cell cycle progression might increase cell size and suppress <italic>mat3&#x02013;4</italic>. We therefore carried out dark-shift assays to determine whether suppression of <italic>mat3&#x02013;4</italic> by <italic>dp1&#x02013;1</italic> and <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> was due to a slowed cell cycle or due to a fundamental change in the size checkpoint function that couples mother cell size to the proper number of division cycles. Unsynchronized cultures of wild-type, single, and double mutants were grown in continuous light to generate a random distribution of cells and then shifted into the dark for 16 to 18 h. Upon shifting to the dark, growth ceases, and any cell that is past Commitment will enter S/M phase (typically within 5 to 10 h for wild-type) and divide to produce 2<sup>n</sup> daughter cells. Given sufficient time, even &#x0201c;slow&#x0201d; cell cycle mutants will eventually produce daughter cells of the appropriate size &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the suppressed strains always produced daughters whose sizes were larger than wild-type for <italic>dp1&#x02013;1 mat3&#x02013;4</italic> or similar to wild-type for <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1 mat3&#x02013;4</italic>, regardless of how long they were dark shifted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020167-t001">Table 1</xref>, and unpublished data). These results indicated that both <italic>dp1&#x02013;1</italic> and <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> suppressed <italic>mat3&#x02013;4</italic> by altering the size checkpoint function that controls how many S/M cycles are initiated rather than simply slowing cell cycle progression. The cell cycle kinetics for <italic>dp1&#x02013;1</italic> and <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> are described further below.</p><p>We also observed the cell cycle behaviors of <italic>dp1&#x02013;1</italic> and <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> single mutants that were generated by outcrossing each suppressed double mutant to a wild-type strain. We carried out dark-shifting experiments for each single mutant and found that their daughter cell sizes were almost identical to the corresponding double mutant strains with <italic>mat3&#x02013;4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020167-t001">Table 1</xref>). This finding suggested that the <italic>dp1&#x02013;1</italic> and <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> strains were largely insensitive to the presence or absence of MAT3/RB and that the deregulated cell division phenotypes of <italic>mat3&#x02013;4</italic> null strains were dependent on DP1 and E2F1. Based on their epistatic relationships with <italic>mat3&#x02013;4</italic>, the different daughter cell sizes of <italic>dp1&#x02013;1</italic> and <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> mutants seemed somewhat paradoxical, but this difference is likely to be caused by residual cell cycle activation that can occur in <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> strains. This idea is elaborated further in the Discussion.</p><p>We investigated the cell division behavior for each mutant strain more directly by plating unsynchronized light-grown cells on agar, shifting the plates to the dark, and then assaying cell division for individual cells after dark incubation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. While post-Commitment <italic>mat3&#x02013;4</italic> cells almost always divided at least two and sometimes up to five times under these conditions, the suppressed strains had division numbers that were closer to wild-type, with most committed cells dividing either one or two times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g002">2</xref>C). While the <italic>dp1&#x02013;1</italic> cell division numbers appeared similar to wild-type in these experiments, they were abnormally low given the larger size of <italic>dp1&#x02013;1</italic> or <italic>dp1&#x02013;1 mat3&#x02013;4</italic> mother cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and unpublished data). Taken together, our data show that <italic>dp1</italic> and <italic>e2f1</italic> mutations block the ability of <italic>mat3</italic> mutant cells to initiate extra rounds of S phase.</p><p>Commitment is a cell size checkpoint that is also controlled by the RB pathway in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. <italic>mat3</italic> mutants were previously shown to pass Commitment at a smaller size than wild-type cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, and we therefore asked whether <italic>dp1</italic> or <italic>e2f1</italic> mutants also had altered Commitment cell size thresholds. Commitment was measured in synchronous cultures so that G1 populations with well-defined size ranges could be obtained. Synchrony for <italic>dp1</italic> and <italic>e2f1</italic> strains was much more difficult to achieve than for wild-type, but we were able to synchronize the mutants using a modified light-dark regimen that also worked for wild-type cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p>The Commitment size threshold in the synchronous cultures was measured by removing aliquots of cells at various times during G1 and determining their cell size distributions before and after dark-shifting, and by plating aliquots of cells on agar in the dark in order to more accurately determine the fraction of committed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The data on cell size distribution and fraction of committed cells were then combined to determine the threshold size at which cells divide. For wild-type cultures, as cells approached approximately 195 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup>, they passed Commitment and were capable of dividing after a dark-shift. In other words, the fraction of cells that was larger than approximately 195 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup> accurately predicted the fraction of cells in the population that were committed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020167-t001">Table 1</xref>).

However, as the cells continued to grow and reached sizes well above wild-type Commitment size, they could produce daughters similar in size to wild-type daughters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, right). Thus, <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> mutants had an increased Commitment size, and cells that were just past Commitment also appeared to have defects in daughter cell-size control. However, the daughter cell-size defect disappeared as cells grew larger and the entire population became committed. While <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> mutants clearly had a larger Commitment size than wild-type, measuring their Commitment size proved difficult. Unlike wild-type and <italic>dp1&#x02013;1</italic> cultures, synchronized <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> cultures behaved somewhat unpredictably, sometimes passing Commitment just above the threshold size of wild-type cells and sometimes considerably later. This instability suggested that <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> cells had a more severe defect early in the cell cycle but that this defect could be partially overcome with continued growth. However, it is important to note that the supernumerous cell divisions of <italic>mat3&#x02013;4</italic> were effectively suppressed by <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> under all circumstances, meaning that even the apparently normal S/M cycles seen in <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> strains concealed an underlying defect.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Complementation and Dominance Testing</title><p>We attempted to complement the <italic>dp1&#x02013;1</italic> and <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> strains in order to confirm that the mutant phenotypes we observed were due to defects in each of these loci.

Umen, unpublished data), DP1 and E2F1 function as heterodimers, and loss of DP1 is expected to eliminate E2F1 activity. Although it is difficult to completely rule out redundancy, our data are most simply interpreted as E2F1-DP1 heterodimers having a nonessential role in cell cycle progression, but a critical role in maintaining size homeostasis.</p><p>However, it is formally possible that other E2F-like genes exist in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> that compensate either for loss of <italic>DP1</italic> or dominant mutations in <italic>E2F1</italic>, but several observations suggest that this is not the case. First, in the current and all previous <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> genome assemblies, extensive bioinformatic searching has never identified any E2F or DP family members other than those already described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Second, no other copies of <italic>E2F1</italic> or <italic>DP1</italic> were detected by low stringency Southern blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020167-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Third, a comprehensive search of the closely related <named-content content-type="genus-species">Volvox carteri</named-content> genome revealed single orthologs of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> E2F1, DP1, and E2FR1, but no additional E2F/DP family members (unpublished data). While it has some resemblance to E2F/DP like proteins, E2FR1 appears to be a poor candidate for an E2F1 or DP1 substitute&#x02014;its DNA binding domain is diverged, and it contains no obvious dimerization domain. Nonetheless, it may be able to substitute in some way for the loss of DP1 or dominant mutation in E2F1. If it did so (either as a binding partner or in some other way), then we might have expected to see added phenotypic severity when <italic>dp1</italic> and <italic>e2f1</italic> mutations were combined, but that was never the case. We are currently attempting to isolate null alleles of <italic>E2F1</italic> and RNAi lines for <italic>E2FR1</italic> so that this question can be resolved more conclusively.</p><p>Two unusual aspects of the suppressor screen were the high rate of isolation of both <italic>DP1</italic> and <italic>E2F1</italic> alleles (12 of 20,000 and three of 20,000, respectively), and the absence of <italic>e2f1</italic> null mutations. If insertions were random, then they would occur on average every 5 kb among 20,000 mutants (for an approximately 100-Mb genome) and should have generated one allele each for <italic>DP1</italic> and <italic>E2F1</italic>. Thus, both the <italic>DP1</italic> and <italic>E2F1</italic> loci appear to be hotspots for insertions/deletions. Whether this insertion bias is also present in a wild-type strain background is not known. It is notable that all the <italic>E2F1</italic> insertions we identified were in a 1.4-kb SmaI fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g001">Figures 1</xref>D and S1) and that <italic>e2f1&#x02013;4</italic> resulted from a spontaneous deletion in the same region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020167-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). While it is possible that <italic>E2F1</italic> is essential, our lack of null alleles in the screen cannot be taken as evidence that this is the case since the locus was highly susceptible to mutations in the 3&#x02032; region that caused a dominant suppressor phenotype.</p><p>The structure of the <italic>E2F1</italic> alleles that we isolated is consistent with them acting as dominant negatives. As has been observed elsewhere, C-terminally truncated alleles of E2F can interfere with E2F function in mammalian cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;.

The complete dominance we observed for <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> E2F1 suppressor alleles could be due to enhanced stability of the mutant E2F1 proteins or mRNA compared to wild-type, but this remains to be determined.</p><p>While the C-terminal region of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> E2F1 lacks an obvious RB binding domain that is found on other E2Fs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;, we propose that it encodes an alternative motif that interacts with MAT3/RB. We also propose the existence of a residual cell cycle activation function in heterodimers formed between <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1, &#x02212;2, &#x02212;3</italic> encoded proteins and DP1 that generates a partially functioning size control mechanism. The mutant heterodimers may, for example, allow the slow accumulation of a rate-limiting cell cycle activity so that in large mother cells this activity is sufficient to support a normal number of S/M cycles. At the same time, this class of <italic>E2F1</italic> alleles must also limit the excess rounds of replication and division that occur in <italic>mat3</italic> mutants, perhaps by restricting the overaccumulation of the same rate-limiting activity that occurs when MAT3/RB is missing.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>The RB Pathway and Cell Size Control</title><p>Our genetic results demonstrate a role for DP1-E2F1 and MAT3/RB as positive and negative regulators of the cell cycle, respectively, that affect cell size in opposite ways. While this observation might be construed as a trivial outcome of shortened or lengthened cell cycles, this is not the case. In <italic>Chlamydomonas,</italic> the effects on cell size checkpoints can be uncoupled from cell cycle kinetics, and the results we obtained clearly implicate the RB pathway in cell size checkpoint control. As previously observed, <italic>mat3</italic> cells pass Commitment prematurely and then divide too many times during S/M &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Here, we showed that <italic>dp1</italic> and <italic>e2f1</italic> mutants have the opposite phenotype of <italic>mat3,</italic> passing Commitment at a larger size and exiting S/M prematurely before an adequate number of cell divisions have been completed. Moreover, <italic>dp1</italic> mutants did not appear to remain in S/M for an unduly long period of time, and they were not slow to transition from G1 into S/M; on the contrary, <italic>dp1</italic> mutants spent less time in G1 than wild-type cells. Nonetheless, <italic>dp1</italic> cells maintained a large size because they failed to initiate enough rounds of S phase. Therefore, the effects we saw on cell size in RB pathway mutants were due to aberrant cell size checkpoint control and were not caused by a slow cell cycle.</p><p>The fact that cells missing key components of the RB pathway can still maintain size equilibrium, albeit at abnormal sizes, indicates that there are alternative mechanisms that can contribute to cell size homeostasis. Therefore, the rate-limiting factors that are required for cell cycle progression can be produced in cells that are mutant for <italic>MAT3, E2F1,</italic> or <italic>DP1,</italic> but perhaps they are produced at the wrong time and/or in inappropriate quantities. The unstable behavior of the <italic>e2f1&#x02013;1</italic> strain in passing Commitment suggests that it is on the &#x0201c;borderline&#x0201d; for production of such a factor, but once made, it can modulate proper cell division later on in the cell cycle. It is important to note that our assay for Commitment is based operationally on future cell division behavior and is not based on a real-time molecular assay such as presence/absence of a protein modification or production/localization of a protein or RNA. Understanding the molecular details of Commitment and the regulation of cell division number will be critical for truly understanding how the RB pathway mediates cell size control.</p><p>The cell size phenotypes we saw for RB pathway mutants in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> are similar to the cell size phenotypes of animal and plant cells that have perturbations in the RB pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b018">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;, but it might be argued that they arise for different reasons&#x02014;altered size checkpoint control in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> versus altered cell cycle kinetics in other organisms. However, the two explanations are not mutually exclusive: Size checkpoint defects in a canonical cell cycle would be expected to alter the overall cell cycle phasing. However, in developing systems, the RB pathway is integrated with developmental control mechanisms at a number of levels, including responses to extracellular signaling pathways, regulation of growth rates, and apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. The cell size and developmental phenotypes of an RB mutation in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, a primitive slime mold that interconverts between a unicellular and multicellular form, suggest that this integration may be a critical part of the transition to multicellularity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. These additional developmental roles do not preclude the participation of the RB pathway in a size checkpoint, but they make the identification of its function as a size regulator more complicated. In animals there has been compelling evidence for a G1-S size checkpoint &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d; although it may not operate in all cell types &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. It will be interesting to determine whether the G1 size control that has been observed in animal cells operates through the RB pathway. It is also intriguing that in budding yeast, which has lost the RB pathway, a highly similar genetic mechanism has evolved to control progression through Start, a G1-S size checkpoint &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;. In summary, the role we have identified for the RB pathway in size regulation may represent a basal function that evolved in unicellular organisms, to which was added additional regulatory inputs in multicellular species.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Transcriptional Regulation by the RB Pathway in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic></title><p>While the genetic architecture of the RB pathway has been conserved in <italic>Chlamydomonas,</italic> its influence on cell cycle transcription has not. The regulation of predicted targets of E2F was not altered significantly in RB pathway mutants, and inhibition of transcription did not influence cell division number. These findings were surprising because many of the transcriptional targets of E2F are conserved between plants and animals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b041">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. However, E2F may be bound at many noncanonical sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;, so predicting targets based on E2F consensus sites may be an inadequate method for identifying E2F-regulated genes.

Thus, in asynchronous culture systems it is easy to overestimate the direct influence of the RB pathway on cell cycle transcription. Our ability to synchronize mutant cells allowed us to overcome this problem by examining periodic transcription within a single cell cycle.</p><p>It is possible that our experiments were unable to detect a role for E2F1-DP1&#x02013;mediated transcription in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. Given that RB pathway mutants have defects at Commitment and during S/M, it is possible that the key transcriptional response is for target genes that are activated early in the cell cycle and that these defects carry over into S/M. Another possibility is that the RB pathway does not control the magnitude of cell cycle transcription but its relative timing. In this model, the duration of the transcriptional burst during S/M but not its magnitude would determine cell division number. In other words, the RB pathway would control the window of time during which a cell could initiate S phase and mitosis but would not directly control the induction of S/M-regulated transcripts. In <italic>mat3</italic> mutants, the window would be abnormally lengthened, and in <italic>dp1</italic> mutants, it would be shortened. In any case, our findings do show that the magnitude of S/M transcription does not predict cell division behavior and is not controlled by the RB pathway. This conclusion also implies the existence of an alternative cell cycle transcription mechanism that can induce and repress expression of S/M genes in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> independently of the RB pathway.</p><p>Despite lacking obvious transcriptional phenotypes, mutants in the RB pathway have very clear cell cycle phenotypes. This discrepancy has prompted us to consider alternative possibilities for how the RB pathway might control the cell cycle. It is conventionally believed that the transcriptional induction of cell cycle genes by E2F-DP complexes has a primary causative role in promoting cell cycle progression. However, the definitive identification of rate-limiting E2F targets is not easy, with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cyclin E gene being one of few examples &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d;. Until recently, mammalian cyclin E was also thought to be such a target, but results showing that cyclin E and its binding partner, CDK2, are not essential for cell cycle progression have demonstrated that this is not the case &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b068">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b070">70</xref>&#x0005d;.

It is, therefore, possible that the primary role of the MAT3/RB pathway in regulating cell cycle progression may not be related to transcription. In this scenario, the RB pathway would activate S phase through some other mechanism, and while we have not identified such a mechanism, there is intriguing evidence suggesting nontranscriptional roles for RB in other organisms. For example, in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> RB complexes have been proposed to regulate chorion gene amplification through direct interaction with origin recognition complexes in a manner that is insensitive to transcriptional inhibition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b071">71</xref>&#x0005d;.

Complemented transformants with <italic>mat3&#x02013;4</italic>&#x02013;sized cells were crossed to a wild-type strain (6145c) in order to segregate away the <italic>mat3&#x02013;4</italic> mutation and to confirm linkage of the Zeocin resistance and complementation phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Isolation and characterization of <italic>e2f1&#x02013;4.</italic></title><p><italic>e2f1&#x02013;4</italic> was isolated during transformation of an <italic>mat3&#x02013;4 nit1&#x02013;305</italic> strain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020167-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; with an <italic>NIT1</italic>-containing vector. The inserted <italic>NIT1</italic> DNA in the suppressed transformant was found to be linked to the suppression phenotype and located approximately 10 kb from the <italic>E2F1</italic> locus whose DNA was then sequenced to identify the <italic>e2f1&#x02013;4</italic> deletion. The deletion removes approximately 1.1 kb of the genomic locus from nucleotides 1124 to 2243 (numbered from the initiator ATG) (corresponding to nucleotides 463 to 1221 of the <italic>E2F1</italic> cDNA) and would generate an in-frame deletion that removes exon 5 and fuses exons 4 and 6. The predicted E2F1&#x02013;4 protein would be missing amino acids 155 to 407. The library used to isolate <italic>e2f1&#x02013;4</italic> genomic DNA was made using the &#x003bb;BlueSTAR Vector System (Novagen, Madison, Wisconsin, United States) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plaque lifts from the library were probed with <italic>E2F1</italic> sequences and positive clones containing <italic>e2f1&#x02013;4</italic> were isolated and confirmed by sequencing. An approximately 4-kb <italic>e2f1&#x02013;4</italic> genomic fragment was isolated from a positive phage clone by PspOMI digestion and cloned into the vector pLitmus 38 (New England Biolabs) that had an <italic>aphVIII</italic> cassette encoding paromomycin resistance to generate pE2F1&#x02013;4. The <italic>aphVIII</italic> cassette was a PvuII-SpeI fragment from pSI103 that had been inserted into the HpaI site of pLitmus 38. pE2F1&#x02013;4 or control plasmid pSI103 was used to transform an <italic>mat3&#x02013;4</italic> strain using paromomycin selection (25 &#x003bc;g/ml), and several suppressed clones were chosen from the pE2F1&#x02013;4 <italic>mat3&#x02013;4</italic> transformants. Two of the suppressed <italic>mat3&#x02013;4</italic> transformants were crossed to a wild-type strain (6145c), and the linkage of the cell size phenotype and the paromomycin resistance phenotype was confirmed in the progeny.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Quantitative RT-PCR.</title><p>Approximately 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> cells were pelleted at each time point, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at &#x02212;70 &#x000b0;C.

Real-time RT-PCR analysis was carried out using a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ (Hercules, California, United States).

The aliquot of cells that was incubated on plates in the dark was scored microscopically to determine the fraction of committed cells in the population. The arrowhead in the picture inset indicates a cell that was not committed, and the stars indicate cells that were committed and divided either once or twice to produce two and four daughters, respectively. The CST is empirically determined by finding a size threshold value that best explains the behavior of the cells with respect to the fraction that were committed in each sample.
