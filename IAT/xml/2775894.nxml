However, the biochemical function of this complex is poorly understood. Using <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extract we show that Tipin is required for DNA replication in the presence of limiting amount of replication origins. Under these conditions the DNA replication defect correlates with decreased levels of DNA Pol&#x003b1; on chromatin. We identified And1, a Pol&#x003b1; chromatin-loading factor, as new Tipin-binding partner. We found that both Tipin and And1 promote stable binding of Pol&#x003b1; to chromatin and that this is required for DNA replication under unchallenged conditions. Strikingly, extracts lacking Tipin and And1 also show reduced sister chromatids cohesion. These data indicate that Tipin/Tim1/And1 form a complex that links stabilization of replication fork and establishment of sister chromatid cohesion.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chromatid cohesion</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>Tipin&#x02013;Tim complex</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosomes are duplicated with remarkable speed and accuracy, with no molecules of DNA left unreplicated or replicated more than once. To allow complete replication of large eukaryotic chromosomes, cells license thousands of replication origins distributed along the chromosome. Origin licensing consists of recruitment of the essential helicase activity, Mcm2&#x02013;7, on the DNA following coordinated binding of origin-recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6 and Cdt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gillespie <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Once two adjacent origins fire, the two converging forks have to progress until they meet to ensure the complete replication of the DNA segment between the origins. Forks can stall if they encounter DNA damage. Under these conditions a replication-pausing complex stabilizes the stalled forks, while a checkpoint response is activated to halt cell-cycle progression and to allow fork restart following DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Branzei and Foiani, 2005</xref>). Tipin, together with Tim1 and Claspin, is a member of the replication-pausing complex and is important to mediate the intra-S-phase checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ito <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Mayer <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Noguchi <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Nedelcheva <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chou and Elledge, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Krogan <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gotter <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Unsal-Kacmaz <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Yoshizawa-Sugata and Masai, 2007</xref>). Studies of Claspin and Tim1 orthologues in yeast, respectively Mrc1 and Tof1, showed that they are also important for control of normal progression of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Hodgson <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, a reduction in the expression levels of mammalian Tim1 results in decreased rate of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chou and Elledge, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gotter <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Unsal-Kacmaz <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Yoshizawa-Sugata and Masai, 2007</xref>). All these data clearly indicate that Tipin and Tim1 are active components of the replication fork, and that beyond their well-established role in fork stabilization they may have a more direct role during DNA replication. An essential additional mechanism to ensure full replication under stress is achieved by licensing many more origins than the ones that will be actually used. These supplementary licensed origins remain &#x02018;dormant' during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Blow and Ge, 2008</xref>) and fire only under stress when replication forks are stalled or slowed ensuring complete genome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Woodward <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Ge <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Blow and Ge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Ibarra <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>We have investigated the role of Tipin during DNA replication using <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extract. We found that Tipin is required for efficient DNA synthesis. Tipin's role becomes evident when dormant origins are suppressed. Under these conditions, absence of Tipin leads to drastic reduction in the level of Pol&#x003b1; on the chromatin. We have also identified And1 (Ctf4) as a new binding partner of Tipin, and demonstrate that these two proteins collaborate in the loading and/or stabilization of Pol&#x003b1; on DNA. In addition, the Tipin/And1-depleted extract show loosening of sister chromatid cohesion. This is in agreement with the cohesion defect already observed in the yeast orthologue mutants, <italic>csm3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Marston <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Mayer <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) and <italic>ctf4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hanna <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Petronczki <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Zhou and Wang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). These data provide biochemical evidence that factors involved in DNA replication and checkpoint signalling also contribute to establishment and maintenance of chromosome cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Suter <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Warren <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tipin is required for DNA replication under minimal licensing condition</title><p>We have previously shown that Tipin is associated with the replication fork and is required for fork stability and fork restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Errico <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, its role during DNA replication is unclear. Reduction of Tipin/Tim1 levels in human cells by siRNA resulted in a delay in S-phase progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chou and Elledge, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Unsal-Kacmaz <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Yoshizawa-Sugata and Masai, 2007</xref>), whereas depletion of Tipin (and consequently Tim1) from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract had no measurable impact on DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Errico <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Previous work using different eukaryotes, including <italic>X. laevis</italic> and humans, demonstrated that Mcm2&#x02013;7 complexes are loaded on the chromatin in a 20-fold excess over the number of chromatin-bound ORC molecules and over the number of active replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Edwards <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Oehlmann <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Many hypotheses have been proposed about the possible function of this excess of MCM, termed as the &#x02018;MCM paradox' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hyrien <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Blow and co-workers showed that one of these functions is to license &#x02018;dormant' replication origins that are inactive during unperturbed S-phase, but can be used to allow complete DNA replication under conditions of replicative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Woodward <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Ge <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Ibarra <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>We reasoned that in an embryonic cell system, such as <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extract, in which there are more origins than in somatic cells, the presence of dormant origins could mask a replication defect phenotype in the Tipin-depleted extract. It has been shown that the addition of Geminin (a Cdt1 inhibitor that prevents MCM loading on the chromatin) to the extract shortly after addition of sperm nuclei reduces the number of MCM complexes loaded on the DNA to a minimum required to support efficient DNA replication without altering the inter-origin distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Woodward <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). This condition is referred as &#x02018;minimum licensing'; the amount of MCM on the chromatin is reduced to 10&#x00025; when compared with the normal &#x02018;excess' condition, which is also referred to as &#x02018;maximum licensing' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Woodward <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Ge <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Blow and Ge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Ibarra <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). To test our hypothesis and better dissect the role of Tipin at the replication fork, we have assessed the efficiency of DNA replication in the Tipin-depleted extract under &#x02018;minimum licensing' conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A&#x02013;C</xref>). Addition of Geminin to the mock or Tipin-depleted extract 3 min after addition of sperm nuclei reduced the amount of MCM on the DNA as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). We have performed a time-course experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>) and measured the efficiency of DNA replication at 120 min post nuclei addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). We found that, under minimal licensing conditions the Tipin-depleted extract showed 70&#x00025; reduction in the overall efficiency of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, lane 2). The defect was specific, since it could be rescued by adding back Tipin/Tim1 recombinant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, lane 3) (since Tipin depletion concomitantly depletes most of Tim1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Errico <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) or mock-depleted extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, lane 4). We have also measured the efficiency of DNA replication in the mock and Tipin-depleted extract in the presence of 10 000 nuclei per microlitre, a condition known to increase the inter-origin distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Walter and Newport, 1997</xref>). Surprisingly, under these conditions we were not able to detect defects in DNA replication in the Tipin-depleted extract (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>), suggesting that replisomes can travel longer distance even in the absence of Tipin.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tipin interacts with Pol&#x003b1; and is required for its association with the chromatin under &#x02018;minimum licensing' conditions</title><p>One of the proposed roles for Tipin and Tim1 is to couple the helicase with the replisome. This would minimize excessive unwinding of the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Errico <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gotter <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, we have previously demonstrated an interaction between Tipin and Mcm7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Errico <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) in <italic>X. laevis</italic>, while others have shown the association of Tipin/Tim1 complex with other member of the replisome such as Mcm6, Mcm7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chou and Elledge, 2006</xref>), Mcm2, RPA, Pol&#x003b4; and Pol&#x0025b; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gotter <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) in human cells. We next asked whether Tipin was also able to interact with DNA polymerases in <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extract; indeed Tipin immunoprecipitates, both from extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>) and nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), were found to contain Pol&#x003b1; (p180). In order to determine the role of Tipin during DNA replication, we took advantage of the &#x02018;minimum licensing' conditions and asked whether the loading of replisome components on the chromatin was defective. Tipin was depleted from an interphase <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>) and chromatin was isolated under &#x02018;maximum or minimum' licensing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). We found that under &#x02018;minimum licensing' conditions the amount of Pol&#x003b1; (p180) on the chromatin was greatly reduced in the Tipin-depleted extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>), whereas the level of Orc1 remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition we monitored the binding of key replication fork proteins such as Cdc45 and Sld5 of the GINS complex. We found that under minimum licensing conditions the binding of these proteins was unaffected in the presence or absence or Tipin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). These data suggest that under these conditions replication fork structures are preserved, and that the Tipin/Tim1 complex is specifically required to promote stabile binding of Pol&#x003b1; (p180) to replication forks.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Analysis of replication forks in the Tipin-depleted extract by molecular combing</title><p>We next examined origins distribution and fork progression in the mock or the Tipin-depleted extract, under &#x02018;maximum or minimum' licensing conditions, by molecular combing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Herrick <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Marheineke and Hyrien, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2004</xref>). Sperm nuclei were incubated in egg extract (mock or Tipin-depleted) supplemented with digoxigenin&#x02013;dUTP, in order to label the entire replicated DNA. Biotin&#x02013;dUTP was added at different times (40 and 60 min) after the addition of digoxigenin and DNA replication was allowed to advance to completion (up to 120 min). For these experiments, replication initiation zones are defined as regions replicated prior to addition of biotin&#x02013;dUTP and, therefore, will appear as digoxigenin-positive, but biotin-negative (gap), tracts (also defined as the replication eye) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). The inter-origin distance (eye-to-eye distance, ETED) is calculated as the distance between midpoints of adjacent eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Marheineke and Hyrien, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Labit <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Overall, we found that both under &#x02018;maximum' or &#x02018;minimum' licensing conditions the peak of the distribution of inter-origin distance was approximately 10&#x02013;20 kb, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Woodward <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), although minor differences attributable to kinetic variability and increased stressful condition due to the depletion procedure could be seen in mock-depleted extracts at 40 min. During early S-phase, the Tipin-depleted extract exhibited a higher frequency of shorter inter-origin distance when compared with the mock sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>), both in the presence or the absence of dormant origins (&#x02018;maximum' or &#x02018;minimum' licensing). This phenomenon may be due to a defect in the intra-S-phase checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Errico <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) that normally suppresses origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Shechter <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Later in S-phase, there is no further substantial difference in the distribution of the inter-origin distance between the mock and depleted extract under &#x02018;maximum licensing' conditions. The peak of this distribution was instead shifted towards higher values in the Tipin-depleted extract under &#x02018;minimum licensing' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the shift towards higher inter-origin distance was due to merging of replication forks occurring at 60 min, due to eventual modifications of the fork rate, we calculated the average &#x02018;eye length' and the fork speed for each sample. Importantly, we found that there was no substantial difference in the various samples (mock or depleted, minimum or maximum licensing, comparing the same time points) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). We have also plotted the average inter-origin distance (ETED) per fibre over the average eye-length (EL) per fibre for each sample (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>) and confirmed that only in the &#x02018;minimum licensed' &#x00394;Tipin sample (at 60 min) there is significant increase in fibres having large ETED (&#x0003e;25 kb) and small EL (&#x0003c;10 kb) values. These distances cannot be the result of merged forks, which would have instead caused an increase in the number of fibres with large ETED and high EL. Therefore, the observed shift of the peak of inter-origins distance in minimum licensed Tipin-depleted extract at 60 min possibly reflects the reduced efficiency of DNA replication due to a reduced number of active origins. This could be explained by the requirement for Tipin in promoting Pol&#x003b1; binding to chromatin. We cannot also exclude sporadic collapse of a higher number of replication forks in Tipin-depleted extract, consistent with the role of Tipin in maintaining fork stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chou and Elledge, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Errico <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). In any case, the biochemical data showing the presence of replisome components such as GINS and Cdc45 under minimal licensing condition without Tipin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>) exclude the occurrence of massive fork collapse.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>A new Tipin-interacting partner: And1</title><p>In order to understand the molecular basis of the interaction between Tipin and Pol&#x003b1;, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using egg extract using anti Tipin antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Errico <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were then fractionated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and analysed by mass spectrometry. Together with the Mcm2&#x02013;7 complex, we identified And1 (data not shown) as a new Tipin-interacting protein. And1 orthologues in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, respectively Ctf4 and Mcl1, have been shown to interact with DNA Pol&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Miles and Formosa, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Formosa and Nittis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Zhou and Wang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Tsutsui <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Recently, Dutta and co-workers have shown that mammalian And1 interacts with both Mcm10 and DNA Pol&#x003b1;. They also showed that in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract Mcm10 is required for loading of And1 on chromatin and both proteins are required for recruitment of DNA Pol&#x003b1; at the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). From this perspective the interaction between Tipin and And1 is intriguing and may contribute to explaining why under &#x02018;minimum' licensing condition Tipin-depleted extracts are defective in the association of DNA Pol&#x003b1; with the chromatin.</p><p>To explore this possibility, we examined whether the Tipin&#x02013;And1 interaction was occurring in egg extract. We found that Tipin immunoprecipitates from extract specifically contained And1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>) and that also And1 was able to co-immunoprecipitate Tipin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). The interaction was also confirmed by immunoprecipitation from nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). This indicates that Tipin interacts with And1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. To address whether the interaction between Tipin and And1 was direct, we performed pull-down experiments using recombinant proteins. We found that differently from GST alone, GST&#x02013;And1 is directly interacting with Tipin&#x02013;6His (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). Since both Tipin and And1 were able to co-immunoprecipitate Pol&#x003b1;, we asked whether the interactions between Pol&#x003b1; and these proteins were direct. We have performed pull-down experiments using GST, GST&#x02013;And1 or GST&#x02013;Tipin recombinant proteins and <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription translated <sup>35</sup>S-labelled Pol&#x003b1;&#x02013;p180 subunit. We showed that both GST&#x02013;Tipin and GST&#x02013;And1, but not GST alone, were able to pull down Pol&#x003b1;&#x02013;p180 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that both Tipin and And1 are directly interacting with Pol&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tipin and And1 are necessary for DNA replication</title><p>To understand the relevance of a Tipin/And1 interaction, we performed double depletion experiments using egg extract. Both antibodies, anti-Tipin and anti-And1, efficiently depleted the respective proteins from the extract (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures S4 and S5</xref>). We prepared Tipin- or And1-depleted extracts, as well as Tipin/And1 double-depleted extracts, and tested them for their ability to support DNA replication. As previously shown, Tipin depletion did not affect DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Errico <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), while And1 depletion induced moderate reduction in the efficiency of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Yoshizawa-Sugata and Masai, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, Tipin and And1 double depletion caused severe impairment of DNA synthesis, with a reduction of 70&#x00025; in the overall efficiency of replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). To understand the basis for such a defect in DNA replication, we analysed the loading on the chromatin of essential replication factors. We found that And1 and Tipin independently bind to chromatin with similar kinetics as the depletion of one protein does not significantly affect the binding of the other protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref> shows that association of DNA Pol&#x003b1; with chromatin is greatly reduced in Tipin/And1-depleted extract. This is also true, although to a lesser extent in And1 single depletion. Since previous data have also indicated the relevance of Mcm10 in such a process, we also checked Mcm10 level on the chromatin. We found no difference in the level of chromatin-bound Mcm10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with its association with chromatin occurring before and independently of And1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Importantly, the binding of other replication proteins such as TopBP1 and Cdc45 was not significantly affected by the double Tipin&#x02013;And1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>). Taken together, these results clearly suggest that And1 and Tipin are specifically required for loading and/or stability of DNA Pol&#x003b1; on the chromatin.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tipin/And1-depleted extracts have a defect in sister chromatid cohesion</title><p>The two DNA molecules that arise from the replication fork must be held together until their separation in anaphase, a task performed mainly by a multi-protein complex named cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Hirano, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Several data suggest a role of replication-fork components in the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. Many replication-associated proteins from budding yeast are known to support efficient sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hanna <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Mayer <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Naiki <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Skibbens, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Warren <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">2007</xref>). Recently a genetic analysis has placed Ctf4 (And1), Csm3 (Tipin) and Tof1 (Tim1) in the same pathway leading to sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Moreover, the same analysis led to the conclusion that Csm3 and Tof1 are required for establishment of cohesion in S-phase, but not for maintenance of cohesion during G<sub>2</sub>/M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Thus, we next asked whether the role of these factors (Ctf4, Csm3 and Tof1) in establishment of cohesion was conserved in higher eukaryotes. To analyse cohesion in our experimental system, sperm nuclei were added to interphase extract, mock or depleted (&#x00394;Tip, &#x00394;And1, &#x00394;Tip/And1), together with biotin&#x02013;dUTP to monitor replication. Once replication was completed, the reaction mixtures were driven into mitosis by addition of 1 volume of CSF-arrested extract (mock), which promoted chromosome condensation. Chromosomes were then fixed, spun over coverslips and analysed by immunofluorescence with an antibody recognizing the condensin XCAP-E, which labels the axis of each chromatid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). Biotin incorporation was detected with an Alexa 594&#x02013;streptavidin conjugate. The majority of chromosomes that had completed replication, as judged by incorporation of biotin&#x02013;dUTP, had paired sister chromatids. However, there was a general loosening of the pairing between the sister chromatids in the chromosomes from the depleted extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). The average distance between chromatids was larger for chromosomes assembled in Tipin- (0.60&#x000b1;0.15), And1- (0.60&#x000b1;0.16) and Tipin/And1 (0.75&#x000b1;0.19)-depleted extracts as compared to those assembled in the mock extract (0.43&#x000b1;0.06). It is worth mentioning that the loosening of cohesion must have been generated in the depleted extract during DNA replication. Cohesion, indeed, could not be restored during chromosome compaction triggered by mitotic extract, although this extract was not depleted and, therefore, contained normal levels of And1 and Tipin. The cohesion defects observed were not due to impaired loading of cohesin on chromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). This suggests that inefficient establishment of sister chromatid cohesion results from a defect in the replication machinery rather than a structural problem with the cohesion apparatus, highlighting the intimate connection between DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we report that, beyond its role in fork stability and checkpoint response, Tipin collaborates with And1 in the loading and/or stabilization of DNA Pol&#x003b1; on chromatin. While And1's association with DNA Pol&#x003b1; was already known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), we have demonstrated here that Tipin is able to directly interact with Pol&#x003b1;. Tipin depletion does not significantly affect embryonic DNA synthesis under normal conditions (maximum licensing). However in the presence of fewer replication origins (minimum licensing), which mimic a condition closer to the somatic status, Tipin becomes an essential replication factor. During unchallenged DNA replication many origins are initiated and the Tipin/Tim1 complex travels with the replication fork. In the event of the fork stalling, should enough forks stall a global checkpoint signal is activated that represses initiation at other sites throughout the genome and halts the cell cycle until replication can resume. However, in the presence of few stalled forks, if the checkpoint response is not strongly activated, nearby dormant origins could fire and rescue replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Woodward <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Under &#x02018;maximum licensing' conditions, we did not observe any difference in the efficiency of DNA replication between the mock- and Tipin-depleted extract. Our hypothesis is that under &#x02018;maximum licensing' conditions, when forks stall, the presence of nearby origins competent for initiation can rescue DNA replication even in the absence of Tipin/Tim1. When the number of competent origins is limited to the minimum required for efficient replication, the absence of Tipin/Tim1 becomes crucial. As shown by the molecular combing data, when in &#x02018;minimum licensed', Tipin-depleted extract forks stall, the extract reacts by firing more origins at early time points (early S-phase). However, later in S-phase, in the absence of dormant origins to maintain DNA replication, we detect a defect in the efficiency of DNA replication that correlates with increased inter-origin distance. A possible explanation to this observation is that in the absence of dormant origins stalled forks are prone to collapse due to the absence of the replication-pausing complex. Tipin-depleted extracts are indeed not only depleted of Tim1 but are also defective in loading Claspin onto the chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Errico <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, biochemical analysis of replication fork proteins Cdc45 and Sld5 did not reveal significant differences in their binding to chromatin in the absence of Tipin, indicating that most of the fork structures are intact. This suggests that if fork collapse happens in the absence of Tipin, it is likely to be minimal and, therefore, to have a minor effect on DNA replication efficiency and increased inter-origin distance. The effects on DNA replication efficiency might be better explained by the deficient association of Pol&#x003b1; (p180) to chromatin, which we show to require Tipin under &#x02018;minimum licensing' conditions. In this case the reduced level of And1, a key factor required for Pol&#x003b1; loading, on &#x02018;minimum licensed' chromatin (data not shown) might render Tipin function essential for this task. In support of this hypothesis, both Tipin and And1 appear to be required to promote Pol&#x003b1; chromatin binding as shown by a defect in Pol&#x003b1; (p180) association with the chromatin observed under &#x02018;maximum licensing' conditions when both And1 and Tipin are depleted. The yeast orthologue of And1, Ctf4, was found to interact physically and genetically with Pol&#x003b1; (p180) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Formosa and Nittis, 1999</xref>), and data on And1 (from mammalian cells and <italic>Xenopus</italic>) proved its role in contributing to the regulation of Pol&#x003b1; binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). We confirmed that And1-depleted extracts have a moderate defect in DNA replication and also a slight decrease in Pol&#x003b1; loading. Strikingly, we detected a more severe defect in replication by co-depleting Tipin and And1. We could not detect any change in Mcm10 level on the chromatin, confirming that Tipin and And1 function downstream of this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The idea that Tipin and And1 are both involved in modulating Pol&#x003b1; association to DNA is also corroborated by the finding that Tipin, And1 and Pol&#x003b1; are part of a large multi-protein complex (together with Claspin, Mcm10, Mcm2&#x02013;7, Cdc45 and GINS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gambus <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). It has been shown recently that Ctf4 binds directly to Pol&#x003b1; and GINS and is required to link Pol&#x003b1; to the replication progression complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Gambus <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>) in budding yeast. Our findings provide novel biochemical evidence that Tof1/Csm3 (Tim1/Tipin) interact directly with Ctf4 (And1) and Pol&#x003b1; and further confirms Ctf4&#x02013;Pol&#x003b1; interaction in higher eukaryotes.</p><p>The effect of the depletion of Tipin and And1 seems to be partially additive. As both proteins can independently bind Pol&#x003b1;, the formation of a complex between Tipin and And1 might help to further stabilize Pol&#x003b1; binding to chromatin under particularly stressful conditions, for example, when the number of available origins is limited. A recent report has demonstrated the requirement for Cdc45 in Tipin&#x02013;Tim1 and And1 binding to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). In light of these and our findings, the Tipin&#x02013;Tim1 complex, which interacts with many of the players found at replication forks among which Cdc45, Pol&#x003b1;, Mcm, And1, Claspin, GINS and SMC1&#x02013;3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Chou and Elledge, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Errico <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gotter <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>), might create a flexible bridge linking Cdc45, Pol&#x003b1;, the GINS and the Mcm complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>) necessary for stable binding of Pol&#x003b1; to chromatin. This complex might be required for progression of the replisome under normal and stressful conditions. Intriguingly, we did not observe major DNA replication defects in the absence of Tipin when inter-origin distance was artificially increased by the addition of a high number of sperm nuclei to egg extract. This suggests that once replication fork have been established, they can travel long distance even in the absence of Tipin complex. It is possible that the replication defects observed with minimum licensed chromatin are also in part due to a defect in replication fork restart, which requires Pol&#x003b1;-mediated re-priming of leading-strand synthesis. This function might be important for Tipin-mediated checkpoint activation in response to stalled forks. In this case Tipin could play a role similar to TopBP1, which has been shown to promote Pol&#x003b1; chromatin binding, an event that appears to be essential to recruit the 9-1-1 complex to the stalled fork and promote activation of the replication checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Yan and Michael, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The physical and functional interaction between Tipin and And1 is not only limited to DNA replication. Genetic data from the yeast orthologues suggest that Ctf4 (And1) and Csm3 (Tipin) are also important for sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Xu <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). We showed that in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract depletion of Tipin, Tim1 and And1 causes a general loosening of the pairing of sister chromatids. Similar results were also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic> (2009)</xref>. Our experiments indicate that the cohesion defect was generated in S-phase. Importantly, we did not observe any striking alteration in the amount of cohesins present on interphase chromatin assembled in the depleted extracts. Thus, it is most likely that the problem stems from the process of cohesion establishment that is coupled to replication fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Skibbens <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Skibbens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Lengronne <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Two different models have been proposed for the establishment of cohesion. One model foresees that cohesion is established by the sliding of the fork through the cohesin ring. In an alternative model, cohesin has to dissociate from DNA to allow the passage of the replication fork, but is held in close proximity of the fork to re-associate with DNA immediately after, thus ensuring pairing of the replicated chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Lengronne <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Although depletion of Tipin, Tim1 and/or And1 does not affect the loading of cohesin on DNA, it is possible that their absence alters the topology of the replication fork, preventing it from sliding through the ring. Alternatively, if cohesins have to briefly dissociate from DNA to allow the passage of replication fork, it is possible to envisage a situation in which the interaction between cohesin subunits and members of the replication complex can help in holding cohesin in proximity of the fork to facilitate its re-association with the two sister chromatids after fork passage. In support of the latter, it has been shown that in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> Tim1 interacts with Smc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Chan <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>), and that human And1 interacts with cohesin in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Yoshizawa-Sugata and Masai, 2009</xref>). Data obtained from <italic>Xenopus</italic> showing interaction of SMC1 and Tim1 also support a role for Tipin complex and SMC1 interaction in cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The results from FRAP analyses of GFP-tagged cohesin in vertebrate cells suggest that the binding mode of cohesin to chromatin changes upon DNA replication so that cohesin is stabilized and its exchange rate is dramatically decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Gerlich <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Cohesin-interacting factors such as Pds5, Wapl and Sororin do not affect the amount of cohesin loaded on chromatin, but do affect its chromatin-binding behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Losada <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Rankin <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kueng <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). For example, depletion of Sororin has been shown to decrease the fraction of stably chromatin-bound cohesin and to result in cohesion defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Schmitz <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Thus, passage of the replication fork might modify cohesin and the way it interacts with its closely associated factors. In this regard, acetylation of Smc3 by Eco1/Ctf7 has recently been proposed to be a key step in cohesion establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ben-Shahar <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Rowland <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Sutani <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). The acetyltransferase travels with the fork and its activity could depend, at least partially, on other replisome components such as Tipin and And-1. These data provide new biochemical insights directly linking replication-fork components such Tipin, Tim1 and And1 to establishment of sister chromatid cohesion and maintenance of genome stability.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plasmids and recombinant protein</title><p>Expression plasmids for Tipin were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Errico <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).
