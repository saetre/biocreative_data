We postulated that HIV-1 Tat protein can alter the expression of specific tight-junction proteins and disturb the blood retinal barrier, and contributes to HIV trafficking into the eyes. This study is to determine the effects of HIV-1 Tat proteins on the barrier function and tight-junction protein expression of retinal pigment epithelial cell (RPE).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A human RPE cell line (D407) cultured on microporous filter-supports was used. After treating with HIV-1 Tat protein, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of confluent RPE cells was measured by epithelial voltmeter. The permeability of the RPE cells to sodium fluorescein was measured. The expressions of the occludin and claudins were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis. Activation of ERK1/2 was detected by Western blot analysis with specific antiphospho protein antibodies. NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding activity was determined by transcription factor assay. Specific pharmacologic inhibitors directed against the MAPKs were used to analyze the signaling involved in barrier destruction of RPE cells exposed to HIV-1 Tat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Treating cultured human retinal pigment epithelial cells with 100 nM Tat for 24 hours increased the permeability and decreased the TER of the epithelial monolayer. HIV-1 Tat also disrupted and downregulated the tight-junction proteins claudin-1, claudin-3, and claudin-4 in these cells, whereas claudin-2 was upregulated, and the expression of occludin was unaffected. HIV-1 Tat protein also induced activation of ERK1/2 and NF-&#x003ba;B. HIV-1 Tat protein induced barrier destruction, changes in expression of TJs, and activation of ERK1/2 and NF-&#x003ba;B were abrogated by inhibitor of ERK1/2 and NF-&#x003ba;B.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>HIV-1 Tat protein causes increases in the paracellular permeability of RPE cells in vitro concomitant with changes in expression of certain transmembrane proteins associated with the tight junction. The effects of HIV-1 Tat on barrier function of the RPE may be mediated by ERK MAPK and NF-&#x003ba;B activation, which may represent potential targets for novel therapeutic approaches for the retinopathy induced by HIV infection.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Serious ophthalmic diseases can cause blindness in the absence of prompt diagnosis and therapy. These diseases often result from opportunistic infections and are common in HIV-infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The exact mechanism underlying the HIV invasion of ocular tissues is still poorly understood.</p><p>HIV-1 transactivator Tat protein (HIV-1 Tat) plays a pivotal role in both the HIV-1 replication cycle and the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 Tat modulates the expression of several cellular genes and triggers the activation of certain signal transduction pathways and transcription factors, suggesting a complex role in HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Extensive data document the pleiotropic effects of Tat protein in many host cells, particularly in cells targeted by HIV, and these effects induce the appearance of many systemic complications of AIDS, such as, HIV-associated dementia, HIV-associated nephropathy, and HIV-associated adipose redistribution syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Despite the importance of HIV-1 Tat, few reports have examined its potential role in HIV-associated ocular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) lies between the photoreceptors of the neurosensory retina and the choroidal capillary bed, and depends on tight junctions (TJs) to forms a highly selective and regulateable barrier between the retina and choroid, called the outer blood-retina barrier (oBRB), that is responsible for the transport of nutrients and ions between photoreceptors and the choriocapillaris, and is very important for maintaining the normal vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The TJ, which is the most apical component of the junctional complex, represents the anatomic substrate of the oBRB. The composition of TJs, which has been unraveled over the past few years, is dominated by two main transmembrane proteins, occludin and claudins, which appear to be important to the tissue- and cell-specific function of TJs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>HIV-1 Tat protein can alter the expression of specific TJ proteins in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), which disturb the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and contributes to HIV trafficking into the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Recently, it was demonstrated that the transport and permeation characteristics of BBB and oBRB, which is formed by the intercellular TJs of the RPE, are surprisingly similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The RPE is also one of the cells targeted by HIV, and the junctional integrity of the RPE can be affected by many factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that HIV-1 Tat can alter the protein expression of TJs in the RPE, and thereby disturb the barrier function of oBRB, which may be one of the mechanisms for HIV-1 entry into the eyes.</p><p>The objectives of the present study were (1) to characterize the effects of HIV-1 Tat protein on the barrier function of cultured RPE cells, through transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and permeability to fluorescence sodium, (2) to determine the differential regulation of transmembrane protein expression associated with the changes in barrier function, and (3) to determine the intracellular pathways that participate in changes in RPE induced by HIV-1 Tat.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagent</title><p>Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/High Glucose (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin were purchased from Hyclone (Logan, UT).

Cells were cultured in DMEM with high glucose (4.5 g/l), containing 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 U/ml). The medium was changed every 2 days, and cells were subcultured by trypsinization every 4 days at a split of 1:5.</p></sec><sec><title>Tat protein preparation and treatment</title><p>The 86-amino acid isoform of the Tat protein was obtained from The National Institutes of Health AIDS Reagent Program (Rockville, MD). It was reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol and deaerated by bubbling with helium. The protein was stored at -80&#x000b0;C in the dark before use. The specificity of Tat-mediated effects was assessed by treating cells with heat inactivated Tat prepared by incubating the protein at over 85&#x000b0;C for 30 min. Because Tat binds strongly to serum proteins, all experiments were carried out in serum-free media. D407 cells remained healthy and viable under these experimental conditions. The Tat treatment in the present study involved exposing D407 cells exposure to 100 nM Tat for 24 hours, which has frequently been used in previous in vitro studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Cell viability assay</title><p>Cells were grown in 96-well plates at a density of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells/well.

D407 cells were seeded at a density of 10<sup>4 </sup>cells/filter on the filters was supported by 24-well culture plates. The volumes on the apical and basolateral side (inside and outside of the membrane) were 400 &#x003bc;l and 600 &#x003bc;l, respectively. The fluid pressure was the same in the two chambers.</p><p>The cultures were incubated in a humidified atmosphere (37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). The medium was changed on the following day, and subsequently changed every second day for the duration of the experiment. Phase contrast microscopy revealed that cells reached confluence at day 3, and then serum concentration of the culture medium was reduced to 1%. From 2 days after seeding, the TER was measured by an epithelial voltohmeter (EVOM, World Percision Instruments, USA) every other day to monitor the time course of the TER. We began the indicated treatments at day 10, the culture medium in control group also changed into serum free, and measured the TER at 1, 2, 3, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after exposure to 100 nM Tat.</p></sec><sec><title>Permeability assay</title><p>The paracellular permeability of RPE cells was determined by measuring the apical-to-basolateral movement of sodium fluorescein (MW: 376 Da), using a slightly modified version of the technique of Hartnett et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Briefly, to assess the fluid flux across the monolayer, sodium fluorescein mixed in DMEM (25 mg/ml sodium fluorescein) was added to the apical compartment of the inserts after the indicated treatment. 100 &#x003bc;l of fluid was collected from the basolateral compartment of each filter at 20, 40 and 60 min after adding sodium fluorescein, and then transported to 96-well black culture plates (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) to measure the fluorescence. The same volume of the appropriate medium was added to replace the medium removed. The fluorescence was measured by a multifunctional microplate reader (emission: 525 nm, excitation: 440 nm). The basolateral-to-total fluorescence ratio was determined for each group, and expressed as a percentage, with larger percentage indicating greater permeability. The fluorescence of DMEM mixed with 25 mg/ml sodium fluorescein was taken as the total fluorescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction</title><p>Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent.

Many HIV patients suffer from decreased visual acuity, which may severely affect the quality of their lives. The mechanisms of HIV-1 entry into the eyes and the subsequent destruction of the homeostasis of the intraocular microenvironment remain obscure. Since most published research about the retina of HIV patients has focused on opportunistic infections and the resulting retinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], few studies have investigated the direct effects of RPE.</p><p>There is increasing evidences of multifunctional effects of Tat that depends on the cell type and the degree of cellular maturation. We postulated that HIV-1 Tat protein could alter the expression of specific tight-junction proteins and disturb the blood retinal barrier, and contributes to HIV trafficking into the eyes.</p><p>The D407 is a spontaneously arising RPE cell line, which retains many of the metabolic and morphologic characteristics of RPE cells in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. D407 cells possess intercellular junctional complexes, and have been used to model the oBRB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We therefore used D407 cells in the present study to test the above-mentioned hypothesis.</p><p>The results from our experiments indicate that treatment with 100 nM Tat, which does not cause the cell death, disturbs the barrier function of the oBRB. In the presence of AIDS, HIV-1 Tat arriving at the choroidal capillary bed, can interact with the RPE and destroy the barrier function of oBRB. Because the choroid vasculature is fenestrated and abundant in blood, the destruction of oBRB would expose the retina to immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. We therefore suppose that HIV trafficking into the eyes is also mediated through a "Trojan horse" mechanism, in which HIV-infected circulating monocytes enter the eyes through breaches of the oBRB, as in the brain and BBB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>It has been verified that anomalies in the expression and distribution of occludin and claudins are responsible for the occurrence and development of many disease. Claudins are localized to the site of close membrane apposition within TJs. They are detected in both epithelial and endothelial cells in all tissues that contain TJs, and form a complex with occludin and junctional adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In the present study, HIV-1 Tat-induced decreases in expressions of claudin-1, 3, 4 and significant increases in claudin-2 were detected in D407 cells. They were all consistent with the decrease in the TER and the increased permeability. Although we failed to show the changes in occludin expression in the present study, we also found the decreases in expression of ZO-1 in another experiment (data not shown). Moreover the Tat-related mRNA and protein variation of claudins is relatively low, so we cannot exclude the possibility that other junctional proteins are also modulated by Tat and contribute to the observed effects on barrier function. The relationship between TJs and the oBRB during HIV infection still need to be elucidated.</p><p>It was reported that Tat can induce oxidative stress and excitotoxicity in the RPE and brain endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], indicating that oxidative stress plays a major role in the HIV-1 Tat-mediated retinal dysfunction associated with AIDS retinopathy. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>was shown to influence the expression of TJs in cultured RPE in a similar fashion as HIV-1 Tat (unpublished data). Numerous studies have suggested that HIV-1 Tat can trigger activation of redox-regulated cell signaling pathways, of which ERK MAPK could alter the composition of claudins within the TJ complex and change TJ permeability rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We further determined whether these pathways are involved in the regulation of claudins expression that was observed in the present study. Our study's results have shown clearly that the activation of ERK1/2 is important for the destruction of barrier and expression of TJs in HIV-1 Tat treated RPE. First, HIV-1 Tat has induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Second, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK-ERK inhibited HIV-1 Tat-induced changes in barrier and expression of TJs. But as the ERK1/2 activation kinetics were not studied in untreated control cells, the global effects of HIV-1 Tat on ERK1/2 activation dynamics in RPE are difficult to compare.</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B is one of the transcription factors that may be controlled by the redox status of the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Activation of NF-&#x003ba;B is controlled by a family of inhibitors. Upon stimulation, after the active complex p65/p50 of NF-&#x003ba;B is released from the inhibitor, and translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they bind target genes and stimulate transcription. Although exogenous HIV-1 Tat protein is known to activate NF-&#x003ba;B in immune cells and endothelial cells, it is not well known whether exogenous HIV-1 Tat protein is able to activate the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The results showed an increase in NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts from HIV-1 Tat treated RPE. The specific NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor, PDTC, also inhibited the changes in barrier function, expression of TJs, and the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B induced by HIV-1 Tat. These indicated that the effects of HIV-1 Tat on barrier function of RPE were NF-&#x003ba;B dependent.</p><p>Our study's results showed that both NF-&#x003ba;B and ERK1/2 MAPK were involved in the effects of HIV-1 Tat on the barrier function of RPE. Generally, NF-&#x003ba;B is not thought to be a transcription factor activated by ERK MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, several reports indicate that ERK MAPK is also an important activator of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Our study particularly shows that the NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding activity induced by HIV-1 Tat was abolished by the PD98059, a specific inhibitor of ERK. This implies that NF-&#x003ba;B acts as a downstream substrate of ERK MAPK during barrier destruction in RPE induced by HIV-1 Tat.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study is the first to provide evidence that HIV-1 Tat induced changes in the claudin composition of TJs, thereby, contributing to the destruction of the barrier function of the RPE and eventually inducing the pathogenesis of HIV-related ocular diseases. The effects of HIV-1 Tat on the barrier function of the RPE may be mediated by ERK MAPK and NF-&#x003ba;B activation, which may represent potential targets for novel therapeutic approaches for the retinopathy induced by HIV infection. But it still needs to be confirmed in human primary RPE cells or <italic>in vivo </italic>situation.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>RPE: retinal pigment epithelial cell; TER: transepithelial electrical resistance; TJs: tight junctions; oBRB: outer blood-retina barrier; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS: fetal bovine serum; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; BSA: bovine serum albumin; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; qRT-PCR: quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; PVDF: polyvinylidene difluoride; MAPK: mitogen activated protein kinase; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinases; NF-&#x003ba;B: nuclear factor kappaB; PDTC: pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Conceived and designed the experiments: ZZ, HZ.
