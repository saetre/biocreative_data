The tangles are made of a protein called tau comprising 441 residues in its longest isoform. Tau belongs to the class of natively unfolded proteins, binds to and stabilizes microtubules, and partially folds into an ordered &#x003b2;-structure during aggregation to Alzheimer paired helical filaments (PHFs). Here we show that it is possible to overcome the size limitations that have traditionally hampered detailed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies of such large nonglobular proteins. This is achieved using optimal NMR pulse sequences and matching of chemical shifts from smaller segments in a divide and conquer strategy. The methodology reveals that 441-residue tau is highly dynamic in solution with a distinct domain character and an intricate network of transient long-range contacts important for pathogenic aggregation. Moreover, the single-residue view provided by the NMR analysis reveals unique insights into the interaction of tau with microtubules. Our results establish that NMR spectroscopy can provide detailed insight into the structural polymorphism of very large nonglobular proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The Tau protein, which plays a central role in the progression of Alzheimer disease, is normally expressed in nerve axons, where it stabilizes microtubules (MTs), supports the outgrowth of axons, and modulates the transport of vesicles and organelles along MTs. In Alzheimer disease, Tau becomes excessively phosphorylated, loses its ability to bind to MTs, and aggregates into intracellular abnormal protein deposits. Many efforts have been made over the years to understand Tau structure as a way to understand Tau function and its mechanisms of action, but these efforts have primarily used traditional biochemistry and molecular biology approaches and therefore have addressed structure and function at a relatively primitive level. Here, we show that it is possible to characterize the structure and dynamics of 441-residue Tau at single residue resolution using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR spectroscopy demonstrates that 441-residue Tau is highly dynamic in solution with a distinct domain character and an intricate network of transient long-range contacts important for pathogenic aggregation. Moreover, the single-residue view provided by the NMR analysis reveals unique insights into the interaction of Tau with MTs.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals the conformations of Tau, the protein that plays a central role in the progression of Alzheimer disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Mukrasch MD, Bibow S, Korukottu J, Jeganathan S, Biernat J, et al.

These properties can be traced back to the high fraction of basic and hydrophilic amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), which resist the compact folding typical of most proteins. In fact, a number of biophysical studies revealed that tau is a prototypical &#x0201c;natively unfolded&#x0201d; protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

The primary sequence of htau40 contains two cysteines (C291 and C322) that provide convenient attachment points for the nitroxide radical (1-oxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-D-pyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate (MTSL). In addition, five different mutants, which harbour only a single cysteine in the projection domain (A15C or A72C), in the proline-rich region (A239C), or near the C terminus (A384C or A416C), were constructed and labelled with MTSL. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g007">Figure 7</xref> shows the PRE profile (ratio of NMR signal intensities in the paramagnetic and diamagnetic state) of the amide protons of htau40 for the six different MTSL-labelled htau40 samples. For a fully extended chain, the NMR signal intensities in the paramagnetic and diamagnetic state should be identical for residues that are more than ten to 15 residues away from the position of the spin label. Thus, if htau40 would be a fully extended chain most residues will show a PRE intensity ratio of one. In clear contrast, we observed for many residues far from the site of spin-labelling PRE intensity ratios below one, indicative of transient long-range contacts between the spin-label and distant areas of sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g007">Figure 7</xref>). When the spin label was attached to position 15, intensity ratios of approximately 0.8 were observed in the proline-rich domain P2 (residues 200&#x02013;240) as well as residues downstream of P2 (residues 130&#x02013;200) and residues in the repeat region up to residue 330 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). A transient long-range interaction between the N-terminal region and its central domain is further supported by the PRE profile of C239-MTSL labelled htau40, for which intensity ratios of 0.6&#x02013;0.8 were observed for residues 1&#x02013;80 and weaker broadening extended up to residue 150 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g007">Figure 7</xref>C).

Moreover, due to the <italic>r</italic><sup>&#x02212;6</sup> dependence, conformations with short intramolecular distances contribute more strongly to the PRE broadening than more extended structures. To take into account the dynamic nature of htau40 we performed both single molecule calculations, in which all distance restraints were enforced simultaneously onto a single molecule, as well as ensemble calculations in which the PRE distance restraints had to be fulfilled not by single structure but collectively by an ensemble of 30 conformations, respectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Clearly, even the 30 conformer calculations are a compromise and underestimate the number of conformations htau40 can assume in solution. Nevertheless they better reflect the ensemble nature of the PRE distances, i.e., the observed PRE broadening arises from a very large number of different conformations and each conformation only fulfils a small subset of distance restraints at any given time.

NMR dipolar couplings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g004">Figure 4</xref>) demonstrated that the functional differences are associated with strong differences in the intrinsic flexibility of the three domains. Whereas the repeat domain and its flanking proline rich regions have a lower intrinsic flexibility on a time scale in the nanosecond to microsecond range detected by dipolar couplings, which is important for formation of secondary structure, in agreement with an increased propensity to populate polyproline II or &#x003b2;-structure, residues in the projection domain as well as in the C-terminal region more rapidly interconvert between different conformations, which is detected by relaxation measurements. The differences in intrinsic mobility are associated with a decreased number of hydrophobic and increased number of negatively charged residues in the projection domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Moreover, using NMR dipolar couplings a reduced mobility in regions that harbour many proline residues had been previously observed in the C-terminal tails of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-synuclein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. Importantly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g004">Figure 4</xref> is also very suggestive of a possible folding of the N-tail and C-tail over the middle domain of tau, previously termed the paperclip model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Intricate Network of Long-Range Interactions in Soluble Tau</title><p>The appearance of tau as an elongated molecule by some EM methods &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d; suggested that the conformation in solution was extended in agreement with the natively unfolded state of tau and the accessibility to multiple kinases throughout the chain. However, evidence for global folding began to emerge from several antibodies that had discontinuous epitopes comprising residues near the N terminus and within the repeat domain (e.g., Alz-50, MC-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;). This evidence was further confirmed by FRET studies showing that tau was able to form a double hairpin, leading to a &#x0201c;paperclip&#x0201d; structure whereby both N- and C terminus were folded into the vicinity of the repeat domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. This concept is now substantially expanded and refined by the NMR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Whereas fluorescence resonance energy transfer combined with electron paramagnetic resonance requires two labels, one label acting as donor and the other one as acceptor, PRE monitored by NMR requires only a single paramagnetic centre such as MTSL attached to a free cysteine. Even more important, whereas in FRET only a single distance can be measured for each donor-acceptor pair, all nuclei in the protein serve as acceptor. Thus, a large number of intraresidual distances (&#x0003e;100) can be measured from a single MTSL-labelled sample. In this study, six uniformly distributed MTSL positions provided a total of 2,288 distance restraints. The distance restraints were integrated into a structural model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g008">Figure 8</xref>A), which shows tau in a much more compact form than previously expected from the EM images. However, the molecule is still loosely packed, highly flexible, and exchanges between a large number of conformations, consistent with large average values of the hydrodynamic radius (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g009">Figure 9</xref>A).</p><p>The C<sup>&#x003b1;</sup> contact map, which reports on transient interactions that are found in many of the calculated structures, reveals an intricate network of long-range interactions in soluble tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). In particular the hexapeptide in R3&#x02014;a residue stretch that is essential for aggregation of tau into PHFs&#x02014;is strongly involved into intramolecular contacts with both the C-terminal and N-terminal domain of tau. This includes a transient interaction with the amphiphatic C-terminal helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g007">Figures 7</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g008">8</xref>B). The second residue stretch with increased propensity for formation of an amphiphatic helix, <sup>114</sup>Leu-Thr<sup>123</sup>, interacts with the N-terminal end of I1 as well as with repeats R1 and R2. Striking is also the compaction in the N-terminal 50 residues, in the region between I2 and P1, in P1 and P2, in repeats R1 and R2, and in repeats R3 and R4. In agreement with the paper clip model proposed by FRET measurements &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, the N terminus weakly interacts with the C terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g007">Figures 7</xref>E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g007">7</xref>F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g008">8</xref>B, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000034-sg004">S4</xref>). Interestingly, the proline rich region P2 has many contacts with distant areas of the sequence, such as R1, R2, R4, and the amphiphatic helix at the C terminus, suggesting that phosphorylation of residues in P2 may modify the ensemble of tau conformations, thereby promoting or delaying aggregation into PHFs. Moreover, the intramolecular interactions between its repeat and proline-rich regions might prime the tau protein for MT binding &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Single-Residue Definition of the Hot Spots of the Tau-MT Interaction</title><p>The MAP tau is a critical regulator of diverse MT functions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;.

Despite the fact that tau molecules are invisible to solution-state NMR when they are bound to MTs owing to the high molecular weight of the complex, information about the residues of tau that are important for binding to MTs can be obtained when the exchange between the fully bound form and the free state is sufficiently fast. In this case, the observed NMR signals will be an average of the resonances originating from the unbound and bound forms of tau, causing changes in NMR signal position and intensity. The strength of these changes will depend on the conformation and chemical environment in the bound state and the concentration of the bound species.

Moreover, the flexible structure may allow tau to be easily displaced from the MT lattice, consistent with the rapid diffusion of tau in neurons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><fig id="pbio-1000034-g011" position="float"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><title>Comparison of MT-Binding Profile with Hydrophobicity Pattern of Tau</title><p>(A) NMR signal intensity ratios between signals observed for htau40 in the MT-bound and in the free state (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g010">Figure 10</xref>B) are shown as stars and connected by lines.

However, in contrast to the proline-rich region P1 and repeats R1, R2, and R3, no clear minimum in NMR signal intensities was observed in repeat R4, indicating that R4 may not be very important to the interaction between tau and MTs. This observation is in agreement with biochemical studies that suggested a core-MT binding domain comprising the N-terminal side of the repeat region &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. On the other hand, it is in contrast to the view that tau possesses multiple independent tubulin-binding sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. As far as the projection domain is concerned, significant chemical shift changes were observed for residues in insert I2 and in the region with helical propensity (<sup>114</sup>Leu-Thr<sup>123</sup>), consistent with the finding that the projection domain regulates the spacing of MTs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Little is known about the nature of the cognate tau binding sites in tubulin. Based on digestion experiments it is believed that tau binds to the acidic carboxyl tail of tubulin, which is supposed to be exposed on the surface of MTs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, mutational analysis pointed to the importance of positively charged lysine residues (K<sup>274</sup>, K<sup>280</sup>, K<sup>281</sup>) in tau for MT-binding, suggesting that electrostatic interactions are important for the tau-MT binding &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. On the other hand, the homologues region in R1 contains only a single positively charged residue (K<sup>254</sup>) at the edge of the most affected residue stretch, but does contain a negatively charged residue (D<sup>252</sup>). Similarly, the hot spots of MT-binding in R2 and R3 also contain a negative charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g001">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g011">11</xref>), suggesting that the tau-MT interaction might be more complex. Indeed, there is a striking correlation between the NMR-based MT-interaction profile and the hydrophobicity pattern of tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g011">Figure 11</xref>A). The 13-residue stretch in R3 (<sup>306</sup>VQIVYKPVDLSKV<sup>318</sup>), which shows the strongest chemical exchange contribution in the presence of MTs, is the most hydrophobic region of 441-residue tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g011">Figure 11</xref>C). Consistent with the importance of hydrophobic interactions, substitution of the tyrosine residue in this residue stretch by an asparagine (Y310-&#x0003e;N) reduced the MT affinity of tau &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. Maxima are also found in the hydrophobicity profile for the other three hot spots of MT-interaction (<sup>225</sup>KVAVVRT<sup>231</sup>, <sup>245</sup>TAPVPMPDL<sup>253</sup>, <sup>275</sup>VQIINKKLDLSNV<sup>287</sup>), whereas the homologous region in repeat R4 only has a few hydrophobic residues but has many charged residues, and is less affected by the presence of MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g011">Figure 11</xref>C). Further support for the importance of hydrophobic interactions for formation of the tau-MT complex comes from the MT-binding site in P2: <sup>225</sup>KVAVVRT<sup>231</sup> is the most hydrophobic residue stretch in the proline-rich regions P1 and P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g011">Figure 11</xref>B). Taken together, the NMR and biochemical data suggest a complex mechanism of tau-MT interaction involving both electrostatic and hydrophobic contacts.</p><p>Over 30 phosphorylation sites have been identified in tau, many of which are elevated in AD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;. Prominent sites are located in the flanking domains, e.g., S<sup>199</sup>, S<sup>202</sup>, T<sup>205</sup>, T<sup>212</sup>, S<sup>214</sup>, T<sup>231</sup>, S<sup>235</sup> before the repeats, S<sup>396</sup>, S<sup>404</sup>, S<sup>422</sup>, and others after the repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g011">Figures 11</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000034-g011">11</xref>C). The major sites within the repeats are located in the KXGS motifs, i.e., S<sup>262</sup>, S<sup>293</sup>, S<sup>324</sup>, and S<sup>356</sup>. These sites are phosphorylated by the kinase MARK, which results in the detachment of tau from MTs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, S<sup>262</sup>, S<sup>293</sup>, S<sup>324</sup>, and S<sup>356</sup> are not part of the hot spots of MT-interaction, suggesting that phosphorylation at these sites might inhibit MT-binding by long-range electrostatic interactions. Alternatively, or in combination, phosphorylation can induce conformational changes that are incompatible with MT-binding. On the other hand, T<sup>231</sup> is right in the middle of the MT-binding region in the proline-rich domain P2, making even a steric inhibition of MT-binding possible. Another potential mechanism is stabilization of a polyproline II helix by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of residues within the fragments <sup>216</sup>PTPPTREP<sup>223</sup> and <sup>232</sup>PPKSPSSA<sup>239</sup> might stabilize their nascent polyproline II helical propensity, such that the resulting conformation is no longer able to efficiently bind to MTs.</p><p>Why would a natively unfolded protein evolve to stabilize axonal MTs? To consider this, we note that MTs bind a variety of proteins, some of which are natively unfolded (e.g., the tau-MAP2-MAP4 family), but others are typical well-folded molecules. Two cases in point are kinesin and doublecortin, both of which bind to the MT surface in a periodic and well-defined fashion. By contrast, the MAPs are rather diffusely distributed over the MT surface, there is little detectable periodicity, the MAPs bind relatively weakly, and they diffuse rapidly off MTs and along them &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;. To complicate matters further, binding of MAPs involves the C-terminal tails of tubulin subunits, which are themselves natively unfolded &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;. Not surprisingly, much of the N- and C-terminal domains of tau are highly flexible even when the repeat domain is attached to MTs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Several explanations have been invoked to explain the functions of unfolded proteins such as MAPs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;: They can act as entropic bristles to keep the spacing between MTs and other cell components (and indeed large MAPs keep larger spacings than small MAPs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;); serve as assemblers for multisubunit structures (e.g., to pre-assemble tubulin into oligomers for incorporation into MT); serve as docking sites for enzymes (e.g., kinases and phosphatases for the case of MT-bound MAPs); and may even have regulatory functions for MT-related functions (e.g., interaction with motor proteins of axonal transport &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000034-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d;). Thus, the multiplicity of functions would correspond to a multiplicity of conformations. Many of the above functions are inferred from biochemical evidence without detailed knowledge of the responsible residues and conformations of tau. The identification of residues reported here will provide a basis for future experiments to clarify the interactions of tau with interaction partners in cells, and hopefully the changes that occur during neurodegenerative tauopathies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Disordered protein statistics.</title><p>Assignments of disordered proteins (IDPs) resolved by other groups with the corresponding protein size were found either in the BMRB databank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/">http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/</ext-link>) or in publications listed in the PubMed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/</ext-link>) databank.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Assembly of MTs.</title><p>Porcine brain tubulin was purified and incubated at concentrations higher than 200 M in MT assembly buffer (100 mM Pipes, &#x0005b;pH 6.9&#x0005d;, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM dithiothreitol) in the presence of 1 mM GTP at 37 &#x000b0;C for 5 min.
