This analysis reveals target genes at a genome-wide scale and uncovers combinatorial control by Atf21p and Atf31p. We also studied two transcription factors not previously implicated in sexual differentiation whose meiotic induction depended on Mei4p: Rsv2p induces stress-related genes during spore formation, while Rsv1p represses glucose-metabolism genes.

Diploid cells of the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe </italic>undergo two meiotic nuclear divisions to produce four stress-resistant spores in response to environmental stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This sexual differentiation is accompanied and driven by an extensive gene expression program, during which a large proportion of all genes are either induced or repressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We have previously classified the genes that are up-regulated at least four-fold into four major clusters, which represent successive expression waves coinciding with the main biological events of the differentiation process: genes induced in response to environmental changes (starvation and pheromone-induced genes), early genes (pre-meiotic S phase and recombination), middle genes (meiotic divisions and early steps of spore formation), and late genes (spore maturation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Posttranscriptional control is involved in regulating mRNA levels during meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, transcriptional control is of fundamental importance for sexual differentiation, and several transcription factors are essential for successful meiosis and spore formation. A subset of the genes induced in response to nutritional changes is controlled by the transcription factor Ste11p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], while some early genes are under the control of the Rep1p transcriptional regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The forkhead-family protein Mei4p controls the expression of several middle genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors Atf21p and Atf31p control a subset of late genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It is not known, however, if other transcription factors are involved in this process, and how the activity of the different factors is regulated and coordinated to bring about the orderly succession of transcriptional waves.</p><p>Here, we investigate the regulation of meiotic genes by examining the transcriptome of cells deleted for or overexpressing genes encoding transcription factors whose expression is induced during sexual differentiation. Our data highlight the importance of combinatorial control in transcriptional regulation and indicate that the progression of the gene expression waves is achieved by transcriptional cascades and feedback interactions between transcription factors. We also identify two new transcriptional regulators involved in controlling late genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Rep1p activates a subset of the early genes</title><p>The Rep1p transcription factor is involved in the regulation of several early genes required for premeiotic S phase and meiotic recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, the expression of some early genes is independent of Rep1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To better understand the role of Rep1p, we sought to systematically identify its target genes by using DNA microarrays to follow gene expression in <italic>rep1&#x00394; </italic>mutant cells undergoing meiosis.</p><p>Because good synchrony is important to obtain gene expression profiles of high temporal resolution, we used cells carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the meiotic inhibitor Pat1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We arrested cells in G1 by removing the nitrogen source from the medium and induced meiosis by shifting the cells to the restrictive temperature. Although <italic>pat1</italic>-induced meiosis is not identical to wild-type meiosis in some respects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], we have previously shown that the gene expression of early, middle, and late genes is similar in both types of experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Deletion of <italic>rep1 </italic>had complex effects on the expression of early genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). About 47% of early genes were not fully induced in <italic>rep1&#x00394; </italic>cells (full induction was defined as an increase within two-fold of that of wild-type cells at every time point between 1 and 3 hours; see Additional data file for complete lists of Rep1p-dependent and Rep1p-independent genes). However, the effects of <italic>rep1&#x00394; </italic>on gene expression were varied, with some genes being partially induced but often in a delayed fashion compared to wild type. Rep1p-dependent and Rep1p-independent genes showed no clear functional distinction. Both groups were significantly enriched in genes involved in meiotic recombination and meiosis I (GO: 0007131 and GO: 0007127, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6</sup>), while Rep1p-dependent genes were uniquely enriched in genes involved in the mitotic cell-cycle (GO: 0000279, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-13</sup>). Control of gene expression during early meiosis involves several transcription factors that also function during the mitotic cell-cycle (Cdc10p, Res2p and Rep2p), which are likely to cooperate with Rep1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The large fraction of genes whose expression seems to be independent of Rep1p suggests that additional transcription factors are important for the control of the early genes.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Meiotic gene expression program in <italic>rep1&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>mei4&#x00394; </italic>mutants. <bold>(a) </bold>Left: hierarchical cluster analysis with columns representing experimental time points and rows representing early genes.

It is unclear, however, whether all middle genes are regulated by Mei4p or whether additional transcription factors are involved in their induction. To address this question, we used DNA microarrays to systematically identify Mei4p targets. A dual strategy was applied: first, we compared meiotic time courses of <italic>mei4&#x00394; </italic>cells with wild-type cells; and second, we studied the effect of Mei4p overproduction in vegetative cells.</p><p>While deletion of <italic>mei4 </italic>did not impair the up-regulation of starvation-induced or early genes, the induction of almost all middle and late genes was strongly affected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b,c</xref>). Lists of Mei4p-independent and Mei4p-dependent middle genes are presented in Additional data file 9 (Mei4p dependency was defined as an induction at least two-fold lower than that of wild-type cells at any time point between 3 and 7 hours). It is likely that the effect on late genes is indirect, as the expression of some transcription factors regulating late genes is dependent on Mei4p(see below). To distinguish between direct and indirect effects, we took advantage of the finding that overproduction of Mei4p leads to induction of its targets even in vegetative cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We cloned the <italic>mei4 </italic>gene under the control of the regulatable <italic>nmt1 </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and overexpressed <italic>mei4 </italic>in vegetative cells, in which endogenous <italic>mei4 </italic>mRNA is almost absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Mei4p-overproducing cells looked normal 18 hours after induction of the <italic>nmt1 </italic>promoter (the time point used for microarray analysis). At later time points (24 hours), they appeared smaller than wild-type cells and many cells had lysed. A total of 454 genes were induced at least two-fold following induction of <italic>mei4 </italic>expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). This group consisted mostly of middle genes (306), as well 35 genes of the nitrogen response, 19 early genes, and 13 late genes. The remaining genes had not been classified in the original study because they did not pass the four-fold cut-off for gene expression changes relative to vegetative cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The Mei4p-induced genes included 55% of all middle genes, but only 16% of the nitrogen response genes, 19% of the early genes, and 9% of the late genes. We noticed that many non-middle genes induced by Mei4p overproduction had complex expression profiles, with several peaks of expression or unusually broad peaks (data not shown). The regulation of these genes is probably under the control of several transcription factors, with Mei4p being responsible for their expression at the time of the meiotic divisions. Of the remaining 81 genes that were induced by Mei4p overproduction but had not been classified, 36 depended on Mei4p for their full induction (as defined above for the <italic>mei4</italic>&#x00394; time course; Additional data file 6). Several of the latter showed middle gene-like expression profiles. It is also possible that Mei4p overproduction leads to the artifactual induction of targets of other forkhead transcription factors (Sep1p and Fkh2p) that normally control the periodic expression of a subset of cell cycle-regulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We looked at whether the expression of periodic genes in cluster 1 (which is enriched in Sep1p targets and forkhead-binding sequences) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] was increased in Mei4p-overproducing cells. The expression of 35 genes of this cluster (out of 94) was induced by Mei4p overproduction. However, 29 of these 35 had been classified as middle genes. Similarly, 9 out of 41 Sep1p-dependent periodic targets were induced by Mei4p overexpression, but 8 of them are also middle genes. Therefore, it seems unlikely that Mei4p induces the ectopic expression of Sep1p targets.</p><p>Together, the results are consistent with the view that Mei4pdirectly controls the expression of most middle genes, and that the low expression of late genes in a <italic>mei4 </italic>mutant is an indirect effect. Given that some middle genes (220 out of the 504 Mei4p-dependent middle genes) are not induced by Mei4p overproduction, we cannot rule out the existence of a second factor that activates the expression of middle genes. However, because the expression of almost all middle genes is reduced in a <italic>mei4&#x00394; </italic>strain (504 out of 549 show at least a two-fold reduction in induction; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>), we believe this possibility to be unlikely. The strong induction of at least some middle genes, however, may be supported by posttranscriptional mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Control of late genes by Atf21p and Atf31p</title><p>We have previously shown that deletion of either <italic>atf21 </italic>or <italic>atf31 </italic>affects the expression of approximately 55% of the late genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. To better understand how these transcription factors function, we overexpressed them in vegetative cells, where they are normally present at low levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Overproduction of Atf21p resulted in the induction of approximately 25 genes, some of them related to stress processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>, and a complete list is in Additional data file 7). When we took samples for microarray analysis (18 hours after induction of the <italic>nmt1 </italic>promoter), Atf21p-overproducing cells appeared slightly elongated. At later time points (24 hours), most cells were highly elongated and contained one or more septa (data not shown). Overproduction of Atf31p resulted in the induction of approximately 12 genes, many of which are also induced in response to heat shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, and a complete list is in Additional data file 7). Note that heat-shock related genes show a highly specific expression pattern during <italic>pat1-</italic>induced meiosis, with a sharp induction following the initial temperature shift and a quick down-regulation after the meiotic divisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Despite this finding, <italic>atf31&#x00394; </italic>cells respond normally to heat shock (JM, AW and JB, unpublished observation). Atf31p-overproducing cells appeared normal after 18 hours of induction but became elongated after 24 hours (data not shown). However, neither group of genes induced by Atf21p or Atf31p overexpression showed any large overlap with the potential meiotic targets of Atf21p/Atf31p that we have previously identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a,b</xref>, left panels).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Atf21p and Atf31p cooperate to induce expression of meiotic genes.

The Venn diagrams on the left show the overlaps between genes induced by overproduction of the different transcription factors (OE) and potential meiotic Atf21p target genes (obtained by analysis of <italic>atf21&#x00394; </italic>cells [4]). The numbers in brackets show the overlap between the two lists expected by chance given the sizes of the gene sets considered and the total number of genes. The overlap between Atf31p-induced genes and meiotic Atf21p targets is not significant, while the overlaps between Atf21p and Atf21p/Atf31p-induced genes and Atf21p targets are both significant (<italic>P </italic>= 2.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3 </sup>and 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-62</sup>, respectively; note, however, that only four Atf21p targets are induced by Atf21p overexpression). The panels on the right show the meiotic expression profiles of genes induced by the overproduction of the corresponding transcription factors (<italic>pat1-</italic>synchronized cells from [4], experiment and labeling as in Figure 1). The profiles of <italic>atf21 </italic>and <italic>atf31 </italic>are highlighted in blue and green, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2007-8-10-r217-2"/></fig><p>We then simultaneously overexpressed both Atf21p and Atf31p. This caused a phenotype similar to that of cells overproducing Atf21p alone, but led to much stronger gene expression changes (325 genes induced at least two-fold), which also showed a highly significant enrichment in the meiotic targets of Atf21p/Atf31p (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>, and a complete list is in Additional data file 7). Many of the genes that were induced show expression profiles typical of late genes, but had not previously been defined as Atf21p/Atf31p targets (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>, left). There are two reasons for this difference. First, the definition of Atf21p/Atf31p targets was based on experiments using asynchronous cells, which are less sensitive. Most of the genes not originally defined as Atf21p/Atf31p targets, however, were expressed at slightly lower levels in <italic>atf21&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>atf31&#x00394; </italic>cells (mean expression ratios of 0.8 and 0.91, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Second, the four-fold cut-off relative to vegetative cells that we used in the original study means that many of these genes were excluded from the analysis. Therefore, the real number of Atf21p/Atf31p targets is probably considerably higher than the conservative estimate from our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>This experiment suggests that Atf21p and Atf31p cooperate to induce the expression of late genes during meiosis, probably by forming a heterodimer. These results highlight the importance of combinatorial control in the regulation of transcriptional programs. The fission yeast genome encodes three additional bZIP family transcription factors besides Atf21p and Atf31p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These transcription factors can work as homodimers or heterodimers, creating numerous regulatory possibilities. It is likely that control by different combinations of bZIP transcription factors is used by fission yeast to launch specific gene expression programs in response to different environmental or developmental conditions. Combinatorial control by bZIP transcription factors is well known from studies in other organisms (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title>Two novel transcription factors regulate the induction of late genes</title><p>The expression of many late genes is independent of the Atf21p/Atf31p system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. We have previously reported that several genes that potentially encode transcription factors are specifically induced at various stages of sexual differentiation, including spore formation, raising the possibility that some of these factors regulate the expression of late genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>We explored the function of <italic>rsv1 </italic>and <italic>rsv2</italic>, encoding potential transcription factors with C2H2-type zinc fingers that are induced in middle/late meiosis (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). Rsv1p has previously been reported to be required for maintaining viability in stationary phase cells; in particular, Rsv1p is required to prevent the loss of viability associated with glucose depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Rsv2p has a similar function during stationary phase (L L&#x000f3;pez-Maury, personal communication) and during nitrogen depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].

For this experiment, we used homothallic haploid cells without <italic>pat1 </italic>mutation, which mate to form diploid cells before undergoing sexual differentiation. Because sexual differentiation is less synchronous in these wild-type cells, different meiotic stages can be studied in a single sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Despite the relative lack of synchrony, these experiments are highly reproducible: only 1.3% and 1.4% of the genes showed differences of more than 2-fold between two independent biological replicates of <italic>rsv2 </italic>and <italic>rsv1 </italic>experiments, respectively. Most genes were expressed at similar levels in wild-type and <italic>rsv2&#x00394; </italic>cells, showing that meiotic progression and gene expression were not disrupted. However, 39 genes were expressed at lower levels in <italic>rsv2&#x00394; </italic>mutants compared to wild-type cells (reduced at least two-fold in two independent repeats; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>, and a complete list of genes is in Additional data file 11). Of these genes, 18 had been classified as late genes, and most of the additional 21 genes also showed a late peak of expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). The latter genes have not been classified as late genes, either because they did not pass the threshold of induction used for the classification, or because they had complex expression patterns containing multiple peaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A large fraction of the potential Rsv2p targets (17/39) are also induced in several different stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We conclude that Rsv2p activates the expression of a subset of genes during late meiosis and may contribute to the acquisition of stress resistance by the spore. No obvious regulatory motifs were significantly enriched in the promoters of Rsv2-regulated genes.</p><p>Deletion of <italic>rsv1 </italic>did not cause major changes in gene expression, indicating that meiotic progression and gene expression were normal in the mutant. However, a group of 24 genes were consistently expressed at higher levels compared to wild-type cells (increased at least two-fold in two independent repeats; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref> and Additional data file 10 for a complete list of genes). This finding suggests that Rsv1p acts as a transcriptional repressor. Many of the induced genes are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including genes for an inducer of gluconate transport (<italic>gti1</italic>), four hexose transporters (<italic>ght1</italic>, <italic>ght3</italic>, <italic>ght4</italic>, and <italic>ght8</italic>), a hexokinase (<italic>hsx2</italic>), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (<italic>SPB660.16</italic>), and a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (<italic>SPCC794.01c</italic>). The promoters of these genes were enriched in several GC-rich motifs, which might define Rsv1p-binding sites (see Table 1 in Additional data file 5). The potential Rsv1p target genes showed a variety of expression profiles during sexual differentiation in wild-type cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>), but seven of them were early genes, including six genes related to glucose metabolism. Rsv1p is similar to proteins of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>MIP1 family, which includes several transcription factors involved in glucose-repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Our data show that late genes are induced by at least two separate transcription factor systems (Rsv2p and Atf21p/Atf31p). Some late genes appear to be independent of both Atf21p/Atf31p and Rsv2p, suggesting that yet other transcription factors are required to activate their expression. However, because our data on Atf21p/Atf31p and Rsv2p targets are based on single time point experiments (which are somewhat less sensitive than time courses), it is possible that all late genes are regulated by these transcription factors and that we have failed to detect a dependency. It is also possible that some mRNAs of late genes are regulated exclusively at the posttranscriptional level.</p><p>Regulation by the Atf21p/Atf31p heterodimer appears to be specific for sexual differentiation, while Rsv1p and Rsv2p are used by the cells during both stationary phase and sexual differentiation. Indeed, Rsv1p and Rsv2p appear to regulate related sets of genes during meiosis and stationary phase (JM and JB, unpublished observations). Fission yeast cells thus use the same transcription factors to produce similar physiological responses (quiescence and resistance to environmental stress) in different situations (starvation and differentiation).</p></sec><sec><title>Coordination of the meiotic transcriptional program</title><p>The middle genes include several putative transcriptional regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], suggesting a simple model in which expression of Mei4p induces the expression of other transcription factors that, in turn, regulate the late genes. To test this hypothesis, we checked whether the expression of <italic>atf21</italic>, <italic>atf31</italic>, <italic>rsv1 </italic>and <italic>rsv2 </italic>was dependent on Mei4p. The <italic>atf21</italic>, <italic>atf31</italic> and <italic>rsv1 </italic>transcripts were not fully induced in the absence of Mei4p, although <italic>atf21 </italic>and <italic>rsv1 </italic>showed a small increase in <italic>mei4&#x00394; </italic>cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a&#x02013;c</xref>). This finding raises the possibility of a two-step activation system, in which only the second step is dependent on Mei4p. The expression of <italic>rsv2</italic>, on the other hand, is reduced in <italic>mei4&#x00394; </italic>cells at late time points (7 hours; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>), and slightly induced when <italic>mei4 </italic>is overexpressed (2.1-fold; data not shown). Therefore, it is possible that its expression in late meiosis is at least partly under the control of Mei4p.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Transcription factor genes regulated by Mei4p.

We found that the reduction in the levels of early genes that normally coincides with the induction of the middle genes did not occur in <italic>mei4&#x00394; </italic>mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b,c</xref>). This effect has been previously observed for a small number of recombination genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We conclude that in addition to its role in up-regulating middle genes, Mei4p is necessary to switch off the early gene expression wave. This function may be indirect, as we did not observe a down-regulation of early genes when Mei4p is overproduced. The finding that the negative regulator Rsv1p seems to be a Mei4p target (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>) raises the possibility that Mei4p represses the expression of some early genes via Rsv1p. However, the inactivation of other early genes, including those involved in meiotic recombination, appears to proceed through a different, yet unknown, mechanism.</p><p>Similarly, we noticed that Rep1p, which is involved in the activation of a subset of early genes, is specifically required for the down-regulation of some of the genes induced in response to nitrogen starvation and pheromone signaling following entry into meiosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a,b</xref>). This effect is specific to the 'delayed' genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], which are enriched in Ste11p targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], while the down-regulation of other genes induced by nitrogen starvation is unaffected or even stronger in a <italic>rep1&#x00394; </italic>mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a,b</xref>). Although gene expression in wild-type and <italic>pat1-</italic>induced meiosis is similar for early, middle and late genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], the conditions used to trigger synchronous meiosis in <italic>pat1 </italic>mutants can affect the expression of genes induced by nitrogen starvation. To rule out the possibility that the effects on the expression of delayed genes were an artifact, we checked whether <italic>rep1&#x00394; </italic>mutants had a similar behavior in wild-type meiosis using homothallic cells. Indeed, 'delayed' genes were expressed at higher levels in <italic>rep1&#x00394; </italic>mutants compared to wild-type cells, while 'transient' genes were not affected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Rep1p is required to down-regulate a subset of nitrogen starvation-induced genes. <bold>(a) </bold>Average expression profiles in wild-type (<italic>pat1-</italic>synchronized cells from [4]) and <italic>rep1&#x00394; </italic>cells of two subclusters of genes induced in response to nitrogen starvation: delayed (blue) and transient (red), as defined by [4]. <bold>(b) </bold>Hierarchical cluster analysis of the two gene clusters shown in (a), with columns representing experimental time points and rows representing genes.

Five of these factors work as transcriptional activators, while one of them (Rsv1p) is a transcriptional repressor. In addition to a global identification of potential target genes, our results give insight into regulatory circuits that coordinate different transcriptional waves of this complex gene expression program. Two main principles are highlighted by this work (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). First, dependence between transcriptional waves is achieved by positive and negative interactions between transcription factors. Rep1p, which is transcriptionally induced by the master regulator for the pheromone response Ste11p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], activates the expression of early genes but is also essential for the repression of pheromone-response genes. Similarly, Mei4p activates the expression of middle genes and is also essential for the repression of the early genes, and for the induction of genes encoding transcription factors that in turn activate the expression of late genes. These dependencies between transcription factors ensure the ordered, uni-directional succession of transcriptional waves. Second, the importance of combinatorial control: overexpression of Atf21p, Atf31p, or Atf21p/Atf31p leads to the activation of unique sets of targets. The use of different combinations of transcription factors enhances the regulatory options of cells to express specific gene sets in response to a variety of situations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast methods and experimental design</title><p>Induction of meiosis using <italic>pat1 </italic>mutations was carried out exactly as in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].
