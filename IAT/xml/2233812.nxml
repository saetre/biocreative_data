Unpublished observations have shown that HO-1 is induced after the infusion of ozonated blood into the respective donors, and many other experimental observations have demonstrated the efficacy of oxidizing agents. It appeared worthwhile to evaluate whether we could better define the activity of potential inducers such as hydrogen peroxide and ozonated human plasma. Human vascular endothelial cells at confluence were challenged with different concentrations of these inducers and the simultaneous production of nitric oxide (NO); and HO-1 was measured by either measuring nitrite, or bilirubin formation, or/and the immune reactivity of the protein by Western blot using a rabbit antihuman HO-1 and Hsp-70. The results show that production of both NO and HO-1 is fairly dose dependent but is particularly elevated using human plasma after transient exposure to a medium ozone concentration. At this concentration, there is also induction of Hsp-70. The results clarify another positive effect achievable by the use of ozone therapy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="section" id="sec1"><title>1. INTRODUCTION</title><p>Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been defined as a cellular Hercules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] because of its potent and pleiotropic biological activities. After Tenhunen et al., in 1972, published the first report describing the enzymatic degradation of heme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], the interest in this enzyme has grown exponentially and to our knowledge, today there are almost 4000 publications on this topic. The induction of HO-1, mainly considered a generalized response to oxidative stress, results in an increased formation of carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin while redox-active iron is rapidly and safely sequestered by the simultaneous coinduction of ferritin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Amazingly, bilirubin, thought to be always a useless and possibly a toxic molecule, has revealed to be an excellent lipophilic antioxidant, far more effective than reduced glutathione [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. CO, a well-known deadly gas molecule, when released in trace amounts, appears to be cytoprotective because of its cyclic-GMP-mediated modulation of vascular tone and neurotransmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus, it is not surprising that HO-1 has been shown to prevent or improve pathological states associated with cardiomyopathy, chronic limb ischemia, hypertension, endotoxemia, organ transplantation, chronic infections, pulmonary diseases, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In all of these cases, the initial etiological cause is perpetuated by a chronic oxidative stress that tends to accelerate the progression of the disease. Orthodox medicine has several valid drugs that, rather than &#x0201c;curing&#x0201d; the disease, aim to stabilize it. A supplemental administration of antioxidants is harmless, but it is of little help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] because the main problem is the intracellular unbalance between an excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), peroxidation products, and proinflammatory cytokines in front of the reduced efficiency of the antioxidant system.</p><p>During the last decade, our biological and clinical work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] has shown that a judiciously performed ozone therapy in still responsive patients is able to correct this abnormal situation by upregulating antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, GSH-peroxidases, reductases and transferases, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This result, firstly demonstrated for SOD in 1996 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], is due to the repetition of small and acute oxidative stresses induced by precise doses of well-calibrated ozone against the potent antioxidant capacity of human blood. This process, now universally present from bacteria to fungi, plants, and mammals, has been defined as an adaptation to acute oxidative stresses or oxidative preconditioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Moreover, this apparently paradoxical biological effect has been postulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] to be supported by the simultaneous induction of HO-1 because this enzyme is induced by hydrogen peroxide (<chem-struct>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></chem-struct>), ultraviolet radiation, ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and by heme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. During the few minutes of ozonation of human blood ex vivo; ozone dissolves in the plasmatic water and generates messengers such as <chem-struct>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></chem-struct> and lipid oxidation products (LOPs) which, after the prompt reinfusion of the ozonated blood in the donor, are responsible of the several biological effects, of which an important one is the upregulation of the antioxidant system intuitively explained as a defensive reaction.</p><p>Owing to the fact that ozone therapy, besides behaving as a calculated acute oxidative stress, favors the release of a small amount of hemoglobin, it appears reasonable to envisage the subsequent induction of HO-1 in the donor patient. On this basis, we have performed the following preliminary study to ascertain whether potential HO-1 inducers can stimulate the synthesis of this enzyme in human endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2.

Collection of human blood and plasma samples</title><p>Blood samples were taken from one of us in the morning by using calciparin (20&#x02009;U/mL blood) as an anticoagulant. Each blood sample of 20.0&#x02009;mL, contained in a 50&#x02009;mL syringe, was immediately treated with the gas mixture composed of a volume of 20.0&#x02009;mL of a gas mixture composed of <chem-struct>O<sub>2</sub></chem-struct>(<italic>&#x0223c;</italic>96%) and <chem-struct>O<sub>3</sub></chem-struct>(<italic>&#x0223c;</italic>4%), at the ozone concentrations indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. The gas withdrawn in a 20&#x02009;mL syringe was introduced into the 50&#x02009;mL syringe containing the blood sample via a multidirectional stopcock. We have previously determined that a rapid rotation of the syringe along its longitudinal axis (about 80&#x02009;cycles/min) for one minute achieved a complete mixing of the liquid-gas phases with minimal foaming and that, within this period of time, ozone reacts completely with substrates, implying that blood samples receiving ozone react with the ozone dose totally. The <chem-struct>pO<sub>2</sub></chem-struct> reached a value of about 400&#x02009;mm Hg, while the blood <chem-struct>pCO<sub>2</sub></chem-struct> and pH values did not change.

The final gas pressure remained at normal atmospheric pressure. Control sample received only oxygen. Immediately after either the oxygenated or the ozonated samples were centrifuged at 3500&#x02009;g for 7&#x02009;minutes, the separated plasma was promptly distributed in cell culture dishes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="subsec2.4"><title>2.4.

After 18-hour incubation, NO was measured in the culture supernatants while the supernatants obtained from the cell layers after undergoing the enzyme extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] were incubated for one hour for measuring the generation of bilirubin. <chem-struct>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></chem-struct> induces both NO and HO-1, indirectly measured by the production of bilirubin. As it has been previously observed (23, 25), there is a good relationship between NO and HO-1: addition of L-arginine (20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M) enhances the production of NO and of HO-1, while the NO-synthase inhibitor L-NAME (20&#x02009;mM) strongly depresses the release of the messenger and of the enzyme. Without L-arginine, a concentration of 40&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL is more effective than the higher concentration of 80&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL.

DISCUSSION</title><p>Since Maines' extensive review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] on the heme oxygenase system, its antioxidant and cytoprotective activities have been amply demonstrated in a variety of pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It is well recognized that HO-1 is induced during oxidative stress due to superoxide , hydroxyl radicals, hypoclorous acid, singlet oxygen, and peroxyl radicals. Furthermore, Motterlini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] have clarified that NO and NO-releasing compounds modulate the activity of HO-1. All of these contributions have been important in explaining why some drugs are able to produce anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects most likely due to HO-1.</p><p>For a long time, we have been involved in clarifying the biological and therapeutic effects of ozone therapy, that in the classical form, consists in exposing for a few minutes a volume (100&#x02013;225&#x02009;mL) of human blood to a mixture of oxygen-ozone where the latter gas is only 2&#x02013;4%. However, its extremely high reactivity causes an acute oxidative stress that activates a number of biochemical pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] without any deleterious action on HO-1 blood cells, because the ozone dose is perfectly calibrated against the potent antioxidant capacity of plasma and erythrocytes. While we have shown already the induction of antioxidant enzymes, it remains to demonstrate the production of HO-1. Ozone dissolves in the water of plasma and instantaneously reacts with unsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants and in doing so, disappears but generates <chem-struct>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></chem-struct>, a variety of alkenals, and a trace of hemoglobin from no more than 0,7% of the erythrocyte mass. The evaluation of the ozonated plasma has shown the consistency of the ozonation process, particularly in the therapeutic range of 0.42&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/mL (20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL ozone per mL of plasma) up to 1.68&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/ mL (80&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL ozone).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>, we compared the production of NO and HO-1, assessed as bilirubin, because it has been previously ascertained a consequential effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We have confirmed this relationship except for the highest ozone dose (1.68&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/mL) and when the inhibitor of NO synthase was present. Moreover, the optimal induction of HO-1 depends very much from the dose ; in fact, <chem-struct>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></chem-struct> at concentrations of 100 and 200&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL (data not shown) and 4-hydroxynonenal at a concentration of 10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M have inhibited the induction because they are most likely cytotoxic. It remains unclear why in this experiment heme inhibited the induction of both Hsp-70 and HO-1. Nonetheless, it appears evident, as we have observed also for the induction of antioxidant enzymes, that the optimal induction of HO-1 and Hsp-70, at least in vitro, is achieved by using the medium ozone therapeutic dose (0.84&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/mL or 40&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL gas per mL of blood). The biochemical data are consistent with the Western blot analysis and show that both HO-1 and Hsp-70 may play important protective functions in adaptive responses to oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In addition, the adaptation to oxidative stress induced by <chem-struct>O<sub>3</sub></chem-struct> treatment has been also shown in animal studies by Zamora et al. and by Ajamieh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. This result agrees well with the clinical data because the best therapeutic results have been obtained by starting with low dose up to medium dose.</p><p>A final useful comment is that the induction of HO-1 surprisingly has been obtained by administering simvastatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], rosuvastatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], aspirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and curcumin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], suggesting the protective activity of this enzyme with other drugs.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref
