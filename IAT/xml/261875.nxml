Proteins required for this pathway include Rad17, Rad9, Hus1, Rad1, and Rfc-2, Rfc-3, Rfc-4, and Rfc-5. The heteropentamer replication factor C (RFC) loads during DNA replication the homotrimer proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) polymerase clamp onto DNA. Sequence similarities suggest the biochemical functions of an RSR (Rad17&#x02013;Rfc2&#x02013;Rfc3&#x02013;Rfc4&#x02013;Rfc5) complex and an RHR heterotrimer (Rad1&#x02013;Hus1&#x02013;Rad9) may be similar to that of RFC and PCNA, respectively. RSR purified from human cells loads RHR onto DNA in an ATP-, replication protein A-, and DNA structure-dependent manner. Interestingly, RSR and RFC differed in their ATPase activities and displayed distinct DNA substrate specificities. RSR preferred DNA substrates possessing 5&#x02032; recessed ends whereas RFC preferred 3&#x02032; recessed end DNA substrates. Characterization of the biochemical loading reaction executed by the checkpoint clamp loader RSR suggests new insights into the mechanisms underlying recognition of damage-induced DNA structures and signaling to cell cycle controls. The observation that RSR loads its clamp onto a 5&#x02032; recessed end supports a potential role for RHR and RSR in diverse DNA metabolism, such as stalled DNA replication forks, recombination-linked DNA repair, and telomere maintenance, among other processes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A cell cycle checkpoint complex is shown to bind preferentially to DNA with 5'recessed ends.

Many of the components of these pathways have been defined genetically in yeast and have orthologs in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Zhou1">Zhou and Elledge 2000</xref>).

These proteins function to affect three different outcomes in response to DNA damage, either cell cycle arrest that facilitates DNA repair, apoptosis, or senescence mediated by the p53 tumor-suppressor protein. The ATM, ATR, CHK1, and CHK2 proteins are serine/threonine protein kinases that phosphorylate a number of proteins, including p53 and CDC25A, in response to DNA damage, and defects in these kinases have been shown to be associated with and required for the progression of various human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Kastan1">Kastan and Lim 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Abraham1">Abraham 2001</xref>).</p><p>Together with Rfc1, the Rfc2, Rfc3, Rfc4, and Rfc5 proteins are subunits of replication factor C (RFC; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.0000033-t001">Table 1</xref>), a five-subunit protein complex that is required for DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Tsurimoto1">Tsurimoto and Stillman 1989</xref>).

The Rfc1 (the largest subunit of the complex), Rfc2, Rfc3, Rfc4, and Rfc5 proteins share a high degree of sequence similarity, manifested as eight conserved sequence motifs (RFC boxes) that are also found in Rad17 and in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> Ctf18/Chl12, a protein required for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Cullmann1">Cullmann et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Griffiths1">Griffiths et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Mayer1">Mayer et al. 2001</xref>).

A complex of human RAD17 with the four small subunits of human RFC has been purified from Sf9 cells and reported to possess DNA-binding and ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Lindsey-Boltz1">Lindsey-Boltz et al. 2001</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which the Rad9, Hus1, Rad1, Rad17, and RFC subunits mediate the checkpoint response is unclear, but one hypothesis is that the Rad17&#x02013;Rfc2&#x02013;Rfc3&#x02013;Rfc4&#x02013;Rfc5 (hereafter called RSR; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.0000033-t001">Table 1</xref>) complex functions mechanistically similarly to RFC to load the PCNA-like protein complex Rad9&#x02013;Hus1&#x02013;Rad1 (hereafter called RHR) onto sites of damaged DNA in vivo. Recently, this hypothesis was investigated using recombinant human RSR and RHR purified from insect cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Bermudez1">Bermudez et al. 2003</xref>) and the orthologous budding yeast protein complexes purified from <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content>, Rad24&#x02013;Rfc2&#x02013;5 and Ddc1&#x02013;Mec3&#x02013;Rad17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Majka1">Majka and Burgers 2003</xref>). Although the native <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> RHR (Ddc1&#x02013;Mec3&#x02013;Rad17) was shown to form a sliding clamp on gapped circular DNA in an ATP hydrolysis- and RSR-dependent manner, the recombinant human RHR complex, in contrast, was found to be incapable of forming a sliding clamp on nicked circular DNA. However, the recombinant protein could interact with recombinant RSR, a reaction that was observed to be nucleotide hydrolysis independent.</p><p>In a series of studies to characterize the biochemistry of DNA replication fork proteins, we were comparing the biochemical activities of the putative checkpoint clamp loader and clamp complexes with the well-characterized RFC/PCNA DNA replication fork components. Toward this goal, the human RSR complex was purified from the human colorectal carcinoma cell line RKO and tested to see whether it could load a recombinant version of the RHR complex onto DNA. We show that the purified RSR complex can catalyze the loading of the RHR complex onto DNA in vitro in an ATP-, RPA-, and DNA structure-specific manner, and once loaded, the RHR complex, like PCNA, forms a sliding clamp. Although sharing properties similar to RFC, the RSR loaded its clamp onto a DNA substrate of the opposite polarity&#x02014;a recessed 5&#x02032; end instead of a recessed 3&#x02032; end. This fundamental difference between the clamp loaders in vitro dictates that the two clamp loaders function in mechanistically distinct biochemical pathways in vivo and, consequently, provides a framework for further investigation of the biochemical function of the RSR and RHR complexes in various DNA maintenance pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The RSR Complex Purified from Human Cells Can Load the RHR Complex onto DNA In Vitro</title><p>Using anti-Rfc2 antibody (Ab) affinity chromatography followed by Q&#x02013;sepharose chromatography, a RHR-loading activity that contained RFC, Rad17, and Ctf18, as well as several other proteins, was purified from human RKO cell extracts (V. E. and B. S., unpublished data). This partially purified fraction was found to load RHR onto primer template DNA substrates in a nucleotide-dependent manner, and RHR-loading activity required the Rad17 protein, since removal of Rad17 (and with it some Rfc2&#x02013;5) using a monoclonal Ab against Rad17 rendered the fraction inactive. In contrast, removal of RFC using a monoclonal Ab against its Rfc1 subunit did not impair RHR loading (data not shown). To further define the components of the RHR-loading activity, an Ab against a Rad17 C-terminal peptide was developed that was able to immunoprecipitate (IP) specifically Rad17 along with the four small subunits of RFC, Rfc2, Rfc3, Rfc4, and Rfc5, but not the largest subunit, Rfc1 (data not shown). Coimmunoprecipitate of Rfc2&#x02013;5 was not observed with preimmune serum, nor when the anti-Rad17 Ab was preincubated with the Rad17 peptide that was used as the antigen, indicating that recovery of the precipitated proteins required the epitope recognized by the Ab (data not shown).</p><p>Using the Ab described above, Rad17 was purified from the partially purified fraction by anti-Rad17 affinity followed by Q&#x02013;sepharose chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). In addition to Rad17 itself, copurification of Rfc2&#x02013;5 was confirmed by Western blotting (Wb) and mass spectrometry analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g001">1</xref>C, respectively). Thus, using sequential Rfc2 and Rad17 Ab affinity chromatography, we identified a highly purified RSR complex (Rad17 and Rfc2&#x02013;5; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.0000033-t001">Table 1</xref> for yeast orthologs). Other proteins in the starting fraction, including Rfc1 and Ctf18, appeared to be components of unique Rfc2-containing complexes, for these proteins were recovered in the anti-Rad17 column flowthrough and therefore did not copurify with Rad17.</p><p>A recombinant version of RHR was purified from <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> using Talon affinity, Q&#x02013;sepharose, phosphocellulose chromatography, and glycerol gradient sedimentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). From glycerol gradient sedimentation and gel filtration analyses of combinations of Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1 interactions, as well as individual subunits, we determined the purified complex to be a heterotrimer (V. E. and B. S., unpublished data). The purified RHR was used as a substrate in the loading assay depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g001">Figure 1</xref>E. A primer&#x02013;template DNA substrate containing biotin located at the 3&#x02032; end of the template was bound to streptavidin&#x02013;agarose beads, after which RPA was incubated with the DNA-bound beads to form an RPA-coated primer&#x02013;template DNA complex. In this assay, previously developed to characterize PCNA loading by RFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Waga2">Waga and Stillman 1998a</xref>), RPA functioned in part to prevent the clamp from sliding off the DNA ends, as it has been shown that both the PCNA and <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> &#x003b2; subunit are incapable of sliding on RPA- or single-strand DNA-binding protein (SSB)-coated single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Yao1">Yao et al. 2000a</xref>). After incubation with various fractions containing RSR, recovery of RHR with the beads, as well as the Rad17 subunit of RSR, was analyzed by Wb.</p><p>Using the same relative amounts of each fraction present in the silver-stained gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), the affinity-purified RSR was analyzed for RHR loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). The initial fraction that was loaded on to the Rad17 affinity column was functional, as recovery of RHR with the beads was not observed in reactions that lacked DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g001">Figure 1</xref>F, lane 1), the Rad17-containing fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g001">Figure 1</xref>F, lane2), or nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g001">Figure 1</xref>F, lane 3). Consistent with a requirement for Rad17 for RHR loading in vitro, the flowthrough from the affinity column that lacked Rad17 but contained other Rfc2-containing complexes (such as RFC) was inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g001">Figure 1</xref>F, lanes 6&#x02013;8). The purified RSR was capable of loading RHR onto DNA in a nucleotide-dependent manner, similar to the starting material (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, lanes 1 and 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g001">Figure 1</xref>F, lanes 3&#x02013;5 and 12&#x02013;14). The four small RFC subunit complex, which by itself does did not bind DNA nor load RHR and PCNA onto DNA in this assay (data not shown), was also detected on DNA when Rad17 was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g001">Figure 1</xref>F; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), further suggesting that Rfc2&#x02013;5 functions in a complex with Rad17. Thus, a complex of RSR that was purified from human cells could load the RHR onto DNA in vitro.</p><p>RFC is a DNA-activated ATPase that is preferentially activated by primer&#x02013;template DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Tsurimoto2">Tsurimoto and Stillman 1990</xref>). When RSR was examined along with an equivalent amount of purified recombinant RFC for ATPase activity in the presence of the primer&#x02013;template substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g002">Figure 2</xref>), or poly(dA):oligo(dT) (data not shown), the ATPase activity of the complex was observed reproducibly to be stimulated no more than 2-fold by DNA. This was in sharp contrast to similar amounts of the RFC ATPase that were stimulated by DNA to greater than 10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Cai1">Cai et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Podust1">Podust and Fanning 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Ellison1">Ellison and Stillman 1998</xref>). The observation, also reported for the yeast checkpoint clamp loader, was surprising, particularly since the ATPase activities of both the Rfc2&#x02013;5 and the Rfc2&#x02013;4 subcomplexes are significantly stimulated by DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Podust3">Podust et al. 1998</xref>; V.

These data suggest that within the RSR complex the Rad17 subunit altered the ATPase cycle of the Rfc2&#x02013;5 subunits.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The RFC and RSR Clamp Loaders Share Similar Requirements, but Have Distinct DNA Substrate Specificities for Activity</title><p>From extensive characterization of the <italic>E. coli,</italic> T4 phage and eukaryotic replication fork assembly processes, loading of all the polymerase processivity clamps (<named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> &#x003b2; subunit, T4 phage, gp45, and PCNA) by their respective clamp loaders (&#x003b3; complex, gp44/62, and RFC) has been demonstrated to be a nucleotide-dependent, multistep reaction that can be divided into two general stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Berdis1">Berdis and Benkovic 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Hingorani1">Hingorani and O'Donnell 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Mossi1">Mossi and Hubscher 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Waga2">Waga and Stillman 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Hingorani2">Hingorani et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Turner1">Turner et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Gomes1">Gomes et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Jeruzalmi1">Jeruzalmi et al. 2001a</xref>, 2001b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Pietroni1">Pietroni et al. 2001</xref>). The first stage, the formation of a clamp&#x02013;clamp loader&#x02013;DNA ternary complex, requires clamp loader ATP binding that can be substituted by the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATP&#x003b3;S. The second step, the release or &#x0201c;clamping&#x0201d; of the protein clamp onto the DNA and the release of the clamp loader from the DNA, requires clamp loader-mediated nucleotide hydrolysis that is stimulated by DNA. In addition, loading of the clamp requires that the DNA substrate possess a DNA replication primer&#x02013;template structure bound by the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB, gp32, or RPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Tsurimoto3">Tsurimoto and Stillman 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Tinker1">Tinker et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Reems1">Reems et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Kelman1">Kelman et al. 1998</xref>). We asked whether the aforementioned prerequisites were also necessary for RSR activity by examining RHR loading onto substrates that lacked either a primer or RPA. Similar to RFC, the RSR-loading activity was both primer- and RPA-dependent, for in the absence of either the primer or RPA, loading of RHR was undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g003">3</xref>B, lanes 11 and 7, respectively). Furthermore, ternary complex formation by RSR was not observed in the absence of a primer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, lane 12), suggesting that the RHR loading requires a primer and template DNA, as observed for RFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, lane 12).</p><p>The primer&#x02013;template substrate used had both a recessed 5&#x02032; end and a recessed 3&#x02032; end because the primer was located in the center of the template. Although it is well established that RFC loads PCNA onto DNA containing either a recessed 3&#x02032; end or a nicked double-strand DNA, usage of alternative DNA structures as substrates, such as those with recessed 5&#x02032; ends, has not been examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Mossi1">Mossi and Hubscher 1998</xref>). Hence, we tested the ability of RFC and RSR to load their respective clamps onto DNA containing either a recessed 5&#x02032; end or a recessed 3&#x02032; end. As expected, we observed a requirement for a DNA substrate with a recessed 3&#x02032; end for PCNA loading by RFC; however, loading onto a recessed 5&#x02032; end DNA substrate was essentially undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, lanes 12 and 13). Unexpectedly, however, RSR possessed the opposite substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), since a DNA substrate with a recessed 5&#x02032; end was discovered to be a much better substrate for RHR loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 11 and 12) compared to the recessed 3&#x02032; end substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 8 and 9). Thus, RSR and RFC loaded their respective clamps onto different DNA structures, relegating these clamp loaders to distinct DNA replication and repair reactions in the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>RHR Is a Sliding Clamp</title><p>Loading of the ring-shaped homotrimeric PCNA results in the topological linking of the complex to the DNA, and because of the absence of specific contacts with the DNA, the PCNA can freely translate or &#x0201c;slide&#x0201d; on duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Kuriyan1">Kuriyan and O'Donnell 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Krishna1">Krishna et al. 1994</xref>). If loaded onto a circular substrate, the PCNA is trapped on the DNA, resulting in a very stable PCNA&#x02013;DNA complex. However, loading of PCNA onto linear DNA yields a very unstable PCNA&#x02013;DNA complex because the PCNA can slide off the DNA unless the ends are blocked. In the assay described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g001">Figure 1</xref>E, PCNA sliding off the substrate was presumably blocked by RPA binding on the single-stranded region of the DNA template (or 5&#x02032; end) and the biotin&#x02013;streptavidin&#x02013;agarose bead complex at the double-stranded end of template (or 3&#x02032; end, distal to RPA).</p><p>To test whether PCNA was topologically linked in this assay, we compared loading onto recessed 3&#x02032; end primer&#x02013;template DNAs that contained the biotin-linked bead at either the double-stranded end (bead distal to RPA) or at the single-stranded end of the template (bead proximal to RPA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). In contrast to the former substrate, the latter possesses one unblocked or &#x0201c;free&#x0201d; end that would allow the PCNA to slide off the duplex DNA. Thus, if the PCNA was topologically linked to the DNA, very poor recovery of the clamp on this substrate was expected. As predicted, although efficiently recovered on the DNA with the biotin bead complex distal to RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, lane 4; see also the experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g004">Figure 4</xref>), PCNA was not recovered when the biotin bead complex was placed at the single-stranded end of the template (proximal to RPA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, lane 8). Placement of the biotin at the single-stranded end of the DNA did not simply inhibit RFC activity, for ternary complex formation on both substrates in the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S was observed with similar efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 5 and 9). In addition, both the 5&#x02032; biotin and 3&#x02032; biotin substrates were capable of activating the ATPase activity of RFC with the same efficiency (data not shown), again indicating no specific impairment of RFC function by the 5&#x02032; biotin substrate. We concluded, therefore, that the inability to recover the PCNA by unblocking one end of the substrate was due to PCNA sliding off the duplex DNA after it was loaded. Thus, in this assay, the PCNA was topologically linked to the DNA.</p><p>When RHR was analyzed for sliding clamp formation, poor recovery of the complex was observed on the DNA substrate with only one end of the DNA blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 8) compared to that with both ends of the substrate blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 4; see also the experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In the presence of ATP, it is probable that multiple RHR complexes were loaded onto the duplex DNA that was blocked with a biotin-linked bead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 4), whereas multiple RHR complexes loaded onto the same substrate with a free duplex DNA end failed to accumulate on the DNA because they slid off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, lane 8). In contrast, in the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S ternary complex formation, but not clamp loading on both substrates occurred with similar efficiencies and therefore appeared to be unaffected by the location of the biotin bead complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g005">Figure 5</xref>B, lanes 5 and 9). Thus, when loaded onto DNA in the presence of ATP, like the PCNA clamp, RHR appeared to be topologically linked and formed a sliding clamp.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Loading of the Human Clamps Are Specifically Stimulated by Human RPA</title><p>RPA is a heterotrimeric, single-strand DNA-binding protein that is required for DNA replication, repair, and recombination in vivo and in vitro and has been shown to modulate the activities of proteins in each of these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Wold1">Wold 1997</xref> and references therein). To test whether RPA plays a role in clamp loading, RFC and RSR activities were analyzed in the presence of either human or yeast RPA. We surmised that if the only function of RPA in our assay was to block the ends of the substrate and thus prevent clamp sliding, then clamp loading should be supported with equal efficiency by yeast and human RPA. However, if RPA also functioned to stimulate clamp-loading activity, this activity may involve species-specific protein&#x02013;protein interactions, given that yeast RPA does not substitute for human RPA in in vitro assays for either SV40 DNA replication or nucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Wold1">Wold 1997</xref>).

Inefficient recovery of the PCNA was not due to an inability of yeast RPA to prevent human PCNA clamp sliding, because usage of alternative recessed 3&#x02032; end substrates in this assay permitted efficient and comparable PCNA recovery in the presence of yeast and human RPA (V. E. and B. S., unpublished data). Hence, recovery of the PCNA in the presence of yeast RPA was DNA structure specific and not due to an intrinsic (1) inability of yeast RPA to prevent human PCNA clamp sliding nor (2) human RFC inhibitory activity of yeast RPA. Therefore, we concluded that RPA performed two functions in our assay: first, it prevented the clamp from sliding off the DNA, and second, it specifically stimulated the activity of RFC on canonical primer&#x02013;template recessed 3&#x02032; end DNA substrates. Likewise, when yeast RPA was tested for the ability to support RHR loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g006">Figure 6</xref>B), RSR activity was found to be preferentially stimulated by human RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 5 and 6) compared to yeast RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4).

The purified RSR, isolated from human cells, was capable of loading the heterotrimeric RHR complex onto DNA in an ATP-, RPA-, and DNA structure-specific manner. Although the reactions executed by the RFC and RSR clamp loaders are similar, they require DNA substrates of the opposite polarity to load their respective clamps: RFC utilizes a recessed 3&#x02032; end, whereas RSR prefers a recessed 5&#x02032; end. The use of a recessed 3&#x02032; end by RFC and PCNA makes sense since PCNA is a DNA polymerase clamp protein and the DNA polymerase utilizes the 3&#x02032;-OH as a primer for DNA synthesis. The new observations provide insights into the function of RSR in the DNA damage-response pathway and suggest that the RHR clamp is not used by DNA polymerases on primer&#x02013;template structures. They also suggest that the Rfc1 and Rad17 subunits confer structure-specific DNA binding and ATPase properties on their respective clamp loader complexes.</p><p>We have also characterized a recombinant source of the RSR complex purified from Sf9 cells and found it to be inactive. Recently, a recombinant source of the RSR complex also purified from Sf9 cells was reported to possess RHR-loading activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Bermudez1">Bermudez et al. 2003</xref>). In contrast to the properties of the native protein we report here, the reaction executed by this recombinant protein was ATP&#x003b3;S dependent and did not result in the formation of a RHR complex that could slide on DNA, indicating that in their assay, the complex was not topologically linked to the DNA. We suggest that a more accurate description for the reaction reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Bermudez1">Bermudez et al. (2003</xref>) is ternary complex formation rather than clamp loading, given that the authors reported that (1) adenine nucleotide binding is sufficient for RSR to form a complex with RHR, and complex formation could be supported by not only ATP, but also ATP&#x003b3;S and ADP in the absence of DNA; and that (2) RSR can bind DNA in the absence of RHR and nucleotide. The explanation for the discrepancy in the biochemical properties of the native and recombinant protein is not known.</p><p>Consistent with our findings, however, the orthologous RSR clamp loader in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content>, isolated from yeast, was recently reported to load its RHR clamp (Ddc1&#x02013;Mec3&#x02013;Rad17) onto DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction, resulting in a Ddc1&#x02013;Mec3&#x02013;Rad17 complex that could slide on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Majka1">Majka and Burgers 2003</xref>). In this report, using a circular substrate containing a 500 bp single-strand gap, clamp loading did not appear to be stimulated by RPA, although the authors did observe stimulation of the DNA-binding activity of the clamp loader and inhibition of clamp loading at ectopic or pseudosubstrates created by secondary structure in the single-stranded region of the substrate. On the other hand, analysis of the clamp-loading reaction carried out by the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> DNA replication clamp loader, the &#x003b3; complex, with a circular gapped substrate revealed that the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> single-strand DNA-binding protein SSB plays an important role by specifically binding the &#x003c7; subunit of the &#x003b3; complex and stimulating its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Kelman1">Kelman et al. 1998</xref>).

Analogously, our comparison of the ability of yeast and human RPA to support PCNA loading suggested that an interaction between RPA and RFC was presumably conferred by specific amino acids in human RPA not present in yeast RPA. We surmise that in the absence of a direct comparison of single-strand DNA-binding protein specificity as reported here, that stimulation of clamp loader activity by RPA may only be revealed by a careful analysis of the salt sensitivity of the clamp-loading reaction. Thus, perhaps the salt concentration in the experiment reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Majka1">Majka and Burgers (2003</xref>) was suboptimal to reveal this activity of RPA.</p><p>Interestingly, we have observed that utilization of a substrate containing a frayed recessed 3&#x02032; end abrogates the stimulatory function of human RPA on RFC activity. Loading of PCNA using this substrate is supported by yeast and human RPA equivalently, and the efficiency of this loading is equivalent to the loading onto a completely base-paired recessed 3&#x02032; end substrate (V. E. and B. S., unpublished data). Hence, the ability for RFC to load its clamp onto a recessed 3&#x02032; end in the presence of yeast RPA is not due to an inhibitory activity nor an inability to prevent the clamp from sliding off the DNA. Therefore, we speculate that one function of the interaction of the clamp loaders with their cognate single-strand DNA-binding protein is to facilitate a conformational change or distortion in the DNA by the clamp loader that influences the efficiency of clamp loading. This idea is consistent with the previous reports demonstrating that the &#x003b3; complex and human RFC can load their clamps onto supercoiled plasmid substrates that lack free ends but contain distortions in the DNA and/or regions of partially unwound DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Podust2">Podust et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Yao2">Yao et al. 2000b</xref>).

This model, however, is inconsistent with our findings revealing a requirement for a 5&#x02032; recessed primer&#x02013;template substrate and RPA for loading of the RHR complex by the RSR clamp loader.

Therefore, we suggest a model in which the checkpoint clamp and clamp loader function not as initial sensors of DNA damage, but instead play a vital role in DNA damage responses by stabilizing stalled replication forks and/or stimulating replication fork reactivation and recombination-dependent DNA replication pathways after lesions are first processed into structures that are suitable substrates for clamp loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000033-g007">Figure 7</xref>). All of these structures have 5&#x02032; recessed ends and RPA could bind to the single-stranded DNA. We further suggest that a modified version of RPA would be primarily responsible for recruiting the checkpoint clamp loader and the clamp to these sites. Under these circumstances, essential roles of the checkpoint clamp may be to protect 5&#x02032; recessed ends from exonucleolytic degradation and promote resolution of these abnormal structures in DNA.</p><p>A potential participant in the DNA damage recognition step of the checkpoint pathway is the Mec1/Lcd1 kinase complex (corresponding to the ATM and ATR/ATRIP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Cortez1">Cortez et al. 2001</xref>&#x0005d; kinases in mammals).

Thus, in the absence of DNA damage, we envision the Mec1/ATR/ATM kinase and checkpoint clamp and clamp loader complexes functioning as auxiliary replication fork components that respond to changes in replication fork progression and promote fork stability in S-phase to ensure proper coupling of leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis. As components of attenuated replication forks, they activate downstream effectors, such as Chk1 and Rad53/Chk2, and facilitate fork reactivation by recruitment of the relevant DNA metabolizing enzymes.

Abs CSH851, CSH1147, CSH1120, and CSH119 were generated by immunization of rabbits with the following peptides covalently coupled to activated KLH (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Illinois, United States): hRFC2 N-terminal peptide GSSGENKKAK, hRAD17 C-terminal peptide MEDYESDGT, hHUS1 C-terminal peptide ESTHEDRNVE, and hRAD1 C-terminal peptide DEEVPESES. All peptides were obtained from Research Genetics (Invitrogen). Abs were affinity purified using the Pierce Sulfo-Link Kit<sup>TM</sup> as suggested by the manufacturer. Wb was performed using standard procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Harlow1">Harlow and Lane 1999</xref>); all Abs were diluted in blocking solution (3&#x00025; nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline) except for 1120 and 1119, which were diluted in blocking solution containing 0.2&#x00025; Triton X-100 (Sigma).</p></sec><sec id="s4a3"><title>Immunoprecipitation of Rad17 and RFC</title><p>IP of Rad17 and RFC from RKO cell extracts was performed using Abs 31E (against Rad17), #6 (against Rfc1), and CSH851 (against Rfc2) covalently coupled to GammaBind<sup>TM</sup> protein G&#x02013;sepharose (Pharmacia, now Pfizer, New York, New York, United States) with 20 mM dimethylpimelimidate (Sigma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Harlow1">Harlow and Lane 1999</xref>).

All IP reactions were incubated for 3 h at 4&#x000b0;C with rocking and washed three times at 4&#x000b0;C with 1.5 ml of buffer A containing 250 mM NaCl. The beads were resuspended in 40 &#x003bc;l of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Each IP reaction (10 &#x003bc;l) was subjected to SDS-PAGE through a 12.5&#x00025; polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were visualized by either silver staining or Wb. For depletion of either RFC or Rad17&#x02013;Rfc2&#x02013;5 from the RHRA, 25 &#x003bc;l of either anti-Rfc1 beads, anti-Rad17 beads, or anti-HA epitope (12CA5) beads was incubated with 70 &#x003bc;l of the RHRA for 3 h at 4&#x000b0;C with continuous agitation. After the incubation, the beads were allowed to settle, and the supernatant (depleted RHRA) was collected to assay for RHR loading.

The extract was incubated with the Ab beads for 6 h at 4&#x000b0;C, and the beads were then washed three times with 50 ml of buffer A containing 250 mM NaCl and aliquoted into three 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. Bound proteins were eluted with 750 &#x003bc;l of buffer A containing 250 mM NaCl and 0.5 mg/ml Rfc2 peptide at 30&#x000b0;C for 15 min, and the eluates were pooled, diluted 1:2 with buffer A, and loaded onto a 350 &#x003bc;l Q&#x02013;sepharose column equilibrated in buffer A containing 125 mM NaCl. After washing the column with 10 ml of buffer A containing 125 mM NaCl, bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 350 mM NaCl, and 350 &#x003bc;l fractions were collected.

A detailed description of the plasmid construction, purification of the complex, and characterization of its properties will be published elsewhere (V. E. and B. S., unpublished data). In brief, the complex was purified using Talon<sup>TM</sup> affinity (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, California, United States), Q&#x02013;sepharose, and phosphocellulose chromatography, and then finally sedimentation through a 4.8 ml 15&#x00025;&#x02013;32.5&#x00025; glycerol gradient in buffer D (50 mM KPO<sub>4</sub> &#x0005b;pH 7.4&#x0005d;, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM PMSF, 7 mM CHAPS, Complete<sup>TM</sup> protease inhibitor cocktail, 2 &#x003bc;M leupeptin) containing 500 mM NaCl at 4&#x000b0;C for 21 h at 49 K in a SW55Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, California, United States). A gradient loaded with native protein molecular weight standards (ovalbumin, albumin, aldolase, catalase) was run in parallel. The fractions containing the peak of all three proteins were aliquoted and stored at &#x02013;70&#x000b0;C.

Reactions were prepared as follows. DNA-bound beads (15 &#x003bc;l; 1 pmol of DNA) or beads alone were washed with 500 &#x003bc;l of loading buffer (LB) (30 mM HEPES&#x02013;KOH &#x0005b;pH 7.5&#x0005d;, 1 mM DTT, 7 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CHAPS) and then resuspended in LB containing 50 mM NaCl and 250 ng of RPA (2 pmol) and incubated at 25&#x000b0;C for 15 min. After the RPA-binding reaction, the beads were allowed to settle by gravity, the supernatant was removed, and 5 &#x003bc;l of the RHR-loading activity from the Rfc2 Ab affinity column or 0.25 pmol of the RSR complex, 1 pmol of the RHR complex, and the LB-containing nucleotide (ATP or ATP&#x003b3;S, as dictated by the experiment) were added and the reactions incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for 25 min with continuous agitation. The final reaction conditions were 30 mM HEPES, 1.1 mM DTT, 7 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.7 mM CHAPS, 1&#x00025; glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM KP0<sub>4</sub>, 60 mM NaCl, 1 mM ATP or ATP&#x003b3;S (deviation from LB due to contribution of protein buffer constituents). To assay for PCNA loading, reactions were prepared as described for RHR above, except 2 pmol of PCNA was used and either 5 &#x003bc;l of the RHR-loading activity or 0.25 pmol (2.5 &#x003bc;l) of recombinant RFC. Reactions were stopped by placement on ice for 1 min, and the beads washed twice, 5 min per wash, with 1.5 ml of LB containing 100 mM NaCl without nucleotide at 4&#x000b0;C with rocking and finally resuspended in 25 &#x003bc;l of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins bound to the bead were analyzed by SDS-PAGE through a 12.5&#x00025; polyacrylamide gel followed by Wb.</p></sec><sec id="s4a7"><title>Purification of PCNA, RPA, RFC and Rfc2&#x02013;5, and ATPase assays</title><p>Human PCNA and RPA and yeast RPA were purified from <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000033-Waga1">Waga and Stillman 1994</xref>).

affinity column eluate by anti-Rad17 Ab affinity chromatography, and the peptide-eluted material was concentrated by Q&#x02013;sepharose chromatography. An equivalent volume (5 &#x003bc;l) of the load onto the anti-Rad17 column (lane 1, labeled L), the flowthrough from the column (lane 2, labeled FT), each peptide elution fraction (lanes 3&#x02013;5), and the indicated amounts of the concentrated, purified complex (lanes 6&#x02013;8) were analyzed by silver staining and Wb for Rad17.</p><p>(B) The same fractions present in the silver-stained gel in (A) were analyzed by Wb for Rfc1, Ctf18, Rfc2, Rfc4, and Rfc5, and the lanes are as loaded and numbered in (A).</p><p>(C) Peptide sequences for the proteins present in the purified Q&#x02013;sepharose fraction.</p><p>(D) Purification of the RHR. RHR was purified from <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> by Talon affinity, Q&#x02013;sepharose, and phosphocellulose chromatography and by glycerol gradient sedimentation (shown here). The load onto the gradient (lane L) and fractions (corresponding to lane numbers) as well as any material in the pellet (lane B) were analyzed by silver staining (shown) and Wb (not shown). Arrows indicate the sedimentation position of protein standards from a gradient prepared in parallel.</p><p>(E) Assay for RHR and PCNA loading. RHR and PCNA loading were examined by monitoring the binding of the proteins to a DNA&#x02013;RPA complex bound to streptavidin&#x02013;agarose beads by Wb of the bead-bound fractions. The DNA substrate consist of a 90 nucleotide (nt) 3&#x02032; biotinylated template and 30 nt primer positioned in the center of the template, resulting in a substrate with 30 nt single-stranded recessed 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends to which RPA was bound.</p><p>(F) RSR is sufficient to load RHR onto DNA in vitro. Reactions were performed as described in the Materials and Methods, and the bead-precipitated products were analyzed by Wb for Rad17, Rfc2, Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1. The fractions from the purification shown in (A) were assayed for RHR-loading activity. Lanes represent reactions that contained the same amount of the anti-Rad17 Ab column load (lanes 1, 3, 4, and 5), flowthrough (lanes 6&#x02013;8), and the Q&#x02013;sepharose concentrated protein (lanes 9&#x02013;17) as shown in the silver-stained gel in (A), or no source of Rad17 (buffer only, lane 2). All reactions contained 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; recessed primer&#x02013;template DNA&#x02013;RPA complex bound to beads (except for that in lane 1, which contained beads alone), 1 pmol of RHR complex, and the indicated nucleotide cofactor (ATP: lanes 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16; ATP&#x003b3;S: lanes 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17) or no nucleotide (lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15).

These structures also contain recessed 5&#x02032; ends, whose fate in these reactions is unclear. Given that RSR loads RHR (depicted as a ring or donut encircling the DNA) onto recessed 5&#x02032; ends in vitro, recessed 5&#x02032; ends generated in vivo in the depicted pathways can be considered potential substrates. They all contain adjacent single-stranded DNA that could be bound by RPA.
