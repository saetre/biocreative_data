Mec1 appeared to be active, since the Rad9 adaptor retained its Mec1 phosphorylation. Moreover, the damage-induced interaction between phosphorylated Rad9 and Rad53 remained intact. In contrast, Rad53 hyperphosphorylation was significantly reduced, consistent with the observation that cell-cycle arrest is lost during adaptation. Thus, we conclude Cdc5 acts to attenuate the DNA damage checkpoint through loss of Rad53 hyperphosphorylation to allow cells to adapt to DNA damage. Polo-like kinase homologs have been shown to inhibit the ability of Claspin to facilitate the activation of downstream checkpoint kinases, suggesting that this function is conserved in vertebrates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Cellular surveillance mechanisms, termed checkpoints, have evolved to recognize the presence of DNA damage, halt cell division, and promote repair. The purpose of these checkpoints is to prevent the next generation of cells from inheriting a damaged genome. However, after futile attempts at repair over several hours of growth arrest, yeast cells eventually adapt and continue with cell division despite the presence of persistent DNA lesions. This process of adaptation employs CDC5, a kinase that also has essential roles in promoting cell division in the absence of DNA damage. We found that increasing levels of Cdc5 promote adaptation by suppressing the hyperphosphorylation of the checkpoint kinase Rad53, which in turn suppresses the DNA damage checkpoint and relieves cell division arrest. Intriguingly, overexpression of PLK1, the human homolog of CDC5, has been reported in various tumor types and has been linked to poor prognosis. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of adaptation in yeast may provide valuable insight into the role of PLK1 overexpression in tumor progression.

To determine if the process of adaptation is sensitive to the dosage of <italic>CDC5</italic>, we first analyzed diploid yeast carrying various combinations of <italic>CDC5</italic> alleles: wild-type (WT), <italic>cdc5-ad</italic>, or a deletion. The percentage of cells able to adapt to the DNA damage checkpoint was first measured by creating DNA damage with the <italic>cdc13-1</italic> temperature-sensitive allele. Shifting <italic>cdc13-1</italic> strains to the non-permissive temperature destabilizes telomeres, causing the accumulation of ssDNA and eliciting a checkpoint response. We assayed adaptation by shifting these strains to the non-permissive temperature of 32&#x000b0;C for 2 h, plating cells to pre-warmed plates, and then counting the number of cells able to form microcolonies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Toczyski2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. As expected and consistent with previous observations, we found that greater than 90&#x00025; of <italic>CDC5/CDC5</italic> homozygous diploids were able to adapt after 10 h of persistent and irreparable DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000286-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Toczyski1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, diploids that express <italic>cdc5-ad</italic> as the only functional <italic>CDC5</italic> allele (<italic>cdc5-ad</italic>/<italic>cdc5-ad</italic> and <italic>cdc5-ad</italic>/<italic>cdc5&#x00394;</italic>) were unable to adapt for the duration of the 25-h time course. However, in heterozygous strains carrying only one copy of WT <italic>CDC5</italic> (<italic>CDC5/cdc5</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>CDC5/cdc5-ad</italic>), the rate of adaptation slows and the number of cells that adapt drops to less than 50&#x00025;. The slowed rate of adaptation is consistent with the idea that <italic>CDC5</italic> is dose dependent for adaptation. However, the decrease in the total number of cells that adapt likely reflects the decreasing ability of diploids to survive after prolonged cell-cycle arrest. In support of this conclusion, even those arrests that are not associated with viability loss in the short term, such as those induced with temperature-sensitive alleles of the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC), show loss of viability after about 10 h, around the time that WT cells grown in glucose adapt (D. Toczyski, unpublished data). The observation that a <italic>CDC5/cdc5</italic>&#x00394; strain shows a more significant defect than a <italic>CDC5/cdc5-ad</italic> diploid suggests that the <italic>cdc5-ad</italic> is not functioning as a gain of function mutation. If <italic>cdc5-ad</italic> had 50&#x00025; activity for adaptation, the <italic>cdc5-ad/cdc5-ad</italic> and <italic>CDC5/cdc5</italic>&#x00394; strains would have an identical capacity to support adaptation. Yet the observation that a <italic>cdc5-ad/cdc5-ad</italic> strain showed a much more pronounced phenotype than a <italic>CDC5/cdc5</italic>&#x00394; suggests that the <italic>cdc5-ad</italic> allele is significantly impaired for <italic>CDC5</italic>'s adaptation activity. The heterozygote contains a mixed population of cells that adapt, as evidenced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000286-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, thus complicating a population-based assay like a Western blot. Despite this, examination of Rad53 directly in these diploids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000286.s001">Figure S1</xref>) showed that at the time of adaptation (the 6-h time point), strains with fewer copies of WT <italic>CDC5</italic> had higher levels of phosphorylated Rad53.</p><fig id="pbio-1000286-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000286.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title><italic>CDC5</italic> overexpression promotes adaptation by suppressing checkpoint signaling.</title><p>(A) Adaptation was measured by microcolony assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Toczyski2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> in diploid strains carrying a combination of <italic>CDC5</italic>, <italic>cdc5-ad</italic>, or <italic>cdc5&#x00394;</italic> alleles, or (B) in haploid strains with or without additional copies of integrated GAL-HA-CDC5.

In contrast, cells harboring the adaptation-defective <italic>cdc5-ad</italic> allele remained arrested with an activated checkpoint. This difference does not appear to be mediated by alterations in the levels of Cdc5 or Cdc5-ad during an adaptation time course (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000286.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These data suggest that an as-yet unidentified step in the DNA damage checkpoint is turned off to allow cells to adapt. However, adaptation is a long and asynchronous process, making studying the molecular mechanism difficult. Moreover, several pathways downregulate the checkpoint to promote adaptation. Therefore, we used the overexpression of <italic>CDC5</italic> as a tool to probe specifically how <italic>CDC5</italic> impinges on the DNA damage checkpoint. We first wanted to determine whether <italic>CDC5</italic> overexpression inhibited the checkpoint pathway itself, or promoted cell-cycle progression non-specifically at a step downstream of the checkpoint. Damage was induced by shifting <italic>cdc13-1</italic> cultures to the non-permissive temperature of 32&#x000b0;C for 2 h, leading to Rad53 phosphorylation. <italic>CDC5</italic> was then induced by adding 2&#x00025; galactose to strains expressing <italic>CDC5</italic> under the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. Nocodazole was added simultaneously with galactose to prevent the adapting cells from reentering the cell cycle. After galactose addition, the hyperphosphorylation of Rad53 dropped significantly in strains harboring the <italic>GAL-CDC5</italic> construct, but not in control strains lacking the construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000286-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This suppression of the checkpoint was not specific to <italic>cdc13-1</italic>-induced damage. Rad53 hyperphosphorylation also dropped when the DSB-inducing drug zeocin was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000286-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Together, these data support the notion that <italic>CDC5</italic> promotes checkpoint inactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Recruitment of Checkpoint Sensors to DSBs Is Unaffected by <italic>CDC5</italic> Overexpression</title><p>To determine how <italic>CDC5</italic> suppresses Rad53 phosphorylation, we examined several upstream steps leading to Rad53 activation after <italic>CDC5</italic> overexpression.

To verify that the observed shift in Rad9 was due to phosphorylation by Mec1/Tel1, we probed immunoprecipitated (IP) Rad9 with a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes glutamine directed phospho-serine and phospho-threonine residues, which correspond to Mec1/Tel1 phosphorylation motifs. As expected, the pS/pT-Q antibody only recognized Rad9 after damage induction and with increasing intensity over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000286-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom). As seen in the Rad9-FLAG Western, <italic>CDC5</italic> overexpression resulted in only a subtle change in Rad9's electrophoretic mobility shift. This 2-fold drop in Rad9 hyperphosphorylation was seen at the last (5 h) time point but was not significant at the 4 h time point, despite the fact that Rad53 phosphorylation was already lost by this time. Thus, we conclude that Mec1/Tel1 are able to recognize and phosphorylate Rad9 properly despite <italic>CDC5</italic> induction, suggesting that their kinase activity towards this substrate is not affected.</p><p>Cdc5 could disrupt Rad9 function without blocking Mec1/Tel1 phosphorylation of Rad9.

We immunoprecipitated Rad9-FLAG in the presence of DNA damage with or without CDC5 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000286-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom). As previously reported, Rad53 co-immunoprecipitated with Rad9 after induction of DNA damage. Despite the fact that <italic>CDC5</italic> overexpression eliminated Rad53 hyperphosphorylation, Rad53 still associated with Rad9. The reciprocal experiment in which we immunoprecipitated Rad53 showed that only shifted Rad9 binds Rad53. Again, <italic>CDC5</italic> overexpression had a marginal effect on Mec1/Tel1-dependent phosphorylation of Rad9 and had no effect on Rad9's ability to interact with Rad53, despite Rad53's hypophosphorylated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000286-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

The HA-Cdc5 kinase was isolated from yeast extracts that were either untreated or damaged with zeocin. To ensure that the in vitro phosphorylation of Rad53 was specific to Cdc5 kinase activity and not a product of Rad53 autophosphorylation, the Rad53 substrates used harbored the D339A kinase inactivating mutation. This Rad53-D339A substrate was otherwise WT (labeled WT) or also carried additional mutations in one or both of the FHA domains. Rad53 contains two FHA domains that are important for checkpoint function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Sun1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and mediate association with phosphorylated proteins, such as Rad9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Durocher1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> and potentially Cdc5. The rad53 R70A mutation corresponds to the N-terminal FHA1 domain and the R605A mutation to the C-terminal FHA2 domain. Similar to the in vivo binding data, the in vitro phosphorylation of Rad53 by Cdc5 can occur independently of the DNA damage.

As expected, this result required a functional HA-Cdc5 since no Rad53 phosphorylation was observed when the kinase dead mutant, HA-cdc5-K110A, was used as a control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000286.s005">Figure S5B</xref>).

A population of Rad53 that is capable of undergoing limited autophosphorylation in the ISA assay in the absence of a significant phospho-shift as measured by gel mobility assay has been observed previously in the checkpoint-defective rad53 FHA2-R605A mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Sweeney1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Pike1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. These data and those presented here suggest that these two assays measure distinct aspects of Rad53 activation that are together required for its in vivo function and that Cdc5 may specifically act to counter one of these functions in vivo. In fission yeast, phosphorylation of Cds1 (the Rad53 homolog) by Rad3 (the Mec1 homolog) is thought to promote Cds1-Cds1 interactions required for autophosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Xu1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, Rad53 autophosphorylation activity requires Mec1/Tel1 phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Sweeney1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, if Mec1/Tel1 were completely inhibited, Rad53 would not be active in the ISA assay, which we did not observe. Consistent with Rad53 maintaining its priming phosphorylation, Rad53 remained a tight doublet even after <italic>CDC5</italic> overexpression caused loss of its hyperphosphorylation. This, along with our data demonstrating Rad9 is appropriately phosphorylated by Mec1/Tel1 despite <italic>CDC5</italic> overexpression, would suggest that Mec1/Tel1 are active and can phosphorylate Rad53 enough to prime its activity.</p><p>Cdc5 was able to directly phosphorylate Rad53 in vitro. Cdc5 phosphorylation might affect the positioning of Rad53 with respect to either other Rad53 molecules or Rad9 so as to prevent proper Rad53 trans-autophosphorylation. Active and phosphorylated Rad53 must be released from Rad9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Gilbert1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that these Rad9-bound hypophosphorylated Rad53 molecules could act dominantly to prevent further checkpoint activation, as does expression of the kinase-dead allele of <italic>RAD53</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Pellicioli2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our demonstration that Cdc5 phosphorylation of recombinant Rad53 depends on both Rad53 FHA domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000286-g004">Figure 4C and 4D</xref>) is particularly intriguing. First, it suggests that this activity is quite specific. Moreover, it argues that Rad53 provides the binding specificity to allow Cdc5 to phosphorylate it, in contrast to the classic model in which polo-like kinases recognize a substrate via their phosphobinding polo-box domains and then subsequently phosphorylate the bound substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Lowery1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. This mechanism is also different from how the human homologs, Chk2 and Plk1, are reported to interact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Tsvetkov2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as both proteins contain phosphobinding motifs, mutual recognition between Cdc5 and Rad53 may be required in vivo. An alternative model of indirect inhibition is one in which Rad53 could bridge an interaction between Cdc5 and Rad9 and promote Cdc5 phosphorylation of Rad9. As a result, Cdc5-mediated phosphorylation could interfere with proper Rad53 autophosphorylation. This model has the benefit of targeting the checkpoint mediator responsible for activating the two parallel effector kinases Rad53 and Chk1, both shown to lose activity as cells adapt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Pellicioli1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Cdc5 can now be added to the growing list of proteins that interact with the Rad53 FHA1 domain. Rad53 contains two FHA domains, one at each terminus, whereas homologous proteins such as human Chk2 and <italic>S. pombe</italic> Cds1 contain only one N-terminal FHA domain. Although both Rad53 FHA domains contribute to its checkpoint function, the N-terminal FHA1 is more structurally similar to its homologous counterparts. This raises interesting prospects on how Rad53's FHA1 domain facilitates interactions with downstream targets including Dbf4, Asf1, Mdt1, Rad9, and other Rad53 molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Sun1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Pike2">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Duncker1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as promote its own inactivation by interacting with Ptc2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Leroy1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Guillemain1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> and, potentially, Cdc5.</p><p>Our results strongly suggest the polo-like kinase, Cdc5, can inhibit checkpoint signaling at the level of Rad53 hyperphosphorylation. Rad53 autoactivation provides an amplification step in which primed Rad53 can activate additional Rad53 molecules in a positive-feedback loop, thereby preventing premature or unnecessary checkpoint activation. The findings that both the in vivo interaction and the in vitro phosphorylation of Rad53 by Cdc5 imply that there is potential for a constitutive interaction, in agreement with human Chk2 and Plk1 data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Tsvetkov2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. While the biological significance for a constitutive interaction is not yet clear, it presents the opportunity for each kinase to inhibit the other and generate a switch-like decision to undergo adaptation. Indeed, Plk1 has been reported to be inhibited by the DNA damage checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-vanVugt1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Smits1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. This leads us to question, what can tip the balance of this potential inhibitory face-off: the activity of a third kinase such as CDK on either or both Rad53 and Cdc5, or the relative strength of their interaction compared to other substrates?</p><p>Adaptation can be considered as a final attempt at survival after yeast have exhausted all other repair options. However, as a consequence of promoting cell division in the presence of DNA damage, adaptation also results in increased genomic stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000286-Galgoczy1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>.
