Osteoclast differentiation from hematopoietic progenitors and their activation depend on M-CSF and RANKL, but also requires co-stimulatory signals acting through receptors associated with DAP12 and FcR&#x003b3; adaptors. Dap12 mutant mice (K&#x00394;75) are osteopetrotic due to inactive osteoclasts but, surprisingly, these mice are more sensitive than WT mice to bone loss following an ovariectomy. Because estrogen withdrawal is known to disturb bone mass, at least in part, through lymphocyte interaction, we looked at the role of mature lymphocytes on osteoclastogenesis and bone mass in the absence of functional DAP12. Lymphocytes were found to stimulate an early osteoclast differentiation response from Dap12-deficient progenitors <italic>in vitro. In vivo</italic>, Rag1-/- mice lacking mature lymphocytes did not exhibit any bone phenotype, but lost their bone mass after ovariectomy like K&#x00394;75 mice. K&#x00394;75;Rag1-/- double mutant female mice exhibited a more severe osteopetrosis than Dap12-deficient animals but lost their bone mass after ovariectomy, like single mutants. These results suggest that both DAP12 and mature lymphocytes act synergistically to maintain bone mass under physiological conditions, while playing similar but not synergistic co-stimulatory roles in protecting bone loss after gonadal failure. Thus, our data support a role for lymphocytes during osteoclast differentiation and suggest that they may function as accessory cells when regular osteoclast function is compromised.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone remodeling and homeostasis result from the balanced activity of two cell types, osteoclasts for bone resorption and osteoblasts for bone formation. In humans, as well as in rodents, bone goes through different phases of development. During the growth phase, bone modeling takes place with a rate of formation higher than that of degradation. Once puberty occurs, the bone mass reaches a peak and subsequently remains constant through a balanced formation and degradation process. Finally, during aging, following gonadal failure and steroid hormone arrest, bone degradation takes over from bone formation leading to osteoporosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Turner1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This aging process can be mimicked in animal models such as mice, by gonadectomy, leading to an inhibition of steroid hormone production and decreased bone mass.</p><p>In women, the major etiology of osteoporosis is estrogen withdrawal after menopause. Many different studies have been carried out in order to understand the mechanisms of estrogen activity on bone mass, and to generate new therapies to prevent or cure the disease. Despite this work, exactly how estrogens act on bone cells still remains unclear. Most of the estrogen activity on bone cannot be explained by a direct effect on bone cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Carlsten1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Several lines of evidence indicate that disruption of the hormonal status through variations in estrogen levels acts on the hematopoietic compartment and especially on B and T lymphocyte precursors. An elevated estrogen level decreases B lymphopoiesis, whereas a decrease in estrogen levels, following ovariectomy, induces an accumulation of pre-B cells in bone marrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Perry1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Thurmond1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, in the last few years, many reports have emphasized the role played by T lymphocytes through cytokine release, in the control of bone mass under normal physiological conditions or after gonadal failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Li1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. T cells have been shown to be one of the key activators of bone resorption via TNF&#x003b1; secretion, leading to osteoporosis in the absence of estrogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Cenci1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Roggia1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However these data remain controversial as Lee et al. (2006) have recently suggested that T lymphocytes are not implicated in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Lee1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. It is currently difficult to have a clear opinion on the precise role of lymphocytes in bone homeostasis, since lymphocytes secrete RANKL, TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1, IL-6, OPG or IFN&#x003b3;, which have all been shown to have either stimulatory or inhibitory effects on osteoclastogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Takayanagi1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Mature multinucleated osteoclasts are formed by the fusion of hematopoietic precursors of the myeloid/monocytic lineage. Although, signals driven by Receptor Activator of NF-&#x003ba;B Ligand (RANKL) and Macrophage-Colony-Stimulating Factor (M-CSF) are clearly essential for osteoclastogenesis, regulation by other receptor-mediated signals is less well defined. In addition, recent data have implicated co-stimulatory signals through DAP12 and FcR&#x003b3; molecular adaptors, which function in concert with many receptors such as TREM2 and OSCAR, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Turnbull1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. DAP12 (also called KARAP or TYROBP) is a small transmembrane polypeptide comprising a unique cytoplasmic ITAM signaling domain mediating all of its known effector functions. In humans, TREM2 or DAP12 deficiencies are responsible for Nasu-Hakola disease, a rare human disease, characterized at the bone level, by osteoporotic lesions at the extremities of long bones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Cella1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Paloneva1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, Dap12 complete deletion or Dap12 loss of function (K&#x00394;75) in mice leads to osteopetrosis due to the presence in bones of numerous but inactive multinucleated osteoclasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Koga1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Humphrey1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, in humans and mice, the bone phenotype appears just after puberty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Paloneva2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Kaifu1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> (our unpublished data). Unexpectedly, osteoclast differentiation and function of Nasu-Hakola patient-derived mononuclear myeloid precursors is impaired <italic>in vitro</italic>, similar to the severe block of osteoclast differentiation observed when bone or spleen myeloid precursors from Dap12-deficient mice are cultured in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL. However, co-cultures of Dap12-deficient hematopoietic precursors, together with M-CSF, RANKL and stromal cells or osteoblasts, can restore a weak osteoclastogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Koga1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Nataf1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, murine osteoclasts differentiate but function poorly whereas, <italic>in vitro</italic>, there is an early block of osteoclastogenesis as no multinucleated osteoclasts can be obtained. Differences between osteoclastogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> in humans and in mice, as well as co-culture experiments, suggest that other co-stimulatory signals are present in Dap12-deficient mice to allow osteoclast differentiation. Indeed, Koga et al. (2004) have demonstrated that FcR&#x003b3;, the other ITAM bearing adaptor protein expressed by osteoclasts, is critical for osteoclast differentiation. Although single FcR&#x003b3;-/- mice do not present any bone phenotype, Dap12;FcR&#x003b3; double knock-out mice exhibit a severe osteopetrosis compared to single Dap12-/- mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Koga1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in the absence of a functional DAP12 protein, FcR&#x003b3; mediates co-stimulatory signals that can restore a weak osteoclast differentiation. The binding of still unknown ligands to DAP12- and FcR&#x003b3;- associated receptors leads to the phosphorylation of their ITAM motif, which activates syk kinase and phopholipase C&#x003b3;, resulting in the amplification of NFATc1, an osteoclast master gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Koga1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Mocsai1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Faccio1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Mao1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Since Dap12 deficiency affects bone resorption after puberty and estrogens regulate the lymphoid cell compartment, we hypothesize that lymphocytes could act as a co-stimulatory signal to stimulate osteoclastogenesis in Dap12 loss of function mice. In this paper, we first show that gonadal failure is a permissive condition that triggers osteoclast resorption in K&#x00394;75 mice. We then address the role played by mature lymphocytes in normal osteoclastogenesis and in bone physiology, analyzing Rag1-/- mice lacking mature B and T lymphocytes, concomitantly with K&#x00394;75 and double mutant Rag1-/-;K&#x00394;75 mice. We show that mature lymphocytes play a similar role to DAP12 in protecting against bone degradation after ovariectomy in female adult mice. Our data support a role for lymphocytes during osteoclastogenesis and suggest that they may function as accessory cells under certain conditions when regular osteoclast function is compromised.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ovariectomy activates bone resorption in Dap12-deficient mice</title><p>Since bone mass in Dap12-deficient mice increases due to the inability of osteoclasts to resorb bone after puberty, we wanted to check whether estrogen withdrawal after ovariectomy could reactivate bone resorption and thus restore the bone mass phenotype. For this purpose, 8-week-old K&#x00394;75 and WT female mice were ovariectomized and sacrificed 4 weeks later and their long bones analyzed by histomorphometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Ovarian ablation was complete since uteral weight was significantly lower in ovariectomized compared to sham-operated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Bone histomorphometrical analysis showed that the control mice lost 30&#x00025; of bone mass one month after ovariectomy, but K&#x00394;75 mice lost 45&#x00025; of their bone mass under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g001">Figures 1A and C</xref>). This showed that bone resorption, which is impaired in K&#x00394;75 adult mice, can be restored after ovariectomy. Because ovariectomy is known to disturb lymphocyte population homeostasis in the bone marrow we also analyzed the hematopoietic cell distribution in the bone marrow and spleen of K&#x00394;75 mice after ovariectomy. As shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, only the B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B lymphocyte number doubled in the bone marrow after ovariectomy in both WT and K&#x00394;75 mice. The numbers of CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes, and Gr1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> granulocytes were not modified. In contrast, in spleen, the numbers of B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B lymphocytes, CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes, CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> dendritic cells and Gr1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> granulocytes were similar in both K&#x00394;75 and WT mice and were not modified by ovariectomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). It should be noted that CD11c dendritic cells in bone marrow, as well as CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T lymphocytes in spleen had increased in K&#x00394;75 mice but not in response to ovariectomy. This increase in B cell lymphocytes in the bone marrow of ovariectomized female adult mice is in agreement with published data for wild type ovariectomized mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Carlsten1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Masuzawa1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

In order to analyze the role of lymphocytes in osteoclast differentiation, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> osteoclast differentiation from spleen cells from Dap12 loss of function K&#x00394;75 mice versus WT littermates. Leukocytes, in the presence or absence of lymphocytes, were plated in the presence of MCSF and RANKL. In WT mouse cells, osteoclast differentiation occurred independently of the presence of lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g002">Figures 2A left panels and 2B</xref>). As expected, after 7 days in culture, no osteoclasts differentiated from K&#x00394;75 mouse leukocytes in the absence of lymphocytes. However, when lymphocytes were present in large amounts, we noticed a significant increase in TRAP activity, since 20&#x00025; of cells in culture were TRAP&#x0002b;. Among these, multinucleated TRAP&#x0002b; osteoclasts were identified, representing a third of the total number of multinucleated cells formed with WT precursors but containing, on average, 7 nuclei versus 20 in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g002">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>). This lymphocyte mediated osteoclastogenic effect was not due to RANKL, since addition of soluble RANKL to K&#x00394;75 mouse leukocytes in the absence of lymphocytes did not enhance osteoclast differentiation (data not shown). So, in addition to M-CSF and RANKL, and independently of RANKL concentration, lymphocytes partially restore osteoclast differentiation from Dap12-deficient hematopoietic precursor cells but have no stimulatory role on WT progenitors.</p><fig id="pone-0000585-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000585.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Lymphocytes enhance osteoclastogenesis from K&#x00394;75 but not from WT mouse spleen cells.</title><p>(A) WT and K&#x00394;75 mice spleen cells were isolated using different lymphocyte separation media to collect osteoclast precursors without (upper panels) or with (lower panels) lymphocytes.

We then checked whether, in addition to osteoclastogenesis, lymphocytes also stimulate bone resorbing activity of the formed osteoclasts. We evaluated several markers typical of mature functional osteoclasts and compared these activities with those of osteoclasts present in the bones of K&#x00394;75 mice. We first analyzed by RT-PCR the expression of an early differentiation marker (Cathepsin K), and a late differentiation marker (calcitonin receptor, CTR). RNA was extracted from WT and K&#x00394;75 bones without bone marrow (&#x0201c;<italic>in vivo</italic>&#x0201d;) and from WT or K&#x00394;75 mouse spleen cell cultures, enriched or not with lymphocytes (&#x0201c;<italic>in vitro</italic>&#x0201d;). Both Cathepsin K and CTR were expressed at similar levels in bones from WT or K&#x00394;75 mice <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). During <italic>in vitro</italic> osteoclast differentiation, cathepsin K was expressed at low levels and CTR was not detected in K&#x00394;75 cells compared to WT cells. However, in lymphocyte enriched cultures, cathepsin K and CTR were expressed by K&#x00394;75 cells, as well as by WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). From these results we can conclude that lymphocytes trigger the expression of differentiation markers of K&#x00394;75 osteoclast precursors. Because the main function of osteoclasts is to resorb bone matrix, we then decided to examine whether or not such differentiated osteoclasts would be able to resorb apatite mineralized matrix like <italic>in vivo</italic> K&#x00394;75 osteoclasts. For this purpose, we analyzed both their ability to form an actin containing sealing zone on calcium apatite and to resorb it. Functional tests for osteoclast activity were carried out on ACC (Apatite Collagen Complex) matrix. Osteoclasts differentiated from WT mouse cells formed a typical sealing zone on the ACC matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and resorbed it, as resorption pits could be observed in the vicinity of osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, white arrow). In contrast, osteoclasts differentiated from K&#x00394;75 mouse spleen cells, enriched in lymphocytes and spread on ACC matrix did not form any sealing zone but only actin-containing lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). These were not functional since they did not resorb the mineralized matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). This absence of resorption was also verified on dentine slices (not shown). So, in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL as well as lymphocytes, spleen cells from K&#x00394;75 mice can differentiate into multinucleated osteoclasts but these are not functional similarly to what is observed <italic>in vivo</italic> inK&#x00394;75 mice. Thus, by adding lymphocytes to <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures we can reproduce the <italic>in vivo</italic> osteoclast phenotype.

We first observed that Rag1-/- mice did not present any particular bone phenotype in comparison to WT animals of a similar genotype. This genetic approach allowed us to confirm once again that K&#x00394;75 mice had an increased bone mass (21&#x00025;) compared with WT or Rag1-/- mice. More importantly, we observed that DKO mice had an even higher increased bone mass to compare with K&#x00394;75 (30&#x00025;) and control or Rag1-/- mice (60&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000585-t001">Table 1</xref>). In comparison with other mice, trabeculae thickness was unchanged in the DKO animals. In addition, the number of trabaculae had increased, whereas the space between them was reduced. This phenotype is mostly due to impairment of osteoclast function, since the number of osteoclasts counted on bone surfaces was similar for all four backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), while collagen type I degradation products present in the urine of 12-week-old DKO female mice had decreased by 17&#x00025; compared with WT females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000585-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

It is required for normal bone homeostasis because mice with impaired DAP12 function, either by targeted inactivation of the ITAM domain or through its complete deletion, develop osteopetrosis after puberty due to the inability of osteoclasts to resorb bone. In this study, using Dap12 ITAM-deficient mice (K&#x00394;75), we expanded on these previous data by showing unexpectedly that bone resorption in mutant adult female mice is restored after ovariectomy. K&#x00394;75 adult female mice were much more sensitive to ovariectomy than WT littermates. Looking for potential cofactors that could act together with DAP12, to maintain bone homeostasis during adult life, we turned our interest toward lymphocytes. Adult Rag1-/- mice, which do not produce any mature B and T lymphocytes, do not present any bone phenotype but suffer a massive decrease in bone mass after ovariectomy. However, double mutant mice with an inactivated DAP12 protein in the absence of mature lymphocytes had increased osteopetrosis compared with K&#x00394;75 mice and their bone mass was decreased to the same extent as K&#x00394;75 animals after ovariectomy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000585-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Increasing evidence suggests that immune and skeletal systems share a number of regulatory molecules, but the role played by lymphocytes in bone homeostasis is still controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Li1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Weitzmann1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been proposed that T lymphocytes are important players in postmenopausal osteoporosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Cenci2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> but opposing data have also been published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Lee1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. T lymphocytes could act directly or indirectly on bone cells and mostly on osteoclasts through the secretion of various cytokines. However, even this is difficult to reconcile since T lymphocytes have been reported to secrete cytokines with osteoclastogenic activities such as RANKL, TNF&#x003b1;, IL1, IL6 or antiosteoclastogenic factors such as OPG. The effects of T cells on osteoclastogenesis should depend on the balance between the positive and negative factors that they express. For example, T cell-produced IFN&#x003b3; which has been reported to inhibit osteoclastogenesis directly but to stimulate it indirectly through antigen-driven T cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Takayanagi2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Gao1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, the role played by B lymphocytes is mostly recognized through the observation that B lymphopoiesis is stimulated during estrogen deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Masuzawa1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Miyaura1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. We reconfirmed this although only in the bone marrow of ovariectomized mice and not in spleen. It is therefore extremely difficult to reconcile all these contradictory data, which could also depend on the genetic background of animals studied. It is also possible to propose that the co-stimulatory pathways involved in osteoclastogenesis could play different, or even opposite roles in specific anatomical bone microenvironments as Wu et al. have shown for ITAM-bearing coadaptors &#x0005b;Wu et al., 2007, PLOSone&#x0005d;. In this work we show that in the specific context of Rag1-deficient mice, mature B and T lymphocytes do not play any role in normal adult bone homeostasis but overall bone mass is drastically reduced after ovariectomy. We cannot rule out the possibility that T and B lymphocytes play opposite roles, which are then nullified in the absence of the two populations. To decipher the role played by lymphocytes in bone homeostasis the specific role of lymphocyte subpopulations will have to be addressed. Indeed, a recent report by Sato et al. has shown the specific importance of the T helper 17 (Th17) subpopulation through secretion of IL17 in bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Sato1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The protective effect of DAP12 on ovariectomy-induced bone loss has been emphasized since we show here that bone resorption activity can be restored after ovariectomy of Dap12 loss of function mutant mice. Similar results have been obtained with female mice in which Dap12 has been completely deleted &#x0005b;Wu et al., 2007, PLOSone&#x0005d;. In the physiopathological context of gonadal failure, DAP12 impairment and lymphocyte depletion do not act synergistically since bone mass reduction after ovariectomy is the same when either one or both of these factors are disturbed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000585.s002">Data S2</xref>). However, B and T lymphocytes can partially compensate for the lack of DAP12 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, from our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies we have shown that lymphocytes enhance Dap12-deficient osteoclast precursor differentiation but do not activate their bone resorbing activity like osteoblasts or stromal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Mocsai1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Nataf1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Kaifu1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. This supports the observation that <italic>in vivo</italic>, the inhibition of osteoclast activity in K&#x00394;75 mice is more drastic in the absence of lymphocytes, leading to a more severe osteopetrosis, reinforcing the hypothesis that lymphocytes are somehow implicated in the control of bone mass reduction in relation to Dap12 deficiency.</p><p>From our results we can propose that lymphocytes play a similar role to the FcR&#x003b3; co-stimulatory pathway on osteoclastogenesis and bone mass homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Koga1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Mocsai1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Baron1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, the absence of mature lymphocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> mimics FcR&#x003b3; deficiency as far as bone mass homeostasis is concerned, according to data reported by Wu et al. (accompanying article). It is then possible to conclude that Dap12 and mature lymphocytes play similar roles in protecting bone mass in the specific context of gonadal failure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>K&#x00394;75 loss-of-function mice were derived from eight backcrosses with C57BL/6 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000585-Tomasello1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.
