Mutational inactivation of the tumour suppressor p53 gene is frequent in malignant gliomas. The role of p53 mutation in the anti-tumour responses of the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib in human glioblastoma cells is unknown. In this study, we used human glioblastoma cells with various p53 status; U87MG (with high and low p53 functional levels), LN229 (functional p53) and U373MG (mutant p53) cells. Inhibition of p53 was achieved in U87MG cells transfected with E6 oncoprotein (U87MG-E6) and treated with pifithrin-&#x003b1;, a reversible inhibitor of p53 (U87MG-PFT). We investigated whether the anti-glioblastoma responses of celecoxib were p53-dependent, and whether celecoxib induced DNA damage leading to p53-dependent G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle arrest, followed by autophagy or apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our findings demonstrated that celecoxib concentration-dependently reduced glioblastoma cell viability, following 24 and 72 hours of treatment. Inhibition of functional p53 in glioblastoma cells significantly reduced the anti-proliferative effect of celecoxib. In U87MG cells, celecoxib (8 and 30 &#x003bc;M) significantly induced DNA damage and inhibited DNA synthesis, corresponding with p53 activation. Celecoxib induced G<sub>1</sub>-phase cell cycle arrest, accompanied with p21 activation in U87MG cells. Cell cycle progression of U87MG-E6 and U87MG-PFT cells was not affected by celecoxib. In parallel, celecoxib induced G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle arrest in LN229 cells, but not in U373MG cells. Autophagy was induced by celecoxib in U87MG and LN229 cells, as shown by the significantly greater population of acridine orange-stained cells and increased levels of LC3-II protein (in comparison with non-treated controls). Celecoxib did not induce significant autophagy in U87MG-PFT, U87MG-E6 and U373MG cells, which lack functional p53. Regardless of p53 status, celecoxib caused no significant difference in apoptosis level of U87MG, U87MG-PFT, U87MG-E6 and U373MG cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings reveal that p53 increases human glioblastoma sensitivity to celecoxib.

Most patients with glioblastoma multiforme survive less than 2 years after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Therapeutic improvements are needed to extend the survival of malignant glioma patients. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, an isoform of COX which is the rate-limiting enzyme in conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins, is inducible in the presence of cytokines and growth factors during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The importance of COX-2 in carcinogenesis and brain tumour progression is highlighted by the detection of COX-2 in brain tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and COX-2 overexpression in gliomas associated with poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Targeting COX-2 with selective COX-2 inhibitors (NS-398, SC-236 and celecoxib) has proven effective to reduce human glioblastoma cell viability <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and in rodent models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Celecoxib is the only selective COX-2 inhibitor approved by the FDA for adjuvant treatment of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.</p><p>The molecular events underlying the anti-tumour properties of COX-2 inhibitors are not fully understood. Several mechanisms have been proposed in various tumour models. COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib induces G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle arrest, corresponding with activation of G<sub>1</sub>-phase cyclin-CDK inhibitors, p21 and p27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Celecoxib activates apoptotic proteins BAD, caspases and PARP, followed by cell apoptosis and reduced tumour cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Anti-tumour mechanisms of COX-2 inhibitors also include inhibition of tumour angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], inhibition of prostaglandin-induced immunosuppressive activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and increased DNA damage/reduced DNA repair capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Peroxidation of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins by COX generates reactive oxygen species and free radicals, which induce DNA damage and tumourigenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Inhibition of COX by COX inhibitors aspirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], nimesulide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], rofecoxib and celecoxib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] protects DNA from oxidative damage by scavenging hydroxyl radicals and superoxide <italic>in vitro </italic>in non-tumour models. However, prevention of DNA damage by COX inhibitors has not been reported in tumour cells. In contrast, aspirin significantly induces DNA damage of HT-29 human colon carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], whereas celecoxib causes DNA damage in MCa-35 murine mammary and A549 human lung cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Whether COX-2 inhibitors induce DNA damage in glioblastoma cells is unclear.</p><p>Mutational inactivation of the tumour suppressor gene p53 (a regulator of cell growth and death) is frequently found in human tumours, with p53 mutation/inactivation reported in 63&#x02013;65% of high-grade gliomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Induction of DNA damage initiates a cascade of signalling with p53 activation (phosphorylation at Ser 15 and Ser 20) and subsequent transcriptional activation of p53 response genes (including p21, GADD45, BAX, PUMA, Bcl2 and NOXA), thus provoking cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Genotoxic stress caused by DNA-damaging agents also induce p53-dependent autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], the type II programmed cell death characterised by the formation of cytosolic double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) that engulf cellular content by digestion, when fused with lysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The mechanisms of p53-dependent induction of autophagy are not fully understood, but are thought to involve both the transcription-independent functions (e.g. activation of the nutrient energy sensor AMP kinase) and transcription-dependent functions (e.g. upregulation of mTOR inhibitors PTEN and TSC1, or p53-regulated autophagy and cell death gene DRAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Anti-tumour mechanisms by COX inhibition have been shown to be either p53-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] or p53-independent in various cancer and non-cancer cells. The anti-proliferative mechanism of COX-2 inhibitors underpin by autophagy induction in tumours is unclear. To date, only one recent report suggests that celecoxib induces both autophagy and apoptosis, mediated by P-glycoprotein independent of p53 mechanisms, in hepatocellular carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The role of p53 in celecoxib-induced autophagy and celecoxib-induced anti-proliferative responses clearly needs to be verified.</p><p>In this study, we investigated (a) whether the anti-proliferative response induced by celecoxib was dependent on the presence of functional p53 and b) whether celecoxib-induced DNA damage resulted in p53-dependent G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle arrest, followed by apoptosis or autophagy. We studied the effect of celecoxib in human glioblastoma cells with various p53 status; U87MG cells with high and low levels of p53 [by both genetic (oncoprotein E6) and pharmaceutical intervention (pifithrin-&#x003b1;)], LN229 (with wild type p53 function despite a p53 mutation in the coding sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]) and U373MG (with mutant p53) cells. Our findings show that the anti-proliferative sensitivity of celecoxib is dependent on p53 in human glioblastoma cells. We further demonstrate that celecoxib enhances glioma cytotoxicity by induction of DNA damage and p53-dependent G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle arrest, followed by p53-dependent autophagy but not apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Celecoxib concentration-dependently inhibited human glioblastoma cell viability, with enhanced anti-proliferative response by the presence of functional p53</title><p>Celecoxib concentration-dependently reduced the viability of human glioblastoma cells U87MG, which contains wild-type p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;D</xref>). To determine whether the anti-proliferative response to celecoxib was dependent on p53, we first compared the effect of celecoxib on viability of U87MG-E6 and U87MG cells. Viral oncoprotein E6 inhibits p53 function by abrogating specific DNA binding and transactivation of p53, sequestering p53 into the cytoplasm and accelerating its degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Inhibition of p53 by oncoprotein E6 reduced the sensitivity of U87MG cells to celecoxib, as shown by the enhanced U87MG-E6 cell viability following celecoxib treatment, compared with non-transfected U87MG cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;B</xref>).

The prerequisite of p53 to protect U87MG cells from the anti-proliferative effect of celecoxib was confirmed with U87MG cells treated with PFT (U87MG-PFT). PFT-&#x003b1; inhibits p53 by reversibly blocking p53-transcriptional activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Inhibition of p53 by PFT significantly reduced sensitivity of U87MG cells to celecoxib, with enhanced U87MG-PFT cell viability at 24 and 72 hours following celecoxib treatment, compared with untreated U87MG cells (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C&#x02013;D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Concentration-dependent response of celecoxib on viability of human glioblastoma cells</bold>.

These results parallel the enhanced anti-proliferative responses of celecoxib in U87MG cells (high level of functional p53), compared with U87MG-E6 and U87MG-PFT (low functional level of p53), thus verifying a p53-dependent anti-proliferative response induced by celecoxib. In subsequent experiments, we tested the effect of celecoxib at 8 &#x003bc;M, a concentration equivalent to human plasma concentration following consumption of 800 mg/kg celecoxib daily (the FDA approved dosage for familial adenomatous polyposis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]), as well as at 30 &#x003bc;M, a lower than EC<sub>50 </sub>concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Celecoxib activated p53</title><p>We verified that stable transfection of U87MG cells with oncoprotein E6 inhibited p53 protein expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

In this study, we analysed the p53-dependent anti-proliferative effect induced by a selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib in human glioblastoma cells. Our findings demonstrate that celecoxib induced p53-dependent G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle arrest followed by autophagy, which are critical for inhibiting growth and proliferation of glioblastoma cells containing functional p53.

In brain tumours, this finding is the first to report a p53-dependent anti-glioblastoma effect of a selective COX-2 inhibitor, which supports selective usage of celecoxib in human glioblastomas with functional p53 for enhanced anti-tumour responses.</p><p>p53 is a key molecule in DNA damage response, causing inhibition of cell proliferation by induction of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis/autophagy or senescence. The inhibitory effect of p53 on cell proliferation is due to transcriptional activation of target genes such as p21, GADD45, Bax, DR5 and PUMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In this study, inhibition of COX-2 by celecoxib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] activated p53 in human glioblastoma U87MG cells, as demonstrated by translocation of p53 from cytoplasm to nucleus accompanied with accumulation of total p53 expression. In line with our study, activation of p53 by COX inhibitors has also been demonstrated in colon and oral cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. We investigated whether celecoxib-induced p53 activation is followed by cell cycle arrest, apoptosis or autophagy in human glioblastoma cells. One study demonstrated a tumour cell-type dependent effect of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis following celecoxib treatment. Liu and colleagues (2003) reported that celecoxib-induced DNA damage led to G<sub>2</sub>M cell cycle arrest in mammary (and not lung) cancer, but apoptosis in lung (and not mammary) cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The underlying mechanisms for these differential celecoxib-induced functional responses were not addressed. Our study in human glioblastoma cells reveal that celecoxib-induced p53 activation is followed by p53-dependent G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle arrest and p21 activation. Celecoxib-induced G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle arrest accompanied by increased p21 protein expression has been reported in human cholangiocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], colorectal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], hepatocellular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and prostate cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>While apoptosis is considered a major anti-proliferative mechanism of celecoxib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], our findings show that induction of p53-dependent G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle arrest by celecoxib is followed by p53-dependent cell autophagy and not apoptosis. It should be noted that higher concentrations of celecoxib (40&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M) induce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The celecoxib concentrations (40&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M) are 4 to 11-fold greater than 8 &#x003bc;M, the human plasma concentration of celecoxib after consumption of 800 mg/kg per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and the concentration that is presently used in this study. Mazzanti et al. (2009) recently showed that celecoxib (10 and 20 &#x003bc;M) induces apoptosis, but lower concentrations of celecoxib (at 2.5 and 5 &#x003bc;M) induce autophagy in hepatocellular carcinoma cells that are cultured in serum-free medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The sensitivity of tumour cells to celecoxib-induced cellular apoptosis or autophagy is likely to be concentration- or tumour type-dependent. The role of p53 in autophagy remains controversial with studies suggesting activation of p53, as well as inhibition of p53, as inductive of autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In our study, induction of autophagy by celecoxib in glioblastoma cells is p53-dependent, as shown by the autophagy induction only in celecoxib-treated glioblastoma cells with high (and not low) functional level of p53. In contrast, Mazzanti et al. (2009) reported that induction of autophagy by celecoxib (2.5 and 5 &#x003bc;M) is mediated by P-glycoprotein and Bcl2 via a p53-independent mechanism. The role of autophagy in cancer development is complex, as it has been implicated in both tumour survival and tumour cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Induction of cell cycle arrest preceding autophagy induction inhibits tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Our results support the induction of p53-dependent G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle arrest, followed by autophagy as a mechanism for celecoxib to prevent glioma cell survival. Induction of p53-dependent autophagy independent of apoptosis should be considered as one of the underlying anti-proliferative mechanisms of COX-2 inhibitors, celecoxib in particular, in various tumours.</p><p>We investigated the 'up-stream' mechanisms preceding p53 activation in U87MG cells treated with celecoxib. We found that celecoxib (8 and 30 &#x003bc;M) induced DNA damage, accompanied with inhibition of DNA synthesis in U87MG cells, which led to p53-induced G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle arrest and autophagy events. These findings of celecoxib-induced DNA damage followed by p53-dependent G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle arrest and autophagy are clinically relevant since low concentration of celecoxib (8 &#x003bc;M) are attainable in human serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In cancer cells, DNA damage was induced following celecoxib treatment (at high concentrations of 50 and 100 &#x003bc;M) in murine lung (A549) and mammary (MCa-35) cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and by the non-selective COX inhibitor aspirin in HT-29 human colon carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Activation of DNA damage-p53 signalling by COX-2 inhibitors has not been reported. One study proposes induction of DNA damage by the COX inhibitor R-flurbiprofen following the observation that R-flurbiprofen increases p53 (Ser 15) phosphorylation in colon cancer cells, but this has yet to be verified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Our study demonstrates that selective COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib induces DNA damage and inhibits DNA synthesis, resulting in p53 activation and subsequent anti-proliferative effects in glioblastoma cells. The mechanisms underlying celecoxib-induced DNA damage remain unclear and are beyond the scope of this study. Whilst inhibition of COX-2 expression is reported to reduce generation of reactive oxygen species and prevent DNA damage, recent studies show that COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] and sulindac [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], induce reactive oxygen species to mediate anti-tumour responses. Seo et al.

It is possible that celecoxib induces reactive oxygen species, followed by activation of DNA damage-p53 signalling to mediate anti-glioblastoma effects, but this requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study reveals an important underlying mechanism of celecoxib-mediated inhibition of glioblastoma cell growth, by induction of DNA damage leading to p53-dependent G<sub>1 </sub>cell cycle arrest and autophagy, but not apoptosis.

Trypsinised cells were re-suspended in phenol red-free growth media (Gibco BRL) and 10,000 events were analysed by FACS with CellQuest Pro software. Acridine orange-stained cells grown on cover slips were viewed under a Laser Scanning Microscope and images captured using software LSM510.</p></sec><sec><title>Comet assays and <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine incorporation assays</title><p>DNA damage was analysed by Comet assays as follows: Sub-confluent cells were treated with DMSO or celecoxib (8 and 30 &#x003bc;M) for 5 and 18 hours. Cells were mixed with 0.5% low melting point agarose and allowed to solidify on slides. Slides were immersed in lysis buffer, electrophoresis in tris-base buffer, stained with SYBR Green 1 (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) and analysed with fluorescence microscopy. DNA damage, characterised by formation of comet tails, was quantitated by tail moments (multiplication of DNA tail migration from cell nucleus with DNA content) using Comet Score Freeware (Tritek Corporation, Summerduck, VA).</p><p>DNA synthesis was quantified with <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine incorporation assays as follows: Sub-confluent cells were labeled with [methyl-<sup>14</sup>C]-thymidine (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) overnight, followed by celecoxib treatment (8 and 30 &#x003bc;M, 5 hours). After wash, cells were incubated with medium containing [methyl-<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 minutes, followed by 5% trichloroacetic acid and then 100% ethanol. Cells were air-dried, lysed in 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate and 10 mM NaOH, and subsequently the radioactivity measured with a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac, Turku, Finland). A control sample labelled with [methyl-<sup>14</sup>C]-thymidine alone was included to determine [methyl-<sup>14</sup>C]-thymidine signal spillover into [methyl-<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine channel. DNA synthesis was presented as a percentage of [methyl-<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine/[methyl-<sup>14</sup>C]-thymidine ratio in celecoxib-treated cells over controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All values are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard error of mean (S.E.M.) and <italic>n </italic>indicates number of independent experiments. The concentration-dependent effect of celecoxib on viability of glioblastoma cells was analysed by 2-way analysis of variance (2-way ANOVA). The effect of celecoxib on DNA damage, DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression, autophagy and cell apoptosis were analysed by 1-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's test (control vs. celecoxib, 8 or 30 &#x003bc;M). The effect of PFT on cell apoptosis and autophagy in U87MG cells was analysed by Mann-Whitney U-test. A <italic>P </italic>value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. GB-STAT (Dynamic Microsystems, Silver Springs, MD) statistical package was used in all calculations.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA: analysis of variance; AVO: acidic vesicular organelle; BSA: bovine serum albumin; COX-2: cyclooxygenase-2; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; FBS: fetal bovine serum; FDA: Food and Drug Administration; LC3: light chain-3; PFT: pifithrin-&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KBK, SKY and QHG performed the experiments.
