When grown on a bacterial lawn, these cells aggregate before the bacteria are completely cleared. In bacterial suspension, mutant cells express the developmental marker discoidin I&#x003b3; even at low cell densities and high concentrations of bacteria. In the absence of nutrients, mutant cells aggregate more rapidly than wild type, but the rest of development is unaffected and normal fruiting bodies are formed. The disrupted gene shows substantial homology to the recently described <italic>gdt</italic>1 gene, and therefore was named <italic>gdt</italic>2. While GDT1 and GDT2 are similar in many ways, there are intriguing differences. GDT2 contains a well conserved protein kinase domain, unlike GDT1, whose kinase domain is probably non-functional. The <italic>gdt</italic>2 and <italic>gdt</italic>1 mRNAs are regulated differently, with <italic>gdt</italic>2 but not <italic>gdt</italic>1 expressed throughout development.

As long as nutrients are abundant, <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>cells grow as individual amoebae. When nutrients are depleted, starving cells aggregate to form a multicellular mound, and finally differentiate into fruiting bodies, consisting of several different cell types. The switch from growth to differentiation is controlled by a number of interacting factors, including the nutritional state of cells, measures of the food supply, and a range of extracellular signals. Several of these signals are generated by nearby <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>cells. Some allow cells to judge the local density of competitors, while others allow populations of cells to cooperate and develop simultaneously. We are currently well short of an understanding of how all these signals are interpreted by cells and integrated to allow a switch in the genetic programme.</p><p>During growth <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>cells continuously synthesize and secrete autocrine factors which accumulate in proportion to cell density. At appropriate concentrations these factors cause changes in gene expression and prepare cells for the initiation of development. A glycoprotein called prestarvation factor (PSF) is secreted by growing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The effect of this protein is counteracted by food bacteria. Cells can detect the level of PSF and thus estimate their own density relative to the abundance of the food source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The "prestarvation response" occurs during increasing of PSF levels and decreasing of food source, and can be detected a few generations before actual starvation occurs. The discoidin I gene family is among the first genes to be activated in the prestarvation response. When food is depleted and cells stop growing, PSF production declines and a separate starvation response is activated. Starving cells secrete another glycoprotein, condition medium factor (CMF), which is essential for establishing of cAMP signalling and the initiation of aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Starvation causes a further increase in discoidin expression, after which discoidin continues to accumulate in early development until its transcription is inhibited by extracellular cAMP at the end of aggregation phase. Expression of discoidin is therefore an excellent reporter for the state of cells within the developmental programme.</p><p>Several genes have been found to regulate the growth-differentiation transition (GDT) in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. Protein kinase A (PKA) plays a critical role and has been implicated in multiple pathways involved in later development. Strains carrying disruptions in PKA exhibit arrest of development on early stage and fail to aggregate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Similarly, the protein kinase YakA, homolog of yeast Yak1p growth regulating protein kinase, is also required for the turning off of growth stage genes and induction of developmental genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. YakA<sup>- </sup>mutant cells are also unable to aggregate. Other genes regulating the growth-differentiation transition include <italic>Dia</italic>2, a gene of yet unknown function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and also <italic>ami</italic>A and <italic>ami</italic>B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <italic>Ami</italic>A is homologous to a yeast gene of unknown function, while <italic>ami</italic>B does not show homology to any known genes. Both genes positively regulate the growth-differentiation transition possibly via regulation of adenylyl cyclase expression.</p><p>Three negative regulators of the growth-differentiation transition have been described. <italic>Puf</italic>A encodes a member of Puf protein family of translational regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. PufA is a translational inhibitor of PKA mRNA, and its levels are downregulated by the YakA kinase. <italic>Dia</italic>1, a gene with no homology to any known genes, appears to be negatively coupled to both the cAMP receptor cAR1 and the adenylyl cyclase ACA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Antisense-mediated inactivation of <italic>dia</italic>1 enhances the progression of differentiation. Finally, <italic>gdt</italic>1 is a gene which encodes a transmembrane protein with a kinase-homology domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], although interestingly the kinase domain is unlikely to be functionally active. <italic>Gdt</italic>1 null cells display accelerated aggregation. Examination of double PKA<sup>-</sup>/<italic>gdt</italic>1<sup>- </sup>mutants and <italic>in vitro </italic>phosphorylation data show that <italic>gdt</italic>1 is likely to be a downstream target of PKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this study we identify a new gene related to <italic>gdt</italic>1. Like <italic>gdt</italic>1, <italic>gdt</italic>2 acts as a negative regulator of the growth-differentiation transition in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. We demonstrate that GDT1 and GDT2 exemplify a family of related proteins which together may serve to mediate the full complexity of the transition between growth and differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of REMI mutant IR32</title><p>The mutant described in this study was found during a screen of REMI-mutagenised library for mutants resistant to propranolol, a phospholipase D (PLD) pathway inhibitor. The original goal of the screen was to discover new genes involved in PLD function. We isolated a REMI mutant, IR32, which was able to aggregate on <italic>Klebsiella </italic>lawns in the presence of 1 mM propranolol. Under these conditions the parental Ax2 cells are totally unable to initiate aggregation (data not shown). However, both growth and development of IR32 cells were inhibited to the same extent as wild type cells by butan-1-ol, another PLD inhibitor (data not shown). It therefore appeared that the gene disrupted by REMI was involved in the initiation of development, rather than being part of a PLD signalling pathway.</p><p>A fragment of the disrupted gene was isolated from mutant IR32 by plasmid rescue using genomic DNA digested with BclI. The sequence of this fragment was used to search <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>genome project databases. Several partial cDNA clones and genomic contigs were found, allowing us to identify the disrupted gene as a homologue of the <italic>Dictyostelium gdt</italic>1 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This new gene was therefore named <italic>gdt</italic>2. The <italic>gdt</italic>2 coding region was interrupted by REMI about 4 kb downstream of predicted start of the ORF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To prove that this disruption caused the phenotype, and that the phenotype was the result of a simple loss of function, we generated fresh mutants disrupted in the first half of the <italic>gdt</italic>2 gene. Several clones were identified by colony phenotype and shown by Southern blot to carry an insertion in <italic>gdt</italic>2 gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). All <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>clones displayed the same phenotype (data not shown) and were found to be identical in phenotype to the original REMI mutant IR32.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of the <italic>gdt</italic>2 gene. </bold>(A) Schematic map of the <italic>gdt</italic>2 gene.

Likewise, each displayed accelerated aggregation when developed on non-nutrient agar (see below). This confirmed that the original REMI insertion caused the phenotype of IR32.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence analysis of the <italic>gdt</italic>2 gene</title><p>Sequence analysis of the genomic contig revealed an open reading frame of 4.6 kb, interrupted by 5 small introns. The ORF within the <italic>gdt</italic>2 gene is predicted to produce a protein of 1637 amino acids, with a mass of 185 kDa. Analysis of the predicted protein by structure-predicting programmes (SMART, TMHMM and MEMSAT) revealed an N-terminal signal sequence for secretion/membrane inclusion, at least 1 and most likely 3 potential transmembrane domains, and a kinase homology domain at the C-terminal end of the protein (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). As mentioned above, GDT2 showed substantial homology to GDT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It is worth mentioning that the original <italic>gdt</italic>1 sequence deposited in the database was incomplete at its 5' end. Our analysis showed that GDT1 has an extra 101 amino acids at its N-terminus, the first 20 of which represent a putative signal sequence. The kinase domain of GDT1 is interrupted by a poly-Asn containing insert and presents many substitutions to well conserved amino acids, particularly in the catalytic loop. It is therefore presumed to be non-functional. The kinase domain of GDT2 is uninterrupted and includes all the typical amino acids for a classical serine/threonine protein kinases. It therefore seems likely that GDT2, unlike GDT1, is a fully functional protein kinase.</p></sec><sec><title>A family of <italic>gdt</italic>1 and <italic>gdt</italic>2 like genes</title><p>Analysis of the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>genome revealed a family of genes which were closely related to <italic>gdt</italic>1 and <italic>gdt</italic>2. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, we identified six additional full-length genes and one pseudogene (<italic>gdt</italic>1 DDB0215003, <italic>gdt</italic>2 DDB0201878, <italic>gdt</italic>3 DDB0186734, <italic>gdt</italic>4 DDB0201754, <italic>gdt</italic>5 DDB0186736, <italic>gdt</italic>6 DDB0201749, <italic>gdt</italic>7 DDB0184322, <italic>gdt</italic>8 DDB0201879 at The <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). Three of the full-length genes (<italic>gdt</italic>2, <italic>gdt</italic>3 and <italic>gdt</italic>4) encode complete, well conserved (and therefore presumably functional) kinase domains; another three (<italic>gdt</italic>1, <italic>gdt</italic>6 and <italic>gdt</italic>8) seem to encode proteins with degenerate protein kinase domains. GDT5 presents a C-terminal sequence unrelated to protein kinases, while GDT7 appears truncated and stops before the protein kinase domain. All the GDT proteins share extensive homology in first 1000 amino acids (700 for the truncated GDT7) despite some insertions or deletions. All the homologs start with a clear signal sequence for secretion/membrane inclusion. Additionally, all have at least one strongly predicted transmembrane domain located between amino acids 600 to 1000 and two weaker ones in the region of amino acids 120 to 200. Since the proteins are well conserved, they should also share the same topology. Combining the transmembrane predictions with the multiple alignment leads to the proposed model of 3 transmembrane domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Neighbor joining phylogenetic analysis clustered these genes into two groups, with group 2 containing the three functional kinases and group 1 containing the others (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In the genome the <italic>gdt </italic>genes form 3 clusters of two genes each plus two singletons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Each cluster includes a member of the groups 1 and 2, suggesting that the clusters arose by duplications of an initial tandem pair of genes.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>A family of proteins related to GDT1 and GDT2. </bold>8 GDT proteins are shown schematically.

To test whether discoidin expression is regulated by folate in the <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>mutant, cells were grown in axenic medium and treated with 1 mM folate for various times, while cell density was maintained at around 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml. In wild type cells discoidin expression was considerably reduced after 8 hours of folate treatment and was nearly undetectable thereafter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>cells, on the other hand, produced a higher amount of discoidin than wild type cells, but expression of discoidin clearly decreased under folate treatment. Thus, the phenotype of the mutant was not caused by an inability to sense folate levels.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Sensitivity of <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>mutants to folate. </bold>Ax2 and g14 cells were grown in axenic medium in presence of 1 mM folate while cell density was maintained at about 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml.

Earlier studies had shown that amino acids specifically inhibit initiation of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In our experiments, <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>cells starved in submerged culture started to form aggregation streams after 8 hours of incubation, whereas Ax2 cells started to aggregate about 1 hour later (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). When the buffer was supplemented with essential amino acids and glucose (see Methods), both wild type and mutant cells exhibited delayed aggregation compared to unsupplemented buffer, but the delay was more substantial for wild type cells. <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>cells started to make streams after 13&#x02013;14 hours of incubation, whereas wild type cells started to stream only after 18&#x02013;19 hours. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>, after 25 hours of incubation <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>mutant cells had completed aggregation and made mounds, whereas Ax2 cells were still streaming. Thus, while the mutant was still able to sense amino acids, it was considerably less sensitive than the wild type.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Aggregation of <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>cells in the presence of amino acids and folate. </bold>Cells were harvested from axenic culture at exponential growth phase, washed and plated at a density of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/cm<sup>2 </sup>in buffer containing either amino acids (A) or 1 mM folate (B). In the presence of amino acids <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>mutant cells aggregate 4&#x02013;5 hours earlier than wild type, while in the presence of folate they aggregate only 1 hour earlier than wild type, as they do in unsupplemented buffer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-4-8-9"/></fig><p>To determine whether this effect was specific to amino acids, we used folate to inhibit aggregation. Folate at a concentration of 10 &#x003bc;M caused 1.5&#x02013;2 hours delay in starting aggregation in submerged culture. Under this folate concentration the time difference in starting aggregation between the mutant and wild type was about 1 hour (data not shown). Higher concentrations of folate caused stronger inhibition of aggregation. Cells incubated in the presence of 1 mM folate started to aggregate after 15 hours (even later than cells incubated with amino acids), but the time difference in starting aggregation was again the same between the mutant and wild type &#x02013; about 1 hour. After 25 hours both wild type and the mutant were breaking streams and making mounds (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>).</p><p>The above experiments show that the <italic>gdt</italic>2 mutant is clearly different from wild type in its response to amino acids, but it is not significantly different in folate response.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein kinase A and the <italic>gdt</italic>2 phenotype</title><p>A large body of work has shown that PKA is a major regulator of early <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>development. Overactivation of PKA leads to premature aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], while loss of the catalytic subunit results in cells that never initiate development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Since <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>mutants showed premature aggregation, we investigated PKA expression and activity in the mutant and in the wild type.</p><p>Our preliminary data using H-89, cell permeable inhibitor of PKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], showed that discoidin expression was inhibited upon PKA inhibition in the mutant to about the same extent as in the wild type (data not shown). It suggests that the disruption of <italic>gdt</italic>2 caused an increase in the level of discoidin expression but did not greatly affect its PKA-dependent regulation. Northern blots showed that mRNA of the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-C) was expressed at about the same level in the mutant as in wild type in vegetative cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10A</xref>). After 3&#x02013;4 hours of starvation, expression of PKA-C mRNA increased in both wild type and the mutant, though it increased somewhat more in the wild type. Interestingly, the expression of PKA-C protein was slightly higher in the mutant than in wild type at corresponding time points of development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10B</xref>). However, although there were some differences between PKA mRNA and protein levels later in development, both were very similar in growing cells at the stage when <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>mutants prematurely initiate development.</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p><bold>Protein kinase A expression and activity. </bold>mRNA (A) and protein (B) extracts were prepared from vegetative cells and cells at different time points of development.

The difference in PKA activity was indistinguishable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10C</xref>). Taken together, this data indicate that GDT2 does not exert its effects by modulating PKA activity. It remains possible that it acts downstream of PKA and mediates a subset of cellular responses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The soil amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum </italic>has a relatively simple developmental programme compared to higher eukaryotic multicellular organisms. Nonetheless, the change from growth to development is regulated by a complex series of signals designed to ensure that aggregation only occurs under optimal conditions. In the prestarvation response, during which cells anticipate future starvation and prepare to develop, expression of a number of genes is induced, and when starvation occurs and cells are triggered to aggregate, changes in gene expression occur in a wholesale fashion. Recent studies of gene transcription profiles show that aggregation of unicellular amoebae to multicellular structures is accompanied by a change in the expression of more than 25% of the genes in the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In this work we have described a new gene, <italic>gdt2</italic>, which is important for the control of this process. We isolated a REMI mutant which was able to develop in the presence of propranolol. The mutated gene was found to be a novel gene. The mutant showed premature expression of discoidin and premature aggregation. Morphological development was not affected in <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>mutants, thus allowing us to assume that <italic>gdt</italic>2 was predominantly involved in the growth-differentiation transition, but was not essential for later development.</p><p>It is clear that the prestarvation response in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>depends on two major factors: cell density and the abundance of food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It is possible that the <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>mutant was impaired in calculating the density of neighbouring cells and/or in sensing of food. We have shown here that <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>cells are able to estimate their own density (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), but we cannot exclude that the mutant has either enhanced PSF production or a higher sensitivity to PSF. However, it is more likely that the mechanisms of sensing some of food components are seriously impaired, although not abolished in the mutant. Our measurements of amino acid sensitivity support this hypothesis. In addition, the <italic>gdt</italic>2 mRNA is expressed during growth and throughout development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), which may reflect a role for the <italic>gdt2 </italic>gene product in dedifferentiation as well as the primary decision to initiate development.</p><p>Mutants lacking <italic>gdt</italic>1 show similar phenotypes to <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>mutants. The <italic>gdt</italic>1<sup>- </sup>mutants also overexpress discoidin and show premature entry into the developmental cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, there are major differences. The <italic>gdt</italic>1<sup>- </sup>mutants display slow growth compared to wild type cells, whereas <italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>cells grow at the same rate as wild type. mRNA expression patterns of <italic>gdt</italic>1 and <italic>gdt</italic>2 are also different. The expression of <italic>gdt</italic>1 mRNA increases with cell density in vegetative cells and rapidly decreases after the onset of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We expected to see a similar pattern of <italic>gdt</italic>2 mRNA expression, or at least a decrease in mRNA upon starvation. Surprisingly, we found the <italic>gdt</italic>2 mRNA to be expressed at about the same level in vegetative cells and throughout development. Taken together, the similarities and dissimilarities between <italic>gdt</italic>1 and <italic>gdt</italic>2 mutants' phenotypes and gene expression patterns allow us to propose that these two genes possibly regulate some or all of the same cellular processes, but are regulated by parallel signal transduction pathways. These genes are possibly most important at different points in the developmental cycle. It would be interesting to see a phenotype of a double <italic>gdt</italic>1<sup>-</sup>/<italic>gdt</italic>2<sup>- </sup>mutant, if a double knockout of these genes was possible.</p><p>Here we have also described a family including <italic>gdt</italic>1, <italic>gdt</italic>2 and 6 more genes in the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>genome. The similarities between these genes suggest that they all may be involved in regulation of the process of development, probably responding to different extracellular signals. However, the particular roles of the members of the family remain to be explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have isolated a <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>REMI mutant, which initiates multicellular development earlier than the wild type. The genome rescue showed that the disruption occurred in a new gene, which was named <italic>gdt</italic>2. G<italic>dt</italic>2 codes for a transmembrane protein with a kinase domain. Using developmental assays we have shown that <italic>gdt</italic>2 is involved in control of the growth-differentiation transition. We have also described a family of <italic>gdt</italic>1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and <italic>gdt</italic>2 related genes in the <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>genome. The family is comprised of eight genes coding for transmembrane proteins with and without kinase domains.
