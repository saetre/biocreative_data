The neuropathology of TSC is often associated with seizures and intellectual disability. To learn about the developmental perturbations that lead to these brain lesions, we created a mouse model that selectively deletes the <italic>Tsc2</italic> gene from radial glial progenitor cells in the developing cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These <italic>Tsc2</italic> mutant mice were severely runted, developed post-natal megalencephaly and died between 3 and 4 weeks of age. Analysis of brain pathology demonstrated cortical and hippocampal lamination defects, hippocampal heterotopias, enlarged dysplastic neurons and glia, abnormal myelination and an astrocytosis. These histologic abnormalities were accompanied by activation of the mTORC1 pathway as assessed by increased phosphorylated S6 in brain lysates and tissue sections. Developmental analysis demonstrated that loss of Tsc2 increased the subventricular Tbr2-positive basal cell progenitor pool at the expense of early born Tbr1-positive post-mitotic neurons. These results establish the novel concept that loss of function of <italic>Tsc2</italic> in radial glial progenitors is one initiating event in the development of TSC brain lesions as well as underscore the importance of Tsc2 in the regulation of neural progenitor pools. Given the similarities between the mouse and the human TSC lesions, this model will be useful in further understanding TSC brain pathophysiology, testing potential therapies and identifying other genetic pathways that are altered in TSC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The autosomal dominant tumor suppressor disorder, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), bears its name from the tuber-like brain lesions described by Desire-Magloire Bourneville in the late 1800s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C1">1</xref>). Most affected patients have a germline inactivating mutation of either <italic>TSC1</italic> or <italic>TSC2</italic>, encoding the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C3">3</xref>). Loss of the second allele, leading to loss of heterozygosity (LOH), has been shown to predispose to tumor formation in many organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C5">5</xref>). Although any organ can be affected, the brain, skin, kidney, lung and heart are principal sites of pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C6">6</xref>). The effects of TSC on the brain are particularly debilitating, encompassing a variety of lesions such as cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, white matter linear migration lines, corpus callosum abnormalities and transmantal cortical dysplasia associated with hemimegalencephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C7">7</xref>). The histopathology of tubers is characterized by generalized cellular disorganization, astrocytosis and characteristic giant cells. The neuropathology of TSC is associated with epilepsy, developmental delay, behavioral abnormalities and autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C10">10</xref>). Because the neurologic sequelae of TSC cause significant morbidity and mortality, there is intense interest in understanding and treating the brain manifestations of this disease.</p><p>Hamartin and tuberin form a biochemical TSC complex that inhibits the insulin- and nutrient-induced mTOR/S6K/4E-BP1 signal transduction pathway that controls translation, proliferation and cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C13">13</xref>). This inhibition is mediated primarily through the GTPase activity of the TSC complex toward Rheb-GTP, a small Ras-like protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C15">15</xref>). Rheb-GTP normally activates the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex, called mTORC1, in which the mTOR kinase is associated with the proteins raptor and G&#x003b2;L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C17">17</xref>). Loss of either TSC1 or TSC2 in TSC abolishes Rheb-GTPase activity, resulting in constitutively activated mTORC1. Activated mTORC1 kinase leads to increased levels of several phosphorylated proteins of the translational apparatus, such as S6 kinase and ribosomal protein S6. The end result is increased translation, cell size and proliferation. The giant cells of tubers stain intensely for both phosphorylated S6 kinase and phosphorylated S6, indicating that mTORC1 activation is an important mechanism for TSC neuropathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C18">18</xref>). The identification of the TSC1&#x02013;TSC2 complex as an inhibitor of mTORC1 has paved the way for a novel medical treatment of TSC. The fungal metabolite rapamycin, which is widely used to suppress the immune system in organ transplant patients, inhibits mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C19">19</xref>). The mTORC1-inhibitory function of rapamycin led to the hypothesis that rapamycin might be able to restore the inhibition lost in TSC. Subsequent cell culture and animal studies confirmed that hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C23">23</xref>). It has recently been demonstrated that rapamycin can rescue the seizure phenotype in an astrocyte-specific <italic>Tsc1</italic> mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C24">24</xref>). Rapamycin also improved survival and rescued cell size and myelination abnormalities in a neuronal-specific <italic>Tsc1</italic> model of TSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C25">25</xref>). Indeed, rapamycin appears to be very promising for the treatment of TSC, and several human trials have already yielded encouraging results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C27">27</xref>). In spite of the recent discoveries regarding the functions of hamartin and tuberin, the pathophysiology of TSC brain lesions remains poorly understood. Most brain lesions are present at birth, suggesting that the neuropathology of TSC represents developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C7">7</xref>). Tubers have been detected <italic>in utero</italic> using high-resolution ultra-sound and fetal MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C28">28</xref>). Neuroglial progenitor markers, vimentin and nestin, have been demonstrated in the cells of tubers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C30">30</xref>). These observations have led to a prevailing hypothesis that neuroglial precursor cells might be the cells of origin of the brain lesions of TSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C31">31</xref>). This hypothesis remains untested.</p><p>Initial attempts to model TSC in the mouse did not result in significant TSC-like brain pathology. Mice with heterozygous disruptions of <italic>Tsc1</italic> or <italic>Tsc2</italic> developed kidney and liver lesions, but limited brain pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C35">35</xref>). Homozygous deletion of either gene caused midgestation lethality, possibly related to liver hypoplasia, though some embryos had exencephaly. Recent models using a conditional allele of the <italic>Tsc1</italic> have been more fruitful. Conditional disruption of <italic>Tsc1</italic> in astrocytes, using a GFAP-Cre driver, produced mice that demonstrated enlarged brains, an astrocytosis and mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C36">36</xref>). <italic>Tsc1</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;GFAP-Cre</italic> mice had normal cortical organization, mild hippocampal abnormalities and died from seizures by 3 months of life. Generation of a neuron-specific deletion of <italic>Tsc1</italic> using a synapsin-Cre driver also produced severely compromised animals that died within a few months of life from seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C38">38</xref>). There is some discrepancy as to whether these animals exhibit histologic abnormalities in the cerebral cortex or hippocampus; however, they clearly demonstrate enlarged neurons, activated mTORC1 and myelination defects. Although these <italic>Tsc1</italic>-based models do not demonstrate tubers or subependymal nodules <italic>per se</italic>, they exhibit significant features of the human disease and will be useful to dissect out the functions of the TSC complex in different neuronal populations. Nonetheless, neither model has tested the hypothesis that loss of <italic>Tsc1</italic> or <italic>Tsc2</italic> in a neuroprogenitor cell initiates TSC neuropathology. Moreover, these studies are all based upon the <italic>Tsc1</italic> gene. Although patients with TSC can have mutations in either gene, <italic>TSC2</italic>-based disease appears to be more severe and causes more profound central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C40">40</xref>). Therefore, in an effort to develop a <italic>Tsc2</italic>-based model for TSC neuropathology, we have created a conditional allele of <italic>Tsc2</italic> in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C41">41</xref>). Our goal was to use this floxed allele to delete <italic>Tsc2</italic> in a neuroglial progenitor population to recapitulate the brain manifestations of TSC.</p><p>Over the past several years, the traditional function of radial glial cells as a mere scaffold for migrating and developing neurons has been expanded to that of neuroglial precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C42">42</xref>). Multiple lineage tracing experiments using Cre transgenic mice and real-time imaging have demonstrated that radial glial cells likely give rise to a majority of cells in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C44">44</xref>). At midneurogenesis, radial glia can divide symmetrically to generate other radial glia, or asymmetrically to self-renew and produce post-mitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C45">45</xref>). Some radial glia can also generate a second progenitor pool in the subventricular zone containing neurogenic basal progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C47">47</xref>). At later stages of development, radial glia are primarily gliogenic. Given these neuroglial progenitor properties, we speculated that loss of <italic>Tsc2</italic> in radial glial might recapitulate the brain pathology of TSC. We used an extensively characterized <italic>hGFAP-Cre</italic> mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C50">50</xref>) to remove the <italic>Tsc2</italic> gene from radial glial progenitor cells. The <italic>hGFAP-Cre</italic> transgenic is notably very different from the GFAP-Cre used to create the astrocyte-specific <italic>Tsc1</italic> knockout model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C36">36</xref>). In the <italic>hGFAP-Cre</italic> mouse, Cre recombinase is expressed in the radial glia of the hippocampal anlage at E12 and in the cortical radial glia at E13.5&#x02013;14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C50">50</xref>). Using the <italic>hGFAP-Cre</italic> mouse allowed us to remove Tsc2 from these progenitor cells and their neuronal and glial progeny, creating a model more similar to the human disease. In the <italic>Tsc1</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup><italic>;GFAP-Cre</italic> mouse, Cre was only expressed in astrocytes, consequently leaving normal Tsc1 function in all neurons. We generated <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic> mice to mimic TSC patients with heterozygous loss of <italic>TSC2</italic> in all cells and selective loss of the remaining copy of <italic>Tsc2</italic> only in radial glial cells. This strategy allowed us to bypass the lethality of homozygous knockouts and create a novel <italic>Tsc2-</italic>based model of TSC that recapitulates many features of the human disease in the brain. Our data demonstrate new roles of the TSC complex in radial glial biology and cerebral cortical development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation of <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic> mice</title><p>We crossed male <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>+/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic> mice with female <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/flox</italic></sup> mice to generate the desired progeny, <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic>. These mutant mice represented TSC patients with one inactivated <italic>Tsc2</italic> allele in all cells. Cre expression only occurred in radial glial cells; hence, the second floxed allele was only lost in radial glial cells and their neuronal and glial descendents. This scheme also tested whether the two hit hypothesis is operative in TSC neuropathology, a somewhat controversial issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C52">52</xref>). <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic> mice were born in the expected Mendelian ratio and appeared healthy until about post-natal day 8, when their weight gain slowed compared with littermate controls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP025F1">1</xref>A). By weaning, <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic> mice were severely runted (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP025F1">1</xref>B) and died between 3 and 4 weeks, likely from seizures, as we observed several mice seizing (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and the majority of dead mice were found in extensor posturing. The <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic> mice had splayed feet, domed heads, and were often tremulous and generally less active than littermate controls. Because mutant animals were often quite sick at weaning and died during the week after, all analyses on adult mice were conducted at post-natal day 21 (P21). The brains of the <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic> mice were substantially larger than control brains and demonstrated dilated lateral ventricles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP025F1">1</xref>C and D). In the <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic> mice, Cre recombinase deleted the floxed <italic>Tsc2</italic> allele in the majority of radial glia in the hippocampal anlage at E12.5 and in the cortical ventricular zone at E13.5&#x02013;14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C50">50</xref>). Consequently, all the neurons and astrocytes derived from <italic>Tsc2</italic>-null radial glia should have had complete loss of tuberin antigen. To demonstrate extensive loss of tuberin, western analysis of cell lysates from P21 cortex and hippocampus of the <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>; hGFAP-Cre</italic> and control mice was performed and demonstrated significant loss of tuberin antigen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP025F1">1</xref>E). Hamartin levels were also slightly decreased in experimental lysates, reflecting the dependence of its stability on the presence of its binding partner tuberin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C53">53</xref>). Loss of tuberin antigen was accompanied by an expected activation of the mTORC1 pathway based on increased levels of phosphorylated (Ser 240/244) S6 (pS6). We then demonstrated that mTORC1 was activated in radial glia by performing immunohistochemistry on E15.5 brains using antibodies against the radial glial marker Pax6 and pS6 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP025F1">1</xref>F and G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C54">54</xref>). In the mutant embryonic brains, more intensely red pS6 staining was seen surrounding the green Pax6-labeled nuclei of radial glial cells in the ventricular zone compared with the control. This increased pS6 expression in radial glial cells demonstrated activation of mTORC1 caused by loss of <italic>Tsc2</italic>.</p><fig id="DDP025F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Generation of <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic> mice. <bold>(A)</bold> Weight curves of mutant (<italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic>) mice (red, <italic>n</italic> = 17) compared with the control (<italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>+/flox</italic></sup>) mice (blue, <italic>n</italic> = 15) demonstrating the retarded growth of the mutant animals. <bold>(B)</bold> A runted mutant, 21-day-old (P21) mouse compared with a control littermate.

These defects were in stark contrast to the tight, ordered pyramidal layer of the control animals, with a relatively cell sparse SO (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP025F3">3</xref>A and E). The dentate gyrus (DG) retained its overall structure and contained approximately equal numbers of granule cells. However, in the mutant hippocampus, there were large, ectopic granule cells lining the outer limit of this region (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP025F3">3</xref>C and D). Another striking defect was the presence of ring heterotopias throughout the stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP025F3">3</xref>B and H).

However, the DG of both mutant and control hippocampus did not express a similar increase in the intensity of pS6 antigen compared with respective pyramidal layers (PL). Previous studies have verified that Cre is expressed in DG granule cell precursors in the <italic>hGFAP-</italic>Cre transgeneic mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C50">50</xref>). Therefore, we postulated that increased mTORC1 activity in granule cells of the DG might not result in elevated pS6 levels comparable with the pyramidal cell layer. Nonetheless, mTORC1 activation should result in an increase in cell size, so we compared the areas of DG granule cells between mutant and control animals (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP025F3">3</xref>M). Granule cells from the mutant DG were on average 10% larger (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0005) than those in the control DG, suggesting that <italic>Tsc2</italic> deletion and mTORC1 activation occurred in the DG of the mutant. Together, these results indicated that mTORC1 remained activated in the neurons and astrocytes derived from Tsc2-deficient radial glia. This mTORC1 activation resulted in increased cell size, both in the cortex and in the hippocampus, as previously reported in several model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C37">37</xref>).</p><fig id="DDP025F3" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3.</label><caption><p>Hippocampal defects and up-regulation of mTORC1 in hippocampal neurons and astrocytes in <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic> mice.

First, the mouse homolog of the <italic>TSC2</italic> gene, associated with more severe human neurologic defects, was conditionally inactivated in this model. Secondly, since the <italic>Tsc2</italic> gene was deleted in radial glial progenitor cells, all their resulting neuronal and glial progeny were also lacking in Tsc2 activity as demonstrated by mTORC1 activation. The survival of these mice was more severely compromised than the other neuronal and astrocyte-specific <italic>Tsc1</italic> brain-specific knockouts, dying between 3 and 4 weeks rather than 2&#x02013;3 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C37">37</xref>). Although we have not performed EEG recordings of epileptiform activity, we have observed generalized seizures in several animals. When animals were found dead, they typically were in extensor posturing suggesting that they died from a tonic seizure. Future electrophysiologic studies will be required to understand the epilepsy that these animals have.</p><p>TSC has been considered a disorder of neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C6">6</xref>). The defects observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus provide evidence to support a neuronal migration defect. The lamination defects of the hippocampal pyramidal layer were similar to defects seen in mice with targeted disruptions of neuronal migration genes such as <italic>Reelin</italic>, <italic>Lis1</italic> and <italic>Doublecortin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C60">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C62">62</xref>). The ring heterotopias also appeared to represent abnormal migration of neurons, glia and other unidentified cells. The presence of more Cux-1-expressing cells in the deep layers of the mutant cortex, and the thickened ventricular zone of P0 mutant mice also suggested a neuronal migration defect. Further investigation into the role of the TSC complex in neuronal migration will be required, but this model should make <italic>in vivo</italic> developmental studies feasible.</p><p>The initial, striking feature of the brains of the TSC mice was the megalencephaly. The enlarged brains of these animals are reminiscent of the enlarged eye phenotype seen in the seminal studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that established the roles of the <italic>Tsc1</italic> and <italic>Tsc2</italic> genes in controlling cell and organ size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C64">64</xref>). Hemimegalencephaly has also been reported as a rare manifestation of TSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C66">66</xref>). Cortical size is controlled by a delicate balance of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C67">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C69">69</xref>). The TSC complex has been demonstrated to regulate all these processes in different model systems. The developmental analysis indicated that the enlarged brain phenotype was predominantly a post-natal event. Minimal proliferation abnormalities were found in the cortex, whereas significantly increased PCNA-positive cells were found in the hippocampus. It appears that increased cell size and matrix are the principle determinants for the cortical enlargement, whereas hippocampal enlargement was dependent on both increased proliferation and increased cell size and matrix.</p><p>The differences in neuronal composition of the adult <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic> cortex suggested that loss of Tsc2 might alter cell fate. Embryonic studies indicated that although total proliferation and radial glial cell numbers were unaffected at E14.5, there were notably more basal progenitor cells and fewer post-mitotic neurons in the mutant embryos. These findings indicate that loss of Tsc2 perturbs progenitor differentiation. Given the fewer early born post-mitotic neurons in the mutant embryo, it follows that there were fewer Layer VI FoxP2-positive neurons in the adult mutant cortex. However, although the large increase in basal progenitor cells in the mutant indicated that a similarly large increase in superficial-layer neurons should be present in the adult cortex, we were unable to find a significant increase in Cux-1-positive cells in Layers II&#x02013;IV in the mice we have analyzed in the P21 cortex (<italic>n</italic> = 6). Recent studies have demonstrated that Tbr2-positive basal progenitor cells not only contribute to superficial cortical layers, but also deeper layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C70">70</xref>). Consequently, we hypothesize that loss of Tsc2 may increase pools of basal progenitor progeny in regions we have not studied, such as Layer V. Though we have not been able to detect apoptosis at E16.5, P5 or P10, we cannot completely exclude cell death of basal progenitors or their progeny as factors that contribute to the final P21 mutant brain.</p><p>Astrocytes can become reactive in response to a variety of CNS pathologies such as infection, ischemia or neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C72">72</xref>). This reactive gliosis is accompanied by morphologic and cell physiologic changes, most notably, the up-regulation of intermediate filament proteins such as vimentin and GFAP. Cortical tubers contain characteristic giant cells surrounded by a severe astrogliosis. The cause of this TSC-associated astrogliosis is unknown, but suggests that dysfunctional, reactive astrocytes may be important in TSC neuropathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C55">55</xref>).

Abnormal myelination has recently been found to be another pathologic feature in the brains of TSC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C59">59</xref>). The <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic> mice also showed abnormalities in the progression of myelination that resulted in an undermyelinated cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Abnormalities in neurons and/or oligodendrocytes may have caused these defects as both cell populations demonstrated mTORC1 activation. Interestingly, the neuronal Tsc1 model mouse, in which post-mitotic neurons are deleted for Tsc1, also demonstrated very similar defects in myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C37">37</xref>). Those data suggested that loss of Tsc1 disrupted neuronal signals that are crucial for the correct progression of myelination. Since both models demonstrate similar myelination defects, it is likely that the neuronal absence of Tsc2 is a major cause for the aberrant myelination. Future co-culture studies will be required to assess the effects of the TSC complex on the interplay between oligodendrocytes and neurons and the regulation of myelination.</p><p>The <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic> model of TSC suggests that the radial glial cell might be a cellular site for LOH in human TSC brain lesions. Although our results do not preclude LOH in other progenitor cells such as neuroepithelial or basal progenitor cells, the resultant phenotype suggests a crucial role for tight regulation of the mTORC1 pathway in radial glial progenitor differentiation and neuronal migration. Loss of mTORC1 regulation plays a role in other developmental brain disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and PTEN-associated macrocephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP025C76">76</xref>). Further study of the developmental defects in radial glia caused by loss of TSC-regulated mTORC1 should provide insight not only into TSC, but also many other neurodevelopmental defects. The <italic>Tsc2</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic> mouse demonstrated activation of mTORC1, so rapamycin treatment should rescue some of the neuropathology. Since neurons and glia are affected in this model, it will be interesting to assess whether there is a differential cellular response to rapamycin treatment. The creation of a <italic>Tsc1</italic><sup><italic>flox/ko</italic></sup><italic>;hGFAP-Cre</italic> is in progress and will allow a comparison with the present model to provide a possible biologic basis for the differences in severity between patients with <italic>TSC1</italic> versus <italic>TSC2</italic> mutations. This <italic>Tsc2</italic>-based model also broadens the availability of models for the preclinical testing of established and novel drugs for the treatment of TSC and related disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice and genotyping</title><p>All animal experimentation was approved by the UTHSC Animal Welfare Committee.

Mouse brains were post-fixed in PFA overnight and stored in 70% ethanol prior to embedding in paraffin. Paraffin blocks were sectioned at 5 &#x000b5;m. For embryo analysis, the day of the vaginal plug was 0.5. Dams were anesthetized with 2.5% avertin and killed by cervical dislocation before embryos were dissected into cold PBS and staged. A small piece of the embryo was used for genotyping. Embryos were fixed in PFA 4&#x02013;6 h and washed in 1&#x000d7; PBS before being stored in 70% ethanol and embedded in paraffin.

For post-natal cell counts, equal-sized images spanning the thickness of the somatosensory cortex were taken at the same lateral distance from the midline. Count results were corrected to represent a percentage of cells in the cortex in order to account for differences in total cortex size. For embryo counts, equal-sized images spanning most of the length of the lateral ventricles were used. Marker-labeled cells with visible nuclei were manually counted using Photoshop and ImageJ v1.38x (W. Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). For neuron cell size determination, the cortex was divided into five equal bins from the bottom of Layer I to the bottom of Layer VI. In one section each from three pairs of control and mutant mice, 50 NeuN-labeled neurons from Bin 3 were outlined and filled using Photoshop and area was analyzed in micrometers using ImageJ. For DG area calculation, one section each from three pairs of mice were stained with H&#x00026;E. DG cell images were captured using a 60&#x000d7; objective and cells near the midline of the DG were outlined for area calculation in the same manner.
