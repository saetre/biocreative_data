The sensors involved in coupling recognition of virus infection with the induction of IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; have recently been discovered. These sensors, or pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), include RIG-I and mda-5, two cytoplasmic, RNA-binding DExD/H box helicases (for recent reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Pichlmair1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Yoneyama1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Both proteins contain N-terminal CARD domains, followed by a DECH box helicase. Both proteins also contain a C-terminal domain, which in the case of RIG-I acts as an internal repressor or regulatory domain (RD) that prevents the CARDs from interacting with their downstream signaling adaptor, IPS-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Saito1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

IPS-1 activation then leads to the recruitment of a series of kinases which in turn leads to the activation of IRF-3/7 and NF-kB and the expression of the early IFN genes, such as IFN&#x003b2;.</p><p>When RIG-I was first described in the seminal paper of Yoneyama et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Yoneyama2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, poly-I/C was proposed as its ligand based on RIG-I over-expression. RIG-I deficient mice, however, were then found not to be defective in their type I IFN response to poly-I/C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Kato1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas they were unable to mount an innate immune response to most RNA viruses other than picornaviruses like EMCV (e.g., Influenza A virus, VSV, JEV and Sendai virus (SeV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Kato2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Mda-5 deficient mice, in contrast, were found to be entirely unable to mount a type I IFN response to poly-I/C and to EMCV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Kato2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Gitlin1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The role of these two helicases in the innate immune response to virus infection was thus found to be remarkably specific. Using cell lines derived from these mice, mda-5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs were found to activate IFN genes in response to various transfected dsRNAs made from complementary <sub>ppp</sub>RNAs transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic>, whereas these MEFs did not respond to poly-I/C. In contrast, RIG-I<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs activated IFN genes in response to transfected poly-I/C, but these MEFs did not respond to dsRNAs made from <italic>in vitro</italic> transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Kato2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Gitlin1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Subsequently, ssRNA transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> was also found to be a ligand for RIG-I, and its ability to induce IFN upon transfection depended on the 5&#x02032; triphosphate moiety of the ssRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Pichlmair2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Hornung1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, RIG-I was thought to act as a PRR exclusively for <sub>ppp</sub>RNA (independent of its single- or double-strandedness), and mda-5 for poly-I/C, or more realistically for the RNA elements of picornavirus infection that are mimicked by poly-I/C.</p><p>RIG-I and mda-5 are thus thought to recognize different RNA ligands (<sub>ppp</sub>RNA and poly-I/C or dsRNA, respectively) that act as PAMPs, which presumably accounts for the virus-specific response of these helicases. This is consistent with our view of RNA virus replication. Except for picornaviruses (and caliciviruses) that initiate all RNA synthesis with a protein primer; the other RNA viruses initiate all RNA synthesis with an NTP, and at least some of the viral <sub>ppp</sub>RNAs remain unblocked during the infection (e.g., the minus-strands of plus-strand and dsRNA viruses) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Flint1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, except for picornaviruses (and possibly caliciviruses), cells require RIG-I (and not mda-5) to activate IFN&#x003b2; in response to other RNA virus infections. In order to test this contention, we have designed a SeV infection that generates dsRNA with capped 5&#x02032; ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Strahle1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> to examine whether this SeV infection requires mda-5 rather than RIG-I to activate IFN&#x003b2;. Remarkably, this dsRNA-generating SeV co-infection also requires RIG-I &#x0005b;and not mda-5&#x0005d; to activate IFN&#x003b2;. This study also provides evidence that RIG-I binds dsRNA devoid of free 5&#x02032; tri-phosphate ends, and that poly-I/C is not a simple analog of dsRNA; i.e., poly-I/C has the unique ability to stimulate the helicase ATPase of RIG-I variants which lack the C-terminal regulatory domain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cells, viruses, and antibodies</title><p>RIG-I<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and mda-5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs were obtained from H Kato and S Akira, Osaka, Japan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Kato1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Kato2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

The extent to which IFN&#x003b2; is activated during SeV infection presumably depends both on the level of the RNA PAMPs produced and that of the viral products that counteract the innate immune response. For mononegaviruses whose genome and antigenome RNAs are tightly covered with N protein during their synthesis (and thus are unlikely to act as PAMPs), small promoter-proximal (leader and trailer) <sub>ppp</sub> RNAs are made independent of assembly with N <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Strahle1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Lamb1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Plumet1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. These promoter-proximal <sub>ppp</sub> RNAs are essential for the control of genome replication. Viral dsRNA could also be generated by the annealing of trailer <sub>ppp</sub>RNA and L mRNA read-thru transcripts. During wt SeV infection of non-immune cells, the activity of both PAMPs is presumably neutralized by the viral C proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Strahle1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Akira and coworkers have previously used SeV-C<sup>minus</sup> infection to induce IFN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Kato2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The SeV which is more commonly used to induce IFN (&#x0201c;Cantell strain&#x0201d;) is in fact a mixed virus stock composed mostly of copyback defective-interfering (DI) genomes, and this DI infection both under-produces the C and V proteins and overproduces trailer <sub>ppp</sub>RNA. In addition, because some of the copyback DI genomes are exceedingly small (546 nt vs 15,264 for wt), some of these genomes may also be made without being assembled with N <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Strahle3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, both <sub>ppp</sub>ssRNA and <sub>ppp</sub>dsRNA (i.e., in which one strand contains a 5&#x02032; tri-phosphate end) are thought to induce IFN&#x003b2; activation during SeV-C<sup>minus</sup> and DI infections.</p><p>More recently, we have also used quasi-wt SeV co-infections that express GFP mRNA and anti-GFP mRNA (from separate genomes) to activate IFN&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Strahle1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The ability of this co-infection to induce IFN depended on the presence of both complementary GFP mRNAs in the cytoplasm, and RFP mRNA expression could not substitute for one of the GFP mRNAs. IFN&#x003b2; activation induced by the GFP&#x0002b;/&#x02212; co-infection thus presumably results from the generation of GFP dsRNA in which both 5&#x02032; ends are capped. Moreover, this IFN&#x003b2; activation also appeared to depend on RIG-I, as a dominant-negative form of RIG-I (RIG-I-&#x00394;CARD) inhibited this response. However, the precise manner in which RIG-I-&#x00394;CARD acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of RIG-I is not known, and this mutant helicase may be acting non-specifically when over-expressed.</p><p>To further investigate the helicase requirement for the GFP&#x0002b;/&#x02212; infection, RIG-I<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and mda-5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs were transfected with plasmids expressing luciferase under the control of the IFN&#x003b2; promoter (and control plasmids), and then infected with SeV DI-H4 or GFP&#x0002b;/&#x02212; stocks.

In contrast, the co-expression of mda-5-&#x00394;CARD has no effect on the activation induced by <sub>ppp</sub>ssRNA, and a mimimal effect on that induced by poly-I/C.

In summary, the ability of poly-I/C to stimulate the ATPase of RIG-I is clearly different from that of heteropolymeric dsRNA.

These results are consistent with the finding that the RD is required for RIG-I self-association, and that this self-association is required for downstream signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Saito1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Cui1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The finding that poly-I/C also competed with the binding of RIG-I to <sub>ppp</sub>RNA (which clearly binds to the RD)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003965-g007">fig 7</xref>) suggests that poly-I/C binds to both the helicase core and the RD. These latter results are consistent with the demonstration that the binding of <sub>ppp</sub>RNA or short dsRNA to RIG-I protects a 17kD fragment from trypsin digestion (essentially the entire RD), whereas the binding of poly-I/C produces a 66 kD fragment of the helicase core and the RD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Takahasi1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0003965-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003965.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Over-expression of RIG-I variants and poly-I/C induced IFNb activation.</title><p>Parallel cultures of wt MEFs were transfected with pIFN&#x003b2;-(ff)luciferase and pTK-(ren)luciferase.

The finding that SeV-GFP&#x0002b;/&#x02212; infections also requires RIG-I (and not mda-5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003965-g001">figs 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003965-g002">2</xref>) was thus not expected. This latter finding, however, is consistent with the recent report that <sub>ppp</sub>ssRNA and short <sub>OH</sub>dsRNA bind to overlapping sites of the RIG-I RD, and that short dsRNAs will activate IFN&#x003b2; via RIG-I upon transfection if they contain 5&#x02032; mono-phosphates that apparently stabilize the dsRNAs intracellularly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Takahasi1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. We have confirmed that short <sub>OH</sub>dsRNA competes with <sub>ppp</sub>ssRNA for its binding to RIG-I, whereas <sub>OH</sub>ssRNA is inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003965-g007">fig 7</xref>).</p><p>Even though it has been reported that RIG-I by itself does not respond to poly-I/C in mda-5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Kato2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Gitlin1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, especially when poly-I/C of 4&#x02013;8 kbp in length is used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Kato3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, this does not exclude the possibility that RIG-I participates in the cellular response to poly-I/C when both helicases are present, or that RIG-I can directly respond to poly-I/C when RIG-I levels are elevated. When RIG-I levels are gradually increased in MEFs, the level of IFN&#x003b2; activation is proportional to that of RIG-I expression in response to either poly-I/C or <sub>ppp</sub>ssRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003965-g005">fig 5</xref>). There is other indirect evidence that RIG-I participates in the poly-I/C induced IFN&#x003b2; activation when both helicases are present. For example, whereas Huh 7 cells respond well to poly-I/C, a sub-line of these cells containing an incapacitating mutation in a CARD of RIG-I (Huh 7.5 cells) has lost most of its response to this dsRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Loo1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, even though the ability of paramyxovirus V proteins (including that of SeV) to bind mda-5 and prevent poly-I/C induced signaling is well documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Andrejeva1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Childs1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, it is the SeV C protein (that inhibits RIG-I signaling) and not the SeV V protein which acts to inhibit the cellular response to poly-I/C in a SeV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Strahle1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We found that both short dsRNAs containing two 5&#x02032; OH ends (dsRNA-tr41) and BTV (reovirus) dsRNAs stimulate the RIG-I ATPase <italic>in vitro</italic> almost as efficiently as <sub>ppp</sub>ssRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003965-g006">fig 6</xref>). Unexpectedly, we also found that poly-I/C stimulated the ATPase of RIG-I variants lacking the C-terminal RD, in strong contrast to either <sub>ppp</sub>ssRNA or heteropolymeric dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003965-g006">fig 6</xref>). Poly-I/C is an unusual dsRNA, composed of complementary homopolymers, and one strand being composed of the rare base inosine. Poly-I/C has been the transfected dsRNA of choice to study IFN induction for many years, not only because it is commercially available, but because it works so well. It has been known for decades that poly-I/C has a special ability to induce IFN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Colby1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Using DEAE-dextran to transfect various dsRNAs into chick embryo fibroblasts, the efficiency of IFN induction of poly-I/C was found to be orders of magnitude greater than that of poly-G/C or poly-A/U. Moreover, these differences in activity among the various polynucleotides did not appear to reflect differences in their thermal stability, sensitivity to RNase A, the rate or amount of uptake into the cells or in the rate of intracellular breakdown. Colby and Chamberlin (1969) presciently concluded that the high degree of specificity of the induction process was consistent with the existence of a specific intracellular receptor, most probably a protein. One of the possible reasons for the remarkable ability of poly-I/C to induce IFN may be because, unlike other dsRNAs or <sub>ppp</sub>ssRNAs, it can directly bind to both the RIG-I helicase domain as well as to mda-5, stimulating their ATPases and inducing the conformational changes that liberate the CARDs for interaction with IPS-1. At present, there is no clear understanding of the RNA elements of poly-I/C that mimic the PAMPs generated during mouse picornavirus infections, or why poly-I/C alone among various dsRNAs stimulates the RIG-I-&#x00394;RD ATPase. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that poly-I/C is not a simple analog of dsRNA.</p><p>While this work was being prepared for publication, Kato et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003965-Kato3">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> reported that the length of dsRNA is important for differential recognition by RIG-I and mda.5. Long poly-I/C (4&#x02013;8 kbp) was found to be a specific ligand for mda-5, whereas relatively short poly-I/C (300 bp) was a specific ligand for RIG-I. We have examined the length of our poly-I/C by agarose gel electrophoresis and found that it was relatively short (200&#x02013;600 bp relative to DNA markers), and the maximum length of our GFP dsRNA would be 714 bp. Our results are thus consistent with those of Kato et al.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank H Kato and S Akira (Osaka), J. Tschopp (Lausanne), K.
