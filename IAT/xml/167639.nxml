Pre-mRNA 3&#x02032;-end processing is initiated by endonucleolytic cleavage at the poly(A) site. Subsequently, the upstream cleavage product is polyadenylated whereas the downstream fragment is rapidly degraded (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c1">1</xref>). The yeast 3&#x02032;-end processing reaction can be reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> with the cleavage and polyadenylation factor IA (CF IA), cleavage and polyadenylation factor IB (CF IB), cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) and the poly(A) binding protein (Pab1p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c3">3</xref>). Interactions between their subunits allow bridging of the different factors and ensure their coordinated action on the substrate. So far the CPF components Fip1p and Pfs2p have been shown to bridge CPF with CF IA by interacting with Rna14p, a subunit of CF IA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c4">4</xref>). A table of the factors involved in 3&#x02032;-end processing and their subunits is provided as supplementary material.</p><p>The polyadenylation signals that guide the processing machinery in yeast are redundant and more degenerate compared to the well-conserved sequences in higher eukaryotes. Still, conserved elements can be found, which are the efficiency element (EE), the positioning element (PE), the poly(A) site and U-rich sequences. The EE is located at variable distances upstream of the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c5">5</xref>). The PE is often found &#x0223c;20 nt upstream of the cleavage site and consists of an A-rich sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c6">6</xref>). U-rich regions, located directly upstream and downstream of the cleavage site, and the poly(A) site itself act in concert to produce multiple recognition sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c9">9</xref>).</p><p>RNase H protection mapping experiments with a CYC1 pre-mRNA suggested that CPF is involved in the recognition of the poly(A) site by specific interactions of its subunits Yhh1p&#x0002f;Cft1p, Ydh1p&#x0002f;Cft2p and Yth1p with sequences surrounding the poly(A) site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c11">11</xref>). Nab4p&#x0002f;Hrp1p (CF IB) binds to the EE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c13">13</xref>) and, through interaction with Rna14p, possibly enables CF IA to bind to the PE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c14">14</xref>). However, it was also reported that Nab4p&#x0002f;Hrp1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c15">15</xref>) as well as the PE and EE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c9">9</xref>) are not essential for cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic>, underscoring the importance of the poly(A) site region itself.</p><p>The yeast and mammalian 3&#x02032;-end processing factors are highly homologous (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c16">16</xref>). In mammals cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) contributes to poly(A) site selection by binding to the well conserved AAUAAA element upstream of the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c17">17</xref>); CPSF-160 and possibly additional CPSF subunits are thought to mediate specific interactions to the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c18">18</xref>). The binding of purified CPSF is weak, but is strongly enhanced by a cooperative interaction with cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) bound to the downstream elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c21">21</xref>).</p><p>Transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and pre-mRNA processing reactions are coupled events (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c25">25</xref>). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAP II plays a central role in linking the processing reactions to transcription. Current models suggest that the CTD is hypo-phosphorylated during transcription initiation and that escape of RNAP II into the elongation phase is accompanied by phosphorylation of the CTD. It has been proposed that the change in charge upon phosphorylation enables proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing to bind to the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c28">28</xref>). This includes proteins involved in capping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c32">32</xref>), splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c33">33</xref>) and 3&#x02032;-end formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c37">37</xref>). It is assumed that the assembled proteins subsequently travel with the elongating RNAP II during transcription and act on the nascent RNA transcript.</p><p>In mammals the CTD was suggested to play a direct role in 3&#x02032;-end cleavage <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c34">34</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c39">39</xref>). Experiments in yeast provided evidence that transcription in the absence of the CTD was accompanied by a reduction of cleavage efficiency and the resulting mRNAs had shorter poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c40">40</xref>). Correct transcription termination requires a functional poly(A) signal in all organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c42">42</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c43">43</xref>), and yeast strains carrying mutations in CPF and CF IA were shown to be deficient in correct transcription termination, indicating the coupling between 3&#x02032;-end processing and transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c47">47</xref>). Furthermore, correct transcriptional termination was found to require the transcription factors Sub1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c48">48</xref>) and Res2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c49">49</xref>) and chromatin remodeling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c50">50</xref>). The Nrd1p complex was shown to be required for correct termination at snoRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c51">51</xref>).</p><p>Ydh1p&#x0002f;Cft2p (which will be referred to as Ydh1p in the remainder of this paper) is the 105 kDa subunit of CPF. It shares 24.4&#x00025; identity and 43&#x00025; similarity with the mammalian CPSF-100 protein. It is also significantly related to Ysh1p and to CPSF-73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c52">52</xref>). Ydh1p is essential for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c53">53</xref>) and was shown to bind RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c54">54</xref>). RNase H protection experiments suggested that the protein interacts with the poly(A) site region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c9">9</xref>). Here, we show that Ydh1p is required for cleavage and polyadenylation <italic>in vitro</italic> and for poly(A) site recognition <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Ydh1p interacts with several subunits of CPF, with Pcf11p, a subunit of CF IA, and with the CTD of RNAP II. The results suggest that Ydh1p is part of an interaction surface that mediates important contacts with CF IA, the CTD of RNAP II and the pre-mRNA substrate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains</title><p>For random mutagenesis of <italic>YDH1</italic>, mutagenic PCR was carried out with a low concentration of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c3">3</xref>).

The cleavage activity of <italic>ydh1-1</italic> extract was restored upon addition of <italic>rna15-1</italic> extract (lane 4) or purified CPF (lane 6), but not by addition of purified CF IA (lane 7). As expected, the <italic>rna15-1</italic> extract on its own lacked cleavage activity (lane 5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c56">56</xref>) and purified CPF and CF IA alone were not able to cleave the substrate (lanes 8 and 9); cleavage occurred at specific and at cryptic sites when both factors were added to the reaction (lane 10); site-specific cleavage was obtained by including CF IB in the reaction (lane 11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c15">15</xref>).</p><p>Next we analysed whether mutations in <italic>YDH1</italic> affect the polyadenylation reaction of pre-cleaved <italic>CYC1</italic> substrate (CYC1-Pre) <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg478f2">2</xref>C). No polyadenylation activity could be observed in <italic>ydh1-1</italic> extract at 30 and 34&#x000b0;C (lanes 3 and 7). In contrast, the <italic>ydh1-2</italic> and <italic>ydh1-3</italic> extracts specifically and efficiently polyadenylated the substrate at both temperatures (lanes 4, 5, 8 and 9), comparable to wild-type (lanes 2 and 6). Specific polyadenylation activity was restored in <italic>ydh1-1</italic> extract by addition of purified CPF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg478f2">2</xref>D, lane 4) but not by addition of purified CF IA (lane 5). As shown before, CPF by itself unspecifically polyadenylated the substrate (lane 6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c3">3</xref>), whereas CF IA alone displayed no polyadenylation activity (lane 7). Specific polyadenylation activity was restored upon combination of CPF, CF IA, CF IB and Pab1p (lane 8).</p><p>Notably, addition of 100&#x02013;250 ng recombinantly expressed Ydh1p failed to reconstitute the cleavage and polyadenylation activities in <italic>ydh1-1</italic> extract, possibly because the recombinant protein was not able to replace its mutant counterpart in the CPF complex (results not shown).</p><p>The above results showed that the <italic>ydh1-1</italic> extract was strongly reduced in cleavage and polyadenylation activities <italic>in vitro</italic> and that both activities could be reconstituted by addition of purified CPF. Furthermore, the cleavage activity of the <italic>ydh1-3</italic> mutant was lower at 34&#x000b0;C compared to 30&#x000b0;C. The results indicate that Ydh1p is involved in both steps of the 3&#x02032;-end processing reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>mRNAs are unstable in <italic>ydh1</italic> mutant strains at restrictive temperature</title><p>mRNAs without poly(A) tails are rapidly degraded in living cells. Yeast strains with a 3&#x02032;-end processing deficiency are therefore expected to under-accumulate mRNAs after shift to the restrictive temperature. For this reason, we performed northern blot analyses on total RNA extracted from strains grown at 25&#x000b0;C and after shift to 37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg478f3">3</xref>A). The amount of 18S rRNA served as control for the loading of the RNA (panel VI). <italic>ADH1</italic>, <italic>ACT1</italic>, <italic>CYH2</italic> and <italic>CYC1</italic> mRNA levels diminished in the <italic>ydh1-1</italic> mutant cells after 2 h shift to 37&#x000b0;C (panels I&#x02013;IV, lanes 3&#x02013;6). The level of the stable <italic>PGK1</italic> mRNA (t<sub>1&#x0002f;2</sub> &#x0003d; 45 min) dropped significantly only after the cells were shifted to 37&#x000b0;C for 6 h (panel V, lanes 3&#x02013;6). In comparison the <italic>ADH1</italic>, <italic>ACT1</italic>, <italic>CYH2</italic> and <italic>CYC1</italic> mRNA levels of the <italic>ydh1-2</italic> mutant strain only dropped slightly after 4 h, and the <italic>PGK1</italic> mRNA level remained stable even after shift to 37&#x000b0;C for 6 h (panels I&#x02013;V, lanes 7&#x02013;10). The mutant strain <italic>ydh1-3</italic> under-accumulated <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA after only 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C; <italic>ADH1</italic>, <italic>CYH2</italic> and <italic>CYC1</italic> mRNA levels were reduced after 4 h (panels I&#x02013;IV, lanes 11&#x02013;14). The <italic>PGK1</italic> mRNA level showed a slight decrease after 4 h and more so after 6 h (panel V, lanes 11&#x02013;14). The RNA polymerase II transcribed U24, U14 and snR13 snoRNAs were stable in all mutants tested, even after shift to 37&#x000b0;C for 6 h (panels VII&#x02013;IX), indicating that snoRNA processing was not affected in <italic>ydh1</italic> mutant strains. These results showed that <italic>ydh1</italic> mutant strains under-accumulated mRNAs at restrictive temperature. The <italic>ydh1</italic> mutant phenotypes are possibly due to a deficiency of the strains in poly(A) site recognition (see below) which might impair the efficiency in 3&#x02032;-end processing.</p></sec><sec><title>Ydh1p is required for poly(A) site selection of <italic>ACT1</italic> pre-mRNA</title><p>The previous observation that Ydh1p binds RNA around the poly(A) site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c9">9</xref>), raised the possibility that the protein is required for poly(A) site recognition. To test this, we analysed poly(A) site usage of <italic>ACT1</italic> pre-mRNA in wild-type and mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c57">57</xref>). The <italic>ACT1</italic> 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) contains at least four polyadenylation sites, of which the most proximal one (site I) is used with highest frequency in wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg478f3">3</xref>B; lanes 1 and 2). All tested <italic>ydh1</italic> mutants used site I three times more often than site IV at 25&#x000b0;C (lanes 3, 5 and 7). At restrictive temperature, however, processing shifted from site I towards site IV in a ratio of 1:1 in <italic>ydh1-1</italic> and <italic>ydh1-3</italic> cells (lanes 4 and 8); the <italic>ydh1-2</italic> mutant showed a ratio of 2:1 (lane 6). These results indicated that mutations in <italic>ydh1-1</italic>, <italic>ydh1-2</italic> and <italic>ydh1-3</italic> impair poly(A) site recognition <italic>in vivo</italic>. To verify that the <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNAs were polyadenylated we incubated the reactions with RNase H and the oligos ACT1-RnaseH and dT to digest the poly(A) tails. This resulted in a slight downward shift and sharpening of the RNA bands. This showed that the <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNAs were polyadenylated (results not shown).</p><p>Western blot analyses were carried out to test whether the observed phenotypes were the result of an under-accumulation of Ydh1p or other subunits of the 3&#x02032;-end processing machinery (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg478f3">3</xref>C). As control, purified CPF or CF IA was analysed in parallel (lane 1). In wild-type and <italic>ydh1-2</italic> cells Ydh1p was stable even after 6 h at 37&#x000b0;C (panel I, lanes 2, 3 and 7&#x02013;9), whereas it was reduced in <italic>ydh1-1</italic> and <italic>ydh1-3</italic> cells after 3 h at 37&#x000b0;C (lanes 5, 6, 11 and 12). Ysh1p&#x0002f;Brr5p, Pfs2p and Ssu72p (panels II, IV and VII) under-accumulated in <italic>ydh1-1</italic> and <italic>ydh1-3</italic> cells after 6 h at 37&#x000b0;C (lanes 6 and 12). The levels of Pap1p, Fip1p and Yth1p were constant even after 6 h at 37&#x000b0;C (panels III, V and VI). In addition, mutations in <italic>YDH1</italic> did not affect the levels of the CF IA subunits Rna14p and Rna15p (panels VIII and IX).</p><p>These results indicate that the defects observed in the <italic>ydh1</italic> mutant strains might be caused by a destabilization of the Ydh1p protein. Since the destabilization at restrictive temperature of Ysh1p&#x0002f;Brr5p, Pfs2p and Ssu72p was detectable at later time-points compared to the appearance of phenotypes &#x0005b;see northern blot and <italic>ACT1</italic> poly(A) site selection&#x0005d;, we consider it unlikely that lower levels of factors other than Ydh1p are responsible for the deficiencies of the <italic>ydh1</italic> mutant cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Ydh1p interacts with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II</title><p>The CTD of RNAP II plays an important role in coupling transcription and 3&#x02032;-end formation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c23">23</xref>). We were interested to know whether Ydh1p contributes to this process by physically interacting with the CTD. To test this, we carried out <italic>GAL4</italic>-based yeast two-hybrid tests and assayed for the activation of expression of the <italic>HIS3</italic> and <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter genes. Strain Y190 was co-transformed with plasmids carrying the <italic>GAL4</italic> DNA binding domain fused to the CTD (pBD-CTD) and the <italic>GAL4</italic> activation domain fused to test genes. As positive controls we analysed the known CTD interactors <italic>YHH1</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>BRR5</italic> (pACT2-YHH1) and <italic>PCF11</italic> (pACT2-PCF11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c47">47</xref>) and pACT2-YSH1 as negative control. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg478f4">4</xref>A the plasmids carrying <italic>YDH1</italic>, <italic>YHH1</italic> and <italic>PCF11</italic> in combination with the plasmid pBD-CTD enabled cells to grow on medium lacking histidine under stringent conditions (in the presence of 35 mM 3&#x02032;-aminotriazole). In contrast, no growth was observed with pACT2-YSH1 or when empty pBD and pACT2 plasmids were tested. These results were confirmed by an X-Gal filter lift assay, which monitors &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression (results not shown). Thus, <italic>YDH1</italic> showed a two-hybrid interaction with the CTD of RNAP II.</p><p>To confirm that Ydh1p interacts with the CTD, and to test whether this interaction is influenced by the phosphorylation state of the CTD we performed GST pull-down experiments with <italic>in vitro</italic> translated radioactively labeled proteins and recombinant GST&#x02013;CTD fusion protein. Ydh1p interacted with the CTD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg478f4">4</xref>B, lane 3) and this interaction was enhanced upon phosphorylation of the CTD (lane 4); no signal was observed with GST alone (lane 2). Ysh1p&#x0002f;Cft1p interacted with neither form of the GST&#x02013;CTD protein. These results suggested that Ydh1p binds the CTD and that the interaction is enhanced upon phosphorylation of the CTD.</p><p>Correct transcription termination by RNAP II requires a functional poly(A) site on the nascent RNA and the CTD plays an important role in coupling transcription and pre-mRNA processing (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c43">43</xref>). The observations that Ydh1p is involved in poly(A) site recognition and that it interacted with the CTD raised the possibility that Ydh1p might also be involved in transcriptional termination. Therefore, we carried out transcriptional run-on analysis with the well-characterized <italic>GAL1&#x0002f;10</italic> controlled <italic>CYC1</italic> gene <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c44">44</xref>). We did not observe a significantly increased RNAP II density downstream of the <italic>CYC1</italic> terminator in <italic>ydh1-1</italic> and <italic>ydh1-3</italic> cells grown at 25&#x000b0;C or following shift to 37&#x000b0;C compared to wild-type (results not shown). Similarly, we did not detect the accumulation of read-through products in <italic>ydh1</italic> strains in reverse transcription experiments with primers annealing downstream of the cleavage site of different snoRNA species (snR39b, snR45, snR3, snR50, snR71) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c51">51</xref>). This suggested that Ydh1p is not generally required for termination of RNAP II during transcription of pre-mRNAs and snoRNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Ydh1p interacts with other subunits of CPF and with Pcf11p, a subunit of CF IA</title><p>As Ydh1p is part of a multi-protein complex we were interested to examine with which of the other CPF subunits the protein interacts. Therefore, we expressed a N-terminally GST-tagged and C-terminally His-tagged version of the Ydh1 protein (G-Ydh1-H) in <italic>E.coli</italic> and carried out GST pull-down experiments with radioactively labeled <italic>in vitro</italic> translated proteins. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg478f5">5</xref>A, G-Ydh1-H interacted with itself and with the CPF subunits Yhh1p&#x0002f;Cft1, Ysh1p&#x0002f;Brr5p, Pta1p, Pfs2p, Ssu72p, YDL094cp (panels I&#x02013;VII) and the CF IA subunit Pcf11p (panel X). G-Ydh1-H did not pull-down the CPF subunits Fip1p and Yth1p (panels VII and IX), nor the CF IA subunits Rna14p, Clp1p and Rna15p (panels XI&#x02013;XIII), Nab4p&#x0002f;Hrp1 (CF IB) or Pab1p (panels XIV and XV). Since we identified a large number of potential Ydh1p interaction partners, we decided to investigate whether these interactions were specific and therefore assignable to distinct regions of Ydh1p. For this purpose the pull-downs were repeated with C-terminally truncated Ydh1p proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg478f5">5</xref>B). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg478f5">5</xref>A shows that the very C-terminus was required for interaction of Ydh1p with itself (panel II) as most of the interaction was lost upon deletion of the C-terminal 137 amino acids. The N-terminal 246 amino acids were sufficient for interaction with Pfs2p (panel V) and central protein sequences most likely mediated interactions with Yhh1p&#x0002f;Cft1p, Ysh1p&#x0002f;Brr5p, Pta1p, Ssu72, pYDL094c and Pcf11p (panels I, III, IV, VI, VII and X). These results suggested that the Ydh1p subunit might contribute to the stability and structural order of CPF and bridge the two factors CPF and CF IA.</p><p>To obtain a better understanding of how CPF interacts with CF IA we decided to assay for further interactions between the two factors. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg478f5">5</xref>C shows a GST pull-down with <italic>in vitro</italic> translated protein and GST-tagged recombinant proteins. Of the analysed CPF subunits we found that only Yhh1p&#x0002f;Cft1p interacted strongly with Rna14p. Yhh1p&#x0002f;Cft1p also bound to Pcf11p, and more weakly to Clp1p (lane 3). Ydh1p pulled-down only Pcf11p (lane 4). Ysh1p&#x0002f;Brr5p interacted strongly with Clp1p and Pcf11p (lane 5). A weak signal was observed for the interaction between Pta1p and Pcf11p (lane 6). These results suggested that Ydh1p, Yhh1p&#x0002f;Cft1p, Ysh1p&#x0002f;Brr5p and possibly also Pta1p are involved in forming a protein&#x02013;protein interaction surface between CPF and CF IA. Our combined results indicate that Ydh1p plays an important role in determining the RNA binding specificity of CPF and in the assembly of the 3&#x02032;-end formation machinery and its tethering to RNAP II.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The yeast and mammalian 3&#x02032;-end formation machineries display a surprisingly complex subunit composition. At present, up to 20 polypeptides are known that constitute the factors that catalyse the yeast 3&#x02032;-end formation reaction <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c58">58</xref>). The ongoing characterization of the components suggests distinct and specialized tasks of the individual polypeptides in both steps of the 3&#x02032;-end processing reaction as well as in the coupling of 3&#x02032;-end formation to transcription. In this work we characterized the role of the yeast CPF subunit Ydh1p in these processes.</p><p>To analyse if Ydh1p is necessary for cleavage and polyadenylation we produced conditional <italic>ydh1</italic> mutant strains and carried out <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. The experiments revealed a deficiency of the mutant extracts in both steps of the 3&#x02032;-end processing reaction. The activity could be rescued upon addition of purified CPF. mRNAs without a poly(A) tail are prone to rapid degradation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Northern analysis revealed that the levels of a number of different mRNAs were reduced at restrictive temperature in Ydh1p mutants. The results support a requirement for Ydh1p in both steps of 3&#x02032;-end processing. However, we do not expect Ydh1p to be directly involved in the catalysis of the 3&#x02032;-end processing reaction, because it took several hours at the restrictive temperature before the mRNA levels were reduced. Furthermore, the <italic>ACT1</italic> poly(A) site selection assay revealed that a substantial amount of pre-mRNA appeared to be cleaved and polyadenylated <italic>in vivo</italic> at the restrictive temperature in all mutants.</p><p>We reported previously that Ydh1p binds to a <italic>CYC1</italic> pre-mRNA around the poly(A) site; this suggested a role for the protein in poly(A) site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c9">9</xref>). Here we show that Ydh1p is involved in poly(A) site selection of <italic>ACT1</italic> pre-mRNA <italic>in vivo</italic>, as all analysed <italic>ydh1</italic> mutant strains displayed more frequent use of alternative poly(A) sites compared to the wild-type strain. These results underscore our previously postulated model that Ydh1p contributes to poly(A) site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c9">9</xref>). In contrast to mammalian polyadenylation signals, the <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences in yeast are highly degenerate (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c8">8</xref>). We proposed that the RNA binding subunits of CPF act in concert to achieve specific recognition of the correct poly(A) site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c9">9</xref>). The preferential use of cleavage sites located downstream of the major site in Ydh1 mutants may be caused by the coupling of transcription elongation and 3&#x02032;-end processing. Reduced RNA binding efficiency of CPF containing mutant Ydh1p could lead to skipping of the first cleavage site of the nascent pre-mRNA emerging from the elongating RNAP II. Ydh1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c9">9</xref>), Yhh1p&#x0002f;Cft1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c10">10</xref>) and Yth1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c11">11</xref>) were shown to bind preferentially to U-rich elements localized directly upsteam and downstream of the poly(A) site, thus colocalizing with the region to which the complete CPF factor binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c9">9</xref>). These interactions with the RNA substrate are thought to be crucial for poly(A) site selection and for cleavage activity. Thus, the observed <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage deficiency of the <italic>ydh1</italic> mutant cells might result from insufficient poly(A) site selection. It remains to be determined how Ydh1p interacts with RNA. The primary sequence of the protein does not display any clear similarities to known RNA binding domains. Preliminary RNA binding experiments with portions of Ydh1p indicated that the RNA binding activity is distributed throughout the entire length of the protein (results not shown). However, detailed analyses have not been done yet. Interestingly, RNA binding activity has not been demonstrated for the mammalian homolog of Ydh1p, CPSF 100 kDa. Considering the highly conserved <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in mammalian pre-mRNAs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c1">1</xref>), it seems possible that a smaller set of proteins is sufficient for specific poly(A) site recognition, whereas in yeast a cooperative interplay of more RNA binding proteins is required to recognize the more degenerate sequence elements in a specific fashion.</p><p>We have shown that Ydh1p interacted with the CTD of RNAP II both in a two-hybrid test and in a GST pull-down assay. This interaction was enhanced upon phosphorylation of the CTD. The only other CPF subunit found to interact with the phosphorylated CTD is Yhh1p&#x0002f;Cft1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c10">10</xref>). We suggest that Ydh1p might be involved in tethering CPF to transcribing RNAP II and thereby contributes to the coupling of 3&#x02032;-end processing and transcription. However, the <italic>ydh1</italic> mutants did not reveal a defect in transcriptional termination at the <italic>CYC1</italic> terminator. As this was the only pre-mRNA that was tested by transcriptional run-on analysis we cannot exclude that Ydh1p might be involved in transcriptional termination of other genes. Moreover, reverse transcription analysis on snoRNAs in <italic>ydh1</italic> mutant strains did not reveal 3&#x02032;-extended transcripts, indicating that Ydh1p was not required for snoRNA termination either. We propose that Ydh1p helps to tether CPF to elongating RNAP II but that it is not needed for general transcription termination. Ydh1p and Yhh1p&#x0002f;Cft1p show a phenotypic similarity in that both proteins bind RNA, are involved in poly(A) site recognition and bind to the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c10">10</xref>). However, the observation that mutants in <italic>yhh1</italic> are severely impaired in transcription termination at the <italic>CYC1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c10">10</xref>) whereas <italic>ydh1</italic> mutants have no general termination defect, indicates that the functional roles of the individual 3&#x02032;-end formation factor subunits can be substantially different.</p><p>It is not well understood how the subunits of the CPF and CF IA factors assemble to form functional 3&#x02032;-end processing complexes on the RNA substrate. CPF consists of up to 15 polypeptides, which interact with each other and form a stable factor. We found that Ydh1p interacted with the CPF subunits Yhh1p&#x0002f;Cft1p, Ysh1p&#x0002f;Brr5p, Pta1p, Pfs2p, Ssu72p and pYDL094c. These many interactions indicate that the protein contributes substantially to the assembly and structural order of the CPF factor. Strikingly, Ydh1p also bound strongly to itself in the GST pull-down assays. This may indicate that there is more than one Ydh1p molecule present per 3&#x02032;-end processing unit. However, silver stain analysis of purified CPF factor suggested an apparent stoichiometric presence of Ydh1p compared to other CPF subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c45">45</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the CF IA subunit Pcf11p interacted with the CPF components Ydh1p, Yhh1p&#x0002f;Cft1p, Ysh1p&#x0002f;Brr5p, and weakly with Pta1p. In addition, we showed that the CPF subunits Yhh1p&#x0002f;Cft1p and Ysh1p&#x0002f;Brr5p interacted with the CF IA subunits Rna14p and Clp1p, respectively. The latter interactions were also observed between the homologous subunits of the mammalian 3&#x02032;-end formation machinery. CPSF 160 kDa interacts with the CstF 77 kDa protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c18">18</xref>) and CPSF 73 kDa interacts with hClp1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c59">59</xref>). So far, only Pfs2p and Fip1p were shown to bridge CPF and CF IA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg478c4">4</xref>). We propose that Ydh1p, Yhh1p&#x0002f;Cft1p, Ysh1p&#x0002f;Brr5p, Pfs2p, Fip1p, and possibly Pta1p, contribute to a protein&#x02013;protein interaction surface which acts in the assembly of the 3&#x02032;-end formation machinery and which appears to be conserved in evolution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg478f5">5</xref>D).</p><p>Our analysis of Ydh1p suggests that the protein is an important constituent of protein interaction surfaces which act in the association of 3&#x02032;-end processing factors with RNAP II, the recognition of poly(A) signal sequences and the assembly of an active 3&#x02032;-end formation complex on the RNA substrate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_31_14_3936__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_31_14_3936__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg478f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>YDH1</italic> mutant strains display a temperature sensitive phenotype.
