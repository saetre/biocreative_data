However, its activity for streptavidin displacement and DNA unwinding has been shown to increase as the number of Dda molecules bound to the substrate molecule increases. A substrate was designed to address the ability of Dda to displace DNA binding proteins. A DNA binding site for the <italic>Escherichia coli trp</italic> repressor was introduced into an oligonucleotide substrate for Dda helicase containing single-stranded overhang. Here we show that a Dda monomer is insufficient to displace the <italic>E.coli trp</italic> repressor from dsDNA under single turnover conditions, although the substrate is unwound and the repressor displaced when the single-stranded overhang is long enough to accommodate two Dda molecules. The quantity of product formed increases when the substrate is able to accommodate more than two Dda molecules. These results indicate that multiple Dda molecules act to displace DNA binding proteins in a manner that correlates with the DNA unwinding activity and streptavidin displacement activity. We suggest a cooperative inchworm model to describe the activities of Dda helicase.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Helicases are ubiquitous molecular motors which utilize the energy of nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis to separate the strands of duplex nucleic acids or move along DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). This strand separation ability makes them essential for virtually all processes in DNA and RNA metabolism, including replication, recombination, transcription and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Helicases have been classified into five families based on sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) and a number of helicase motifs have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). It has become clear that the roles of enzymes containing helicase motifs extend beyond simply separating dsDNA into ssDNA. For example, removing proteins from nucleic acids is now believed to be an important role for both DNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p>Helicases and other enzymes that move along DNA or RNA are likely to encounter proteins that are bound to the nucleic acid. The collision between these proteins can lead to stalling of the motor, displacement of the motor or displacement of the DNA binding protein. The probable outcome of such collisions may depend on the relative affinity of the motor protein compared with the DNA binding protein, as well as the force imparted by the molecular motor. The biological relevance of such collisions is becoming increasingly apparent. For example, RNA polymerase can encounter protein roadblocks that prevent transcription of essential genes. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, stalled RNA polymerase can be &#x02018;pushed&#x02019; by the translocase activity of a helicase-like protein called Mfd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Mfd can push RNAP to correctly position the polymerase active site after stalling. Alternatively, Mfd can completely displace RNAP from the DNA. In other cases, the translocase activity of a polymerase can accelerate the rate of a helicase. Another clear example of a collision between a DNA-dependent ATPase and a DNA binding protein occurs with chromatin remodeling proteins such as those in the SWI2/SNF2 class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Chromatin remodelers disrupt the interaction between DNA and histones but do not necessarily unwind dsDNA. A number of models have been proposed for how remodeling can occur including nucleosome sliding, nucleosome dissociation or histone replacement with a variant histone. Chromatin remodelers share regions of homology to DNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism for helicases has been under intense study by a number of laboratories over the past decade. One aspect of the mechanism that has provided much discussion is in regards to the optimal functional form of helicases. For those enzymes of superfamily 1 (SF1) and SF2, different models have been proposed. Evidence for functional, dimeric forms of helicases has been reported for the <italic>E.coli</italic> Rep helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) and <italic>E.coli</italic> UvrD helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). The proposed inchworm mechanism for helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) places no requirements on the oligomeric structure of the active helicase species. A model for the inchworm mechanism for PcrA helicase has been provided based on biochemical and X-ray crystallographic evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). The SF2 helicase, NS3 helicase domain, from the hepatitis C virus has been proposed to function as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), although functional cooperativity between monomers has been suggested for optimal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). The full-length NS3 helicase has been proposed to function as a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), although optimal activity may require a larger species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>Dda helicase has been shown to be capable of functioning as a monomer for unwinding of short duplex oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) and for displacing streptavidin from 3&#x02032;-biotinylated oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Dda also does not appear to form stable oligomers even in the presence of ATP, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Dda's activity for displacement of streptavidin from 3&#x02032;-biotinylated oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) and for unwinding of short duplex oligonucleotides has been shown to increase as the number of Dda molecules bound to the DNA substrate increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). This led to the proposal of a model for Dda whereby monomeric forms of the enzyme can function in an inchworm-like fashion, yet multiple molecules can function together to enhance the overall activity of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>).</p><p>Although unwinding of duplex DNA is a physiologically relevant reaction, displacement of streptavidin from biotinylated oligonucleotides is a process which Dda does not perform <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the displacement of streptavidin may mimic Dda's ability to displace DNA binding proteins in the path of the replication complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). We sought to determine whether the cooperativity observed for streptavidin displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>) was also exhibited for displacement of a protein bound to duplex DNA. The <italic>E.coli trp</italic> repressor was chosen because it binds to the <italic>trpEDCBA</italic> operator sequence with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;10</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) in the presence of L-Trp.

The standard helicase assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) must allow the ssDNA products to be separated from dsDNA by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This is done by adding a strand of DNA that can hybridize to one of the ssDNA products produced by the helicase activity. This additional strand is referred to as the re-annealing trap. Another feature of helicase experiments described here is that single turnover conditions with respect to the DNA substrate were maintained. Helicases require ATP hydrolysis to unwind dsDNA, therefore the enzyme can be incubated with the DNA substrate prior to initiating the reaction. Single turnover conditions can be obtained by introducing a large amount of ssDNA such as poly dT at the same time as the ATP. The poly dT serves as a protein trap that binds to any enzyme that is free in solution or dissociates from the substrate. Thus, in addition to the DNA substrate, the reaction contains a re-annealing trap and a protein trap.</p><p>The <italic>trp</italic> repressor was chosen based on the ease of the protein purification and the well-characterized affinity for duplex dsDNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). The addition of a DNA-binding protein contributes additional complications to the assay. The <italic>trpEDCBA</italic> operator is a palindromic sequence which could be problematic for trapping of the ssDNA reaction products in the helicase assay. For this reason, the substrate was designed with 12 nt of non-palindromic sequence adjacent to the <italic>trpEDCBA</italic> operator sequence to aid in substrate preparation and increase trapping efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To test the effectiveness of the DNA trap, an unwinding reaction was performed with 750 nM Dda and 100 nM substrate containing a 12 nt single-strand overhang in the absence of a protein trap. Under these conditions, all of the substrate would be expected to be converted to product, allowing the trapping efficiency to be determined. No substrate was present after 1 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that the displaced strand can be effectively trapped using a re-annealing trap complimentary to the 12 nt of non-palindromic sequence in the displaced strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Next we sought to determine whether displacement of <italic>trp</italic> repressor from the substrate was dependent on ATP and Dda. In the absence of ATP, no displacement was observed after 20 s, but the substrate was converted to product in the presence of 5 mM ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Product was also not formed in the absence of Dda, but substrate was completely converted to product in the presence of 750 nM Dda (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This indicates that the <italic>trp</italic> repressor is displaced by Dda as it unwinds the DNA substrate.</p></sec><sec><title>Helicase-catalyzed displacement of the <italic>E.coli trp</italic> repressor and DNA unwinding</title><p>Dda sequesters 6 nt when bound to ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Based on this, a substrate with an 8 nt single-strand overhang should easily be able to accommodate one Dda molecule. Since the <italic>trp</italic> repressor binding site is at the ssDNA&#x02013;dsDNA junction, it is unlikely that much fraying occurs, so binding of more than one Dda molecule would be unlikely. Dda helicase exhibits higher processivity when more than one molecule of the enzyme binds to the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). We wished to compare the protein displacement activity of monomeric Dda with that of multiple molecules of Dda, so substrates with 12 and 24 ssDNA overhangs were designed that should be able to bind two and four Dda molecules when saturated, respectively.</p><p>Displacement of <italic>trp</italic> repressor from and unwinding in the presence of <italic>trp</italic> repressor of substrates with 8, 12 and 24 nt single-strands were compared. Dda was incubated with substrate, and the reactions were initiated by addition of ATP, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and protein and re-annealing traps. The products were separated by PAGE in the presence of L-Trp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The <italic>trp</italic> repressor bound, dsDNA substrate could be separated from the unbound dsDNA substrate, allowing for protein displacement to be measured in the absence of DNA unwinding. However, the unbound dsDNA appeared only transiently in the reaction, and almost all of dsDNA substrate from which <italic>trp</italic> repressor was displaced and was quickly melted by the helicase. Reaction progress curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) show that the unwinding reaction is completed rapidly after the protein is displaced. The same quantities of product are formed in both reactions, which illustrates that Dda is capable of displacing a protein and continuing with the unwinding reaction after displacement since the <italic>trp</italic> repressor must be displaced before the final 12 bp can be unwound. No unwinding or displacement is seen when the substrate contains only 8 nt of single-strand, suggesting that a single Dda molecule is not capable of displacing the <italic>trp</italic> repressor while unwinding DNA under single cycle conditions. A monomer is capable of unwinding naked DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) but for unwinding of this substrate to occur, the bound protein must first be displaced. The displacement of <italic>trp</italic> repressor and unwinding of the DNA require multiple steps, as indicated by the initial lag in product formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The lag phases are identical, again suggesting that protein displacement limits the overall reaction rate.</p><p>In order to ensure that the substrate was saturated with respect to Dda, the reaction with the three substrates was conducted at two concentrations of Dda with each substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). No increase in the rate or amplitude was observed when Dda was raised from 750 nM to 1 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Therefore, 750 nM Dda is sufficient to saturate the rate on 100 nM of all the three substrates.</p></sec><sec><title>Unwinding of unbound dsDNA</title><p>To determine whether protein displacement limits the reaction rate and quantity of product formed, unwinding reactions were performed in the absence of <italic>trp</italic> repressor on each substrate. Reactions were performed as described for the <italic>trp</italic> repressor displacement experiments except the <italic>trp</italic> repressor was omitted. Samples were analyzed by PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Reaction progress curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) show that the quantity of product formed increases as the length of the ssDNA overhang increases. Interestingly, product is observed with the substrate containing 8 nt ssDNA overhang (filled circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), whereas in the presence of <italic>trp</italic> repressor, no product was observed (filled circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Unwinding of the free 30 bp duplex also exhibits a lag phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), although the lag phase is shorter than that for unwinding in the presence of the <italic>trp</italic> repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that fewer steps are required for unwinding of free DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of quantities of product formed and rates in the presence or absence of <italic>trp</italic> repressor</title><p>The quantity of product formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and the rate at which it is formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The major difference between DNA unwinding and <italic>trp</italic> repressor displacement occurs on the substrate containing the 8 nt ssDNA overhang. Little product for DNA unwinding or <italic>trp</italic> repressor displacement was observed with this substrate in the presence of the repressor. However, the substrate was rapidly unwound in the absence of <italic>trp</italic> repressor. The quantity of product formed for protein displacement and DNA unwinding are similar in the presence of <italic>trp</italic> repressor with the substrates containing the 12 nt ssDNA overhang, but the rate for DNA unwinding is somewhat faster in the absence of <italic>trp</italic> repressor. The magnitude of these differences decreases as the length of the single-stranded portion of the substrate increases from 12 to 24 nt, suggesting that the more Dda molecules bound, the more efficient the displacement of the protein bound in its path. The rate and quantity of product formation in the presence and absence of <italic>trp</italic> repressor are nearly identical when the substrate can accommodate up to four Dda molecules. The fact that unwinding occurs at nearly identical rates to <italic>trp</italic> repressor displacement in the presence of <italic>trp</italic> repressor, compared with somewhat faster rates for unwinding in the absence of <italic>trp</italic> repressor, indicates that the unwinding reaction is more rapid than protein displacement.</p></sec><sec><title>Dda does bind to the substrate with an 8 ntsingle-strand when <italic>trp</italic> repressor is bound</title><p>No displacement or unwinding in the presence of <italic>trp</italic> repressor was observed from the substrate with an 8 nt single-strand. Since the <italic>trp</italic> repressor binding site is at the ssDNA&#x02013;dsDNA junction, it is possible that the <italic>trp</italic> repressor protein overhangs the single-stranded region of the substrate somewhat and prevents Dda from binding. The equilibrium dissociation constants for Dda from a substrate containing an 8 nt single-strand in the presence and absence of bound <italic>trp</italic> repressor were found to be nearly identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that Dda is bound to the substrate with the 8 nt single-strand even when the <italic>trp</italic> repressor is bound. However, a single Dda molecule is not able to displace the bound protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>DNA and RNA helicases are motor proteins that manipulate nucleic acids in virtually all aspects of nucleic acid metabolism. The primary role for DNA helicases is believed to be in melting of dsDNA, which is likely to be the role in most cases. The role for helicases in RNA metabolism is not as clear, although for both RNA and DNA, collisions between helicases and proteins bound to nucleic acids are highly probable to occur. These collisions may lead to dissociation of the translocating helicase, or the bound protein might be displaced by the helicase. Numerous examples of collisions between DNA or RNA translocases have been reported, but the mechanism for protein displacement has not been described. For example, DNA replication termination in <italic>E.coli</italic> has been shown to occur at defined sequences due to specific interaction between the DnaB helicase and the replication terminator protein Tus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Other protein&#x02013;nucleic acid complexes do not impede DnaB helicase. Kaplan and O'Donnell showed that DnaB can displace dsDNA-binding proteins during translocation on dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). This activity of DnaB was proposed to facilitate branch migration in DNA recombination or to strip proteins away from sites of DNA repair. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, termination of replication forks is controlled in a sequence-specific fashion by the interaction of the Fob1p replication terminator protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Stalled replication forks can be released by the Rrm3p helicase (termed a &#x02018;sweepase&#x02019;). The action of Rrm3p is modulated by other proteins such as Tof1p-Csm3p complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Hence, a complex series of protein collisions controls the number of replication forks that can proceed through normal termination sites in this organism.</p><p>Removal of proteins from RNA was shown <italic>in vitro</italic> in the case of NPH-II helicase illustrating that RNA helicases can participate in structural reorganization of ribonucleoprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). The ability of RNA helicases to remove proteins from dsRNA in the absence of RNA unwinding has also been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Evidence has been presented for a functionally significant role for two putative yeast helicases, Sub2 and Prp28, in disruption of protein&#x02013;RNA complexes during spliceosomal assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>).</p><p>We have designed a substrate for evaluation of the biochemical mechanism of displacement of protein&#x02013;DNA complexes by Dda helicase. The substrate was designed so that the monomeric form of Dda could be compared with multimeric forms of the enzyme by increasing the length of the ssDNA loading strand. Dda has been found to function as a monomer in unwinding short oligonucleotide substrates, but the processivity of the enzyme is enhanced by increasing the number of molecules bound to a DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Dda also displaces streptavidin from biotin labeled oligonucleotides, and the activity exhibits positive cooperativity, again illustrating the idea that more molecules of helicase appear to function together. The data for streptavidin displacement activity support a model whereby two or more Dda molecules interact to enhance the activity of the enzyme. This might occur in a manner where a trailing molecule of helicase pushes a leading molecule along the nucleic acid strand, or prevents the lead molecule from slipping during translocation. The data for DNA unwinding by Dda can be interpreted in terms of &#x02018;functional&#x02019; cooperativity, which does not rely on protein&#x02013;protein interactions <italic>per se</italic>. The latter term has been applied to the NS3 helicase domain to explain how multiple molecules can work on the same substrate to enhance the rate and quantity of ssDNA formed from dsDNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Functional cooperativity can occur when the trailing molecule of helicase continues unwinding dsDNA after the lead molecule dissociates, thereby leading to increased product formation. Also, the trailing molecule can prevent re-annealing of the ssDNA products that might occur after the lead molecule unwinds a given number of base pairs. It is likely that some of the biochemical activities of Dda require interactions between helicase monomers and other activities do not require protein&#x02013;protein interactions.</p><p>A single Dda molecule was not capable of displacing the <italic>E.coli trp</italic> repressor from the <italic>trpEDCBA</italic> operator sequence or unwinding DNA with a <italic>trp</italic> repressor molecule bound under single turnover conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), although it was able to unwind the DNA in the absence of <italic>trp</italic> repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Two Dda molecules were sufficient to convert about half of the substrate to product in the presence of <italic>trp</italic> repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), although, more unwinding was observed in the absence of bound protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The longest ssDNA overhang used here (24 nt) can bind up to four Dda molecules. When this substrate was examined, almost all of the <italic>trp</italic> repressor was displaced and nearly all of the substrate unwound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). In fact, the quantity of product formed and rate of product formation for protein displacement, unwinding in the presence of bound <italic>trp</italic> repressor, and unwinding of naked DNA were nearly identical when four Dda molecules were bound to the substrate. This suggests that although a Dda monomer is sufficient to unwind the 30 bp of DNA, it cannot produce the force necessary to unwind DNA and displace a protein bound to the duplex at the same time under single turnover conditions. Two Dda molecules can accomplish this task, although the presence of the protein slows the unwinding process. When more than two molecules of Dda are bound to the substrate, progression of the unwinding reaction is unaffected by the presence of the bound protein, indicating that multiple Dda molecules have increased activity in protein displacement.</p><p>The unwinding reaction was limited by protein displacement, as illustrated by the faster DNA unwinding in the absence of <italic>trp</italic> repressor. The longer lag phase in the presence of <italic>trp</italic> repressor indicates that Dda needed additional catalytic cycles to displace the <italic>trp</italic> repressor (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This observation is consistent with the idea that Dda may slip when encountering a block or challenge in its path, therefore requiring additional steps to complete the process. This also illustrates the need for multiple Dda molecules to remove <italic>trp</italic> repressor, because monomeric Dda is not highly processive, therefore it is not able to undergo as many catalytic cycles after encountering the protein block. The fact that protein displacement and dsDNA unwinding were correlated so tightly for the substrates with longer ssDNA overhangs indicates that the displacement reaction was probably a direct consequence of the DNA unwinding. This suggests that the DNA melting activity of Dda is responsible for protein displacement.</p><p>Others have shown that Dda can displace proteins from DNA including the <italic>E.coli</italic> lac repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>) and the <italic>E.coli</italic> Ter protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). However, not all protein&#x02013;DNA complexes are displaced by Dda. Dda was unable to dislodge a GAL4&#x02013;DNA complex, even under conditions which should favor binding of more than one molecule of Dda to the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). Therefore, some specific protein&#x02013;DNA complexes are able to sequester Dda in a manner that appears to trap Dda and reduce the ATP hydrolysis activity of the enzyme. It is possible that the GAL4&#x02013;DNA complex adopts a unique structure that perturbs Dda's interaction with DNA.</p><p>A model for Dda helicase activity is emerging that illustrates a role for multiple helicase molecules per substrate, whether DNA unwinding is measured or protein displacement. The work here illustrates that the idea of cooperative function of Dda put forth for streptavidin displacement applies for displacement of DNA-binding proteins as well; i.e. increasing the number of Dda molecules leads to enhanced activity. This model suggests that multiple helicase molecules can cooperate to unwind DNA and displace proteins more effectively than a single molecule. The activity continues to increase as more helicase molecules bind to the same substrate. We suggest the term &#x02018;cooperative inchworm&#x02019; to describe Dda, which illustrates the ability of individual monomers to function, but the increased activity as more than one molecule binds to a substrate. Some challenges presented to the helicase, such as protein displacement or unwinding of long stretches of dsDNA, require the action of multiple helicase molecules, whereas short duplexes can readily be melted by the monomeric form of this enzyme.</p><p>A cartoon depicting a possible mechanism by which two helicases can function together to displace the <italic>trp</italic> repressor is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Monomeric Dda is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. Of the helicases for which structures are available, Dda is most similar to RecD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). RecD contains two domains that include the known helicase motifs found in super family 1 helicases, and like Dda, translocates in a 5&#x02032;-to-3&#x02032; direction. Based on the reported structure of RecD, and by making analogous comparison with the inchworm model proposed for PcrA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), the two domains in RecD are thought to adopt open and closed conformations as a function of binding ATP. Dda is also thought to contain two major &#x02018;helicase domains&#x02019; based on limited proteolyis experiments (L. Blair and K. D. Raney, unpublished observations). The two domains of Dda are depicted as a leading domain and a trailing domain in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Further, these two domains can adopt an open conformation in the absence of ATP binding and closed conformation in the presence of ATP binding. Movement of the helicase along nucleic acid is proposed to be driven by cycling between these conformations as a function of ATP binding and hydrolysis. When monomeric Dda encounters the <italic>trp</italic> repressor, movement of the helicase is impeded by the presence of the repressor, which serves as a protein block. Monomeric Dda can continue to hydrolyze ATP upon encountering a protein block, without immediately displacing the protein block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that Dda is able to &#x02018;slip&#x02019; backwards, which is indicated by the small reverse arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. Slipping by Dda occurs as a result of the trailing domain losing its grip on the nucleic acid, thereby re-establishing the open conformation without forward movement. When two molecules of Dda are bound to the same substrate, <italic>trp</italic> repressor can be displaced as a result of the second Dda molecule acting as a brake or an anchor for the first molecule, thereby preventing the backwards slipping of the first molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This model for Dda is similar to a model recently reported for the interaction between T7 polymerase and the T7 helicase. DNA synthesis by the T7 polymerase provides the driving force that speeds up the DNA unwinding rate for T7 helicase by &#x0223c;10-fold (47). The enhanced rate of the helicase has been interpreted in terms of a &#x02018;push&#x02019; by the polymerase or as a &#x02018;brake&#x02019; by the polymerase to prevent the helicase from sliding backwards.</p><p>The fact that multiple molecules of Dda are required for protein displacement may illustrate an additional level of regulation available for determining the outcome of collisions between translocases and DNA binding proteins. The number of helicase molecules that can be loaded onto a particular DNA sequence is likely to be dependent on whether DNA repair, replication or recombination or transcription is being catalyzed. Dda helicase has been implicated in playing some role in disrupting biological significant protein&#x02013;nucleic acid interactions. The first step in the homologous pairing reaction catalyzed by the T4 uvsX recombinase is inhibited by Dda helicase, presumably by disruption of the uvsX protein&#x02013;DNA filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). However, Dda is known to bind to uvsX and stimulate branch migration activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). The protein displacment activity of Dda is believed to allow branch migration through a DNA&#x02013;protein complex containing an RNA polymerase promoter complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). The number of Dda molecules required for these processes <italic>in vivo</italic> remains to be determined. In addition to binding to uvsX, Dda is also known to bind to the T4 single-stranded binding protein, gp32. Each of these proteins is known to form filaments along nucleic acid. If these proteins play a role in loading Dda onto ssDNA, then it is possible that multiple Dda molecules are loaded onto specific DNA sites <italic>in vivo</italic> as a result of the interaction of Dda with multiprotein filaments such as uvsX and gp32.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by research grant GM059400 (K.D.R) from the National Institutes of Health and the UAMS graduate student research fund (A.K.B.).

(<bold>A</bold>) In the presence of ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Dda is capable of displacing the <italic>E.coli trp</italic> repressor from the <italic>trpEDCBA</italic> operator and unwinding the duplex. A re-annealing trap complimentary to the non-palindromic portion of the displaced strand (the 12 nt closest to the 5&#x02032; end of the displaced strand) was included in the reaction to prevent the displaced strand of DNA from re-annealing to the loading strand. The <italic>trp</italic> repressor only binds to duplex DNA so it is unable to bind to the ssDNA product after displacement from the substrate. This assay allows both unwinding and protein displacement to be monitored simultaneously. A protein trap was also included to prevent Dda that dissociates from the substrate from rebinding to the substrate. (<bold>B</bold>) The substrates used contain the <italic>E.coli trpEDCBA</italic> operator sequence (highlighted) at the ssDNA&#x02013;dsDNA junction, followed by 12 bp of non-palindromic sequence. The single-stranded portion of the substrate consists of a variable number of thymidine residues.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkl369f1"/></fig><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Assessment of the DNA unwinding and protein displacement assay. (<bold>A</bold>) Product formation is plotted for unwinding in the absence of a protein trap to illustrate that the re-annealing trap functions well even though part of the duplex sequence is a palindrome. Substrate (100 nM) containing a 12 nt single-strand was pre-incubated with Dda (750 nM) and the reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and a re-annealing trap.

Upon hydrolyzing ATP, the helicase moves forward while adopting an open conformation (ii). Upon binding ATP, the domains change conformations to adopt the closed conformation (iii). The presence of the <italic>trp</italic> repressor prevents the helicase from moving forward after ATP hydrolysis, therefore the enzyme slips backward or dissociates from the substrate.
