Plastid division involves nucleus-encoded homologs of cyanobacterial division proteins such as FtsZ, MinD, MinE, and ARC6. However, homologs of many other cyanobacterial division genes are missing in plant genomes and proteins of host eukaryotic origin, such as a dynamin-related protein, PDV1 and PDV2 are involved in the division process. Recent identification of plastid division proteins has started to elucidate the similarities and differences between plastid division and cyanobacterial cell division. To further identify new proteins that are required for plastid division, we characterized previously and newly isolated plastid division mutants of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Leaf cells of two mutants, <italic>br04 </italic>and <italic>arc2</italic>, contain fewer, larger chloroplasts than those of wild type. We found that <italic>ARC2 </italic>and <italic>BR04 </italic>are identical to nuclear genes encoding the plastid chaperonin 60&#x003b1; (ptCpn60&#x003b1;) and chaperonin 60&#x003b2; (ptCpn60&#x003b2;) proteins, respectively. In both mutants, plastid division FtsZ ring formation was partially perturbed though the level of FtsZ2-1 protein in plastids of <italic>ptcpn60&#x003b2; </italic>mutants was similar to that in wild type. Phylogenetic analyses showed that both ptCpn60 proteins are derived from ancestral cyanobacterial proteins. The <italic>A. thaliana </italic>genome encodes two members of ptCpn60&#x003b1; family and four members of ptCpn60&#x003b2; family respectively. We found that a null mutation in <italic>ptCpn60&#x003b1; </italic>abolished greening of plastids and resulted in an albino phenotype while a weaker mutation impairs plastid division and reduced chlorophyll levels. The functions of at least two ptCpn60&#x003b2; proteins are redundant and the appearance of chloroplast division defects is dependent on the number of mutant alleles.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that both ptCpn60&#x003b1; and ptCpn60&#x003b2; are required for the formation of a normal plastid division apparatus, as the prokaryotic counterparts are required for assembly of the cell division apparatus. Since moderate reduction of ptCpn60 levels impaired normal FtsZ ring formation but not import of FtsZ into plastids, it is suggested that the proper levels of ptCpn60 are required for folding of stromal plastid division proteins and/or regulation of FtsZ polymer dynamics.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>All plastids trace their origins to a primary endosymbiotic event in which a previously nonphotosynthetic protist engulfed and enslaved a cyanobacterium. Over time, most of the genes once present in the endosymbiont have been lost or transferred to the host nuclear genome; those nuclear-encoded proteins used by the plastid are translated by the host and targeted back into the organelle to express their functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Consistent with this scenario, plastids are never synthesized <italic>de novo </italic>and they cannot multiply independently. Their continuity is maintained by the division of preexisting plastids, which is performed and controlled by proteins encoded in the nuclear genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Consistent with the endosymbiotic origin of plastids, molecular genetic studies in <italic>A. thaliana </italic>have defined several nucleus-encoded homologs of cyanobacterial cell division proteins that function in plastid division in photosynthetic eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Plastid division requires assembly of FtsZ1 and FtsZ2, homologs of the tubulin-like bacterial protein FtsZ, into a ring structure at the midplastid division site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The FtsZ ring is localized to the midplastid through the activities of MinD and MinE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and is thought to be stabilized by the J-domain-like protein ARC6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Mutations in several other cyanobacteria-derived genes, such as <italic>Giant Chloroplast 1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and <italic>Crumpled Leaf </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], also cause defects in plastid division, although their roles in the division process are still not known.</p><p>Plant-specific proteins (dynamin-related GTPase protein, PDV1 and PDV2) also regulate chloroplast division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Division involves the assembly and constriction of the endosymbiont-derived FtsZ ring on the stromal surface of the inner envelope membrane and the plant-specific dynamin ring on the cytosolic surface of the outer envelope membrane. This coordination is mediated by the outer envelope spanning proteins PDV1 and PDV2, and inner envelope spanning protein ARC6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. As above, recent studies identified several additional components of the plastid division machinery. However, several other proteins that are involved in bacterial cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] are not found in plants, and there are still unidentified <italic>arc </italic>(<underline>a</underline>ccumulation and <underline>r</underline>eplication of <underline>c</underline>hloroplasts) loci that impair chloroplast division in <italic>A. thaliana </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], suggesting that there are still unidentified components of the plastid division machinery. In order to identify new plastid division proteins, we are using forward genetics approaches.</p><p>By characterizing plastid division mutants, we found that the cyanobacteria-derived chaperonin proteins ptCpn60&#x003b1; and ptCpn60&#x003b2; are required for proper plastid division in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. The <italic>A. thaliana </italic>genome encodes several members of the ptCpn60&#x003b1; and ptCpn60&#x003b2; families and our analyses suggest that at least two ptCpn60&#x003b2; proteins have redundant functions. Moderate reduction of ptCpn60&#x003b2; protein levels impaired plastid division while severe loss abolished greening of plastids, suggesting that the level of ptCpn60&#x003b2; is important for proper plastid division. Since chaperonin proteins have been shown to be required for assembly of the division apparatus in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], their activities in the division machinery are conserved between bacteria and plastids.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Mutations in ptCpn60&#x003b1; and ptCpn60&#x003b2; impair plastid division</title><p>In order to find new proteins required for plastid division, we screened 22,650 <italic>A. thaliana </italic>Activation Tagging Lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. By microscopic observation of leaf cell chloroplasts, we found twenty-five mutant lines with chloroplasts that were significantly altered in number and size within single cells as compared with those in the wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Among these mutants, one line, <italic>br04</italic>, which contained enlarged chloroplasts, was characterized in this study (<italic>ptcpn60&#x003b2;1-1</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

These results indicated that the chloroplast-division phenotype of <italic>br04 </italic>is recessive and that the phenotype is caused by a mutation in a single genomic locus.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Chloroplast division defects and mutation sites in plastid <italic>cpn60 </italic>mutants</bold>.

The nucleotide insertion produced a premature stop codon in the second exon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). To confirm that the mutation in At1g55490 is linked to the chloroplast-division phenotype, we observed another T-DNA insertion mutant in the same gene (SAIL_852_B03; <italic>ptcpn60&#x003b2;1&#x02013;2</italic>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>).

Because two independent mutant alleles of At1g55490 showed chloroplast division defects, we conclude that At1g55490 is identical to <italic>br04 </italic>and is required for plastid division.</p><p>Supporting the above relationship between ptCpn60&#x003b2; and plastid division, map-based cloning of the previously isolated chloroplast division mutant <italic>arc2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] revealed a mutation in At2g28000, which encodes ptCpn60&#x003b1;.

The <italic>arc2 </italic>mutation bears a single nucleotide substitution, which converts Ala-342 to Val in At2g28000 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). In addition, a genomic copy of At2g28000 complemented the chloroplast-division defect in <italic>arc2 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>), indicating that <italic>ARC2 </italic>is identical to At2g28000. These results indicate that ptCpn60&#x003b1; as well as ptCpn60&#x003b2; proteins are required for normal plastid division.</p></sec><sec><title>Moderate reduction of ptCpn60&#x003b1; or ptCpn60&#x003b2; activity causes defects in chloroplast division while severe reduction abolishes greening</title><p>A previous study showed that a T-DNA insertion null mutant of <italic>ptcpn60&#x003b1; </italic>(<italic>schlepperless</italic>, At2g28000) had a defect in embryo development and greening of plastids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>arc2</italic>, a missense allele, germinated normally, though it showed a dwarf phenotype later in development. <italic>br04 </italic>(At1g55490) also germinated normally, consistent with previous observations of another null allele of At1g55490, <italic>lesion initiation 1 </italic>(<italic>len1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Although leaves of <italic>len1 </italic>had wrinkled irregular surfaces and displayed lesion formation under short-day conditions, under long-day conditions similar to those used throughout our study, these phenotypes were not observed and the plants showed a dwarf phenotype similar to that of <italic>br04 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We hypothesized that the differences in phenotypes resulted from remnant ptCpn60&#x003b1; activity in the case of <italic>arc2 </italic>and redundant ptCpn60&#x003b2; proteins in the case of <italic>br04</italic>.</p><p>To address the above possibilities, we first analyzed ptCpn60 proteins in <italic>A. thaliana </italic>by phylogenetic analyses. The results showed monophyly of six <italic>A. thaliana </italic>proteins with cyanobacterial chaperonin 60 proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Of these, two proteins, including At2g28000, were grouped as ptCpn60&#x003b1; (we named them ptCpn60&#x003b1;1 and ptCpn60&#x003b1;2), and four proteins, including At1g55490, were grouped as ptCpn60&#x003b2; (ptCpn60&#x003b2;1 through ptCpn60&#x003b2;4). These results are consistent with a previous classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Further, our phylogenetic analyses indicated that there are two types of cyanobacterial chaperonin 60 proteins, GroEL-1 and GroEL-2, and that only one group, GroEL-1, gave rise to ptCpn60&#x003b1; and ptCpn60&#x003b2; in land plants and green algae (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Phylogenetic relationships among plastid chaperonin 60 proteins</bold>.

Since the antibodies still detected a faint band at the same position on the gel in the double mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), they may also recognize ptCpn60&#x003b2;3 and/or ptCpn60&#x003b2;4.

The fluorescence signal was detected specifically in chloroplasts but was not detected by preimmune antisera or secondary antibodies alone (not shown).

The results also indicate that the mutant phenotypes vary depending on the severity of the mutations. In addition to defects in plastid division, <italic>ptCpn60 </italic>mutants exhibited dwarfed or other developmental defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A similar situation was observed in the <italic>crumpled leaf </italic>(<italic>crl</italic>) mutant, which also showed both plastid division defects and abnormal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Because both ptCpn60 and CRL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] function in chloroplasts and, in our screening, several mutant plants that showed abnormal morphology contained chloroplasts of normal size, it is unlikely that the developmental defects are the cause of the observed chloroplast division defects.</p><p>Chaperonins are evolutionarily conserved molecular chaperones found in bacteria (named GroE), mitochondria and plastids. The structure and mechanisms of chaperonin function have been well studied mainly using the chaperonin of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, GroE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The GroE chaperonin functions as a large complex consisting of multiple 60-kD GroEL and 10-kD GroES subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Although <italic>in vitro </italic>studies have clarified the mechanism of GroEL as a molecular chaperone, the <italic>in vivo </italic>roles are poorly understood. GroE is essential for the viability of <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and this is partly because GroE is required for cell wall synthesis. In addition to the cell lysis phenotype of GroE-depleted <italic>E. coli</italic>, it has been reported that cells with impaired GroE exhibit filamentous cell morphology owing to defects in cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The filamentous phenotypes were also observed in GroE-depleted <italic>Caulobacter crescentus </italic>and <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, suggesting that GroE plays a universal role in cell division in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Plastid Cpn60 proteins are homologs of bacterial GroEL and phylogenetic studies indicate that plant Cpn60 proteins evolved from GroEL proteins in the cyanobacterial ancestor of plastids ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Previous studies showed that depletion of ptCpn60 proteins in <italic>A. thaliana </italic>results in abnormal development of embryos and plastids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and cell death in some growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Although severe mutations in <italic>ptCpn60 </italic>genes resulted in albino and dwarf seedlings, we found that weaker mutations confer defects in plastid division. Even though plastid chaperonins are expected to be involved in several processes occurring in plastids as are bacterial chaperonins, our results suggest that one of the roles of the chaperonins is related to plastid division and that the role in division is conserved between bacteria and plastids. It is also known that plastid chaperonins are different from <italic>E. coli </italic>GroE in that plastids contain two distinct proteins, ptCpn60&#x003b1; and ptCpn60&#x003b2;, both of which are expressed in all tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Despite the difference, our results showed that both ptCpn60&#x003b1; and ptCpn60&#x003b2; are required for plastid division.</p><p>In our analyses, depletion of ptCpn60 proteins did not alter the level of plastid FtsZ. The size of the FtsZ protein in the mutants was the same as that in wild type, indicating that the transit peptide was cleaved and the protein was imported into plastids. Both in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and <italic>A. thaliana </italic>chloroplasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), normal FtsZ ring formation is impaired in the respective chaperonin mutants even though FtsZ protein levels are normal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). These results suggest that ptCpn60 proteins are not required for import of plastid division proteins into plastids. Rather, it is suggested that ptCpn60s are required for assembly and/or maintenance of the plastid division apparatus after import of the components into plastids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, the mechanistic basis of the chloroplast division defect remains unclear. The abnormally long, disorganized FtsZ filaments observed in the <italic>ptcpn60 </italic>mutants resemble the reported FtsZ2 localization patterns in an <italic>ftsZ1 </italic>null mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], an <italic>ftsZ1 </italic>antisense line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and in a line overexpressing <italic>ARC6</italic>, which functions in part to stabilize FtsZ polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The <italic>ptcpn60 </italic>FtsZ morphologies are distinct from those observed in <italic>minD </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] (multiple closed FtsZ rings with multiple constriction), <italic>minE </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], <italic>arc6 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] (many fragmented short FtsZ filaments), <italic>pdv1, pdv2 </italic>and <italic>arc5 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] (multiple rings or spirals at the constriction site) mutants. The mutant phenotypes suggest that reduced ptCpn60 levels result in excessively stable FtsZ filaments, though whether this is through a direct effect on FtsZ or a regulator of FtsZ assembly, and whether the effects result from misfolding of some proteins in the mutant backgrounds or loss of another activity of ptCpn60, remain to be determined. Whatever the mechanism, the results provided evidence of a role for the ptCpn60 chaperone system in the regulation of FtsZ polymer dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We compared the effects of several combinations of <italic>ptCpn60&#x003b2; </italic>alleles. The appearance of the chloroplast division phenotype depends on the number of disrupted alleles of <italic>ptcpn60&#x003b2;</italic>. For example, chloroplast size and number in the <italic>ptcpn60&#x003b2;1-1 </italic>heterozygote and <italic>ptcpn60&#x003b2;2 </italic>homozygote were normal, but combining these alleles (<italic>ptcpn60&#x003b2;1-1 </italic>heterozygous <italic>ptcpn60&#x003b2;2 </italic>homozygous mutant) impaired chloroplast division (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G8</xref>). The lack of an obvious phenotype in <italic>ptcpn60&#x003b2;2 </italic>is probably because the level of total ptCpn60&#x003b2; decreased little in this mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The results suggest that ptCpn60&#x003b2;1 and ptCpn60&#x003b2;2 have redundant functions and that the plastid division defects in the <italic>ptcpn60&#x003b2; </italic>mutants are due to decreased ptCpn60&#x003b2; dosage. Thus far, several plastid division proteins of cyanobacterial origin, such as FtsZ, MinD, MinE, ARC6, and GC1, were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Studies showing that the stoichiometry among these proteins is tightly maintained in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and that moderate loss or overexpression of FtsZ, MinD and MinE impairs plastid division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] suggest that normal plastid division requires the presence of the proper stoichiometric relationship among plastid division proteins. The observed defects in plastid division in a series of <italic>ptcpn60&#x003b2; </italic>mutants even in the presence of wild type <italic>ptCpn60&#x003b2; </italic>alleles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>) may reflect disruption of the stoichiometric relationship of functional plastid division proteins due to misfolding in the mutants after import from the cytosol.</p><p>Studies using <italic>E. coli </italic>showed preferential localization of a population of GroEL at division sites by immunofluorescence labelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In our immunofluorescence analyses, however, ptCpn60&#x003b2; proteins are spattered throughout the chloroplasts of <italic>A. thaliana </italic>and we could not observe predominant localization of the protein at the division site. This observation is perhaps because of the existence of several chloroplast proteins which require Cpn60 proteins for their folding. In fact, many proteins other than division proteins have been identified as possible targets of bacterial GroEL as below. Despite of this observation, it is still possible that a portion of the ptCpn60 pool interacts with the plastid division machinery. A study in <italic>E. coli </italic>further suggested that the division protein FtsE is a target substrate of the GroE system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In contrast, FtsE is missing in plant and algal genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], suggesting that the plastid Cpn60 system targets a different plastid division substrate(s). Proteome-based analyses in <italic>E. coli </italic>identified ~300 proteins that interact with GroE, including the cell division proteins FtsE, FtsA, FtsI, and FtsZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] although GroE-dependent folding of FtsA, FtsI, and FtsZ has not been examined. Of these, only FtsZ is conserved in plant genomes, raising the possibility that FtsZ might be a target of Cpn60 in the plastid.</p><p>Several other molecular chaperone proteins have been shown to function in plastids, such as HSP100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and HSP70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], but there is limited information about their substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Although it is known that functional specificity of Hsp70 is mediated by specialized co-chaperones, how and what kinds of proteins GroE/Cpn60 recognize <italic>in vivo </italic>is little understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Further studies on the interaction between GroEL and plastid division proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>, such as co-immunoprecipitation and FRET analyses, would shed light on the role of ptCpn60 in the assembly and/or maintenance of the plastid division machinery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results show that cyanobacteria-derived ptCpn60&#x003b1; and ptCpn60&#x003b2; proteins are required for plastid division.

Although plants have several members of the ptCpn60&#x003b1; and ptCpn60&#x003b2; family, we found that moderate reduction of ptCpn60 level results in impaired plastid division and reduction of chlorophylls.
