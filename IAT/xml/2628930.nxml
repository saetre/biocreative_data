Many different mechanisms have been suggested to explain the development of an MDR phenotype in cancer cells. One of the most studied mechanisms is the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is a product of the <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene. Tumor cells often acquire the drug-resistance phenotype due to upregulation of the <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene. Overexpression of <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene has often been reported in primary gastric adenocarcinoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study investigated the role of p38-MAPK signal pathway in vincristine-resistant SGC7901/VCR cells. P-gp and MDR1 RNA were detected by Western blot analysis and RT-PCR amplification.

The MDR phenotype is often related to overexpression of drug-efflux pumps in cancer cells. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a 170-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by the <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene, is one of the best characterized drug efflux pumps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Overexpression of P-gp on the surface of tumor cells allows removal of cytotoxic drugs out of the cell in an energy-dependent manner, thereby reducing drug accumulation and increasing multidrug resistance. In addition, inhibition of the P-gp function or inhibition of its expression could prevent the P-gp-mediated MDR phenotype and improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, there is accumulating evidence that P-gp-associated MDR cells develop other pathways instigating chemoresistance to P-gp-unrelated drugs such as cisplatin and 5-FU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Expression of P-gp has been reported to be regulated through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms and by various endogenous and environmental stimuli that evoke stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The transcriptional factor AP-1 has been shown to mediate P-gp expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Regulation of the AP-1 pathway is highly complex and activation of certain signal pathways seems to stimulate the transcriptional activity of AP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Simultaneous expression of P-gp and activation of several signal pathways has been found in some cancer cells. Moreover, these pathways have been reported to regulate the expression of P-gp in some multidrug-resistant cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and blocking these pathways with their specific inhibitors has also been found to reduce P-gp expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These studies suggest that signal pathways play a positive role in the regulation of P-gp expression</p><p>In the present study, we assessed p38-MAPK phosphorylation and AP-1 activity in drug-resistant and drug-sensitive gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, the effect of the p38-MAPK inhibitor SB202190 on the <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression and AP-1 activity was also tested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture and reagents</title><p>Drug-sensitive human gastric cancer cell SGC7901 and the corresponding vincristine-resistant cell SGC7901/VCR were kindly provided by the Institute of Digestive Diseases (Fourth Military Medical University). All cells were cultivated in RPMI1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in a CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator. To maintain the drug-resistance phenotype of SGC7901/VCR cells, vincristine (1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml) was also added to the medium. Cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and epirubicin were purchased from QILU PHARMA (JiNan, Shandong, China). SB202190 was obtained from TOCRIS (Ballwin, MO, USA).

After 4&#x02013;6 h, the medium was replaced with 10% fetal calf serum RPMI1640. Approximately 36 h after the beginning of the transfection, cells were lysed and Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, WI, USA).

Following Rh123 accumulation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold Hanks' Balanced Salt (HBSS) (without phenol red), placed in HBSS with 10% fetal bovine serum on ice. The green fluorescence of Rh123 was measured by flow cytometry. For determination of Rh123 efflux, cells were loaded for 120 min with Rh123 in the absence of SB202190, and then the medium was replaced with Rh123-free medium containing SB202190, or the vehicle.

To test whether SGC7901/VCR is more resistant to other chemotherapeutic agents than SGC7901, we treated these two kinds of cells with different concentrations of cisplatin, 5-FU and epirubicin. MTT assay results and IC<sub>50 </sub>values showed that SGC7901/VCR cells were more resistant to these chemotherapeutic agents.

Meanwhile, vincristine and epirubicin are known as P-glycoprotein substrate and cells resistant to these two drugs often overexpress P-glycoprotein. Therefore, we used Western-blot and RT-PCR analyses to investigate <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression in SGC7901 and SGC7901/VCR cells.

MDR is one of the main obstacles to successful cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Many different mechanisms have been suggested to explain the development of a MDR phenotype in cancer cells, one of the extensively studied form of these mechanisms is overexpression of several energy dependent drug efflux pumps that belong to the ATP-binding cassette family of transporters, such as the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and the MDR-associated proteins (MRPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. P-gp is a product of the <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene. Overexpression of <italic>MDR1 </italic>has often been reported in primary gastric adenocarcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, there are some reports showing that P-gp-associated MDR cells develop other mechanisms to acquire chemoresistance to P-gp-unrelated drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In this study, we found that constitutive overexpression of the <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene in drug-resistant human gastric cancer SGC7901/VCR cells is dependent on phosphorylation of p38 and the activity of AP-1. Inhibition of p38-MAPK could restore the sensitivity of these cells to P-gp-related drug and P-gp-unrelated drugs.</p><p>Cultured tumor cells, when selected for resistance to an anti-neoplastic agent, often acquire cross-resistance to others. In this study, we showed that vincristine-rsistant SGC7901/VCR is a multidrug-resistant cancer cell line, which was resistant to P-gp-related drug (eprubicin) and P-gp-unrelated drugs (5-FU and cisplatin). Vincristine and epirubicin are known substrates of P-glycoprotein, and it is now increasingly evident that P-gp-associated MDR cells were conferred a cross-resistance to P-gp-unrelated drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We then examined and compared the levels of <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression in SGC7901/VCR and SGC7901 cells, and showed SGC7901/VCR cells have increased expression levels of P-gp protein and MDR1 mRNA than SGC7901. But cisplatin or 5-FU treatment could not induce MDR1 gene expression in SGC7901 cells. Taken together, these results suggested SGC7901/VCR cells may develop P-gp-related or unrelated mechanism to acquire chemoresistance. Thus, P-gp-associated MDR cell line-SGC7901/VCR has ability to crossresist against P-gp-related drug (eprubicin) and P-gp-unrelated drugs (5-FU and cisplatin). Our results was in agreement with previous findings that the P-gp-prominent MDR cell was cross-resistant to 5-FU and cisplatin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>It has previously been reported that the human <italic>MDR1 </italic>promoter contains an AP-1-binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and increased AP-1 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] has been observed in several multidrug-resistant cell lines whereas reduced AP-1 binding has been associated with increased drug sensitivity in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In this study, we observed increased AP-1 activity in SGC7901/VCR cells compared with the drug-sensitive parental SGC7901 cells. This result indicates that increased activity of AP-1 is correlated with increased drug resistance in SGC7901/VCR cells.</p><p>Recently, increasing evidence indicates that anticancer drugs activate many signal pathways, some of which are connected to the development of drug resistance of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The MAP kinase pathway is an important signal-transduction pathway activated by many different stimuli. Previous reports have shown that modulators of the MAP kinase pathway can affect drug transport activity of P-gp in certain multidrug-resistant cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. We investigated the role of the MAP kinase signal pathway in drug-resistant and drug-sensitive cell lines. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, phosphorylation of p38 was increased in SGC7901/VCR cells, but there were no differences in phosphorylation of JNKs and ERKs between drug-resistant and drug-sensitive cell lines. Meanwhile, AP-1 activity was significant attenuated by SB202190 or after cotransfection with the DN-p38 plasmid. We also observed that inhibition of p38 by SB202190 markedly decreased levels of P-gp, MDR1 mRNA and function of P-gp. Moreover, the function of P-gp can also be repressed by SB202190 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) in SGC7901/VCR cells. Furthermore, incubation with cisplatin for 24 h can also induce p38 phosphorylation in SGC7901 cells; this result is supported by previous report that p38 MAPK was preferentially activated by cisplatin in several cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Thus, these results suggest that the p38-MAPK/AP-1 signal pathway is involved in regulation of the <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene in SGC7901/VCR cells, and may contribute to chemoresistantce. Our results were in line with previous report that the specific p38-MAPK inhibitor SB203580 blocked both c-fos and c-jun expression in response to UV irradiation and anisomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Although p38-MAPK does not phosphorylate or activate c-Jun, several lines of evidence however, support the idea that p38 can contribute to AP-1 activity. p38 can contribute to c-jun gene induction mediated by the AP-1 binding site in the c-jun promoter. In addition to the AP-1 site, the c-jun gene can be regulated by MEF2 family of transcription factors (consisting of MEF2 A-D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The MEF2 site is critical for induction of the c-jun promoter by LPS in macrophages, and that this induction requires functional p38 and transcription factor MEF2C. Furthermore, MEF2C was shown to be directly phosphorylated and activated by p38 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Thus, p38 can potentially regulate c-Jun transcriptional activity by regulating transcription factors that bind to the AP-1 site as well as the MEF2 site.</p><p>It has been previously reported in other cell lines that p38-MAPK does not affect P-gp and MDR1 mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrated that inhibition of p38-MAPK by SB202190 significantly attenuated the activity of AP-1 and <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression. As AP-1 is the important transcription factor for <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression, we suggest that SB202190 inhibited <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression by reducing the activity of transcription factor AP-1. Thus, the effect of p38-MAPK on <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression is cell type dependent.</p><p>Previous reports have showed that increased expression of <italic>c</italic>-<italic>Jun </italic>contributed to cisplatin resistance, and 5-FU can induce <italic>c-Jun </italic>phosphorylation and activate AP-1-specific transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Meanwhile, we have demonstrated that the activity of Ap-1 was upregulated in SGC7901/VCR cells and inhibition of p38-MAPK by SB202190 can reduce the activity of AP-1 and inhibit <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression. Therefore, we investigated the effect of SB202190 on the multidrug-resistant phenotype of drug-resistant SGC7901/VCR cells. As shown in Fig. 6, SB202190 significantly increased the sensitivity of drug-resistant SGC7901/VCR cells to chemotherapeutic agents, which indicates that SB202190 may reverse the multidrug-resistant phenotype in SGC7901/VCR cells. Our results were consistent with previous reports that pharmaceutical inhibition of p38 by SB203580 reversed the multidrug resistance of L1210/VCR cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. It has also been reported that the p38 MAPK pathways play an important role in cellular resistance against photodynamic therapy with hypericin in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Therefore, it could be suggested from our results that drug resistance in SGC7901/VCR cells is attributed at least in part to the activation of p38-MAPK/AP-1 signal pathway, and downregulation of this pathway appears to confer on MDR cells sensitivity to P-gp-unrelated drugs as well as P-gp-related drug. Several reports have showed that specific inhibitors of signal pathway can reverse P-gp-mediated multidrug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Thus, interrupting signal-transduction pathways that mediate the expression of multidrug transporters might be an effective approach to prevent multidrug resistance and increase sensitivity to chemotherapy in human cancers. Taken together, our data indicate that the p38-MAPK signal pathway affects <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression, and provide a possible new mechanism for cross-resistance in drug-resistant human gastric cancer cells. These results further our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved in <italic>MDR1 </italic>gene expression and may provide new strategies for reversal of multidrug resistance in human gastric cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Activation of the p38-MAPK pathway might be responsible for the modulation of P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance in the SGC7901/VCR cell line.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinases; MDR: multidrug resistance; AP-1: activator protein-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>XLG and NNM carried out the molecular genetic studies, participated in the sequence alignment and drafted the manuscript.
