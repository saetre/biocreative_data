Ligands of CCR5, in contrast to a ligand of CXCR4, induced a clear increase in FRET efficiency, indicating that selective ligands promote and stabilize a distinct conformation of the heterodimers. We also found that mutations at C-terminus of CCR5 reduced its ability to form heterodimers with CXCR4.

Chemokines regulate leukocyte function by binding to specific chemokine receptors expressed on their surface, typically leading to the activation of receptor-associated Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) and the heterotrimeric G-protein G&#x003b1;iG&#x003b2;&#x003b3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Soriano1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Jiao1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. One basic question is how different chemokine receptors receive and transduce signals from the surface of a cell on which multiple GPCRs are expressed. Initially, GPCRs were believed to signal as simple monomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Strange1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Gurevich1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, mounting evidence now indicates that many GPCRs, including several chemokine receptors, function as dimers or higher-order oligomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Strange1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Gurevich1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>CXCR4 and CCR5 receptors regulate leukocyte chemotaxis in inflammation and also serve in conjunction with CD4 as co-receptors for HIV entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Murphy1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Moser1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. CXCR4 normally functions as the receptor for the chemokine CXCL12/SDF-1, whereas CCR5 mediates responses to several chemokines, including CCL3/MIP1-&#x003b1;, CCL4/MIP1-&#x003b2; and CCL5/RANTES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Murphy2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. CXCR4 and CCR5 are co-expressed in several leukocyte populations including lymphocyte and monocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Moser1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Lazzarino1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to their roles in regulating leukocyte chemotaxis, CXCR4 and CCR5 serve as the entry co-receptors for T-tropic or M-tropic strains of HIV virus, respectively. Upon the binding of envelope protein gp120, CD4 receptor physically associates with either CXCR4 or CCR5 receptors to initiate the formation of the HIV entry complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Berger1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Murphy3">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. CXCR4 or CCR5 can also form heterodimers with other GPCR receptors for initiation or alteration of signaling by these involved receptors. For example, CXCR4 and the &#x003b4;-opioid receptor (DOR), both of which are expressed on the surface of monocytes and other immune cells, form heterodimers the presence of ligands for each receptor. The formation of the CXCR4:DOR heterodimer prevents each of them from signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Pello1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. CCR5 and CCR2 can form heterodimers on the surface of the cells when they are stimulated with both CCL5 and CCL2 (ligands of CCR5 and CCR2, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Mellado1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The CCR5:CCR2 heterodimers activate heterotrimeric G-protein Gq/11, instead of Gi, which is activated by CCR5 or CCR2 alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Mellado1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. It appears that heterodimerization in response to chemokine binding is required for the termination or alteration of signaling by an increasing number of chemokine receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Hereld1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>CXCR4 and CCR5 are expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes and, during T cell activation, are both recruited to the immunological synapse (IS). This recruitment requires chemokine secretion by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Molon1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it has been proposed that APC-derived chemokines promote formation of CXCR4:CCR5 heterodimers, resulting in accumulation of these receptors at the IS. Despite the important roles of CXCR4 and CCR5 in chemotaxis, HIV entry, and T cell activation, it is still not clear whether CXCR4 and CCR5 form heterodimers on the surface of live cells.</p><p>In this report, we investigated the formation of heterodimers between CXCR4 and CCR5 on the surface of live cells using FRET imaging coupled with quantitative microscopic analyses. CXCR4 was tagged with CFP (FRET donor), and CCR5 and two CCR5 mutants with altered C-termini, CCR5<sup>STA</sup> and CCR5<sup>&#x00394;4</sup>, were fused with YFP (FRET acceptor). We observed that CXCR4CFP, CCR5YFP, CCR5<sup>STA</sup>YFP and CCR5<sup>&#x00394;4</sup>YFP could be expressed on the surface of live cells. When co-expressed, CXCR4CFP and CCR5YFP displayed a high level of FRET signal, indicating that CXCR4 and CCR5 formed heterodimers. In contrast, CXCR4CFP and CCR5<sup>STA</sup>YFP showed a low level of FRET signal and CXCR4CFP and CCR5<sup>&#x00394;4</sup>YFP showed little FRET signal, suggesting that mutations in the C-terminus of CCR5 caused a decrease in CCR5's ability to form dimers with CXCR4. Furthermore, CCR5 chemokines, CCL3/MIP1&#x003b1; or CCL5/RANTES, induced a clear increase, while CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12/SDF-1, triggered a decrease in FRET between CXCR4CFP and CCR5YFP, suggesting that the binding of these chemokines differentially modulates the stability or conformation of CXCR4:CCR5 heterodimers in the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>pEYFP-N1 and pECFP-N1 were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA).

Because we were interested in CXCR4 and CCR5 interactions at the cell surface, only the plasma membrane region of the cell was selected as the ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003424-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). FRET efficiency is usually sensitive to the relative amounts of donors and acceptors in the selected regions. However, we took the following steps to minimize the possibility that our measurements were strongly influenced by high levels of the receptor expression. First, all the FRET images were recorded using identical parameters, including excitation laser intensity, detector gains and magnification. Therefore, the levels of CXCR4CFP and CCR5YFP, CCR5<sup>STA</sup>YFP or CCR5<sup>&#x00394;4</sup>YFP were clearly monitored pixel-by-pixel by CFP and YFP intensities. Second, in our analyses, we selected regions having mean CFP and YFP intensities between 600 and 2800 to ensure the proper receptor levels. Finally, FRET values were normalized pixel-by-pixel by dividing by the square root of the donor and acceptor concentrations to yield N-FRET values. We have previously shown that such N-FRET values are relatively independent of the CFP or YFP concentrations and, therefore, likely reflect receptor interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Yi1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Kramer1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We used tagged receptors for IL17 and TNF (IL17RA-YFP and TNFR-CFP), which both localize to the cell membrane and do not associate as a receptor complex, as negative controls for determining the baseline for FRET efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Siegel1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Kramer1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

In clear contrast, cells that expressed membrane-localized CXCR4CFP and CCR5<sup>&#x00394;4</sup>YFP showed very low FRET intensity, while cells expressing CXCR4CFP and CCR5<sup>STA</sup>YFP displayed moderate FRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003424-g004">Figure 4B and 4D</xref>). Quantitative analyses of FRET efficiency indicated that normalized FRET (N-FRET) between CXCR4CFP:CCR5YFP (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;198) was significantly greater than in the case of CXCR4CFP:CCR5<sup>&#x00394;4</sup>YFP (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;148, p&#x0003c;0.01) or the negative control (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;58, p&#x0003c;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003424-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, the intermediate N-FRET value obtained for CXCR4CFP:CCR5<sup>STA</sup>YFP (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;156) was significantly lower than that of CXCR4CFP:CCR5YFP (p&#x0003c;0.01) but still higher than those of CXCR4CFP:CCR5<sup>&#x00394;4</sup>YFP (p&#x0003c;0.01) and the negative control (p&#x0003c;0.01). On the other hand, N-FRET of CXCR4CFP:CCR5<sup>&#x00394;4</sup>YFP did not significantly differ from that of the control (p&#x0003e;0.01). Together, these data suggest that CCR5 dimerizes with CXCR4 on the plasma membrane in the absence of ligands and, moreover, that the C-terminal tail mutations of CCR5<sup>STA</sup> or CCR5<sup>&#x00394;4</sup> reduce or abolish the receptor's ability to form pre-existing dimers with CXCR4.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Ligand binding to CCR5 or CXCR4 differentially affects heterodimers</title><p>To examine the effects of CCR5 and CXCR4 ligands on the pre-existing dimers, we measured the FRET efficiency between CXCR4CFP and CCR5YFP upon stimulation with CCL3/MIP1&#x003b1; and CCL5/RANTES (ligands of CCR5) and CXCL12/SDF-1 (a ligand of CXCR4). Relative to the unstimulated control, both of the CCR5 ligands induced N-FRET increases between CXCR4CFP and CCR5YFP of roughly 30&#x00025; (p&#x0003c;0.01 for both), while CXCL12/SDF-1 (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;119) triggered a slight decrease in the N-FRET signal (p&#x0003c;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003424-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>) These results suggest that ligands binding to each receptor comprising the heterodimer distinctly alter its conformation.

However, their dimerization properties have not been clearly defined. In this study using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging, we provide the first evidence that CXCR4 and CCR5 form heterodimers on the plasma membrane in the absence of chemokines and that their chemokine ligands induced different conformational changes that either promote or destabilize the formation of heterodimers.</p><p>Our results indicate that CXCR4 and CCR5 heterodimers exist on the surface of cells in the absense of ligand stimulation and that point mutations within or deletion of the C-terminus of CCR5 reduce the ability of the receptor to form heterodimers with CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003424-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

We also found that the deletion mutant CCR5<sup>&#x00394;4</sup> was aberrantly expressed in the cytosol in a majority of transfected cells, but surface expression of CCR5<sup>&#x00394;4</sup> was detected in a small number of cells. Using live single cell imaging, we were able to use these mutants to analyze functions of the C-terminus in chemokine-induced Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> responses and heterodimer formation. Our data suggested that the C-terminal tail of CCR5 may be involved in the formation of CXCR4 and CCR5 heterodimers.</p><p>Our data revealed that ligand binding to CCR5 or CXCR4 could either promote or destabilize the formation of heterodimers. Previous studies indicated that ligand binding could promote the formation of homo- or heterodimers. For example, the CXCR4 and &#x003b4;-opioid receptor (DOR) form both homo- and heterodimers and extracellular ligands could alter the complexes of these dimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Pello1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. DPDPE, a ligand of DOR, induces DOR homodimers; CXCL12/SDF-1, a ligand of CXCR4, triggers the formation of CXCR4 homodimers; and DPDPE and SDF-1 together promote assembly of heterodimeric CXCR4:DOR complexes. It has been proposed that the formation of homo- or heterodimers on the cell membrane, where various receptors co-exist, is a dynamic process, and various ligands bind to their respective receptors and alter the complexes of receptors. Our study indicated a new level of complexity regarding to the effect of ligand binding on the formation of receptor heterodimers. While binding of CCL3/MIP1&#x003b1; and CCL5/RANTES to CCR5 promoted the formation of CCR5:CXCR4 heterodimers, CXCL12/SDF-1 binding to CXCR4 reduced the level of preexisting CCR5:CXCR4 heterodimers. Mutations in the C-terminal tail of CCR5 not only reduced or abolished its ability to form heterodimers with CXCR4 but also altered effects of ligand binding on the formation of heterodimers with CXCR4. CCL3/MIP1&#x003b1; binding to CCR5<sup>STA</sup> mutant receptor reduced its ability to form heterodimer with CXCR4, while the binding of CCL5/RANTES to CCR5 or CXCL12/SDF-1 to CXCR4 had no apparent effect. Furthermore, CCL3/MIP1&#x003b1; and CXCL12/SDF-1 binding to either CCR5<sup>&#x00394;4</sup> mutant or CXCR4 promoted formation of heterodimers. Our results suggest that ligand binding to a chemokine receptor causes a conformational change in the receptor that can either promote or destabilize the formation of receptor dimers. Mutations of the C-terminal domain of a receptor affect ligand-induced conformational changes, thereby altering its potential to form dimers.</p><p>Our results have clear implication for the in vivo physiology of chemokine and their receptors. It has been suggested that chemokines secreted by antigen-presenting cells recruit both CXCR4 and CCR5 to the immunological synapse (IS) during T cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003424-Molon1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data suggest that this accumulation of both CXCR4 and CCR5 could be mediated by chemokine-promoted formation of CXCR4:CCR5 heterodimers. Our results also provide information on the functions of the C-terminal tail of chemokine receptors in dimerization and thus define additional targets for potential drugs in chemokine-related diseases. It should be noted that our study was performed using HEK293 cells expressing CFP- or YFP-tagged receptors.
