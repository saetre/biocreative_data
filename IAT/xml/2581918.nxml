We also found that spontaneous polarization was achieved in starved cells by asymmetric localization of PTEN and F-actin. This breaking of the symmetry of protein localization maintained the leading edge and considerably enhanced the persistence of directed migration, and overall random exploration was ensured by switching among the different ordered patterns.

Motile bacteria and most eukaryotic cells can move in a directed (directed cell migration) or spontaneous (spontaneous cell migration) fashion depending on the presence or absence of external cues.</p><p>Directed cell migration toward a soluble ligand or chemotaxis is a general property of many motile eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003734-VanHaastert1">[7]</xref>. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells extend one or more pseudopodia at a time, with the extended pseudopodia being close to the chemoattractant source. The sensing of chemotactic cues is achieved by the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors and the cytosolic regulator of adenylyl cyclase (CRAC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003734-Parent1">[8]</xref>. To polarize and migrate up the chemotactic gradient after sensing chemical cues, cells restrict filamentous actin (F-actin) polymerization and form a leading edge. This task requires the cells to amplify a shallow external chemical gradient into a steep intracellular response. A recent study has revealed that, during chemotaxis in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is localized at the leading edge of the cells and new pseudopodia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003734-Funamoto1">[9]</xref>. A counteracting phosphatase of PI3K, the phosphatase and tensin homolog, (PTEN), is simultaneously localized at the rear edge of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003734-Iijima1">[10]</xref>. This reciprocal localization of the two proteins creates a spatial internal gradient of phosphatidyl inositol tri-phosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>) across the plasma membrane; the level of PIP<sub>3</sub> is higher at the leading edge than at the rear edge due to the kinase activity of PI3K.</p><p>On the other hand, motile cells are able to migrate spontaneously even in the absence of external stimuli. In the absence of external cAMP, individual <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells spontaneously form actin filaments and extend 1 or 2 pseudopodia. The new pseudopodia are retracted or attached to the substrate. After the attachment of the pseudopodia to the substrate, the cell adopts a polarized morphology for a few minutes and then retracts its rear edge and moves forward. Spontaneous cell migration allows the cells to forage and explore their surroundings by balancing random and directed migrations. It is thought that <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells extend pseudopodia in a more or less random manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003734-VanHaastert1">[7]</xref>. Recently, <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells were observed to undergo spontaneous migration through stochastic activation of both PI3K and Ras at the sites of new pseudopod formation even in the absence of either chemoattractants or functional heterotrimeric G-proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003734-Sasaki1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003734-Sasaki2">[12]</xref>. However, the fundamental question of how a cell demonstrates spontaneous migration by randomly remodeling its shape through underlying molecular interactions of PI3K/PTEN/F-actin remains unanswered. Here, in order to reveal the mechanism of spontaneous cell migration, we employed a quantitative approach based on the statistical analysis of the cell shape of single <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells. To gain a further understanding of spontaneous cell migration, we observed two different developmental states of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells, namely the vegetative and starved states. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells exhibit vegetative and starved states at different developmental stages, but they are able to move spontaneously in both of states. Vegetative cells are more round in shape and move more slowly than starved cells; comparing these two cell states enables us to identify common mechanisms underlying cell migration.</p><p>We analyzed the stochastic dynamics of cell shape and their coordination with cell movement by using correlation analyses such as autocorrelation functions. Correlation analysis is a useful method for identifying repeating signal patterns that are masked by noise. We observed that despite apparently random pseudopodia formation, the remodeling of the cell shape was organized into three distinct ordered patterns: elongation, rotation, and oscillation. The ordered remodeling of cell shape was correlated with PI3K-dependent F-actin polymerization. PI3K activity was required for the formation of actin-filled pseudopodia while PTEN restricted the formation of excess pseudopodia; this supports the idea that the ordered patterns are mediated by PI3K/PTEN/F-actin. Furthermore, we observed that F-actin and PTEN spontaneously localize at the leading and rear edge of the cell, respectively. The asymmetric localization of both proteins would ensure the reinforcement of the leading edge, which would facilitate the maintenance of a biased direction of cell migration. Eventually, the cells would be able explore their surroundings by switching among the ordered patterns. Our results suggest that the ordered patterns of cell shape mediated by PI3K/PTEN/F-actin result in spontaneous cell migration even in the absence of chemotactic cues.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ordered remodeling of cell shape in spontaneously migrating cells</title><p>We observed single <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells in the absence of chemoattractants or nutrients at a low cell density.

WT STA cell 1 maintained a larger <italic>Amp</italic>(<italic>&#x003b8;,t</italic>) at both 80&#x000b0; and 260&#x000b0; angles, meaning that the cell stably maintained its elongated morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003734-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, it is often difficult to recognize patterns in <italic>Amp</italic>(<italic>&#x003b8;,t</italic>) because of the intrinsic noise of cell deformations.

Remarkably, we found ordered patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003734-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, lower row). WT STA cell 1 exhibited a stable positive correlation along the lines &#x00394;<italic>&#x003b8;</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0&#x000b0; and &#x00394;<italic>&#x003b8;</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x000b1;180&#x000b0;, indicating that this cell maintains an elongated shape (elongation pattern). In WT STA cell 2, the correlation was laterally propagating, indicating the lateral propagation of pseudopodia (rotation pattern). WT STA cell 3 exhibited an oscillatory periodic profile with slight rotation; it reshaped its membrane periodically by extending pseudopodia in a certain direction and then re-extending at certain angles to the long axis of the cell in cycles of 2.5 min (oscillation pattern). Moreover, WT STA cell 1 exhibited more noisy <italic>Amp</italic>(<italic>&#x003b8;,t</italic>) at the leading edge (<italic>Amp</italic>(260,<italic>t</italic>)) rather than at the rear edge (<italic>Amp</italic>(80,<italic>t</italic>)), indicating that lamellipodia are formed predominantly at the leading edge. The branches propagating from the leading edge to the rear imply that some of the lamellipodia adhere to the substrate and become fixed while the whole cell body moves forward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003734-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, arrowheads). We also note that cells exhibiting a rotation or an oscillation pattern show variability of from 2.5 min to 3.5 min in the period of rotation and oscillation. We identified ordered patterns in nearly 70% of WT STA cells, and transient patterns that were intermediate between the two ordered patterns in the remaining cells (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;53). There was no significant difference in the average area of cells exhibiting the different patterns (p&#x0003e;0.05, ANOVA).

WT VEG cells were less motile than WT STA cells, and their shapes are less polarized (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003734-t001">Table 1</xref>). To our surprise, despite the significant decrease in migration speed and in the roundness of the cells, WT VEG cells also exhibited ordered patterns similar to those of the WT STA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003734-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>); WT VEG cells 1, 2, and 3 were deformed by elongation, rotation, and oscillation, respectively. When a cell extends pseudopodia in a certain direction and then re-extends new pseudopodia perpendicular to the long axis of the cell, an oscillation pattern occurs. 70% of the WT VEG cells exhibited the ordered patterns, and the remaining cells exhibited transient patterns that were intermediate between the two ordered patterns (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;53). The area of a cell does not appear to determine the type of pattern since the average areas for WT VEG cells of each of the three pattern types were not significantly different (p&#x0003e;0.05, ANOVA). These three commonly observed patterns indicate that the morphological dynamics of WT VEG cells are also organized into ordered patterns without the need for external stimuli. The rates of occurrence of each pattern were roughly the same between vegetative and starved cells although the oscillation pattern was less frequently observed than the than other two patterns. A previous study by Killich et al. has identified rotation and oscillation patterns in WT STA cells using a different type of analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003734-Killich1">[2]</xref>. These patterns clearly corresponded to the rotation and oscillation patterns that we observed. Moreover, our comprehensive analysis revealed that WT STA cells also show an elongation pattern and that three types of ordered pattern are commonly observed in vegetative states. Our results not only validate the previous observation but also fully characterize the dynamics of cell shape in both STA and VEG states.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0003734-t001"

The power spectrum of <italic>Amp</italic>(<italic>&#x003b8;,t</italic>) provides additional information than the CCF on the mechanism underlying the development of ordered patterns because it is a measure of the amplitude of pseudopodia at scales of different length. We found that the spectrum of PI3K-inhibited cells had lower amplitude, suggesting that PI3K-inhibited cells rarely grow large pseudopodia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003734.s004">Fig. S3</xref>). Moreover, a small spectrum amplitude is a commonly observed property in both the VEG and STA states. These results are consistent with the strong correlation of the CCF in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003734-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). In addition, the amplitude of the spectrum of <italic>pten</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells was comparable to that of the WT cells, suggesting that PTEN disruption did not affect the amplitude of pseudopodia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003734.s003">Figs.

Furthermore, treatment of <italic>pten</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells with LY294002 also resulted in a spectrum of smaller amplitude. These results support our conclusion in the preceding section: the initiation of an ordered remodeling of cell shape from random morphological dynamics is mediated by both the PI3K-dependent actin polymerization and the suppression of excess pseudopodia by PTEN.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Coordination between ordered remodeling of cell shape and cell movement</title><p>Finally, we addressed a central problem of cell migration, the relationship between morphological dynamics and cell migration. We defined the persistence length of centroid motion as a characteristic length of persistence of directional migration (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).. The persistence of directional migration of WT STA cells gradually decays as a function of distance, while that of both <italic>pten</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> STA and <italic>pi3k</italic>1/2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> STA cells, and also of WT VEG cells, rapidly reaches to 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003734-g006">Figs. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003734.s005">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003734.s001">Text S1</xref>); The averaged persistence length of WT STA cells (16.4 &#x000b5;m) was 27 times greater than those of both <italic>pten</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> STA and <italic>pi3k</italic>1/2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> STA cells, and also that of WT VEG cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003734-t001">Table 1</xref>). The difference of persistence length is not explained solely by the difference of velocity because WT STA cells move four times faster than WT VEG cells. In order to reveal the mechanism by which WT STA cells create persistent motion in the absence of external signals, we investigated the coordination between cell shape and cell movement. We calculated the probability distribution of the deviation of <italic>Amp</italic>(<italic>&#x003b8;,t</italic>) in the direction of migration, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0003734.e002.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). This distribution tells us whether a cell tends to extend (or retract) its membrane in the direction of migration. The probability distribution of WT STA cells was largely biased towards the positive side (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0003734.e003.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>), whereas that of both <italic>pten</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> STA and <italic>pi3k</italic>1/2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> STA cells, and also of WT VEG cells, was only slightly shifted toward the positive side with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0003734.e004.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003734-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). The bias of WT STA cells was approximately 6 times larger than that of the other cell. The difference in distribution profiles confirms that WT STA cells directly migrate in the direction of protrusions without the necessity of external cues, while PTEN disruption or PI3K1/2 deletions diminished such coordination between cell polarity and cell migration. Furthermore, we observed the spatial localization of PTEN-GFP and ABD-GFP and found that PTEN and F-actin were spontaneously localized at the rear and the leading edges asymmetrically in WT STA cells, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003734-Sasaki2">[12]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003734-g006">Figs. 6C and 6D</xref>). We did not observe the asymmetric localization of PTEN-GFP at the membrane in WT VEG cells. In addition, the localizations of these molecules were abolished by inhibition of actin polymerization either by latrunculinA or by LY294002 (data not shown), indicating that actin polymerization is required for establishing asymmetric localization of PTEN. Our observations imply that the breaking of spontaneous symmetry accompanied by localization of PTEN reinforces the cell polarity and that the marked change in persistence length between the VEG and STA states is controlled through the persistent asymmetric localization of F-actin mediated by the PI3K pathway. Furthermore, we evaluated the correlation between the membrane extensions (or retractions) along the direction of cell movement, <italic>Amp</italic>(<italic>&#x003b8;,t</italic>) at time <italic>t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;t+&#x00394;t</italic> and the centroid displacements <italic>V</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) at time <italic>t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;t</italic> by using the identical angle cross-correlation function (iaCF) as follows (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>); the iaCF is useful for evaluating the coordination between cell deformation and cell movement for individual cells. When we obtain the maximum value of the iaCF at <italic>&#x00394;t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x003c4;</italic>, this cell tends to protrude its own membrane toward the direction of cell movement with a time delay of <italic>&#x003c4;</italic>.

The dependency of the persistence on the type of ordered patterns suggests that key proteins related to the pattern regulate the location of F-actin accumulation and then steer cell movement. Moreover, we examined this pattern-oriented migration again by comparing iaCFs between the elongation pattern and rotation/oscillation pattern. The iaCF of the elongation pattern showed a long-lasting positive correlation within &#x02212;300 sec&#x0003c;&#x00394;<italic>t</italic>&#x0003c;300 sec, while the iaCF of the rotation/oscillation pattern rapidly decayed and eventually reached to 0 near &#x00394;<italic>t</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x000b1;100 sec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003734-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). This result means that the elongating cells maintain the elongated cell shape in the direction of motion, and rotating or oscillating cells rapidly turn in accord with the deformation of cell shape. Thus, the ordered patterns of cell shape are coordinated with cell movement even in the absence of external stimuli. The coordination was observed solely in WT STA cells, and, as a separate observation, the asymmetric localization of PTEN occurred in WT STA cells. This suggests that spontaneous cell polarization assisted with the reciprocal localization of PI3K and PTEN, which in turn was responsible for the strong correlation between the patterns and cell migration.</p><fig id="pone-0003734-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003734.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Orientational correlation of ordered patterns and cell movement in polarized cells.</title><p>(A) Persistence of directional movement as a function of distance in WT STA cells.

In addition, the oscillation pattern of cell shape showed the period of 2.5 to 3.5 min that was approximately equivalent to that of OSC (2 to 3 min). According to these comparisons, we suppose that the characteristic motions of CIRC and OSC were attributed to the coordination of cell movement with the rotation and oscillation patterns of cell shape, respectively.</p><p>We mention that OSC showed the various durations from minutes to an hour though the oscillation pattern of cell shape was maintained for 10 to 20 min but not an hour. We consider that this is because the number of our measurements was not enough to find the oscillation pattern of an hour.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Mechanism of spontaneous cell migration: coordination with ordered patterns of cell shape</title><p>Although the mechanism by which PTEN and PI3K create the ordered patterns of cell shape is still unclear, the observed patterns have enabled us to propose a model of spontaneous cell migration, i.e., the coordination of migration with the formation of ordered patterns of cell shape. This coordination is strengthened especially in WT STA cells due to spontaneous cell polarization mediated by asymmetric PTEN localization. PTEN is asymmetrically localized in WT STA cells, while PTEN is uniformly distributed at the cell membrane in WT VEG cells. The asymmetric localization of PTEN is not necessary for creating ordered patterns but is required for persistently enforcing the direction of movement along with the orientation of cell shape.</p><p>Elongating WT STA cells displayed the long-lasting correlation in iaCF, while rotating or oscillating ones showed the rapid decrease of correlation in iaCF. This result suggests that each local pseudopodia extension mediated by PI3K dependent F-actin polymerization enables a cell not only to move forward but also to turn to the left or right. Spontaneous cell migration in polarized cells thereby results from mutual coordinating behavior between ordered patterns and cell movement. We further asked a question regarding the temporal hierarchy between the ordered pattern and cell movement: Does a cell elongate in the direction of cell movement or move in the direction of protrusions? Or do these two processes coordinate instantly? In order to infer this temporal hierarchy, we examined the point at which iaCF shows the maximum value. Given that a cell elongates in the direction of motion with a time delay of &#x003c4; after cell movement, iaCF exhibits the maximum of correlation at &#x00394;<italic>t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x003c4;</italic>.

This observation indicates that the coordination between cell shape and cell movement occurs instantly.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Relationship between the ordered patterns and chemotactic behavior</title><p>Our results show that ordered patterns of cell shape are mediated by PI3K and PTEN. PI3K and PTEN are also essential for cell polarity during chemotaxis. The responsibility of the two proteins raises a question as to what relations exist between the ordered patterns and cell polarity in chemotaxis. During chemotaxis, directional sensing by CRAC occurs through the activations of G-protein coupled receptors, and then the localizations of PI3K and PTEN are induced by extracellular chemotactic stimuli. Guidance signals are subject to amplification and feedback regulation of cell polarity, probably to permit the detection of small differences in a shallow gradient. In the case of spontaneous cell migration, Sasaki et al. have found that PI3K and Ras are autonomously activated in the absence of chemoattractants at the sites where F-actin projections emerge, which suggests that spontaneous cell polarity would result from the stochastic activation of the guidance pathway G-protein-independent guidance pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003734-Sasaki2">[12]</xref>.</p><p>We observed that PTEN was localized spontaneously at the rear edge in WT STA cells, and PI3K-dependent F-actin polymerization occurred at both the leading edge and at the rear edge. The elongation pattern indicated that the cells amplify shallow gradients of spontaneously produced PIP<sub>3</sub> and maintain cell polarity through PI3K and PTEN. Moreover, the switching of ordered patterns suggests that cells stochastically choose one of the three ordered patterns and change it to another pattern in order to ensure overall random exploration during spontaneous cell migration. In contrast, chemotactic cells dominantly select the elongation pattern due to signals from G-proteins and then move toward the source of the chemoattractant by coordinating cell movement with the selected elongation pattern. Hence, cell polarity in chemotaxis could be considered as the property that cells dominantly choose an elongation pattern.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that mutants lacking PI3K and/or PTEN do not sustain a polarized cell shape but can exhibit precise chemotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003734-Andrew1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003734-Hoeller1">[15]</xref>. Although cell polarity that is sustained by PI3K and PTEN in chemotaxis could be related to the elongation pattern of cell shape, neither the cell polarity nor the elongation pattern may be necessary for chemotaxis.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Biological function of the transition of ordered patterns of cell shape</title><p>We observed that the ordered patterns of cell shape stochastically transit from one pattern to another. This stochastic transition could add randomness to the motion of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. In terms of the advantage of randomness, we note similarities between the stochastic change of flagella rotations of bacteria and the stochastic transition of ordered patterns of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells. Motile bacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E.coli</italic>) have flagella that are rotating structures driven by the proton motive force. Although <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and <italic>E coli</italic> do not use identical locomotory apparatus, both forage with the aid of stochastically switching between two characteristic states, a fairly straight motion and a turning motion. For the fairly straight motion, bacteria rotate flagella in a clock-wise manner, and <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells maintain the elongation pattern of cell shape for at least 10 min. Moreover, for the turning motion, bacteria tumble by counter-clockwise rotation of flagella, and <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells change into the rotation or oscillation pattern that lasts the order of 10&#x02013;20 min. Stochastic switching of these ordered patterns allows cells to do overall random exploration.</p><p>Regarding the efficiency of searching behavior, Li et al. have conducted the numerical simulation of the amoeboid motion in which a cell finely directs the motion with a persistent time of approximately 9 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003734-Li1">[26]</xref>. By comparing to the random walk (defined as the motion whose direction and speed are randomly chosen), they found that the fairly straight motion of 9 min in the amoeboid motion allows cells to cover more area in a given time. This non-random motion results in the 1.6 to 2.4 fold increase of the efficiency greater than random walk. In our study, the coordination of the ordered patterns with cell movement suggests that the ordered patterns of cell shape attribute to the non-random motion in foraging behavior, e.g., the straight motion directed by the elongation pattern could realize the fairly straight motion. Based on the discussion done by Li et al, such a non-random (persistent) motion directed by the ordered pattern could improve the efficiency of searching behavior.</p><p>In this study, we found the ordered patterns of cell shape were mediated by PI3K/PTEN/F-actin, and the coordination of these patterns with cell movement constituted the mechanism of spontaneous cell migration.
