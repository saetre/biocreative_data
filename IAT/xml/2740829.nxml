A beneficial role by OMI, in preserving cell viability, is assumed to occur via the avoidance of dysfunctional protein turnover. However relatively few substrates for mitochondrial Omi are known. Here we report our identification of three novel mitochondrial substrates that impact metabolism and ATP production. Using a dual proteomic approach we have identified three interactors based upon ability to bind to OMI, and/or to persist in the proteome after OMI activity has been selectively inhibited. One candidate, the chaperone HSPA8, was common to each independent study. Two others (PDHB subunit and IDH3A subunit) did not appear to bind to OMI, however persisted in the mito-proteome when OMI was inhibited. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are two key Kreb's cycle enzymes that catalyse oxidative decarboxylation control points in mitochondrial respiration. We verified both PDHB and IDH3A co-immunoprecipitate with HSPA8 and after elution, were degraded by recombinant HtrA2 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Additionally our gene expression studies, using rotenone (an inhibitor of Complex I) showed <italic>Omi</italic> expression was silenced when <italic>pdhb</italic> and <italic>idh3a</italic> were increased when a sub-lethal dose was applied. However higher dose treatment caused increased <italic>Omi</italic> expression and decreased levels of <italic>pdhb</italic> and <italic>idh3a</italic> transcripts. This implicates mitochondrial OMI in a novel mechanism relating to metabolism.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Omi (HtrA2/PARK13) was originally identified as a homologue of a bacterial protease HtrA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Faccio1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In mammalian cells, the nuclear-encoded OMI resides in the inter-membrane space (IMS) of mitochondria as active, mature (32&#x02013;36 kD) and pre-processed 50 kD forms. A second pool of OMI resides on the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Huttunen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

This facilitates release into the cytosol, removing a trans-membrane domain and exposing a domain that binds with the most studied OMI substrate, the anti-apoptotic factor XIAP.

OMI is a homo-trimer, where each monomer consists of a MLS, a small trans-membrane region, the AVPS sequence (for XIAP interaction), the protease domain and the PDZ domain (governing substrate interaction) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Verhagen1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Martins1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Martins2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Zhang2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Mitochondrial dysfunction is coincident with PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Thomas1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and in humans Omi deficiencies have been found in PD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Strauss1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition OMI has been consistently detected in Lewy Bodies (LB) - the intracellular aggregates that represent one of the hallmarks of PD and LB Dementia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Kawamoto1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Two other studies have strongly contested any genetic implication of Omi with PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-SimonSanchez1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Ross1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, nevertheless animals with a lack of this protease show a profound neuropathology. The <italic>mnd</italic>2 mutation, that spontaneously arose as an autosomal recessive disorder was identified as a mis-sense mutation (S276C) in the protease domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Jones1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Jones2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. It manifest as abnormal spinal motor neuron morphology and muscle denervation leading to muscle atrophy and progressive paralysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Jones1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Neurodegeneration of striatal neurons occurred around 3 weeks of age, accompanied by astrogliosis and the activation of microglia with animals rarely living past 40 days p.n. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Jones2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The protease activity of Omi was greatly reduced in the tissues of <italic>mnd</italic>2 mice, albeit restored by a partial deletion in the PDZ domain, indicating substrate binding may have been a root cause. Additional studies using targeted deletions of the mouse Omi gene (<italic>Prss25</italic>) developed a parkinsonian phenotype with loss of striatal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Martins3">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Simultaneous deletion of another predominant IAP-binding protein did not alter the animal or cellular phenotype, indicating it was the protease activity of Omi that was beneficial, rather than the IAP interaction. With respect to its mitochondrial function, recent reports have given some clues. The loss of Omi in the brain was shown to cause an accumulation of unfolded mitochondrial proteins and ROS, which could signal the increased expression of the transcription factor CHOP. CHOP expression is a part of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) and was seen to be increased in PD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Moisoi1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Although most studies place the role of OMI in the maintenance of the mito-proteome and the avoidance of ROS accumulation, there are few known mitochondrial substrates. Extensive studies have been done to discern the cytosolic substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-VandeWalle1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> with the only known mitochondrial substrate HAX-1 (an anti-apoptotic factor) keeping the focus upon OMI as a death effector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Cilenti1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently mitochondrial APP was reported to be a substrate, cleaved by either mature or immature OMI in the mitochondrion, furthering the importance of this protease in neuronal function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Park1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>OMI, as a substrate of other enzymes such as Akt, Rhomboid-7 and Pink-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Yang1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Whitworth1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, has led to proposed regulatory mechanisms for this serine protease. In particular, mutations in the kinase Pink-1/PARK6 are a known cause of familial PD, with aberrant mitochondrial morphology clearly exhibited in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Exner1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Pink-1 has been shown to interact with OMI and phosphorylate several key amino acid residues leading to increased OMI activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-PlunFavreau1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally Parkin/PARK2, another gene with mutations known to cause familial PD, had been shown to rescue Pink-1 mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Exner1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. All of this has led to a multi-factorial mechanism for maintaining mitochondrial integrity, where the role of OMI was downstream of Pink-1 (which in turn was upstream of Parkin), but was independent of Parkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Whitworth1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Tain1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Yun1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. While no consensus has been reached, it appears likely that both Omi and Parkin act via parallel pathways, with respect to Pink-1, in maintaining mitochondrial integrity. The added importance of the ATP-dependent mitochondrial Rhomboid-7 was shown by its ability to co-immunoprecipitate and cleave both PINK1 and OMI into mature forms that are no longer membrane-tethered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Whitworth1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In this way Rhomboid-7 (or its human homologue PARL) could be seen as an activator of both enzymes during times when ATP was not limiting.</p><p>Our main interest was in discerning the mitochondrial substrates of OMI. In this study, we used two approaches (functional and structural) to discover three novel substrates, one of which is the chaperone for the other two, which are subunits of regulatory Kreb's cycle enzymes. We then studied the coincidental expression of these players under lethal and sub-lethal conditions. From our results, we hypothesize a novel mechanism for the role of Omi in the mitochondrion, which may account for its beneficial role and contribution to neurodegenerative processes, and move Omi beyond protein quality control.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Degradomic approach using the mito-proteome and OMI inhibitor ucf-101</title><p>Differential proteomic samples were generated by incubating mitochondria, isolated from HEK293 cells, in the presence or absence of the serine protease inhibitor, ucf-101 for 2H under aerobic conditions.

We enriched for two pools of proteins that were co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged OMI protease mutants. These OMI mutants had either an inactive site, or the same active site mutation accompanied by a mutated PDZ domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007100-g002">figure 2A</xref>). The first mutant OMI would entrap substrates within the trimer's cleft, whereas the second mutant could not due to a mutation in the PDZ domain. This mutation disallowed the conformational change giving substrate access. Any species isolated via this double mutant represented those binding to the OMI trimer either non-specifically, or specifically (but not as a substrate for cleavage). IEF/2D electrophoresis of concentrated mitochondrial proteins and comparison of protein spots detected in the former (OMI S306C/FLAG) but not the latter (OMI S306C.G399S/FLAG) showed several unique species.

MG-132 toxicity resulted in an increase in <italic>omi</italic> gene expression at 12 hours post-treatment. Other time points that differed significantly from the untreated control were at 24 and 48 hours, when <italic>omi</italic> expression was reduced. The overall pattern of <italic>omi</italic> expression during inhibition of cytoplasmic protein turnover by MG-132 was in stark contrast to that seen with 6OHDA treatment. Likewise rotenone treatment showed an early increase in <italic>omi</italic> gene expression above that seen with the untreated control. This fluctuated greatly over the 48 hour time period, returning to control levels by 48 hours, with maxima seen at 12 and 24 hours. Comparison between MG-132 and rotenone treatments showed only two time points with a common <italic>omi</italic> expression response namely, the control-level expression seen at 6H post-treatment, and the coincidental peak in expression at 12 hours. When we compared the peak with <italic>hax</italic>-1 expression at 12 hours, rotenone and MG-132 treatment both gave a large increase in <italic>omi</italic> expression (205&#x00025; and 194&#x00025;), coinciding with a dramatic decline in <italic>hax</italic>-1 expression (47&#x00025; and 9&#x00025;) respectively. By contrast, neither of these changes was seen at 12 hours with 6OHDA treatment, where <italic>hax</italic>-1 expression had already returned to control levels.</p><p>The expression of our novel OMI interactors also altered with the neurotoxin treatment. Quantitative PCR results showed that initially the level of <italic>hspa8</italic> remained at the same level as the untreated control cells, but after 3 hours was increased to a greater magnitude than that seen with <italic>omi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007100-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Omi expression was elevated up to 143&#x00025; by 3 hours, whereas <italic>hspa8</italic> expression did not peak until 12&#x02013;18 hours at which point it was more than 217&#x00025; of the untreated control. Gene expression of both <italic>idh3a</italic> and <italic>pdhb</italic> was diminished.

This result implied that there was some degree of regulation in the expression levels of these subunits of two Kreb's Cycle enzymes, in response to the oxidative stress resulting from the 6OHDA treatment.

The third substrate was a specific chaperone, HSPA8. We also identified the same chaperone via the &#x0201c;entrapment&#x0201d; approach, using FLAG-tagged mitochondrial OMI. This allowed pursuit of the relationship between the four proteins. Previous work by others in different cell types had shown PDH was a binding partner with HSP70. It is worth noting that HSPA8 is a constitutive heat shock protein, with sequence similarity to the stress-inducible HSP70. Both are members of a large family of heat shock proteins. Despite their abundance in the cytosol, and in association with and in mitochondria, we did not identify HSP70 or any other related heat shock family members beyond the homologous sub-regions of the HSPA8 sequence.</p><p>Using isolated mitochondria, we have shown the HSPA8-specific antibody was able to co-immunoprecipitate small amounts of IDH3A and PDH&#x00392;. Our studies employed IEF/2D separation due to the small amounts of protein involved, as well as the weaker epitope-interaction by the HSPA8 antibody. In doing so, we have established a new, potential role for endogenous HSPA8, distinct from its many cytosolic roles, as being that of transporting IDH3A and PDH&#x00392; to the mitochondrion. Additionally, when the immunoprecipitated species was incubated with recombinant HtrA2 there was degradation unless the inhibitor ucf-101 was present. We verified the endogenous HSPA8 results using HA-tagged HSPA8 co-immunoprecipitation studies. All three species (OMI, PDHB and IDH3A) were co-precipitated to varying degrees. We concluded that both subunits can be bound by HSPA8 and all three proteins may be degraded by OMI at or inside the outer membrane of the mitochondrion. More direct evidence of this physical interaction was seen in a report investigating Lewy Bodies (LBs), the proteinaceous aggregates formed in PD brains. Clearly visible within tissue sections, LBs are mostly comprised of &#x003b1;-synuclein, and are a histopathological hallmark of PD. Using laser capture micro-dissection to study the other protein components in LBs from PD brains, HSPA8 was identified as one of the major components within these aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Leverenz1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally Kawamoto et al. showed increased OMI present in inclusion bodies of neural cells in the tissue of patients with &#x003b1;-synucleinopathies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Kawamoto1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. These two independent studies establish that aberrant levels of both proteins (OMI and HSPA8) occur in PD brains, supporting our results that show the relationship between them.</p><p>Establishing the conditions where this relationship is relevant and how it could be tested was made difficult by the roles of both OMI and HSPA8. Each may be located or re-located to two other major compartments of the cell, namely the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, the death effector role of OMI disallows over-expression studies.</p><p>In this current study, and in relation to PD, we have shown neurotoxicity (caused by 6OHDA) increased <italic>omi</italic> transcription in neuroblastoma cells, and with this came a coincidental, relative decrease in the novel OMI substrates. We believe this to be an initial, protective role of mitochondrial OMI. Under conditions of acute 6OHDA toxicity, the increased ROS production via OXPHOS establishes a strong incentive to shift away from using the Kreb's cycle for anabolic components and energy production. Under these conditions, the need to limit ROS production causes an increase in OMI, so it might degrade the incoming regulatory subunits of Kreb's cycle enzymes PDH and mitochondrial IDH. While this may initially be protective, continued stress would reverse OMI's beneficial role, making the release of activated OMI and other death-effectors from the damaged mitochondrion inevitable.</p><p>Poisoning by 6OHDA provided an acute and severe condition in which to study <italic>omi</italic> expression. Further from this, we chose conditions where OMI activity would not be ideal, namely when OXPHOS was restricted (in the absence of excess oxidative damage) and substrate availability was not limiting. Under these conditions, we proposed greater flux through the regulatory steps of the Kreb's cycle would be beneficial. By using partial inhibition of complex I by rotenone, we placed greater demand on complex II to provide for OXPHOS which in turn would make increased IDH and PDH activity more desirable. We postulated this would elicit effects on <italic>omi</italic> gene expression, given that OMI could degrade IDH3A and PDHB. Our results showed a transient silencing of <italic>omi</italic> expression, which was coincident with increased expression of the novel OMI substrates. This suggested conditions where <italic>omi</italic> expression (and potentially OMI activity) was not beneficial, just as the early stage of 6OHDA neurotoxicity suggested a time point when it was.</p><p>Further experiments to discern the regulatory players in this altered <italic>omi</italic> expression are required. Interestingly studies investigating the cleavage of CIAP (a member of the IAP family) identified OMI as the serine protease involved, and found expression of <italic>omi</italic> was increased upon activation of the transcription factor p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Jin1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. This established <italic>omi</italic> as a downstream target gene of p53 and the presence of a p53 dependent apoptotic pathway in mammals. While this pathway operates in the cytosol and directly impacts cytosolic OMI, it is possible that p53 plays a role in our toxicity studies where the effects are initiated in the mitochondrion and lead to increased <italic>omi</italic> gene expression. However, the transcriptional mechanism of <italic>omi</italic> down-regulation, in our sub-lethal studies, also mediated by the mitochondrial demands, requires greater investigation.</p><p>Until this study, the beneficial role of OMI in the mitochondrion has largely been considered as one of maintaining protein quality and turn over. A model recently postulated by Plun-Favreau et al. suggested the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 mediated OMI's activity. In this model PINK1 kinase activity was thought to increase proteolytic capability of OMI, and protect cells from stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-PlunFavreau2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. The same researchers found PD patients had considerably less OMI in which its key site (OMI S<sup>142</sup>) was phosphorylated by PINK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-PlunFavreau1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Their model described cells with OMI trimers that contained one or more monomers lacking S<sup>142</sup> phosphorylation, would be more vulnerable to mitochondrial stress. Additionally they found that idiopathic PD tissue showed greater amounts of phosphorylated OMI compared with normal controls. This implied PINK1 and OMI/HtrA2 operated within a dynamic stress-sensing model, although it could not be determined whether high levels of PINK-activated HtrA2 were a protective response or a cause of nigral cell death. Further to this model is a second protease known as Rhomboid-7 in drosophila and its orthologue PARL in mammals. Whitworth et al discovered Rhomboid-7 was capable of binding both OMI and PINK1, as well as cleaving them in their different intramembrane domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007100-Whitworth1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. This provides an additional regulatory means of increasing the mobile pool of both proteins in the intermembrane space. Whether this translates to more or less OMI for cleaving IMS or membrane-associated proteins (respectively), or whether this directly impacts the interaction between OMI and PINK1, remains to be tested. Since PARL is ATP-dependent, where OMI is not, it represents an intriguing aspect of regulation to the PINK1-HtrA2 stress response model.</p><p>Our results provide a new piece in this puzzle of describing the role of OMI in the mitochondrion. We believe this protease to be a regulator of IDH3A and PDHB entering the organelle and suggest it is most likely working from a baseline level of activity, so the mitochondrion may be poised to respond according to demand. While OMI is unlikely to be the only regulator, its ability to function independent of ATP should not be overlooked, particularly when key players, such as other mitochondrial proteases, are largely ATP-dependent. Regulation of OMI activity can now be sub-divided between autocatalysis (from inactive to active), PINK1 phosphorylation (from baseline to activated) and Rhomboid-7 modification (from membrane to IMS localization). Our model adds further to the PINK1-HtrA2 stress-sensing model. We suggest, as part of the stress-sensing model, that a pool of deficient or over-active OMI would be deleterious when there is a need to switch between OXPHOS and substrate-level phosphorylation, whether this may be due to a need to avoid excessive ROS production, or a need to generate more ATP. In the case of too much (or aberrantly activated) OMI, the chaperone role of HSPA8 would be destroyed, which could potentially limit PDH and mtIDH activity. This situation may also precipitate the re-location of OMI into the cytosol along with other toxic cell changes, depending upon the type of cell, its metabolic needs, and the duration of the demands placed upon it. In the case where OMI activity was absent or unable to be activated (due to PINK1 deficiencies) during conditions of less demand (but when substrates were plentiful), there would be little or no protease capable of controlling IDH3A and PDHB import. With one less control mechanism, the continued activity and pressure on OXPHOS would generate greater ROS accumulation. Two such paradigms exemplifying the second case may present as #1. fast-firing, dopaminergic neurons (with their need to rapidly restore conditions after repetitive, sequential firing of action potentials) or #2. the developing <italic>mnd</italic>2 mouse-pup. The former situation is further complicated by calcium ion fluctuations to levels capable of activating both of these Kreb's cycle enzymes, which would exacerbate the pressure on OXPHOS. Under these conditions, PINK1 would have a positive role in maintaining OMI activation, and subsequently its substrates greater degradation. The role of Rhomboid-7 requires greater scrutiny in our model. However, it is tempting to suggest that Rhomboid-7 processing would rid the mitochondrial membrane of its tethered OMI pool, which could only be replenished by newly synthesized OMI. As such, over or under-active Rhomboid-7 would impact our model in an ATP-dependent manner.</p><p>Several key experiments still need to be addressed, including determining the HSPA8, IDH3A and PDHB levels and expression patterns in the <italic>mnd</italic>2 developing mouse brain. Our current research also focuses on establishing a cellular assay in which the manipulation of OMI activity and its impact on Kreb's cycle function and ROS accumulation can be measured. We include the use of Omi phosphomutants to further establish the effect of PINK1 activation of OMI on our novel substrates. Likewise future studies with OMI mutants unable to be cleaved by Rhomboid-7/PARL could further improve our understanding of the involvement of mitochondrial OMI in the pathogenesis of PD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture, transfection and isolation of mitochondria</title><p>Cells (HEK-293 and SH-SY5Y, ATCC) were grown in 10&#x00025; FBS/DMEM supplemented with 20 U/mL penicillin and 20 ug/mL streptomycin at 37&#x000b0;C in 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>/95&#x00025; air.
