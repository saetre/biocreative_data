We assessed cell proliferation by labeling cells with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester and quantifying the fluorescence by FACS analysis. We also examined the cell cycle status using BrdU/propidium iodide double staining and FACS analysis. We evaluated changes in gene expression by microarray analysis following treatment with A-192621 in glioma cells. We examined the role of ETRB by reducing its expression level using small interfering RNA (siRNA).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report that two ETRB-specific antagonists, A-192621 and BQ788, reduce the number of viable cells in two glioma cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We describe similar results for two melanoma cell lines. The more potent of the two antagonists, A-192621, decreases the mean number of cell divisions at least in part by inducing a G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Microarray analysis of the effects of A-192621 treatment reveals up-regulation of several DNA damage-inducible genes. These results were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Importantly, reducing expression of ETRB with siRNAs does not abrogate the effects of either A-192621 or BQ788 in glioma or melanoma cells. Furthermore, BQ123, an endothelin receptor type A (ETRA)-specific antagonist, has no effect on cell viability in any of these cell lines, indicating that the ETRB-independent effects on cell viability exhibited by A-192621 and BQ788 are not a result of ETRA inhibition.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While ETRB antagonists reduce the viability of glioma cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, it appears unlikely that this effect is mediated by ETRB inhibition or cross-reaction with ETRA. Instead, we present evidence that A-192621 affects glioma and melanoma viability by activating stress/DNA damage response pathways, which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This is the first evidence linking ETRB antagonist treatment to enhanced expression of DNA damage-inducible genes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The endothelin (ET) family includes three 21-amino acid peptides, ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3, which bind to two G-protein-coupled receptors, endothelin receptor type A (ETRA) and endothelin receptor type B (ETRB). The ETRA binds ET-1 and ET-2 with equal preference over ET-3, while ETRB binds all three isoforms with equal affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The ET axis is believed to play a role in various malignancies including ovarian, prostate, cervical and breast carcinomas, melanoma and central nervous system tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The influence of the ET family on cancer is multifactorial: ET-1 induces proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], suppresses apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], enhances angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and promotes invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Components of the ET system have been found in many glioma tumor specimens and cell lines, and ET expression positively correlates with the degree of malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Two studies demonstrated ETRA expression in the neovasculature of glioblastoma tumors, while ETRB was localized to the tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Inhibitors of ET converting enzyme 1, which converts ET-1 into its active form, block DNA synthesis in glioblastoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. ET-1 induces proliferation in glioblastoma through various pathways including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and BQ788, an ETRB-specific receptor antagonist, blocks the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase, a key step in MAPK signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This led us to consider whether potential therapeutic candidates, the ETRB antagonists, negatively impact glioma growth.</p><p>Our laboratory previously showed that high levels of BQ788 inhibit melanoma proliferation both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We are currently investigating the effects of ETRB antagonists on melanoma and glioma, with particular interest in two ETRB-specific antagonists, BQ788, a peptide, and A-192621, an orally bioavailable small molecule. In the present work we demonstrate that both ETRB antagonists decrease the number of viable cells in melanoma and glioma cultures, while an ETRA-specific antagonist, BQ123, has no effect. In glioma cells, A-192621 induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and expression of DNA-damage associated genes. Surprisingly, however, the down-regulation of ETRB levels has no effect on the reduction in cell number by either ETRB antagonist.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and cell culture conditions</title><p>The human glioma cell lines LN-229 and SW1088 and the human melanoma cell line A375 (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA, USA) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modification of Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA, USA) and the human melanoma cell line WM35 (ATCC) was maintained in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) (Mediatech, Inc.). All cells were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gemini Biological Products, Calabasas, CA, USA), 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 &#x003bc;g/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and cultured in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>at 37&#x000b0;C.

LN-229 was originally derived from a grade IV glioblastoma and SW1088 was derived from an anaplastic astrocytoma. Twenty-four hours after plating, A-192621 was added at concentrations from 1 to 100 &#x003bc;M to non-confluent cells and incubated for 24 to 72 h. Viable cells were quantified by the capacity of their intracellular esterases to convert non-fluorescent calcein AM into green-fluorescent calcein. This assay reveals a decrease in viable cells with increasing A-192621 concentration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This decrease is enhanced at longer incubation times (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In addition, A-192621 is effective in reducing viable cells in the human melanoma cell lines A375 and WM35 in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This finding with melanoma cells is consistent with previously published data reporting that A-192621 inhibits melanoma growth in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We also tested the ability of ETRB-specific antagonist BQ788 to reduce the viability of the glioma cells. BQ788 was added to non-confluent cells in the same manner as A-192621 at concentrations from 1 to 100 &#x003bc;M. This inhibitor causes a significant decrease in viable LN-229 cells after 48 or 72 h of treatment but no significant change in SW1088 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). BQ788 also reduces cell viability in both melanoma cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This last result is consistent with previous findings of melanoma cells in our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. To assess the involvement of ETRA in viability, cells were treated with BQ123, an ETRA-specific antagonist. BQ123 was added to cells at 1 to 100 &#x003bc;M and incubated for 24 to 72 h. No significant changes in cell viability were observed in any of the four cell lines, at any concentration or time point (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Thus, potential cross-reaction of A-192621 or BQ788 with ETRA does not play a role in their effects on cell viability.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Endothelin receptor B antagonists reduce viable cell number in a dose- and time-dependent manner</bold>.

The human glioma cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE). This non-fluorescent reagent passively diffuses into cells, where the acetate groups are cleaved by intracellular esterases, producing green-fluorescent carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester. The ester groups react with intracellular amines and fluorescent intensity is exponentially diluted as cells divide. Fluorescent intensity was measured by FACS at 9 to 72 h. We tested two doses of A-192621, 10 nM, a concentration slightly above the IC<sub>50 </sub>that is calculated from radio-labeled ET-1 binding displacement studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and 100 &#x003bc;M, a concentration that dramatically reduces the number of viable cells in both the LN-229 and SW1088 lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We find that 100 &#x003bc;M, but not 10 nM, significantly reduces fluorescent carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester dilution in both LN-229 and SW1088 cells at 24 h, and this effect is sustained through later time points, indicating that A-192621 reduces the rate of cell division (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The endothelin B receptor antagonist A-192621 decreases glioma cell proliferation</bold>.

The exponential dilution of CFSE was converted to the number of cell divisions. (B) A high concentration of A-192621 (100 &#x003bc;M) induces G2/M cell cycle arrest in both LN-229 and SW1088 cells by 72 h.

Following treatment with A-192621, cultures were labeled with BrdU for 40 min to identify cells undergoing DNA synthesis and fixed immediately afterwards. Cells were analyzed by FACS, and BrdU intensity was plotted against DNA content. In both glioma cell lines, 100 &#x003bc;M A-192621 significantly increases the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase compared to vehicle, or to 10 nM treatment after 24 h (data not shown). This accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase continues through 72 h and is coupled with a concomitant decrease in the G1/G0 population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), indicating that A-192621 induces a G2/M phase arrest. In addition to effects on proliferation, we investigated whether A-192621 treatment also affects cell death, as measured by the percentage of total cells that stain positively with PI. A-192621 significantly increases PI staining at 48 h in both LN-229 and SW1088 cells, and at 72 h in SW1088 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Moreover, as a measure of apoptotic cell death, caspase 3/7 activity is increased at 72 and 48 h in LN-229 and SW1088 cells, respectively (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The endothelin B receptor antagonist A-192621 induces cell death</bold>.

Changes in gene expression were identified using the criteria of &#x0003e; 3-fold change and P &#x0003c; 0.0001. A striking finding is that, in both cell lines, 100 &#x003bc;M A-192621 up-regulates several genes that are known to be induced by DNA damage (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). These genes were not significantly up-regulated by 10 nM A-192621. These genes include growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible (GADD) 153, GADD45A, GADD34, sestrin 2 and death receptor 5 (DR5). The up-regulation of these genes was confirmed by real-time PCR in the human glioma cell lines, and also in the human melanoma cell lines (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Moreover, when we examined expression levels by real-time PCR, we could not detect ETRB in the SW1088 cell line after 45 amplification cycles (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). These findings led us to question the involvement of ETRB in the growth inhibition by ETRB antagonists. To address this question directly, we reduced the expression level of ETRB 69&#x02013;93%, using small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). All cell lines were transfected with siRNAs targeting ETRB or a non-targeting, scrambled siRNA, and then treated 24 h later with 100 &#x003bc;M A-192621, BQ788 or their respective vehicles. The number of viable cells was assessed at 24 to 72 h. First, reduced ETRB expression alone does not affect cell viability. Second, both A-192621 and BQ788 decrease the number of viable cells equivalently in cells transfected with ETRB-targeting siRNA or scrambled siRNA at all time points (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>; 24 and 48 hours not shown). The lack of effect of ETRB knockdown on A-192621- and BQ788-mediated reduction in cell number is further evidence that antagonism of this receptor is not the primary mechanism for the viability effects of these two drugs <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Reduced ETRB expression does not alter the effect of ETRB antagonists on viable cell number</bold>.

We show here that both melanoma and glioma cell viability are sensitive to ETRB antagonists. Both BQ788 and A-192621 decrease melanoma and glioma cell number in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We find that A-192621 is more potent than BQ788, causing a greater decrease in viable cell numbers at lower concentrations and at earlier time points. In fact, within the time frame tested, only A-192621 was able to reduce the viable cell number in the astrocytoma line SW1088.</p><p>In addition, A-192621 is attractive as a therapeutic agent because it is orally bioavailable, and considering that it is also more potent than BQ788, we investigated how it reduces glioma cell number in greater detail. The CFSE labeling study indicates that A-192621 inhibits mitosis. Using cell cycle analysis, treatment of glioma cells with A-192621 increases the percentage of cells with G2/M DNA content over time. This is coupled with a concomitant decrease in the percentage of cells with G0/G1 DNA content, indicating an arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, which likely accounts for the reduction in cell division seen with CFSE labeling. We also find that A-192621 treatment induces apoptotic cell death. Reduction in viable cell number is therefore a consequence of both decreased mitosis and increased apoptosis. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of ETRB antagonist-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest.</p><p>To further elucidate the actions of A-192621 on human glioma cells, we analyzed changes in gene expression using microarray technology. Notably, after 12 h of A-192621 treatment, there are highly significant increases in the expression of several genes known to be up-regulated following DNA damage. These genes include GADD153, GADD45A, GADD34, Sestrin 2 and DR5. Environmental stressors such as methylmethane sulfonate, or ultraviolet or gamma irradiation induce GADD45A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Expression of GADD45A and other GADD45-like genes activates the p38/JNK pathway and apoptosis. GADD45A also induces G2/M cell cycle arrest through its interaction with Cdc2 and cyclin B1 following genotoxic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Two other members of the GADD family, GADD34 and GADD153, are also up-regulated by A-192621 treatment. Like other members of this family, GADD34 and GADD153 are induced by stressful growth conditions and DNA damage. Over-expression of GADD34 and GADD153, along with GADD45 and others, suppresses cell growth (as measured by colony formation) and induces apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Sestrin 2 is one of three closely related genes in the sestrin family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and is closely linked to other GADD genes since sestrin 1, also known as PA26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], is a member of the GADD gene family. Sestrin 2, also known as Hi95, is induced by hypoxia, oxidative stress and DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Over-expression of sestrin 2 leads to apoptosis approximately 24 h following induction, and the cells are hypersensitive to further insult. DR5 is one of the TRAIL receptors with a cytoplasmic death domain that induces caspase-dependent apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. DR5 is induced by DNA damaging compounds in malignant gliomas, including LN-229 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Taken together, this evidence suggests that A-192621 affects glioma viability by activating stress/DNA damage response pathways, which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. A similar process may also occur in melanoma. The up-regulation of these genes was confirmed by real-time PCR in LN-229 and SW1088 cell lines, and also occurs in human melanoma cell lines, A375 and WM35, following 12 h of A-192621 treatment. Up-regulation of these genes may account for the G2/M arrest and the apoptosis we see at later time points. This is the first evidence linking ETRB antagonist treatment to enhanced expression of DNA damage-inducible genes.</p><p>We also present evidence that the reduction of both glioma and melanoma <italic>in vitro </italic>viability by A-192621 and BQ788 is not dependent on ETRB expression. This conclusion is supported by three types of data. (1) The concentrations of ETRB antagonists required to reduce cell number are far above the concentrations required to displace ET-1 from ETRB. (2) At the high dose, A-192621 reduces cell viability in the glioma cell line SW1088 despite the absence of detectable ETRB expression in these cells. (3) Experimental reduction of ETRB expression in the other cell lines by &#x0003e;90% has no effect on the ability of either antagonist to reduce glioma or melanoma cell numbers <italic>in vitro</italic>. Despite the evidence that these ETRB antagonists are not acting through ETRB, it is clear that they are not toxic for all cell types. That is, our prior experiments showed that BQ788 kills 7 different melanoma cell lines without affecting the human kidney line 293, even at 100 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus, there appears to be something distinctive about melanoma and glioma cells, and possibly a number of cancer cell types (ovarian, prostate, meninges) that are susceptible to ETRB antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have demonstrated that ETRB antagonists are effective agents against glioma and melanoma cell growth <italic>in vitro</italic>. To date, mechanisms of ETRB antagonist action in cancer treatment have focused on blocking ET-1 induced pathways. Although determining the precise mechanism by which ETRB antagonists reduce cell number in these cancers is beyond the scope of this study, the data presented here indicate that ETRB antagonists function independently of direct ETRB antagonism to mediate their effects on <italic>in vitro </italic>cell viability. We present evidence that A-192621 affects glioma and melanoma viability by activating stress/DNA damage response pathways, which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This is the first evidence linking ETRB antagonist treatment to enhanced expression of DNA damage-inducible genes, and suggests a novel direction for future work on the mechanism of action of ETRB antagonists in cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JPM participated in the design of the study, drafted the manuscript and carried out the experimental work.
