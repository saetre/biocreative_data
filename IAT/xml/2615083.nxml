Proteins that do not fold properly or integrate into cognate complexes are degraded by ER-associated degradation (ERAD) involving retrotranslocation to the cytoplasm and proteasomal peptide hydrolysis. N-linked glycans are essential in glycoprotein ERAD; the covalent oligosaccharide structure is used as a signal to display the folding status of the host protein. In this study, we define the function of the Htm1 protein as an &#x003b1;1,2-specific exomannosidase that generates the Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> oligosaccharide with a terminal &#x003b1;1,6-linked mannosyl residue on degradation substrates. This oligosaccharide signal is decoded by the ER-localized lectin Yos9p that in conjunction with Hrd3p triggers the ubiquitin-proteasome&#x02013;dependent hydrolysis of these glycoproteins. The Htm1p exomannosidase activity requires processing of the N-glycan by glucosidase I, glucosidase II, and mannosidase I, resulting in a sequential order of specific N-glycan structures that reflect the folding status of the glycoprotein.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>D.M.

As nascent protein chains enter the ER lumen through the Sec61 translocon complex, the oligosaccharyltransferase transfers the Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> glycan to asparagines in the consensus motif N-X-S/T, generating an N-linked glycan. Soon after the transfer, the N-linked glycan is processed by glucosidase I, glucosidase II, and ER mannosidase I. N-glycans increase the hydrophilicity of the protein and thereby affect protein folding directly. Importantly, these glycans also serve as ligands for proteins that modulate the folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helenius and Aebi, 2004</xref>). The Glc<sub>1</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> structure is a signal for the interaction with the molecular chaperones calnexin or calreticulin in higher eukaryotes or Cne1p, respectively, as proposed in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). In mammalian cells, after the removal of the mannose-linked glucose by glucosidase II, the folding sensor UDP-glucose/glycoprotein glucosyltransferase can readd a terminal glucose and thereby allows for another cycle of reassociation with calnexin/calreticulin. In contrast, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, no reglucosylation of misfolded proteins has been found, which implies the absence of the calnexin/calreticulin cycle in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandez et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Proteins that achieve the correct fold and integrate correctly into their cognate complexes can continue along the secretory pathway to their site of action. In contrast, proteins that do not achieve the proper fold in due time, as well as excess subunits of protein complexes, are retained in the ER and ultimately are degraded by the cytoplasmically located 26S proteasome. The process of recognition, retrotranslocation, and degradation of terminally misfolded proteins is referred to as ER-associated degradation (ERAD).</p><p>Although the N-glycans play a crucial role in the folding of N-glycoproteins, their remodeling by glucosidase I, glucosidase II, and ER mannosidase I is also crucial for N-glycoprotein ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knop et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jakob et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hitt and Wolf, 2004</xref>). The finding that ER mannosidase I is a relatively slow-acting enzyme (compared with glucosidase I and II) supported the mannose timer hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Su et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Helenius et al., 1997</xref>) and suggested that the ER mannosidase I product glycan Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>, when present on misfolded proteins, serves as the ERAD targeting signal in mammalian cells and in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. This led to the proposal that the ER contains a lectin or a lectinlike protein that recognizes Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> glycans on misfolded glycoproteins and by this initiates glycoprotein ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jakob et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>A group of proteins found throughout the eukaryotic kingdom with homology to class I mannosidases (family 47 glycosylhydrolases), termed Htm1p/ER degradation&#x02013;enhancing &#x003b1;-mannosidase&#x02013;like protein (EDEM), was proposed to act as such degradation lectins in ERAD. Sequence comparison of ER mannosidase I, EDEM1/2/3, and Htm1p reveals a mannosidase homology region with significant sequence identity among the homologues. However, the proteins differ in their remaining domains. One particular characteristic is the presence of a C-terminal extension that varies among the EDEM/Htm1p homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mast et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kanehara et al., 2007</xref>). In Htm1p, this domain constitutes almost one third of the whole protein. Although the essential residues of the processing mannosidases are conserved in Htm1p/EDEM1/2/3, initially neither in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jakob et al., 2001</xref>) nor in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hosokawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mast et al., 2005</xref>) mannosidase activity was reported, supporting their potential role as lectins. More recently, another protein besides Htm1p, Yos9p, has been suggested to act as ER degradation lectin. Yos9p harbors a mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domain essential for its function in N-glycoprotein ERAD. It was shown to be required for the efficient degradation of ERAD substrates that carry lesions in the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buschhorn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhamidipati et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szathmary et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, three pathways, ERAD&#x02013;lumen (ERAD-L), ERAD&#x02013;cytosol, and ERAD&#x02013;membrane, have been described, engaging different factors for the degradation of proteins with misfolded lesions in the corresponding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonifacino et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Taxis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vashist and Ng, 2004</xref>). ERAD-L engages the Hrd1p E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is in a complex with the Ubc7p/Cue1p E2 ubiquitin&#x02013;conjugating enzyme and AAA-ATPase (ATPase associated with a variety of cellular activities) Cdc48p with the cofactors Npl4p, Ufd1p, and Ubx2p. Moreover, this complex includes Hrd3p, Yos9p, Kar2p, Der1p, and Usa1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gauss et al., 2006a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">b</xref>). Hrd3p/Kar2p/Yos9p is believed to specifically recognize and target misfolded proteins carrying Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> glycans of the ERAD-L pathway to the degradation. Interestingly, Htm1p is also acting in the ERAD-L pathway via the Hrd1p complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vashist and Ng, 2004</xref>); however, it was not found to be a member of the complex but proposed to act upstream of Yos9p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gauss et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kanehara et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Although in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> the Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> glycan as N-glycan ERAD determinant remained, it became evident that in mammalian cells, N-glycans of folding-deficient proteins are further trimmed to Man<sub>6</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> and Man<sub>5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ermonval et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foulquier et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frenkel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hosokawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kitzmuller et al., 2003</xref>). By this extensive demannosylation, the terminal mannose of the A branch, which is the acceptor mannose of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, is removed. Thus, the proteins can no longer associate with the chaperones calnexin and calreticulin and can be directly deviated into the disposal machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Molinari, 2007</xref>). Recently, EDEM3 was shown to have mannosidase activity in vivo, as its overexpression leads to mannose trimming in vivo to Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> and Man<sub>6</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hirao et al., 2006</xref>), and interestingly, EDEM1 was also proposed to act as processing mannosidase in the extraction of misfolded glycoproteins from the calnexin/calreticulin cycle rather than being a lectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olivari et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Reconsidering glycoprotein quality control and ERAD in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in which the calnexin/calreticulin cycle is absent, no apparent need for enhanced N-glycan processing has emerged to date. Nevertheless, the essential residues of the processing mannosidases are conserved in Htm1p. Therefore, we reevaluated the function of Htm1p in the yeast ERAD system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>HTM1</italic> overexpression leads to altered N-glycan processing</title><p>To readdress the question of whether Htm1p is an active mannosidase in vivo, the N-glycan structures of overall proteins from wild-type, &#x00394;<italic>htm1</italic>, and wild-type cells overexpressing <italic>HTM1</italic> were compared. N-linked sugars were metabolically labeled in vivo for 20 min with [<sup>3</sup>H]mannose, and whole cell protein extracts were prepared. N-glycans were released by peptide N-glycosidase F treatment and analyzed by HPLC. As previously reported, the most abundant N-glycan structure in the ER of wild-type cells was Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrd et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jakob et al., 1998a</xref>). In addition, small amounts of oligosaccharides migrating at the positions of Man<sub>5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> and Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> glycans were also detected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The conversion of the N-linked glycans to Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> was not impaired in &#x00394;<italic>htm1</italic> cells, and the N-glycan profile appeared similar in both wild-type and &#x00394;<italic>htm1</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jakob et al., 2001</xref>).

In wild-type cells, a 10-min pulse predominantly revealed the Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> structure. Small amounts of a Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> oligosaccharide were also present. Upon the chase, oligosaccharides with higher molecular weight became prominent, reflecting the processing of N-linked glycans by Golgi-localized mannosyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrd et al., 1982</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>HTM1</italic>-overexpressing cells Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> was detected directly after the pulse, and the relative amount of this oligosaccharide increased during the chase period (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In comparison with the empty vector control, the amount of the Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> glycan was 4-fold or 4.5-fold increased at 0 min or 30 min of chase, respectively. Concomitantly, Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> was substantially reduced, indicating that it had served as physiological substrate for the trimming (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). We concluded that overexpression of Htm1p results in an amplified level of the Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> N-linked glycan.

Therefore, we first tested whether the Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> oligosaccharide structure was required for the Htm1p-dependent processing. For this, we took advantage of processing-deficient mutant strains and of the relaxed substrate specificity of the yeast oligosaccharyltransferase to genetically tailor the structure of the glycans present on proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jakob et al., 1998b</xref>). In wild-type cells, the activities of glucosidase I and II as well as ER mannosidase I result in the generation of the Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moremen et al., 1994</xref>), and overexpression of Htm1p yielded the Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> glycan. The Glc<sub>2</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> oligosaccharide in a glucosidase II&#x02013;deficient strain is still processed by ER mannosidase I to the Glc<sub>2</sub>Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> oligosaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jakob et al., 1998a</xref>), but <italic>HTM1</italic>-dependent processing was strongly impaired (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). In contrast, the Glc<sub>1</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> oligosaccharide transferred in &#x00394;<italic>alg8</italic>&#x00394;<italic>gls2</italic> cells was processed by ER mannosidase I to the Glc<sub>1</sub>Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> oligosaccharide, and this glycan was also a target for Htm1p-dependent processing to Glc<sub>1</sub>Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>. The deletion of the <italic>MNS1</italic> locus resulted in the generation of Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> glycans, and the absence of ER mannosidase I activity almost completely abolished Htm1p-dependent processing. From this result, we concluded that the sequential trimming of the N-glycan by glucosidase I, glucosidase II, and ER mannosidase I, generating the Man<sub>8</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> oligosaccharide in vivo, is a prerequisite for Htm1p-dependent processing. Moreover, because extension of the A branch by one glucose did not prevent <italic>HTM1</italic>-dependent processing, this analysis suggested that the trimming involved either the B or C branch of the N-linked glycan target.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Processing of N-glycans by glucosidase I, glucosidase II, and mannosidase I is required for efficient trimming by Htm1p.</bold> (A) N-glycan pulse-chase analysis over two time points (10-min pulse; 0- and 30-min chase).

Microsomes were prepared, and solubilized Htm1&#x02013;Myc-TAP protein was precipitated from the supernatant with IgG beads. The purified complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were stained (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). The two prominent bands that were visualized around 62 kD were isolated from the gel and subjected to mass spectrometry. Both bands were identified as protein disulfide isomerase 1 protein (Pdi1p; Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809198/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809198/DC1</ext-link>). We wondered whether the C terminus of Htm1p might be required for this interaction. Therefore, Myc-tagged constructs of Htm1p were generated of different truncates within the C terminus, namely at the positions 749, 683, 647, 582, and 547. We also generated Pdi1-HA-HDEL and a C-terminal truncate of Pdi1p at position 459, Pdi1-&#x00394;459&#x02013;HA-HDEL. Immunopurification of Pdi1-HA-HDEL or Pdi1-&#x00394;459&#x02013;HA-HDEL was performed, and the presence or absence of full-length or truncated Htm1p-Myc was determined by immunoblot analysis. The results confirmed the interaction of the full-length Pdi1p with Htm1p. However, no interaction could be detected between Pdi1-&#x00394;459&#x02013;HA-HDEL and Htm1-Myc (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>).

Visualization of the protein content by silver staining revealed Htm1-Myc and two bands around 62 kD that were clearly absent from the control lane (compare lane 2 with lane 3). Proteins were excised from the gel, trypsinized, and subjected to mass spectrometry. Both bands at 62 kD were identified as Pdi1p.

Within the framework of our hypothesis, we assumed specifically that a terminal &#x003b1;1,6-linked mannosyl residue functioned as a signal required for degradation. Yos9p, the putative ER-degradation lectin with a mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domain essential for glycoprotein ERAD, might act as the receptor for this structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buschhorn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhamidipati et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szathmary et al., 2005</xref>). To address this hypothesis directly, we took advantage of the possibility to alter N-glycan structures by manipulating the biosynthetic pathway of lipid-linked oligosaccharide assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jakob et al., 1998b</xref>). It is noteworthy that the putative product of Htm1p, the Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> oligosaccharide, is not a biosynthetic intermediate in the pathway of N-glycoprotein biosynthesis. However, &#x00394;<italic>alg3</italic> mutant cells produce a Man<sub>5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> glycan that also carries a terminal &#x003b1;1,6-linked mannose linked to an &#x003b1;1,3-substituted mannose, as is the case in the Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> C isomer.

Importantly, overexpression of mutant Htm1p did not result in an increase in the overall Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> glycan level, and these mutant forms were inactive in ERAD function. From this, we propose that the Man<sub>7</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> glycan generated by Htm1p on ERAD substrates serves as the N-glycan degradation signal, but Htm1p activity is not limiting in the degradation pathway. In this study, we addressed several aspects of this model: (a) what is the nature of the glycan signal; (b) how is the signal specifically generated on an ERAD substrate; and (c) what is the receptor of the glycan signal in the ERAD pathway?</p></sec><sec><title>A terminal &#x003b1;1,6-linked mannosyl residue is the product of Htm1p activity</title><p>The combined actions of ER mannosidase I and Htm1p result in a unique protein-bound high mannose structure not found during the biosynthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide substrate for N-linked protein glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burda and Aebi, 1999</xref>). ER mannosidase I produces a terminal &#x003b1;1,3-linked mannose on the B branch, whereas the action of Htm1p removes the capping &#x003b1;1,2-mannose of the C branch, resulting in a terminal &#x003b1;1,6-linked mannose.

We propose that substrate recognition by Htm1p involves a terminal &#x003b1;1,3-mannosyl residue generated by ER mannosidase I.

Our observation that overexpression of this protein was required to visualize small amounts of processing products is in line with this hypothesis. It is tempting to speculate that the C-terminal domain of Htm1p is required for the recognition of the protein part of the substrate. An appealing explanation could be that this part of the protein directly or indirectly binds misfolded peptides or hydrophobic patches and thus mediates substrate selection. In support of this proposal is our finding that the C terminus was required for the interaction with Pdi1p (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>).

If this glycan signals terminal misfolding, the dual recognition triggers the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the substrate protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gauss et al., 2006a</xref>). Our genetic data support the hypothesis that Yos9p specifically binds to the terminal &#x003b1;1,6-linked mannosyl residue generated by the Htm1p activity. Work by the group of J.S. Weissman corroborates this proposal by showing that the Yos9p lectin indeed prefers glycan structures that contain a terminal &#x003b1;1,6-linked mannose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quan et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the in vivo immunoprecipitation experiments performed with CPY&#x0002a;-HA and Yos9-ProA-His7 protein revealed physical interaction of these proteins in wild-type cells in which the signal is generated by Htm1p and in the &#x00394;<italic>alg3</italic> mutant cells that expose the signal as a result of incomplete N-glycan biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szathmary et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of Htm1p activity and EDEM function in mammalian cells</title><p>Recent studies suggest that EDEM1 as well as EDEM3 act as enzymes rather than as lectins and enhance the demannosylation of ERAD substrates in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hirao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olivari et al., 2006</xref>). In view of the conservation of essential residues of the processing mannosidases, our finding that Htm1p has mannosidase activity in vivo is in accordance with the described activities of the mammalian orthologues.</p><p>Although direct structural analysis of processing products are missing, indirect evidence suggests that mammalian EDEM proteins have a dual function; they process the terminal mannose residues of the A branch and thereby remove the UDP-glucose/glycoprotein glucosyltransferase acceptor, thus extracting the proteins from the calnexin/calreticulin cycle. However, N-glycans of misfolded glycoproteins are trimmed further down to Man<sub>6</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> and Man<sub>5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> in mammalian cells. Besides the EDEM family, other processing mannosidases of the glycosyl-hydrolase 47 family, like Golgi mannosidases and ER mannosidase I, have been shown to contribute to the enhanced N-glycan processing of misfolded glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moremen and Molinari, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Molinari, 2007</xref>).</p><p>We extend the model of glycan signaling in ERAD of mammalian cells and propose that the extensive mannose trimming serves two distinct goals: the removal of the terminal &#x003b1;1,2-linked mannose of the A branch ensures the exit from the calnexin/calreticulin cycle, whereas the additional trimming of the C branch generates the terminal misfolding signal and targets the N-glycoprotein for degradation. This dual activity explains the biphasic mode of glycoprotein degradation in mammalian cells, a lag phase in which the protein remains in the calnexin/calreticulin cycle and is protected from degradation followed by the actual degradation phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Molinari, 2007</xref>). Mannose trimming of the A branch by EDEM mannosidases releases the protein from the protective calnexin/calreticulin cycle and allows degradation. Indeed, overexpression of these enzymes was shown to result in an earlier onset of degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Molinari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Molinari, 2007</xref>). In view of our results, we propose that degradation itself requires the processing of the C branch to generate the &#x003b1;1,6-linked mannose as a degradation signal. It is possible that EDEM proteins are able to trim both the A and the C branch of the N-linked glycan. The absence of a calnexin/calreticulin cycle in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> made it possible to analyze the generation of this degradation signal directly.</p><p>It is a unique feature of the eukaryotic N-linked protein glycosylation that a complex oligosaccharide of a defined structure can be transferred to multiple sites characterized by a short consensus sequence, N-X-S/T, of very diverse secretory proteins. Therefore, this posttranslational modification tags many different proteins with a unique structure that is processed in the ER by a set of hydrolases and glycosyltransferases. They act in a sequential order, and some of these enzymes modify only N-glycans of unfolded proteins. This orchestrated processing results in a set of defined glycan signals that can be interpreted by a general folding and degradation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helenius and Aebi, 2004</xref>). Our work reveals the identity of one of these signals, the terminal &#x003b1;1,6-linked mannose residue generated by the exomannosidase activity of Htm1p. Our data suggest that this signal is interpreted by the lectin Yos9p, and we propose that this interaction communicates to the multicomponent degradation platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gauss et al., 2006a</xref>) that an unfolded bound protein is destined for destruction. The complete bipartite signal leads to the retrotranslocation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation of the substrate protein. However, we do not know how Htm1p activity is regulated by the presence of an unfolded protein domain or how the folding status of many different glycoproteins can modulate this mannosidase activity. A detailed biochemical analysis of the EDEM/Htm1 protein family will clarify this issue.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table S2 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809198/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809198/DC1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vijayraghavan et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biederer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jakob et al., 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2001</xref>).
