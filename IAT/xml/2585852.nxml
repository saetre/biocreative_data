Recently, we found that retinoblastoma-associated protein 48 (RbAp48) induces tissue-specific apoptosis in the exocrine glands depending on the level of estrogen deficiency. In this study, we report that transgenic (Tg) expression of RbAp48 resulted in the development of autoimmune exocrinopathy resembling Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome. CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell&#x02013;mediated autoimmune lesions were aggravated with age, in association with autoantibody productions. Surprisingly, we obtained evidence that salivary and lacrimal epithelial cells can produce interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) in addition to interleukin-18, which activates IFN regulatory factor-1 and class II transactivator. Indeed, autoimmune lesions in <italic>Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were induced by the adoptive transfer of lymph node T cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice. These results indicate a novel immunocompetent role of epithelial cells that can produce IFN-&#x003b3;, resulting in loss of local tolerance before developing gender-based autoimmunity.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: CIITA, class II transactivator; cLN, cervical LN; HSG, human salivary gland; IRF, IFN regulatory factor; MSG, mouse salivary gland; NOD, nonobese diabetic; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; RbAp48, retinoblastoma-associated protein 48; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; SS, Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome; Tg, transgenic.</p></fn><fn><p>N.

It can increase susceptibility to autoimmunity by affecting the overall reactivity and quality of the cells of the immune system. There is an autoimmune disease specific for certain organs in the body, involving a response to an antigen expressed only in those organs. Antigen/organ specificity is affected by antigen presentation and recognition, antigen expression, and the state and response of the target organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), which are maintained by a local immune system termed here &#x0201c;local tolerance.&#x0201d;</p><p>Many mechanisms protect tissues from autoimmune damage. These include relative isolation from the immune system and inhibition of the function of invading lymphocytes. For example, the eye has barriers to T cell infiltration and produces immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Constitutive expression of Fas ligand within the privileged site might also prevent immune-mediated damage by eliminating Fas-expressing T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Although they have yet to be well demonstrated in spontaneous animal models or human disease, genetic effects at the level of tissue protection are therefore to be expected. Autoimmune organ damage can be mediated by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, which play a crucial role in the development of autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). MHC class II alleles are probably involved in autoimmune disease because different alleles have different abilities to present peptides from target cells to autoreactive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Certain class II alleles might predispose to autoimmunity by increasing positive selection or decreasing negative selection of autoreactive T cells in the thymus. They might also act by inhibiting selection in the thymus of the regulatory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that are thought to prevent autoantigen-specific responses. Evidence for the local tolerance hypothesis is provided by the observation that autoimmune diseases are often tissue specific and sometimes involve antibodies against a restricted set of antigens, thereby prompting us to accept this most simple explanation for the initiation of autoimmunity. The loss of local tolerance is considered to result from the combined effect of different environmental factors. MHC class II genes are constitutively expressed only on hematopoietic cells involved in antigen presentation (dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells, and cortical thymic epithelial cells), but can be aberrantly induced by inflammatory stimuli on many other cell types (such as endothelial cells, hepatocytes, &#x003b2; cells of the pancreas, and thyrocytes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Although it has been implicated in allograft rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), and subsequently in autoimmunity, it is still unknown whether to initiate autoimmunity class II molecules have to be expressed on professional APCs within secondary lymphoid organs or on nonhematopoietic cells of the target organ itself.</p><p>It has been suggested that estrogenic action is responsible for the strong female preponderance of many autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome (SS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that apoptosis plays a key role in the physiology and pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases, including SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). We have demonstrated that estrogenic action influences target epithelial cells through Fas-mediated apoptosis in a murine model for SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Recently, we found that tissue-specific apoptosis in the exocrine glands spontaneously occurring in estrogen-deficient mice may contribute to the development of autoimmune exocrinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Searching for the role of estrogen deficiency in the development of autoimmunity, we have recently identified retinoblastoma-associated protein 48 (RbAp48) gene specific for estrogen deficiency&#x02013;dependent apoptosis in the exocrine glands, and transgenic expression of RbAp48 gene induced tissue-specific apoptosis in the exocrine glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). In this transgenic mouse model, we propose a possible clear and defined ab initio relationship between aberrant exposure of MHC class II molecules on IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing epithelial cells and disease development (i.e., autoimmune exocrinopathy).</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Autoimmune exocrinopathy develops in <italic>RbAp48</italic>-transgenic (Tg) mice</title><p>We have generated <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice where the RbAp48 gene is expressed in the salivary and lacrimal glands using the salivary gland&#x02013;specific promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). When the histopathology of all organs from those mice were analyzed, we found that autoimmune exocrinopathy resembling SS developed in almost all <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice at 24 wk of age or more, but not in the WT mice. Lymphocyte infiltration in salivary and lacrimal glands of <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice becomes more frequent at &#x0223c;30&#x02013;50 wk of age (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), and a significantly higher incidence of inflammatory lesions was found in female Tg mice at all ages (not depicted). Many infiltrating lymphocytes were observed in periductal areas at moderate (score 2) to severe (score 4) degrees, and shown in focal appearance. Representative histopathological features of the inflammatory lesions in lachrymal and salivary (submandibular) glands from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice were shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>. No inflammatory lesions were observed in other organs of <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice. A majority of infiltrating cells in salivary and lacrimal glands were Thy1.2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, whereas a minor proportion of B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), and CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells (unpublished data) was observed. When the function of lacrimal and salivary glands in <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice was analyzed, the mean volume of tear and saliva secretion from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice was significantly lower than that from the WT group at 30 wk of age or more (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Regarding the peripheral T cell phenotype of <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice, T cell activation markers (CD44<sup>high</sup>, CD62L<sup>low</sup>, CD45RB<sup>low</sup>) were up-regulated on CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in cervical LNs (cLNs) from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice, compared with those from WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). No significant difference was observed in thymic T cells gated on CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> bearing CD69, CD25, and CD62L<sup>low</sup> between Tg and WT mice (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080174/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080174/DC1</ext-link>). As for the phenotype of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells, no difference was detected in thymus, spleen, and cLNs between <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg and WT mice (Fig. S2). Moreover, culture supernatants from anti&#x02013;TCR-&#x003b2; and -CD28 mAb-stimulated cLN T cells obtained from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice contained higher levels of IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3;, whereas no difference in IL-4 and -10 levels between <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg and WT mice was observed by ELISA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Our previous reports identified a 120-kD &#x003b1;-fodrin as an important autoantigen in murine and human SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). It is particularly interesting that a higher titer of serum autoantibodies against SS-A (Ro), SS-B (La), and 120-kD &#x003b1;-fodrin was detected in <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice, compared with that in WT mice by ELISA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). This result is consistent with the characteristic flow cytometric finding that showed a significant CD5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> fraction capable of autoantibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>) that appeared in spleen cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). On the other hand, the CD5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were undetectable in both salivary and lacrimal glands from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice (Fig. S3 A). In addition, significantly increased CD21<sup>high</sup>IgM<sup>high</sup>B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> marginal zone B cells were observed in both cervical lymph nodes and spleen from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice compared with those from WT mice (Fig. S3). These results may provide a new animal model for autoimmune exocrinopathy resembling SS, which should help us to further understand how autoreactive T cells are developed, and subsequently influence the development of autoimmunity.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Autoimmune lesions in <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice.</bold> (A) Mean grade of inflammatory lesions in salivary and lacrimal glands from WT and <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice 10&#x02013;50 wk of age.

However, it is undetermined whether MHC class II&#x02013;expressing epithelial cells can function as APCs. We frequently observed MHC class II molecule expression on the exocrine gland cells in <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice, but not in WT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). These molecules play a pivotal role in the induction and regulation of immune responses by virtue of their ability to present self-peptides to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). To examine whether salivary epithelial cells could act as APCs, mouse salivary gland (MSG) cells, splenocytes, and splenic CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice and WT mice were compared in terms of their capacity to express MHC class II and costimulatory molecules, including CD86, CD80, and ICAM-1, by flow cytometric analysis. Among them, a considerably large proportion of MHC class II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD86<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, CD80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, and ICAM-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells was observed on MSG cells from Tg mice, compared with those from WT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). MSG cells were enriched by enzymatic treatment and using several antibodies against immune cells, epithelial cells, and magnetic beads, as shown in Fig. S4 A (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080174/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080174/DC1</ext-link>). DCs were undetectable in the purified MSG cell suspension (Fig. S4 B). On the other hand, although the expressions of MHC class II and CD86 on the splenocytes and CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs were higher than those on both MSG cells, the expressions of CD80 and ICAM-1 on the professional APCs were similar or lower than those on the MSG cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). These expressions (MHC class II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD86<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, and ICAM-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) on salivary epithelial cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice were also confirmed by confocal analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Controls using isotype antibodies for immunostainings were shown in Fig. S4 B. Moreover, to examine whether the peripheral T cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice can respond to the MSG cells that show phenotypes for the APCs, CFSE-labeled purified CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (10<sup>5</sup>) T cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice were co-cultured with the MSG cells (1 and 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) from those mice or WT mice. Although CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from B6 mice could not respond to both B6 and <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg MSG cells, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice were capable of responding to MSG cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice, but not with those from WT mice, whereas anti&#x02013;MHC class II antibody inhibits these responses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Furthermore, proliferation assay using [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporation demonstrated that purified CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells of cLNs from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice were more proliferative to the MSG cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice relative to those from WT mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Additionally, significantly increased proliferation of the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to peripheral DCs from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice was observed compared with DCs from WT mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Approximately half of the T cells response to 10<sup>5</sup> DCs from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice equaled the level of the response to 10<sup>5</sup> MSG cells from the Tg mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Antigen-presenting function in salivary epithelial cells.</bold> (A) MHC class II expression of salivary tissues from WT and <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice was detected by confocal analysis using anti&#x02013;MHC class II mAb, Alexa Fluor 568&#x02013;conjugated anti&#x02013;rat IgG (red) and DAPI (blue).

Surprisingly, in <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice, a prominent expression of IFN-&#x003b3; was detected in salivary and lacrimal epithelial cells besides sporadically positive infiltrating cells of <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice, not WT mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). These findings were observed mainly in the MHC class II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ductal epithelium adjacent to lymphoid infiltrates. Epithelial IFN-&#x003b3; expression in the exocrine glands of <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice was up-regulated during the course of autoimmune exocrinopathy. Induction of IFN-&#x003b3; expression may occur through many different types of stimulation, including cross-linking of cell-surface receptors and stimulation with cytokines, including IL-2, -12, and -18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). It has been demonstrated that IFN-&#x003b3; synthesis is predominantly induced by stimulation with IL-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), IL-18 expression was observed in salivary epithelial cells in <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice, not in WT mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Confocal analysis revealed that differential expression of IL-18 and IFN-&#x003b3; was clearly observed, i.e., IL-18 mainly in the acinar cells and IFN-&#x003b3; in the duct cells, within salivary epithelial cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice, but not from WT mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>). Controls using isotype antibodies were shown in Fig. S4 C. Epithelial IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-18 productions were confirmed by flow cytometry using MSG cells without immune cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg, not from WT mice, whereas there was no difference in both IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-18 expressions of cLN cells between WT and <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>). Although the production of IL-18 in salivary gland cells was detected in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), there has been no proof for IFN-&#x003b3; production of salivary gland cells in any paper. Therefore, to confirm IFN-&#x003b3; production of exocrine glands, detection of IFN-&#x003b3; using tissue homogenates was performed. A high concentration of IFN-&#x003b3; was detected in the tissue homogenates of lacrimal and salivary glands from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice, compared with that from WT mice, by ELISA (Fig. S6 A). Furthermore, the detection of IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA of MSG cells was performed by in situ hybridization using the RNA probe of mouse IFN-&#x003b3; gene. A more intense signal for IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA in duct cells of salivary glands from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice was observed compared with that from WT mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). As for the expression of BAFF, which is an inducer of IFN-&#x003b3; in B cells, the expression of epithelial cells was undetectable in both <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg and WT mice (Fig. S7). In vitro studies using HSG cells demonstrated that the expressions of IL-18, IFN-&#x003b3;, and MHC class II (HLA-DR) were observed when treated with Tam or transfected with pCMV-<italic>RbAp48</italic>, whereas they were inhibited when treated with 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E2), caspase 1 inhibitor (Ac-YVAD-CHO; Ci), and siRNA of <italic>RbAp48</italic> (si; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Confocal analysis confirmed the expression of IL-18 and IFN-&#x003b3; in HSG cells treated with Tam or transfected with pCMV-<italic>RbAp48</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). It is important to note that IL-18 is secreted earlier (by 6 h) than IFN-&#x003b3; production and HLA-DR expression (by 12 h) in Tam-stimulated and <italic>RbAp48</italic>-transfected HSG cells (Fig. S8). The most prominent function of IL-18 is its capacity to act as a potent costimulus for IFN-&#x003b3; production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Indeed, we observed an increase in IFN-&#x003b3; production in HSG cells treated with recombinant IL-18 in the dose-dependent manner, but not in MCF-7 cells (Fig. S9, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080174/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080174/DC1</ext-link>), by ELISA and flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>).

In this regard, we reported previously significantly increased caspase 1 activity in salivary gland tissues from ovariectomized (Ovx) C57BL/6 mice in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) and Tam-stimulated and <italic>RbAp48</italic>-transfected HSG cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>IFN-&#x003b3; production from salivary epithelial cells stimulated with RbAp48.</bold> (A) IRF-1 and CIITA mRNA expressions of HSG cells stimulated with Tam (&#x0223c;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M) or transfected with pCMV-<italic>RbAp48</italic> (&#x0223c;0&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;g) in the presence of IFN-&#x003b3; (5 ng/ml) were detected by real-time PCR.

To know the homeostatic expansion of peripheral T cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice, we adoptively transferred CFSE-labeled CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice into irradiated syngeneic C57BL/6.Ly5.1 mice and analyzed them 7 d later. As a result, we observed more substantial cell division of the donor CFSE-labeled cLN CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice than that from WT mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>), indicating that T cells undergoing homeostatic proliferation may provide a basis for autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). This suggests that elicitation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell&#x02013;mediated autoreactivity against autoantigen could be the primary pathogenic process that leads to substantial homeostatic expansion.

For example, certain alleles of class II (mouse I-A<sup>g7</sup>) might be particularly good at presenting glutamic acid decarboxylase&#x02013;65 or insulin peptides to T cells in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, thus contributing to recognition and ultimate destruction of pancreatic &#x003b2; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Some investigators have proposed that I-A<sup>g7</sup>, because of its poor peptide-binding properties, enhances autoimmunity in NOD mice in a global fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). In this case, the &#x003b2; cell specificity of autoimmunity in this strain and the switch to autoimmune thyroiditis when a class II molecule without these properties is exchanged for I-A<sup>g7</sup> must be controlled by other genetic loci in NOD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). It is possible that the most straightforward explanation for the effects of I-A<sup>g7</sup> is that it predisposes to islet-specific autoimmunity and not system-wide reactivity. Another piece of evidence that the role of MHC class II is antigen-specific is that the class II alleles predisposing toward autoimmunity vary in one human disease to another, indicating that class II alleles act in autoimmunity via specific antigens rather than comprehensively.</p><p>We demonstrated in this study that autoimmune exocrinopathy resembling SS developed in almost all <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice, and that a high titer of serum autoantibodies against SS-A (Ro), SS-B (La), and 120-kD &#x003b1;-fodrin was detected in these Tg mice. We frequently found MHC class II molecule expression on the exocrine gland cells with autoimmune lesions in <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice. When we examined whether salivary epithelial cells could act on antigen presentation, we found a large proportion of MHC class II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD86<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD80<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, and ICAM-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells primarily observed on cultured MSG cells from Tg mice. Moreover, CFSE-labeled purified CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (10<sup>5</sup>) T cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice were capable of responding to MSG cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice, whereas anti&#x02013;MHC class II antibody inhibited these responses. Although it has not been determined whether MHC class II&#x02013;expressing epithelial cells can function as APCs, those data strongly suggest that the epithelial cells may function as APCs during development of autoimmune exocrinopathy. In <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice, a surprisingly prominent expression of epithelial IFN-&#x003b3; was detected beside sporadically positive infiltrating cells. These findings were observed mainly in the MHC class II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ductal epithelium adjacent to lymphoid infiltrates. Epithelial IFN-&#x003b3; expression in the exocrine glands of <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice was up-regulated during the course of autoimmune exocrinopathy. A previously unknown, multifaceted role of IFN-&#x003b3; as regulator of the local immune system, which is termed here local tolerance, is disclosed. As to the mechanism of CIITA induction in <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice, our findings demonstrate the essential role of RbAp48-driven stimulation of IFN-&#x003b3; production and signaling leading to up-regulation of IRF-1 and CIITA. RbAp48, initially identified as retinoblastoma-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>), was characterized as a component of distinct nucleosome-modifying complexes, including the nuclear histone deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Although the functions of the RbAp48-like proteins in these complexes remain undetermined, it was reported that E2F-1 and RbAp48 are physically associated in the presence of Rb and histone deacetylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>), suggesting that RbAp48 could be involved in transcriptional repression of E2F-responsive genes. Several reports have demonstrated that estrogen may play an inhibitory role on apoptosis in endothelial cells, breast cancer cells, cardiac myocytes, prostate cells, and neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). It has been shown that the transcription factor IRF-1 mRNA expression is induced by ICI 182,780 as an antiestrogenic reagent and repressed by estrogens in antiestrogen-sensitive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). We demonstrated the first evidence that IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing epithelial cells in the exocrine glands function as APCs through the IRF-1&#x02013;CIITA pathway, resulting in the development of autoimmune exocrinopathy via loss of local tolerance. SS is known to have the most female predominance of &#x0003e;95% among all the autoimmune patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). One of the key questions in respect to the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases is how autoreactivity to particular autoantigens is initiated and maintained under an estrogen-deficient state. Although an important role for T cells in the development of autoimmune disease has been argued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>), it is not known if disease is initiated by a retrained inflammatory reaction to autoantigen. We clarified that epithelial IFN-&#x003b3; production is crucial for the initiation of autoimmune reactions between epithelial cells and autoreactive T cells with homeostatic expansion. Our previous study suggests that antiestrogenic actions have a potent effect on the proteolysis of &#x003b1;-fodrin autoantigen in the salivary gland through up-regulation of caspase 1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). These results strongly suggest that RbAp48-mediated activation of caspase 1 leads to the cleavage and activation of IL-18, which may act directly on IFN-&#x003b3; production and on effector CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells by inducing migration and proliferation. Thus, aberrant expression of MHC class II in the exocrine glands facilitates loss of local tolerance before the development of autoimmune lesions, which is very similar to SS.</p><p>Evidence has been mounting that estrogen deficiency such as menopause is a proinflammatory state, which promotes osteoporosis and atherosclerosis, as well as autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). In vivo and in vitro experiments here, including the induction of autoimmune lesions by T cell transfer from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice into Ovx-<italic>Rag2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and in vitro antigen presentation of the Tg MSG cells to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, strongly suggests that estrogen deficiency stimulates salivary epithelial cells that are activated via the up-regulation of RbAp48 to present any endogenous autoantigen to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells for the onset of autoimmune lesion in the salivary glands resembling human SS. Our data finds that transfer of cLN T cells from <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice into Ovx-<italic>Rag2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice leads to autoimmune lesions, consistent with the conclusion that estrogen deficiency leads to the ability of salivary gland epithelial cells to express MHC class II and present any self-antigens. Most importantly, the salivary gland cells from human SS patients express RbAp48 together with IFN-&#x003b3; or IL-18, as well as the findings of <italic>RbAp48</italic>-Tg mice in this work, suggesting that the molecules would be useful for any clinical application.</p><p>Collectively, our results demonstrate a direct molecular mechanism by which estrogen deficiency induces tissue-specific overexpression of RbAp48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), subsequently developing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell&#x02013;mediated autoimmunity through epithelial IFN-&#x003b3; production.
