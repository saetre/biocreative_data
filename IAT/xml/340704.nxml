The gene contains 3 introns totalling 7.8 kb and unusual direct repeats flank all three intron-exon splice junctions. The transcription initiation site was mapped by S1 nuclease protection analysis and confirms that cDNA clones previously reported were full length. Sequence similarities between regions at the 5' and 3' termini of this human gene and a chicken H3.3 gene lead us to propose that either the previous assignments of termini of the chicken gene are in error, or there are alternative transcription start and polyadenylation sites. The 85% base matching of human and chicken H3.3 3'UTR sequences for 520 bases is unprecedented among homolog 3'UTR segments, especially considering that these species are separated by over 250 Myr of evolution. We also present the sequence of three related processed human H3.3 pseudogenes and provide evidence demonstrating that most of the 20 to 30 copies of the H3.3 gene within the human genome are in fact processed pseudogenes.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0097-a" xlink:role="2874"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0102-a" xlink:role="2879"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2871"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2872"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2873"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0097.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2874"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2875"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0099.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2876"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0100.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2877"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2878"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2879"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2880"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2881"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2882"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2883"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2884"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2885"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2886"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2887"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2888"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00251-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2889"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
