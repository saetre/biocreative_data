Dexamethasone evoked a concentration-dependent (EC<sub>50</sub>&#x0223c;4 &#x003bc;M) increase in transcriptional activity dependent upon a glucocorticoid response element in the &#x003b1;-ENaC sequence. Although dexamethasone also activated endogenous SGK1, artificially increasing cellular SGK1 activity by expressing a constitutively active SGK1 mutant (SGK1-S422D) in hormone-deprived cells did not activate pGL3-KR1. Moreover, expression of catalytically inactive SGK1 (SGK1-K127A) suppressed the activation of endogenous SGK1 without affecting the transcriptional response to dexamethasone. Increasing cellular PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) activity by expressing a membrane-anchored form of the catalytic PI3K-P110&#x003b1; subunit [CD2 (cluster of differentiation 2)-P110&#x003b1;] also activated endogenous SGK1 without affecting pGL3-KR1activity. A catalytically inactive form of CD2-P110&#x003b1; (R1130P), on the other hand, prevented the dexamethasone-induced activation of SGK1, but did not inhibit the activation of pGL3-KR1. However, expression of SGK1-S422D or CD2-P110&#x003b1; enhanced the transcriptional responses to maximally effective concentrations of dexamethasone and this effect occurred with no change in EC<sub>50</sub>. Dexamethasone-induced (0.3&#x02013;300&#x000a0;nM) activation of pGL3-KR1 was unaffected by inhibitors of PI3K (PI-103 and wortmanin) and by rapamycin, a selective inhibitor of the TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex 1) signalling complex. Dexamethasone-induced activation of the &#x003b1;-ENaC gene promoter can thus occur independently of SGK1/PI3K, although this pathway does provide a mechanism that allows this transcriptional response to dexamethasone to be enhanced.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>airway epithelium</kwd><kwd>epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel (ENaC) dexamethasone</kwd><kwd>phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)</kwd><kwd>reporter gene</kwd><kwd>serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1 (SGK1)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>Af9, ALL-1 fused gene from chromosome 9</kwd><kwd>CD2, cluster of differentiation 2</kwd><kwd>df, degrees of freedom</kwd><kwd>Dot1a, disruptor of telomeric silencing alternative splice variant a</kwd><kwd>ENaC, epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel</kwd><kwd>GRE, glucocorticoid response element</kwd><kwd>Nedd-4/2, neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated protein 4-2</kwd><kwd>NDRG1, <italic>N</italic>-myc downstream regulated gene 1</kwd><kwd>PIM1 and 3, provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukaemia 1 and 3</kwd><kwd>SGK1, serum- and glucococorticoid-induced protein kinase</kwd><kwd>PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase</kwd><kwd>TORC, target of rapamycin complex</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="49"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The integrated functioning of the respiratory tract is dependent upon the controlled absorption of Na<sup>+</sup> from the liquid film that covers the lung/airway epithelia, and glucocorticoid hormones are important to the induction and maintenance of this Na<sup>+</sup>-absorbing phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> absorption occurs via a &#x02018;leak&#x02013;pump&#x02019; mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], in which the overall rate of Na<sup>+</sup> absorption is restricted by the rate of apical Na<sup>+</sup> entry, and this rate-limiting influx of Na<sup>+</sup> occurs via ENaCs (epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channels), transport proteins composed of three subunits (&#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-ENaC) encoded by separate genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In unstimulated cells, apical Na<sup>+</sup> permeability appears to be restricted by the continual internalization of ENaC, and this process is mediated by Nedd-4/2 (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated protein 4-2), an ubiquitin ligase that binds to WW domains (protein&#x02013;protein interaction modules characterized by two conserved proline residues spaced 20&#x02013;22 amino acids apart) on &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-ENaC, thus targeting the ENaC channel complex for ubiquitination, internalization and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Glucocorticoids induce expression of SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], a regulatory kinase that phosphorylates Nedd-4/2, thus blocking this protein's interaction with ENaC. Activating SGK1 therefore allows ENaC to remain in the apical membrane, leading to a rise in Na<sup>+</sup> permeability and a stimulation of Na<sup>+</sup> absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, glucocorticoid hormones also control &#x003b1;-ENaC transcription by activating a GRE (glucocorticoid receptor response element) in this gene's promoter region, and this provides another mechanism that allows these hormones to contribute to the control of Na<sup>+</sup> absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It is therefore interesting that studies of renal epithelia have indicated that SGK1 may also play a role in the control of &#x003b1;-ENaC transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Since this may have implications for our understanding of the ways in which glucocorticoids control pulmonary Na<sup>+</sup> transport, the present study explores the relationship between cellular SGK1 activity and &#x003b1;-ENaC transcription in glucocorticoid-stimulated human airway epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>Cell culture and molecular biology</title><p>Experiments were undertaken using a human distal airway epithelial cell line (H441) that expressed an endogenous Na<sup>+</sup> conductance essentially identical with that associated with &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-ENaC co-expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Since the activity of this Na<sup>+</sup> conductance is strictly dependent upon glucocorticoid stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], these cells provide a valuable experimental system with which to explore the factors that allow these hormones to control Na<sup>+</sup> transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Standard techniques were used to maintain these cells in serial culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and experiments were undertaken using cells removed from culture flasks using trypsin/EDTA and plated on to 24-well (reporter gene assays, 7.5&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) or six-well (Western analysis, 3&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) plates. Cellular SGK1 activity was artificially increased by transfecting cells with a cDNA construct encoding a glutathione transferase-fusion protein incorporating a truncated form of SGK1 which lacked 60 N-terminal amino acid residues and which had been further modified by mutating SGK1-Ser<sup>422</sup> to aspartate (SGK1-S422D). The N-terminal truncation increases the expression of this protein by preventing its degradation, and the S422D mutation allows SGK1 to be activated by PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Taken together, these mutations confer a constitutively active phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Non-specific effects of the transfection and/or heterologous protein expression were controlled for using an analogous construct encoding a catalytically inactive form of SGK1, SGK1-K127A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The role of PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) was explored by expressing a chimaeric protein consisting of the catalytic P110&#x003b1; domain of PI3K (PI3K-P110&#x003b1;) attached to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the rat CD2 surface antigen. The CD2 domain effectively anchors the PI3K-P110&#x003b1; subunit to the inner surface of the membrane. PI3K activity was enhanced using a construct encoding wild-type PI3K-P110&#x003b1; (CD2-P110&#x003b1;), and the corresponding control construct (CD2-P110&#x003b1;-R1130P) incorporated a catalytically inactive mutant. This system has been detailed previously in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional activity of the &#x003b1;-ENaC promoter</title><p>Activation of the promoter region of the &#x003b1;-ENaC gene was assayed by transfecting cells on 24-well plates using Lipofectamine&#x02122; 2000 with a luciferase-linked reporter gene construct (pGL3-KR1) incorporating 2.2&#x000a0;kb of the &#x003b1;-ENaC gene sequence corresponding to nucleotides &#x02212;1388 to +830 relative to the start site for the &#x003b1;-ENaC-1 transcript. This gene sequence includes exon 1A, intron 1, the start site for the &#x003b1;-ENaC-2 transcript and the GRE at position &#x02212;141 to &#x02212;155 that is known to regulate transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In all experiments the transfected cells were initially maintained (24&#x000a0;h) in a fully defined culture medium prepared using dialysed serum devoid of glucocorticoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Glucocorticoid-deprived cells were exposed to this medium throughout the entire experimental period, whereas dexamethasone-stimulated cells were exposed to this synthetic glucocorticoid as detailed below. Experiments were terminated by lysing the cells so that luciferase formation could be quantified (Wallac 1420 Victor plate reading luminometer/Promega luciferase assay system) and normalized to the amount of cellular protein in each well, which was determined using Bradford reagent. Some experiments were undertaken using a reporter construct that had been modified by deleting (Stratagene QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit) five nucleotides (position &#x02212;150 to &#x02212;155) in order to disrupt the GRE that has previously been documented in the &#x003b1;-ENaC gene promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental design and data analysis</title><p>All pGL3-KR1 activities were expressed as fold increases over the basal activity measured in cells expressing the empty pGL3 vector (pGL3-basic). Hormone-sensitive pGL3-KR1 activity was quantified by subtracting the activity measured in glucocorticoid-deprived cells from the activity measured in dexamethasone-stimulated cells, and all such data are shown as percentages of the activity measured in cells exposed to a maximally effective concentration of dexamethasone. To allow comparison between different data sets, the response to this standard stimulus was quantified in every experiment. Plots showing the relationship between hormone-sensitive pGL3-KR1 activity and dexamethasone concentration were constructed and sigmoid curves fitted to the pooled data by least-squares regression. Since the background activity was defined experimentally, the algorithm used to fit this curve (Grafit 5; Erithacus Software) estimated (i) the concentration of dexamethasone needed for half-maximal activation (EC<sub>50</sub>); (ii) the maximal response (<italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub>), and (iii) the Hill Coefficient. This software package also provided an estimate of the standard error associated with each parameter and the statistical significance of any apparent differences between data sets could thus be tested by calculating a value of Student's <italic>t</italic> using the equation: <disp-formula id="m01"><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \def\rm#1{{\textrm #1}} \def\it#1{{\textit #1}} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} }{} \[ t = (\hbox{\it Param}_1 - \hbox{\it Param}_2)/\sqrt {(\hbox{\it SE}_1^2 - \hbox{\it SE}_2^2)} \] \end{document}</tex-math></disp-formula> where <italic>Param</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>Param</italic><sub>2</sub> are the respective parameters measured under different conditions (i.e. EC<sub>50</sub> or <italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub>) and <italic>SE</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>SE</italic><sub>2</sub> represent their respective standard errors. Each curve was defined by six or seven different dexamethasone concentrations and was therefore fitted with three or four df (degrees of freedom). This, in turn, implies that the values of <italic>t</italic> derived from this equation are associated with six or eight df, and these were therefore used to estimate the two-tailed probabilities (<italic>P</italic>) that the two parameters are derived from the same statistical populations. Values of <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 were considered to be significant. Values of <italic>n</italic> denote the number of times a protocol was repeated using cells at different passage number and all results are means&#x000b1;S.E.M.</p></sec><sec><title>Assay of SGK1 activity</title><p>Changes in cellular SGK1 activity were monitored using phosphospecific antibodies to monitor by Western analysis the phosphorylation of residues (Thr<sup>346/356/366</sup>) within an endogenous protein (NDRG1; <italic>N</italic>-myc-downstream gene 1) that are phosphorylated by SGK1 but not by other kinases, including the closely related PKB (protein kinase B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Although it is now clear that changes to the phosphorylation status of these residues can provide a read-out of cellular SGK1 activity (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]), our experience is that there can be variations in the magnitudes of the responses measured in different experiments. To ensure that this effect did not confound analysis of the present data, all experiments were undertaken using strictly paired experimental designs in which the control and experimental cells were age-matched and at identical passage. Great care was taken to handle all protein samples identically and, in all experiments, proteins extracted from control and experimental cells were processed in parallel using identical reagents and then fractionated on the same gels so that they could be analysed in exactly the same way. A full account of this method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and a detailed review of its rationale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], are published elsewhere.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Glucocorticoid-induced activation of the &#x003b1;-ENaC gene promoter</title><p>When expressed in glucocorticoid-deprived cells, the activity of the pGL3-KR1 reporter gene was 7.3&#x000b1;1.0-fold greater (<italic>n</italic>=49, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001, Student's paired <italic>t</italic> test) than the activity measured in cells expressing the empty pGL3 vector. Dexamethasone (0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) consistently evoked luciferase synthesis in pGL3-KR1-expressing cells and, since this response was not seen in cells expressing the empty vector (results not shown), this finding confirms that this synthetic glucocorticoid normally activates the &#x003b1;-ENaC gene promoter. This response became apparent after &#x0223c;6&#x000a0;h, reached a plateau at &#x0223c;18&#x000a0;h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) and was abolished by disrupting the GRE that has previously been shown to regulate the activity of this gene promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Experiments in which luciferase formation was quantified in cells exposed to 0.3&#x02013;300&#x000a0;nM dexamethasone for 18&#x000a0;h showed that this response was concentration-dependent, and the EC<sub>50</sub> was estimated to be 3.7&#x000b1;0.4&#x000a0;nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), a value similar to that reported in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Concentrations of dexamethasone &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;nM usually evoked maximal responses, although, in some experiments, high concentrations of dexamethasone evoked sub-maximal responses, indicating that this response can be subject to desensitization. The activation of this reporter gene was abolished by mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), and it is therefore clear that this response reflects glucocorticoid receptor-mediated activation of the GRE that has been previously described in the promoter region of the &#x003b1;-ENaC gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Dexamethasone-induced activation of pGL3-KR1</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time courses showing the effects of dexamethasone (0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) upon luciferase accumulation in cells expressing either wild-type (wt) &#x003b1;-ENaC reporter construct (pGL3-KR1, <italic>n</italic>=10) or the construct incorporating the mutant &#x003b1;-ENaC sequence lacking the functional GRE (GRE-del, <italic>n</italic>=5).

This response was essentially identical with that reported in previous studies of untransfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and it is therefore clear that exposure to transfection reagents does not alter this response. Parallel studies of glucocorticoid-deprived cells expressing SGK1-S422D revealed a clear stimulation of NDRG1-Thr<sup>346/356/366</sup> phosphorylation and this response, in common with the response to dexamethasone, occurred with no change in the overall NDRG1 abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).

Moreover, although a catalytically inactive control construct (CD2-P110&#x003b1;-R1130P) did not alter NDRG1 phosphorylation, this mutant protein did prevent the dexamethasone-induced increase in NDRG1-Thr<sup>346/356/366</sup> phosphorylation, indicating that this chimaeric protein displays a dominant&#x02013;negative phenotype. It is therefore interesting that electrophysiological studies undertaken in this laboratory (M. Gallacher and S.M. Wilson, unpublished work) have shown that the expression of CD2-P110&#x003b1;-R1130P can partially suppress the glucocorticoid-induced Na<sup>+</sup> current in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Transient expression of CD2-P110&#x003b1;-R1130P thus seems to provide another way of blocking the glucocorticoid-induced activation of SGK1.</p><p>Expressing these chimaeric proteins in glucocorticoid-deprived cells had no effect upon the transcriptional activity of the &#x003b1;-ENaC gene promoter, indicating that PI3K-mediated activation of SGK1 does not mimic the transcriptional response to dexamethasone. Interestingly, although it has no catalytic activity, expressing CD2-P110&#x003b1;-R1130P did enhance the transcriptional response to dexamethasone. Although this unexpected response to a catalytically inactive protein cannot be mediated via PI3K or SGK1, it is important to remember that this mutant protein would almost certainly suppress the phosphorylation of PI3K targets other than SGK1. It is therefore possible that a PI3K-dependent signalling pathway may normally exert inhibitory control over &#x003b1;-ENaC gene transcription. However, the most important result to emerge from these experiments was that expression of CD2-P110&#x003b1; augmented the transcriptional response to dexamethasone to a level greater than that measured in CD2-P110&#x003b1;-R1130P-expressing cells. This result accords well with the data derived from cells expressing the modified forms of SGK1 and, taken together, these two sets of independent experiments indicate that artificially imposed increases in cellular SGK1 activity do not mimic the effects of glucocorticoid stimulation but do enhance the transcriptional responses to these hormones.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K</title><p>Studies of cells expressing SGK1-K127A or CD2-P110&#x003b1;-R1130P showed that glucocorticoids continue to activate the &#x003b1;-ENaC promoter even if the activation of endogenous SGK1 is prevented and so, although SGK1 augments the transcriptional response to dexamethasone (see above), increased SGK1 activity does not seem to be necessary for the hormonal activation of the &#x003b1;-ENaC gene promoter. Since this contrasts with the situation in renal epithelia where SGK1 is intimately involved in the control of &#x003b1;-ENaC transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], further experiments explored the effects of pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K, since such compounds characteristically cause a profound loss of SGK1 activity (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]). Neither wortmanin nor PI-103 had any effect upon the transcriptional response to dexamethasone, and although LY294002 reduced the maximal response to this hormone, this effect was relatively modest (&#x0223c;30% inhibition) and residual responses could clearly be seen in LY294002-treated cells. Parallel analyses of extracted protein showed that LY294002, PI-103 and wortmannin all reduced the phosphorylation of NDRG1-Thr<sup>346/356/366</sup>, indicating these substances all cause substantial inactivation of endogenous SGK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, although LY294002 appeared to cause a complete loss of activity (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]), small amounts of Thr<sup>346/356/366</sup>-phosphorylated NDRG1 could still be detected in PI-103-treated and wortmannin-treated cells, suggesting that these compounds may not inactivate SGK1 fully. This discrepancy was surprising, since all three compounds were used at concentrations thought to cause complete inhibition of PI3K in intact cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and it may be relevant that, as well as inhibiting PI3K, LY294002 is known to inactivate a number of protein kinases including GSK3&#x003b2; (glycogen synthase kinase 3&#x003b2;), PLK3 (polo-like kinase 3), CK2, PIM1 (provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukaemia 1) and PIM3, and it has been therefore suggested that the use of LY294002 as a selective PI3K inhibitor should be discontinued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, even if we accept that LY294002 is the only tested compound that was able to cause complete inhibition of PI3K, then the present data show that essentially complete loss of endogenous SGK1 activity causes only a modest reduction of the transcriptional response to dexamethasone.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of rapamycin</title><p>Although often referred to as PI3K inhibitors, LY294002, wortmannin and PI-103 also inhibit the TORC1 signalling complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], and this could be significant for the present study, since it has recently been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] that TORC1 catalyses the phosphorylation of SGK1-Ser<sup>422</sup>, implying that TORC1 plays an important role in the control of cellular SGK1 activity (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). We therefore also explored the effects of rapamycin, since this compound has been shown to act as an exquisitely selective inhibitor of TORC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The first such studies showed that rapamycin augmented the glucocorticoid-induced activation of the &#x003b1;-ENaC gene promoter, and it is therefore clear that the inhibitory action of LY294002 described above cannot be attributed to an effect on TORC1. Indeed, these data also suggest that tonic activity of TORC1 may normally repress the activity of this gene promoter. However, the most important result to emerge from these studies was that rapamycin had no discernible effect upon NDRG1-Thr<sup>346/356366</sup> phosphorylation in glucocorticoid-deprived or dexamethasone-stimulated cells. Since separate experiments in this laboratory have shown that 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h exposure to 0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M rapamycin essentially abolishes TORC1 activity in H441 cells (assayed by monitoring the phosphorylation of S6K-Thr<sup>389</sup>; G. Watt and S.C. Land, personal communication) this result, in contrast with the data presented by Hong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], indicates that TORC1 is not important to the control of SGK1. This finding does, however, accord well with results recently presented by Garc&#x000ed;a-Mart&#x000ed;nez and Alessi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], who showed that the apparent phosphorylation of SGK1-Ser<sup>422</sup> by TORC1 is almost certainly an artefact.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance of findings from the present study</title><p>Recently, studies of renal epithelial have indicated that &#x003b1;-ENaC transcription may be inhibited by a repressor complex [Dot1a (disruptor of telomeric silencing alternative splice variant a)/Af9 (ALL-1 fused gene from chromosome 9)] that associates with the &#x003b1;-ENaC gene promoter. This complex appears to be a substrate for SGK1, which phosphorylates Af9 at Ser<sup>435</sup> thus allowing Dot1a to dissociate from this gene region and this, in turn, seems to permit unimpeded transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. It was therefore suggested that SGK1 is centrally important to the hormonal control of &#x003b1;-ENaC transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and this mechanism could explain the augmentation of the glucocorticoid-induced &#x003b1;-ENaC transcription that we observe in cells expressing SGK1-S422D or CD2-P110&#x003b1;. However, it is important to remember that transient expression of such constitutively active proteins would almost certainly cause hyperactivation of SGK1/PI3K, and it is therefore interesting that our results also show that dexamethasone can activate the &#x003b1;-ENaC gene promoter even when signalling via SGK1/PI3K has been blocked. Moreover, although irradiation with UV light increased the activity of endogenous SGK1 via a pathophysiological mechanism, this manoeuvre did not alter the activity of the &#x003b1;-ENaC reporter gene construct in unstimulated or dexamethasone-stimulated cells. Although it is abundantly clear that glucocorticoids do activate SGK1 in H441 cells (as shown in the present study and in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]), the results from the present study, in contrast with those presented by Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], suggest that this kinase can only play a very minor role in the hormonal control of &#x003b1;-ENaC transcription. It is therefore interesting that the quantification of mRNA levels presented by Zhang et al. (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]) show that sgk1 gene deletion has only a modest (&#x0223c;30% inhibition) effect upon &#x003b1;-ENaC mRNA abundance in the kidneys of mice fed a low-Na<sup>+</sup> diet. This result, in common with the results from the present study, indicates that substantial &#x003b1;-ENaC gene transcription must occur independently of SGK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Moreover, in the lungs, &#x003b1;-ENaC gene deletion prevents the absorption of alveolar fluid that normally occurs during the perinatal period and thus causes death through severe respiratory distress within &#x0223c;48&#x000a0;h of birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Genetic deletion of the sgk1 gene, on the other hand, does not cause an overt pulmonary phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], indicating that at least some &#x003b1;-ENaC gene transcription must be able to occur independently of this kinase.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION</title><p>The experimental work was jointly undertaken by Niall McTavish and Jennet Getty.
