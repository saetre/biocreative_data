Individual cancer genes display point mutations such as base changes, insertions and deletions that initiate and promote cancer growth and spread. Somatic hypermutation is a powerful mechanism for generation of different mutations. It was shown previously that somatic hypermutability of proto-oncogenes can induce development of lymphomas.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We found an exceptionally high incidence of single-base mutations in the tumor suppressor genes <italic>RASSF1</italic> and <italic>RBSP3 (CTDSPL)</italic> both located in 3p21.3 regions, LUCA and AP20 respectively. These regions contain clusters of tumor suppressor genes involved in multiple cancer types such as lung, kidney, breast, cervical, head and neck, nasopharyngeal, prostate and other carcinomas. Altogether in 144 sequenced <italic>RASSF1A</italic> clones (exons 1&#x02013;2), 129 mutations were detected (mutation frequency, MF&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.23 per 100 bp) and in 98 clones of exons 3&#x02013;5 we found 146 mutations (MF&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.29). In 85 sequenced <italic>RBSP3</italic> clones, 89 mutations were found (MF&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.10). The mutations were not cytidine-specific, as would be expected from alterations generated by AID/APOBEC family enzymes, and appeared <italic>de novo</italic> during cell proliferation. They diminished the ability of corresponding transgenes to suppress cell and tumor growth implying a loss of function. These high levels of somatic mutations were found both in cancer biopsies and cancer cell lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>This is the first report of high frequencies of somatic mutations in <italic>RASSF1</italic> and <italic>RBSP3</italic> in different cancers suggesting it may underlay the mutator phenotype of cancer. Somatic hypermutations in tumor suppressor genes involved in major human malignancies offer a novel insight in cancer development, progression and spread.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>We have performed a comprehensive deletion survey of 3p on more than 400 of lung, renal, breast, cervical and ovarian carcinomas (major epithelial cancers) using a defined set of markers, combining conventional LOH with quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR), comparative genomic and NotI microarrays hybridisations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Alimov1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Braga1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Li1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Senchenko1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Senchenko2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. We identified two most frequently affected 3p21.3 regions, LUCA (LUng CAncer) at the centromeric and AP20 at the telomeric border of 3p21.3. Aberrations of either region were detected in more than 90&#x00025; of the studied tumors suggesting they harbor multiple tumor suppressor genes (TSG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Senchenko2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Zabarovsky1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Imreh1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>One of them is <italic>RASSF1</italic> gene (from LUCA region) that can exist in different alternative splicing forms (at least 7 different isoforms). In this work we studied the most important <italic>RASSF1A</italic>, the largest splicing form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Dammann1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Several studies have shown that loss of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> expression occurs because of tumor acquired promoter DNA methylation in many different cancers. For example, <italic>RASSF1A</italic> is silenced by promoter hypermethylation in over 90&#x00025; of small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) and clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and in about 40&#x00025; of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). The gene is able to suppress growth of lung and renal cancer cells in culture and tumor formation in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Zabarovsky1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, occasional missense mutations in <italic>RASSF1A</italic> have been reported. <italic>RASSF1A</italic> codes for 340 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> contains a predicted diacylglycerol (DAG) binding domain and a Ras association domain. RASSF1A can induce cell-cycle arrest by engaging the Rb-family cell cycle checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Shivakumar1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. These and other results strongly suggest that RASSF1A is an important human tumor suppressor protein acting at different levels of tumor progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Zabarovsky1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Another gene is <italic>RBSP3</italic> also called <italic>HYA22</italic> and <italic>CTDSPL</italic>. It exists in two splice forms (A, 265 amino acids and B, 276 amino acids) that map to AP20 region and belongs to a gene family of small C-terminal domain phosphatases that may control the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Kashuba1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Expression of the gene was greatly decreased in several SCLC and NSCLC cell lines. <italic>RBSP3</italic> showed growth suppression with regulated transgenes in culture and suppression of tumor formation in SCID mice. It was demonstrated that transient expression of both A and B forms resulted in drastic reduction of phosphorylated form of RB protein presumably leading to a block of the cell cycle at the G1/S boundary. After this finding the gene was renamed (RB protein serine phosphatase from chromosome 3). All these features are consistent with classical characteristics of a TSG.</p><p>Interestingly, both <italic>RASSF1</italic> and <italic>RBSP3</italic> could collaborate in cell cycle arrest: the former by inhibiting cyclin D1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Shivakumar1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and the latter by dephosphorylating RB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Kashuba1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

In 20 available <italic>p16/INK4a</italic> (exons 1&#x02013;3, 447 bp) clones sequenced from cancer and normal cells we found no mutations and in 6 clones for <italic>GPR14</italic> (1170 bp) only 1 mutation was found in cancer cells (MF&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.01). In our experiments described below (see next Section and Section &#x0201c;Different mutations frequencies in other genes&#x0201d;) in 31 sequenced <italic>GPR14</italic> clones no mutations were found indicating that this mutation is rather rare. The mutation frequency for GPR14 was statistically significantly different as compared both to the RASSF1A and RBSP3 (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.01).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Frequent mutations in <italic>RASSF1A</italic> in human carcinomas, cancer and haematopoietic cell lines</title><p>During analysis of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> we have isolated several mutant clones including one double mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Dreijerink1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. This high frequency of mutations was surprising since for <italic>RASSF1A</italic> and other candidate genes in the AP20 and LUCA regions the mutation frequencies were reported to be low to none <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Zabarovsky1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Lerman1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. At the same time many polymorphisms were recorded for <italic>RASSF1A</italic> and in many cases it was not clear whether it was a real single nucleotide polymorphism or somatic mutation in cancer cells because control normal cells were not available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Dammann1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Importantly, in all these studies single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and direct sequencing from PCR products was used. The admixture of stroma, blood vessels, lymphocytes and other normal cells would hamper detection of mutations using these methods (see M/M). Tumor heterogeneity creates additional problems for recognizing mutations. Therefore we decided to re-investigate the mutational status of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> in multiple tumor types including primary tumors and cancer cell lines. First, <italic>RASSF1A</italic> cDNA was isolated from an RCC biopsy (T356) and the surrounding normally looking kidney parenchyma (N356). Several cDNA clones were sequenced. In six clones derived from normal kidney parenchyma, no mutations were found. However of seven clones from the tumor tissue, mutations were detected in three (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.14). All were A to G substitutions. To exclude RNA editing, genomic DNA from the same patient was isolated and the first two exons (DAG domain) of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> were amplified by PCR. Several clones derived from normal and tumor tissue were then sequenced: all six clones from the tumor biopsy showed mutations while of the fourteen analyzed clones from normal tissue only one was mutated (P&#x0003c;0.001). The observed mutations in the cDNA from tumor cells were not created by RNA editing because the mutations were detected also on genomic DNA level. Normal cell contamination and high expression of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> in normal cells, compared to cancer cells, can explain the different ratios between mutated and normal <italic>RASSF1A</italic> clones from cDNA and genomic DNA. Most surprising was the fact that with the exception of two genomic clones from the tumor biopsy with deletion of C at position 254 (Accession No. NM_007182), all other detected mutations were in different positions.</p><p>As a control we amplified <italic>GPR14</italic> from the same patient and sequenced 10 clones from cancer and from the surrounding normal tissue. No mutations were found proving that high mutation rate is specific for the <italic>RASSF1A</italic> gene.</p><p>To check whether different mutations in the same tumor occurred due to the tumor heterogeneity or some other mechanism(s), we isolated and sequenced <italic>RASSF1A</italic> clones (only exon 1 and 2; 391 bp) from genomic DNA of four RCC cell lines. In TK164 all three and in KRC/Y (2&#x0002b;2) all four sequenced clones contained mutations. In TK10, among 22 clones, 9 were mutated. Importantly, the majority of clones contained different mutations. Only one clone was sequenced from Caki1, and it was mutated.</p><p>We also sequenced this gene from genomic DNA of four lymphoid cell lines (BL2 and RAMOS are Burkitt cell lines, and IARC171 and MutuIII are lymphoblastoid cell lines) and the results were very similar to the RCC cell lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005231-t002">Table 2</xref>). Altogether, among 84 sequenced clones 55 contained mutations that in most cases differed. MF in <italic>RASSF1A</italic> in these experiments was between 0.14 and 0.70.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0005231-t002" position="float"><object-id

The average frequency of mutations was 0.10/100 bp for transcribed sequences.

If a mutation originates in the cell and not in the tube <italic>in vitro</italic> then in the cell population grown from one cell some fraction (depending on the number of alleles present in the single cell) of plasmid clones should contain the same (i.e. a founder) mutation. To perform this experiment we isolated 15 single cell KRC/Y clones as described in the section &#x0201c;Mutations generated de novo&#x0201d;. In this case we grew the cells for three weeks to obtain more DNA and generate more mutated clones. KRC/Y cells were used instead of BL2 cells as it was easier to detect that we have one cell in the well. However, we of course cannot exclude that in some of the 15 selected wells there were more than one cell. <italic>RASSF1A</italic> exons 3&#x02013;5 were tested in this experiment (see M/M) as they were more easily isolated than exons 1 and 2 and contained more sequence information (516 nt vs. 391 nt). Moreover, according to EST sequence data this part of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> has higher MF. From each PCR reaction 10 plasmid clones were selected and DNA was isolated. However, due to different technical problems (no or rearranged insert, bad quality DNA or sequencing, etc.) usually only six-seven plasmid clones were further analysed. Totally 98 plasmid clones were sequenced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005231-t005">Table 5</xref>). One founder mutation was detected in all cell clones and in 46 (47&#x00025;) of plasmid clones. It was a change of A to G (nt26735, Accession No. AC002481) just at the border of intron 2 and exon 3. This mutation destroyed the splice acceptor site AG/G and thus inactivated the gene. As this founder mutation appeared in all single cell clones most probably it originated before we started to do this experiment. Forty other founder mutations specific for each cell clone were also detected (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005231-t005">Table 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005231.s001">Table S1B</xref>).

In our published papers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Kashuba1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Li3">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> wild type <italic>RBSP3</italic> and wild type and mutated <italic>RASSF1A</italic> genes were tested in GIT. The genes were PCR amplified from tumors and sequenced. In contrast to the wild type <italic>RBSP3</italic> and <italic>RASSF1</italic> genes, that were inactivated (i.e. deleted, non-expressed, mutated) in all 32 grown tumors, the mutant <italic>RASSF1A</italic> was not additionally mutated in any of four analyzed tumors. Importantly, in these GIT experiments we used direct sequencing of PCR products. These experiments showed that &#x0201c;founding mutations&#x0201d; really do exist.</p><p>Analysis of public EST databases confirmed our experimental data. It should be noted that the frequency of mutations in <italic>RASSF1A</italic> and <italic>RBSP3</italic> found in EST databases even using very stringent criteria was significantly higher than found in our experiments. MF for all mutations for <italic>RBSP3</italic> was 0.63 and for <italic>RASSF1</italic> it was 0.22. Probably, this discrepancy could account for the differences between the cell types analyzed in our experiments and in the EST database.</p><p>Unfortunately only 17 <italic>RASSF1A</italic> clones could be analysed because other EST sequences were either not sufficiently good or could be other isoforms of the <italic>RASSF1</italic> gene.</p><p>Interestingly, mutations of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> and <italic>RBSP3</italic> changing amino acids were found even in clones isolated from normal cell RNA, however, at a lower frequency than in cancer cells (MF ratios for cancer/normal sequences were 3.3 and 3, respectively). This difference for both genes was statistically significant (P&#x0003c;0.001) This probably reflects the selection for and the advantage of coding mutations during cancer progression. Important to mention that &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; sequences include also non-annotated sequences so we cannot exclude that some of the &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; sequences actually represent cancer cells.</p><p>In fact, these results correlate with the data from the mouse <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments that showed a higher frequency of mutations in SCID tumors than in the same cells grown <italic>in vitro</italic>. Interestingly, the same mutations were observed in cells grown <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, in SCID mice (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005231.s002">Table S2B</xref>).</p><p>We have also experimentally tested whether <italic>RASSF1A</italic> (genomic DNA, exons1 and 2) harbored mutations in normal tissues and found one mutated clone out of 14 in normal kidney (normal control to T356, see section &#x0201c;Frequent mutations in <italic>RASSF1A</italic> in human carcinomas&#x0201d;). Important to note that so called &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; kidney could be already partially transformed despite of normal phenotype because it was obtained from tissues adjacent to the tumor. We also sequenced complete <italic>RASSF1A</italic> cDNA from normal heart and detected six mutated clones out of 15 tested. All six heart mutated clones contained the same two mutations: L214L with codon changed from CTA to CTG and V236V with codon changed from GTA to GTG. Mutations in heart <italic>RASSF1</italic> cDNA were most likely SNP as they could be also found in other <italic>RASSF1</italic> clones in public databases (e.g. AC002481, NM_170713.2, NM_170714.1). In any case it is clear that mutations in <italic>RASSF1</italic> in normal cells are more rare than in cancer cells.</p><p>As we found mutations in all 5 coding exons of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> (the last 6<sup>th</sup> exon contains only 48 amino acids&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;144 bp). It means that other six known isoforms of <italic>RASSF1</italic> are also frequently mutated.</p><p>Exceptionally high level of germ line SNP mutations in <italic>RASSF1A</italic> found in several studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Dammann1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> support our data that the two genes we studied have rather frequent mutations even in normal cells.</p><p>The pattern of mutations was very different compared to those reported for AID and APOBEC enzymes and cannot be explained by polymerase errors. This is the first report of high mutation frequencies of <italic>RASSF1</italic> and <italic>RBSP3</italic> genes in different epithelial malignancies. In our preliminary paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Pan1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> we analyzed mutations in <italic>RASSF1A</italic> gene in NPC samples and the results supported the present observations. In the NPC experiments 35 mutations were detected in 23 patients and mutations were considered real if at least two clones from the same patient contained the same mutation. Ten clones for each sample were sequenced in these experiments. Both DNA strands were sequenced.</p><p>At present, we don't know the nature of the mechanism responsible for this hypermutability, and only speculations could be done for its physiological function(s) in normal cells. There are several DNA polymerases in vertebrate cells that inaccurately copy templates and could be involved in generating hypermutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Gearhart1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. One of them, <italic>POLH</italic> (error rate 3&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>), has a mutation target motif WA and may contribute to hypermutagenesis of immunoglobulin genes at A-T bases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Rogozin1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>POLH</italic> is expressed in all tissues and, in principle, could cause hypermutations in non-haematopoietic cells. We found that 50&#x00025; of all observed mutations in <italic>RBSP3</italic> happened in A or T surrounded by G or C. That means that the mutation target motif for 50&#x00025; of mutations in <italic>RBSP3</italic> is SWS and is different from the <italic>POLH</italic> motif. It is reasonable to suggest that other(s) yet unknown DNA polymerase(s) may be responsible for the high mutability rates we report here and more than one polymerase contributes to hypermutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Gearhart1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Zeng1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our results also argue that mutations are not completely random. They are not correlated with predicted numbers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005231-t001">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005231-t002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005231-t003">3</xref>). For example according to statistical calculations our sequences of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> exons 1 and 2 should contain 0.026 nonsense mutations but in reality we detected 3 nonsense mutations, P&#x0003c;0.001 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005231.s001">Table S1A</xref>). For <italic>RASSF1A</italic> exons 3&#x02013;5 the predicted number of nonsense mutations is 0.037 and we found 3 such mutations, P&#x0003c;0.001 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005231.s001">Table S1B</xref>). This fact may reflect the nature of cancers and normal tissues studied here. We cannot also exclude that these mutations still have some preferable motif(s).</p><p>We mentioned in the text that clonal selection for more aggressive growth of cancer cells could add to changing proportion of different mutations. In our previous paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Pan1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> we also observed an unusual distribution of mutations. Among 35 detected mutations we found 30 transitions, 3 transversions, 2 deletions (frameshift), 3 nonsense (stop), 26 missense and only 4 were synonymous.</p><p>High frequency of mutations in different cancers and normal cells was reported earlier for P53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005231-Strauss1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.
