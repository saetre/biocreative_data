In the ovary, both <italic>Cebpa</italic> and <italic>Cebpb</italic> are essential for granulosa cell function. In this study we have explored the role of the <italic>Cebpd</italic> gene in ovarian physiology by expression and functional studies. Here we report that <italic>Cebpd</italic> (C/EBP&#x003b4;) is expressed in the mouse ovary in a highly restricted temporal and spatial pattern. In response to luteinizing hormone (LH/hCG), CEBPD expression is transiently induced in interstitial cells and in theca cells of follicles from the primary to pre-ovulatory stage, and overlaps in part with expression of the alpha-smooth muscle actin protein. Efficient down-regulation of CEBPD was dependent on a functional <italic>Cebpb</italic> gene. Proliferating human theca cells in culture also express <italic>Cebpd</italic>. Cells from patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) exhibited higher <italic>Cebpd</italic> expression levels. However, deletion of <italic>Cebpd</italic> in mice had no overt effect on ovarian physiology and reproductive function. Very little is known at present about the molecular mechanisms underlying theca/interstitial cell functions. The expression pattern of CEBPD reported here identifies a novel functional unit of mouse theca cells of primary through tertiary follicles responding to LH/hCG together with a subset of interstitial cells. This acute stimulation of CEBPD expression may be exploited to further characterize the hormonal regulation and function of theca and interstitial cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ovary is a complex organ undergoing regular phases of re-organization in response to a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The main functional unit, the follicle is comprised of a central oocyte, mural and cumulus granulosa cell layers, and an outer layer of theca cells. Ovarian follicles reside within the interstitial stroma, which also gives rise to the specialized follicular cell types. The ovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (LH), produced by the pituitary, triggers a series of dramatic morphological and physiological changes in the pre-ovulatory follicle, culminating in ovulation and subsequent differentiation of the follicular granulosa and theca cells into the luteal cells. While the LH receptor signals primarily through the cAMP/PKA pathway to influence gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001334-Ascoli1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> it also impacts signaling pathways involving Janus and phosphoinositol kinases, chloride currents, and calcium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001334-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001334-Gudermann1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

Each CEBP protein has unique properties regulating cell type-specific growth and differentiation. For example, within the hematopoietic system CEBPA is required for development of granulocytes, while lack of CEBPB affects differentiation of the B-cell lineage and monocytes. During adipocyte differentiation, CEBPB, -D, and A are expressed consecutively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001334-Takiguchi1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In the mammary gland, CEBPB promotes proliferation and differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001334-Robinson1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, while CEBPD participates in the initiation of cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001334-Thangaraju1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In the ovary, both CEBPA and CEBPB are expressed in follicular granulosa cells, dynamically regulated by gonadotropins, and essential for follicular development, efficient ovulation and luteal differentiation. In particular, CEBPB is a downstream effector of the LH signaling pathway in granulosa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001334-Sterneck1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The absence of significant levels of CEBPA and CEBPB in theca cells combined with the importance of these factors in mediating LH-triggered events in granulosa cells suggested the possibility that another member of the family may substitute for their function in theca cells. Therefore, we investigated the expression and function of CEBPD in the ovary.</p><p><italic>Cebpd</italic> (C/EBPdelta, CELF, CRP3, NFIL-6beta) was first characterized as an acute phase inflammatory response gene.

We used an ovulation protocol in which mice were treated with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) to stimulate the coordinated development of multiple pre-ovulatory follicles, followed two days later by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to mimic the ovulatory surge of LH. Northern blot analysis of whole ovary RNA revealed a highly restricted temporal expression pattern for <italic>Cebpd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001334-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Expression of <italic>Cebpd</italic> mRNA was minimal prior to hCG treatment, but was highly induced 2&#x02013;3 hours following hCG, before returning to pre-hCG levels by 6 hours where it remained through 8 hours. Similar data were obtained by Western analysis of whole ovary protein extracts (data not shown). Expression of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (<italic>Ptgs2</italic>, a.k.a.

This expression was localized in the theca cell layer of follicles of varying sizes as well as in the stromal compartment. No evidence of granulosa cell expression was observed in any preparation. To better characterize <italic>Cebpd</italic> expression within the stroma, immunohistochemistry was performed. The anti-CEBPD rabbit polyclonal antibody detected nuclear CEBPD protein expression in theca and interstitial cells specifically in wild-type ovarian tissue but not in <italic>Cebpd</italic> knockout control tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001334-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). As seen with <italic>Cebpd</italic> mRNA, maximal protein levels were observed 3 h after hCG treatment. However, 7 h following hCG-adminstration to mice CEBPD protein was still detected in interstitial cells, but less so in theca cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001334-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Thus, immunohistochemistry revealed expression kinetics that were not evident by analysis of whole ovary mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001334-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) or protein extracts (data not shown).

In the ovary, CEBPA and CEBPB play key roles in the LH response of the follicle. <italic>Cebpa</italic> is widely and constitutively expressed in the rat ovary. <italic>Cebpa</italic> expression levels do not change dramatically upon hormone stimulation, and localize mostly to the granulosa cells and theca cells of preovulatory follicles, with the highest levels in cumulus cells. On the other hand <italic>Cebpb</italic> expression is rapidly and highly induced by hCG mainly in granulosa cells. Knockdown and targeted mutations have shown that both CEBPA and CEBPB are important for ovulation and <italic>Cebpb</italic>-deficient mice are sterile presumably due to a granulosa cell defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001334-Sterneck1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. We used a combination of expression studies and genetic analysis to assess the function of CEBPD in the mouse ovary. We found that in contrast to CEBPA and CEBPB, the CEBPD protein does not have a critical or non-redundant role in the ovary. However, expression of the <italic>Cebpd</italic> gene is acutely responsive to the LH surge in a select group of interstitial cells within the ovarian stroma and in theca cells of follicles. The diversity of cell type and hormone-response specific expression of different <italic>Cebp</italic> genes demonstrates that this gene family has been exploited in evolution to contribute to the development of the ovary by providing unique functions for its variety of cell types. Interestingly, expression of CEBPD in theca cells is not restricted to pre-ovulatory follicles but was seen at all stages of follicular development, beginning with primary follicles. In the stroma, we observed that most alpha smooth muscle actin containing regions harbor CEBPD-expressing cells, and were thus identified as early responders to LH/hCG. To our knowledge, the only other transcription factor gene previously reported as activated by LH/hCG specifically in theca cells, is the zinc finger protein gonadotropin-inducible transcription factor 1 (<italic>Giot1</italic>). However, activation of Giot1 was detected only in theca interna cells and was not observed in interstitial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001334-Mizutani1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Remarkably, loss of CEBPD did not have a detrimental effect on thecal cell function, as might be expected, if it was essential for LH-induced steroidogenesis (which is critical for follicular steroidogenesis) or thecal cell development. However, it is possible that loss of CEBPD was compensated by one of the other CEBPs. For example, <italic>Cebpe</italic> mRNA is detectable in whole ovary RNA, but its hormonal regulation or cellular distribution has not yet been characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001334-Sterneck1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A role for CEBPB in down regulation of <italic>Cebpd</italic> mRNA levels was also observed after its initial activation by hCG. <italic>Cebpb</italic> is mainly expressed in the inner follicular mass of granulosa cells. While we cannot rule out a direct effect of low levels of CEBPB within theca/interstitial cells as the primary mechanism for the observed decline in <italic>Cebpd</italic> mRNA levels, it is tempting to speculate that thecal <italic>Cebpd</italic> expression is regulated by juxtacrine/endocrine factors from the granulosa cell compartment. A number of cytokines, including several members of the EGF family, which are induced in the granulosa layer by LH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001334-Richards1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001334-Park1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, are dramatically downregulated in <italic>Cebpb</italic> null ovaries (L.K.C., E.S., unpublished data) and, therefore, represent candidate feedback signals.</p><p>The observation that the <italic>Cebpd</italic> gene is not essential for fertility in mice, does not rule out that the protein participates in ovarian gene regulation. Therefore, misexpression or overactivity of CEBPD could impact ovarian function in adverse ways. In humans, hyperactivity of the theca/interstitial compartment is associated with PCOS. In the present study, we evaluated <italic>Cebpd</italic> levels in PCOS patient derived theca cells. Our results indicate that <italic>Cebpd</italic> expression was elevated in theca cells that are producing androgen and are in agreement with the chronically elevated androgen levels and <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> gene expression seen in PCOS theca cells. However, our data are in contrast to an array-based expression analysis of biopsies, which reports 2-fold lower levels of <italic>Cebpd</italic> expression in PCOS tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001334-Jansen1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. There are several potential reasons for this discrepancy. The cultured cells used here were derived from the theca layer of 5&#x02013;6 mm follicles of both normal and PCOS women, while the biopsies were random and therefore of varying cell type composition that could be quite heterogeneous. In contrast, the cultured theca cells from normal and PCOS women would be more homogenous and comparable cell populations, and cultured cells are known to maintain some of their <italic>in vivo</italic> characteristics unique to PCOS such as elevated <italic>Cyp17a1</italic>. However, the potential effect of culture conditions affecting gene expression patterns can not be discounted either. Because of the relatively small number of samples in this analysis we primarily conclude that <italic>Cebpd</italic> expression in theca cells is not specific to mice but also true for human cells. Our present results lend support but far from confirm that CEBPD is possibly elevated in thecal cells of PCOS women.</p><p>In summary, our data show that the <italic>Cebpd</italic> gene is rapidly induced by LH/hCG in theca cells of primary follicles through pre-ovulatory follicles as well as in interstitial cells. This observation demonstrates some common characteristics in the hormonal regulation between these cell populations. The data also suggest that in contrast to CEBPA and CEBPB, CEBPD function is not directly related to the ovulation process, but may rather have a role in the broad endocrine activity of the theca/interstitial compartment, or possibly the inflammatory response associated with ovulation. The physiologic/developmental role of LH/hCG responsive cells within the ovarian stroma compartment is presently not understood. CEBPD can be a useful marker for the early response of the theca/interstitial compartment to LH/hCG and may help to further characterize these ovarian cell types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>The generation of mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) with targeted deletion of <italic>Cebpd</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001334-Sterneck2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>Cebpb</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001334-Sterneck3">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> has been described previously.
