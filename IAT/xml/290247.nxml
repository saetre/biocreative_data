It changes the topology of DNA in chromatin and protein-free DNA through the introduction of positive supercoils. The sequence and structure specificities of DEK&#x02013;DNA interactions are not completely understood. The binding of DEK to DNA is not sequence specific, but we describe here that DEK has a clear preference for supercoiled and four-way junction DNA. In the presence of topoisomerase II, DEK stimulates intermolecular catenation of circular DNA molecules. DEK also increases the probability of intermolecular ligation of linear DNA molecules by DNA ligase. These binding properties qualify DEK as an architectural protein.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chromatin is involved in the regulation of all nuclear processes, most prominently transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c3">3</xref>), replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c4">4</xref>), recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c5">5</xref>) and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c6">6</xref>). In recent years, two fundamental principles have emerged that form the basis for interchangeable chromatin structures corresponding to distinct functional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c7">7</xref>). First, the interactions of the histone N-terminal tails can be modulated through post-translational modifications, notably acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation, as well as ubiquitination and ADP-ribosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c8">8</xref>). These modifications seem to have profound effects on histone&#x02013;DNA interactions and the binding of regulatory proteins. Secondly, chromatin-remodeling factors alter histone&#x02013;DNA interactions such that nucleosomal DNA becomes more accessible to interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c9">9</xref>). In addition, architectural proteins such as the high mobility group (HMG) proteins that typically lack the potential to activate transcription or carry out recombination on their own induce conformational changes in the DNA and facilitate the assembly and activity of multiprotein&#x02013;DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c10">10</xref>).</p><p>We have identified the proto-oncogene protein DEK as a protein that influences chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c12">12</xref>). The DEK protein was initially identified in a fusion with the CAN nucleoporin in a subtype of acute myeloid leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c13">13</xref>). Furthermore, autoantigens to DEK have been detected in human diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c16">16</xref>), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c17">17</xref>) and sarcoidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c15">15</xref>). Interestingly, DEK has also been linked to ataxia telangiectasia (ATM), as a fragment of <italic>dek</italic> cDNA reverses the mutagen-sensitive phenotype of cells from ATM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c18">18</xref>). In spite of these clinical observations, the biological function of DEK remains unclear.</p><p>The activity of the DEK protein seems to be regulated by protein&#x02013;protein interactions as well as through binding to RNA and chromatin. Thus DEK could be involved in tethering different proteins to chromatin. By co-fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation, it was demonstrated that the transcriptional co-repressor hDaxx associates with DEK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c19">19</xref>). How ever, the exact function of DEK in hDaxx-mediated repression, however, is not clear. DEK has also been found to be associated with the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) which is constitutively expressed in Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus latent infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c20">20</xref>). The data indicate that LANA is tethered to chromatin through interaction with the DEK protein and the methyl CpG-binding protein MeCP2. In addition, DEK interacts with the celltype-specific transcription factor AP-2&#x003b1; <italic>in vitro</italic> and stimulates the transactivation activity of AP-2&#x003b1; over the APOE promotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c21">21</xref>).</p><p>Two reports suggested that DEK may be involved in RNA metabolism and that DEK occurred in an &#x0223c;335 kDa exon junction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c23">23</xref>). However, recent experiments could not confirm these data, and a function for DEK in RNA metabolism remains to be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c26">26</xref>).</p><p>Our recent data show that the main fraction of DEK is associated with chromatin <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that DEK is a constituent of oligonucleosomes, generated by micrococcal nuclease digestion of chromatin in isolated nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c27">27</xref>). Association of DEK with metaphase chromosomes has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c28">28</xref>). Purified DEK changes the topology of DNA in viral minichromosomes and reduces the accessibility of chromatin to DNA-binding factors including components of the replication machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c11">11</xref>). The DEK-induced change in topology is due to the introduction of positive supercoils into the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c12">12</xref>).</p><p>DEK does not belong to a known family of proteins. Apart from four stretches of acidic amino acids, the only recognizable feature is a homology to a DNA-binding motif, the SAF (scaffold attachment factor) box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c30">30</xref>) also termed the SAP domain (after <underline>S</underline>AF-A/B, <underline>a</underline>cinus and <underline>P</underline>IAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c31">31</xref>) between amino acids 149 and 183 of the DEK protein. It has been described that DEK binds to DNA and specifically recognizes the peri-<italic>ets</italic> (pets) sites in the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c34">34</xref>). However, Alexiadis <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c11">11</xref>) have shown that DEK changes the topology of different chromatin templates, independently of the underlying DNA sequence. To further characterize the DEK&#x02013;DNA interaction, we used substrates with different sequences and structures. We found that DEK binds preferentially to supercoiled and cruciform DNA and that it brings different DNA molecules into close proximity. However, we have no evidence for sequence-specific binding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of GST&#x02013;DEK</title><p>The DEK gene was cloned in the pGEX3 vector (Pharmacia) to generate a GST fusion protein.

Electron micrographs were taken with a Zeiss EM 900 electron microscope.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>DEK binds to and changes the topology of DNA without sequence specificity</title><p>To determine whether DEK binds to different DNA sequences, we used EMSA. SV40 DNA, HK-plasmid DNA and Litmus-plasmid DNA were incubated with increasing amounts of DEK. The resulting nucleoprotein complexes were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f1">1</xref>A). The data of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f1">1</xref> show that DEK binds to all three DNAs with similar efficiency, although with a marked preference for supercoiled DNA (see later). We have also used the different DNAs as substrates in a topology assay incubating supercoiled DNA with DEK and topoisomerase I. The deproteinized DNA was then separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f1">1</xref>B). We found that DEK changes the topology of the three templates tested, independent of the underlying DNA sequence.</p><p>Although no sequence specificity could be detected with these DNAs, it is conceivable that DEK has a higher affinity for the pets sequence as used by Fu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c34">34</xref>) and Faulkner <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c32">32</xref>) compared with a random DNA sequence. The pets sequence is a TG-rich element found between the two Elf-1-binding sites in the HIV-2 enhancer. As a control, we used the same mutated pets sequence that has been used by Fu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c34">34</xref>). In this sequence, three bases differ from the wild-type sequence. Both oligonucleotides were labeled and incubated with increasing amounts of purified DEK protein, and nucleoprotein complexes were analyzed on native polyacrylamide gels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f2">2</xref>A). We found that DEK binds with similar efficiency to the wild-type and the mutated pets sequence. To further investigate these data, we performed competition experiments, and added increasing amounts of either non-labeled wild-type or mutated pets sequence to the standard reaction just shown. Binding to the labeled pets oligonucleotide was competed at an excess of 50-fold competitor DNA of either the pets sequence itself (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f2">2</xref>B lanes 3&#x02013;6) or the mutated pets sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f2">2</xref>B, lanes 7&#x02013;10). The same ratio was obtained when we used the mutated pets sequence for DEK binding. Again binding was competed at a 50-fold excess of competitor of both the pets sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f2">2</xref>B, lanes 13&#x02013;16) and the mutated oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f2">2</xref>B, lanes 17&#x02013;20). Identical results were obtained by using GST-tagged or His-tagged DEK protein (data not shown). Thus, these data show that DEK has no preference for the pets sequences of the HIV enhancer. This is clearly in contrast to the data of Fu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c34">34</xref>), and we presently cannot explain this discrepancy.</p></sec><sec><title>DEK binds preferentially to negatively supercoiled and cruciform DNA</title><p>The EMSA experiment in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f1">1</xref>A indicated that DEK binds preferentially to negatively supercoiled DNA, provided that relaxed and supercoiled DNA are present within the same sample. To further investigate the binding of DEK to DNAs of different topologies, we incubated DEK with either supercoiled and relaxed DNA, supercoiled and linear DNA or relaxed and linear DNA in the same assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f3">3</xref>). The EMSA with supercoiled and relaxed DNA revealed a clear preference of DEK for form I DNA because the entire supercoiled DNA was shifted, whereas no significant shift was observed with relaxed DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f3">3</xref>, lane 2). The same result was obtained when supercoiled and linear DNA was present in the same reaction. Again, the entire supercoiled DNA was shifted by DEK, whereas only a minimal shift was observed with linear DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f3">3</xref>, lane 4). However, when relaxed and linear DNAs were used together, both templates were shifted with similar efficiency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f3">3</xref>, lane 6). The clear preference for supercoiled DNA was also obvious when all three templates were present in the same reaction. In this case, the entire supercoiled DNA was shifted, but none of the relaxed and linear DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f3">3</xref>, lane 8).</p><p>The preferential binding of DEK to supercoiled DNA could be an indication that DEK recognizes unusual DNA forms such as cruciform DNA. The classical experiment to test this is the binding to 4WJ DNA as found in the Holliday junction DNA of intermediates in homologous genetic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c36">36</xref>). Accordingly, we used five different single-stranded oligonucleotides which were annealed to form either duplex DNA or cruciform DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f4">4</xref>A and B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c37">37</xref>). The <sup>32</sup>P-labeled DNA substrates were incubated with increasing amounts of DEK and analyzed on a native polyacrylamide gel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f4">4</xref>C). We found that DEK binds to both DNA substrates although with different efficiencies. Low DEK/DNA ratios were sufficient to shift the entire 4WJ DNA, whereas at least 4-fold higher DEK/DNA ratios were required to shift the duplex DNA.</p><p>To confirm these data, we performed competition experiments. Binding to labeled duplex DNA was competed with increasing amounts of either unlabeled 4WJ DNA or duplex DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f5">5</xref>A). Whereas binding to duplex DNA was competed already at a 50-fold excess of 4WJ DNA as competitor, almost a 1000-fold excess of duplex DNA was necessary to eliminate binding to the labeled duplex DNA. When labeled 4WJ DNA was used as substrate, binding could not be competed even with a 1000-fold excess of cold duplex DNA and was significantly reduced at a 500-fold excess of competing 4WJ DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f5">5</xref>B). These data demonstrate that DEK binds with higher preference to cruciform DNA compared with duplex DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>DEK stimulates intermolecular interactions</title><p>The binding behavior of DEK to DNA resembles that of architectural proteins such as the HMG proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c38">38</xref>). For example, the HMGB1 protein preferentially binds to supercoiled over linear or nicked closed circular DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c39">39</xref>) and is also able to manipulate DNA by looping, compaction and changes in DNA topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c42">42</xref>). To gain further insights into DEK&#x02013;DNA interactions, we investigated the binding of DEK to circular DNA by electron microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f6">6</xref>A). We detected a population of molecules (&#x0223c;5&#x00025;) containing two or more DNA molecules with multiple DNA loops connected at a protein bead in addition to large complexes with many looped DNA molecules of variable size. These data indicate that DEK brings different DNA molecules into close proximity, and thereby increases the local concentration of DNA.</p><p>To test whether DEK stimulates intermolecular interactions between circular DNA molecules, we incubated supercoiled SV40 DNA with increasing amounts of DEK and topoisomerase II (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f6">6</xref>B). Topoisomerase II is known to induce double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c43">43</xref>), and could induce the formation of catenated DNA from closely adjacent DNA circles. We found indeed that topoisomerase II converted DNA circles into large structures that were not able to enter the gel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f6">6</xref>B, lanes 3&#x02013;5). These large DNA structures were most probably catenanes because topoisomerase II could resolve them into circular monomers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f6">6</xref>B, lane 7).</p><p>We finally show that DEK stimulates the intermolecular end-to-end joining of linear DNA molecules by DNA ligase. For this purpose <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 123 bp DNA fragments with cohesive ends were incubated with increasing amounts of DEK and treated with T4 DNA ligase. Increasing concentrations of DEK favored the formation of linear multimers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f6">6</xref>C). To discriminate between linear and circular DNA, the deproteinized DNA was digested with exonuclease III (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f6">6</xref>C, lanes 3 and 6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c44">44</xref>). All reaction products were sensitive to exonuclease III, indicating that DEK does not bend the DNA fragment but stimulates intermolecular end-to-end joining.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We found that DEK exhibits distinctive structure-specific rather than sequence-specific DNA binding properties. In contrast to published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c34">34</xref>), our results do not support a sequence-specific binding mode of DEK. We found that DEK is able to bind to and change the topology of different DNA substrates. More specifically, we show that DEK binds with similar efficiency to the pets sequence and the mutated pets sequence. Binding to the pets sequences could be competed equally well with both the specific pets sequence and the mutated sequence, and vice versa. These results contradict the data of Fu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c34">34</xref>) who claimed a specific binding of DEK to the pets sequences. The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear; however, we believe that their competition experiment with the labeled pets sequence competed with the unlabeled pets oligonucleotide or an unrelated HIV-2 &#x003ba;B oligonucleotide was inconclusive &#x0005b;fig. 7 of Fu and Markovitz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c33">33</xref>)&#x0005d;. Our present data agree with the previous findings of Alexiadis <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c11">11</xref>), who had shown that changes in chromatin topology occur independently of the DNA sequence. Thus, we conclude that the underlying DNA sequence is not a critical determinant for DEK&#x02013;DNA interaction.</p><p>In fact, the structure of the DNA could be a more important parameter that determines the interaction of DEK with DNA. In support of this, we report here that DEK has a strong preference for negatively supercoiled DNA compared with relaxed or linear DNA, and that the element recognized by DEK could be a 4WJ DNA. The 4WJ (Holliday junction) DNA was initially proposed as the central intermediate in homologous genetic recombination; it is also involved in replication-related events. Furthermore, binding to 4WJ DNA seems to be a common property of architectural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c38">38</xref>) as shown, for example, for the HMG proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c46">46</xref>), the linker histone H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c47">47</xref>) or the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c48">48</xref>). It has also been reported that the chromatin-remodeling complex SWI/SNF preferentially binds to 4WJ DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c49">49</xref>). Binding and competition experiments demonstrated that DEK binds preferentially to 4WJ DNA compared with duplex DNA.</p><p>At least some of the binding properties of DEK are reminiscent of the HMGB1 and HMGB2 proteins &#x0005b;old name: HMG 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c50">50</xref>)&#x0005d;. They bind DNA without sequence specificity but have a high affinity for bent or distorted DNA such as 4WJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c46">46</xref>). They also bind to crossovers in supercoiled DNA and can cause looping of linear DNA. HMGB1 and 2 play important architectural roles in the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes in a variety of biological processes, e.g. V(D)J recombination and the initiation of transcription. A function in DNA repair has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c51">51</xref>).</p><p>We have observed that DEK stimulates the intermolecular end-to-end joining of linear DNA molecules in the presence of DNA ligase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f6">6</xref>C). Increasing concentrations of DEK favored the formation of linear multimers but did not induce circularization of the substrate, as observed with the HMG protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c44">44</xref>). We also found that DEK promoted the formation of catenated DNA molecules in the presence of topoisomerase II (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f6">6</xref>B). The same properties were observed for the cohesin complex, which consists of a heterodimeric pair of SMC proteins and at least two non-SMC subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c52">52</xref>). Cohesin functions as a molecular cross-linker and holds sister chromatids together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c53">53</xref>). Whether DEK is involved in such a kind of chromatin organization has yet to be investigated.</p><p>It has been postulated that proteins which bind to 4WJs all perform a particular kind of architectural role <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c38">38</xref>). In most cases studied, the non-specific binders induce DNA looping and change the topology of circular closed DNA molecules, in both a negative and positive orientation. These are precisely the properties of DEK: it promotes the looping of DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f6">6</xref>A) and induces positive supercoils into protein-free DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c12">12</xref>). The mechanism of DEK-induced positive supercoiling is not known. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that DEK caused no shortening of DNA molecules, excluding a wrapping of the DNA around DEK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c12">12</xref>). Another possibility is that protein&#x02013;protein interactions between DNA-bound DEK molecules cause a change in helical twist by bending the DNA and thus introducing positive supercoils (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg864f6">6</xref>A). Further studies are necessary to clarify the exact mechanism.</p><p>The function of DEK <italic>in vivo</italic> is not yet known, but its structure-specific binding strongly resembles those of architectural proteins. The DNA entering and exiting from the nucleosome, which shows structural similarity to 4WJ DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c54">54</xref>), provides possible DEK-binding sites. Whatever the precise function of DEK may be, it seems to be required in many physiological states, because we see no significant changes in the amount of chromatin-bound DEK throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg864c27">27</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg864f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> EMSA and topology assay with different DNA sequences.
