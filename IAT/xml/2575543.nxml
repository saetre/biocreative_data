The bitransgenic tumours were less organised, had more mitotic figures and fewer apoptotic cells. However, many bitransgenic tumours displayed areas of extensive necrosis compared with tumours from MMTV-c-ErbB2 mice. The two tumour types demonstrate dramatically different expression and activation of EGFR family members, as well as different metabolic profiles. c-ErbB2 tumours demonstrate overexpression of EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4, and activation/phosphorylation of both ErbB2 and ErbB3, underscoring the importance of the entire EGFR family in ErbB2-induced tumourigenesis. Tumours from bitransgenic mice overexpress the myr-Akt1 and ErbB2 transgenes, but there was dramatically less overexpression and phosphorylation of ErbB3, diminished phosphorylation of ErbB2, decreased level of EGFR protein and undetectable ErbB4 protein. There was also an observable attenuation in a subset of tyrosine-phosphorylated secondary signalling molecules in the bitransgenic tumours compared with c-ErbB2 tumours, but Erk was activated/phosphorylated in both tumour types. Finally, the bitransgenic tumours were metabolically more active as indicated by increased glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression, elevated lactate production and decreased intracellular glucose (suggesting increased glycolysis).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Expression of activated Akt1 in MMTV-c-ErbB2 mice accelerates tumourigenesis with a reduced requirement for signalling through the EGFR family, as well as a reduced requirement for a subset of downstream signaling molecules with a metabolic shift in the tumours from bitransgenic mice. The reduction in signalling downstream of ErbB2 when Akt is activated suggest a possible mechanism by which tumour cells can become resistant to ErbB2-targeted therapies, necessitating therapies that target oncogenic signalling events downstream of ErbB2.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The ErbB2/Neu/HER2 oncogene is amplified and overexpressed in 20% to 30% of human breast cancer cases, and expression of ErbB2 is associated with aggressive metastatic tumour behaviour, decreased time to clinical relapse and poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The importance of c-ErbB2 in mammary tumourigenesis was further established through a study of transgenic mice that expressed either activated ErbB2 (Neu-NT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] or non-activated c-ErbB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Activated ErbB2-induced tumours in male and female mice have an average time to tumour appearance of 114 and 89 days, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], while expression of non-activated c-ErbB2 in the mammary gland of transgenic mice resulted in tumour formation in female mice in 150 to 300 days, with the latency depending on the founder line examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The most extensively investigated transgenic line to date is the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV)-c-ErbB2 line 202 female mice in which adenocarcinomas appear with an average latency of 205 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Overexpression of c-ErbB2 mRNA and protein, elevated c-ErbB2 kinase activity and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins was observed in tumour tissue, but not in normal mammary tissue from the same mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Protein levels of ErbB3 and tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 are increased in mammary tumours from transgenic mice expressing activated ErbB2 (Neu-DL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], suggesting that ErbB2 and ErbB3 function as an oncogenic unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Holbro <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] demonstrated that loss of either functional ErbB2 or ErbB3 results in a loss of tumour cell proliferation even though ErbB3 does not possess an active tyrosine kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. ErbB3 phosphorylation activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream target, Akt, thus providing a possible mechanism for the requirement for both ErbB2 and ErbB3 in stimulating mammary tumourigenesis. This gives rise to the hypothesis that expression of activated Akt could compensate for the expression of ErbB3 in ErbB2-induced mammary tumours.</p><p>Our group and others have demonstrated that expression of activated Akt1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] or overexpression of non-activated Akt1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] can delay mammary gland involution. In spite of the fact that Akt was discovered as an oncogene which induces leukaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], mammary tumours were not observed in these transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Hutchinson <italic>et al. </italic>demonstrated that activated Akt1 could accelerate mammary tumourigenesis in transgenic mice that express activated ErbB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Similarly, deletion of one or both alleles of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a negative regulator of Akt signalling, accelerates tumour induction in another ErbB2 mouse mammary tumour model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the current study, we demonstrate that transgenic expression of activated Akt1 can accelerate mammary tumourigenesis in the MMTV-c-ErbB2 mice. However, we observe a significant attenuation of tyrosine kinase signalling in tumours from the bitransgenic MMTV-myr-Akt1, MMTV-c-ErbB2 animals compared with tumours from the MMTV-c-ErbB2 animals, particularly with regard to ErbB3 and Src. These results have implications for human ErbB2-positive tumours that may also have high levels of activated Akt, whether due to the loss of the tumour suppressor PTEN or mutations in either PI3K or Akt.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice lines</title><p>The MMTV-c-ErbB2 (line 202) transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME.

One possible means by which expression of myr-Akt1 could accelerate tumourigenesis in the MMTV-c-ErbB2 mice would be to bypass the apparent requirement for mutation of rat <italic>c-ERBB2</italic>. However, analysis of the tumours that appeared in the bitransgenic mice indicated that these tumours also contain the activating mutations in the rat <italic>c-ERBB2 </italic>allele (data not shown).</p><p>Tumour histology was evaluated using haematoxylin and eosin stained sections. The histology of the c-ErbB2 tumours was consistent with previous descriptions: they are solid tumours composed of uniformly sized and shaped cells with small stroma and no evidence of myoepithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Staining of tumours from the bitransgenic animals revealed two different types of tumours: those similar to c-ErbB2 tumours with a solid, uniform architecture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>); and the second type of tumour demonstrated necrosis in areas of the tumour 10 to 20 cells away from vasculature, consistent with a tumour that outgrows its blood supply (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d, e</xref>). Very little necrosis is ever observed in tumours derived from MMTV-c-ErbB2 mice.</p><p>After initial detection, tumour volumes were determined by measuring the tumour dimensions with calipers to estimate tumour volume (volume = (length &#x000d7; width &#x000d7; width)/2). A comparison of tumour growth in mice of both genotypes revealed that tumour volume increased two to three times faster in the bitransgenic mice compared with tumours in the MMTV-c-ErbB2 transgenic mice (data not shown). The increased growth rate of tumours in the bitransgenic mice could result from either increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis or both. Measurement of the apoptotic rates in both tumour types by activated caspase-3 immunohistochemistry demonstrates that the tumours from the bitransgenic animals have an apoptotic rate half that of the tumours derived from the MMTV-c-ErbB2 animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref>). The rate of proliferation, determined by quantitating the number of mitotic figures in tumour sections, demonstrated that tumours from bitransgenic animals had a higher proliferation rate than tumours from MMTV-c-ErbB2 animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1g</xref>). Thus, the bitransgenic animals rapidly develop mammary tumours with a low rate of apoptosis and high rate of proliferation compared with the tumours from MMTV-c-ErbB2 animals, and at least half of these bitransgenic tumours exhibit extensive necrosis.</p><p>The expression of the transgenes was examined at the protein level in tumours (T) and normal mammary gland control (N) taken from tumour-bearing mice of both the MMTV-c-ErbB2 and MMTV-c-ErbB2, MMTV-myr-Akt1 genotypes.

Immunoblotting with an anti-ErbB2 antibody demonstrated that the level of ErbB2 protein was dramatically increased in tumours of both origins compared with normal mammary tissue from the same mouse, from FVB mice or from myr-Akt1 transgenic mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Tumours from bitransgenic MMTV-myr-Akt1, MMTV-c-ErbB2 mice and MMTV-c-ErbB2 mice overexpress ErbB2 and phosphorylated Akt.

Equal amounts of total protein was loaded per lane to a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride and probed with the following antibodies: <bold>(a) </bold>anti-ErbB2; <bold>(b) </bold>anti-HA to detect the HA epitope-tagged myr-Akt1 transgene; <bold>(c) </bold>anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473); <bold>(d) </bold>anti-pan-Akt; and <bold>(e) </bold>anti-&#x003b2;-actin to demonstrate equal loading of the gel.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bcr2132-2"/></fig><p>Expression of the HA-tagged myr-Akt1 transgene was only detected in tumour tissue from the bitransgenic animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). The myr-Akt1 transgene in the bitransgenic tumours was phosphorylated at Ser473, indicating enzymatic activity, and can be distinguished from endogenous Akt because the myr-Akt1 transgene has a higher molecular weight (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). Akt was also phosphorylated in c-ErbB2 tumours, consistent with previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). Immunoblot using anti-pan-Akt antibody demonstrates expression of endogenous Akt in both tumour types with the c-ErbB2 tumours expressing more Akt than the bitransgenic tumours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). An immunoblot with anti-&#x003b2;-actin antibody demonstrates equal sample loading (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e</xref>). All immunoblot data presented in the present study is representative of all tumour and normal gland pairs examined (n = 5 for c-ErbB2 and n = 7 for bitransgenic). The different levels of proteins expressed in tumour tissue versus normal tissue is probably due to both a difference in selective pressures brought on by tumourigenesis and a dramatic increase in epithelial cell content in tumour tissue: the virgin mammary gland is predominantly adipocytes and tumour tissue is predominantly epithelial in nature.</p></sec><sec><title>Diminished overexpression and activation of EGFR family members in tumours from bitransgenic animals</title><p>Mammary tumours from transgenic mice expressing activated mutants of ErbB2 also express elevated levels of total and tyrosine-phosphorylated ErbB2 and ErbB3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

The extent of activating phosphorylation of ErbB2 was lower in the bitransgenic tumours than in the c-ErbB2 tumours, demonstrated by using phosphospecific antibodies to two different phosphorylation sites in ErbB2, Tyr877 and Tyr1248 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a, b</xref>).

The amount of Tyr416-phosphorylated Src present in the c-ErbB2 tumours was dramatically increased in comparison to the bitransgenic tumours and normal tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>), even though the bitransgenic tumours express more total Src than the c-ErbB2 tumours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>).

Gab2 is a scaffolding protein that can recruit the p85 subunit of PI3K when it is phosphorylated at Tyr452 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] which in turn activates PH-domain containing proteins such as Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The levels of Gab2 protein are elevated in both c-ErbB2 tumours and bitransgenic tumours compared with normal gland controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>), although the level is slightly higher in c-ErbB2 tumours than bitransgenic tumours. The amount of Tyr452-phosphorylated Gab2 is dramatically higher in the c-ErbB2 tumours compared with the bitransgenic tumours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>) suggesting that expression of activated Akt1 in the bitransgenic animals attenuates phosphorylation of Gab2 and subsequent docking of PI3K, which occurs in c-ErbB2 animals.</p><p>It has recently been demonstrated that another secondary signalling molecule, ShcA, is required for ErbB2-mediated tumourigenesis and phosphorylation of Tyr313 in ShcA may be important for tumour cell survival, while phosphorylation of Tyr239/240 may be important for tumour vascularisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. c-ErbB2 tumours and bitransgenic tumours both demonstrate expression of ShcA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4g</xref>), particularly the p52 and the p46 isoforms while the p66 isoform was barely detectable. Both tumour types also appear to have similar levels of Tyr239/240-phosphorylated ShcA (with the bitransgenic tumours having slightly less phosphorylation than the c-ErbB2 tumours), indicating that activities regulated by phosphorylation of this site (perhaps in angiogenesis) are important in both tumour types (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4f</xref>). However, the difference in phosphorylation of ShcA at Tyr313 is more dramatic between the two tumour types (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>), with the c-ErbB2 tumours having more ShcA phosphorylated at Tyr313 than the bitransgenic tumours suggesting that activities regulated by phosphorylation of this site (cell survival) may be less important in the tumours that express activated Akt1.</p><p>Oncogenic signalling often activates the Erk pathway, which is a known mediator of cell proliferation, cell survival, angiogenesis and cell migration (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]). Dual phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 (corresponding to Thr183 and Tyr185 of human Erk2) in the activation loop results in catalytic activation of kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Despite the attenuation of several signalling events in the bitransgenic tumours when compared with the c-ErbB2 tumours as discussed above, both tumour types maintain similar levels of phosphorylated/activated Erk (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4h</xref>) indicating that transgenic activation of Akt1 does not bypass Erk signalling. Normal gland controls demonstrate various levels of Erk activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression/activation of cell cycle control proteins in bitransgenic tumours</title><p>The decrease in the tumour latency observed in the bitransgenic tumours would predict that there would be a change in the expression/modification of cell cycle control proteins in the bitransgenic tumours compared with the c-ErbB2 tumours. Phosphorylation of Rb by active cyclin-dependent kinases inactivates Rb activity and is an important regulatory step in cell cycle entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Immunoblot analysis with a phospho-specific antibody against Rb (Ser780) demonstrated Rb phosphorylation in tumour lysates from both genotypes of mice and not in the normal tissue from the same mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). The extent of Rb phosphorylation was greater in the c-ErbB2 tumours than in the bitransgenic tumours. This is surprising because the bitransgenic tumours have a shorter tumour latency and greater mitotic index which we predicted would correlate with more Rb phosphorylation and a more active cell cycle. However, Hutchinson <italic>et al. </italic>observed a similar phenomenon in their study: the NDL2 tumours (activated ErbB2) demonstrated a higher level of Ser780-phosphorylated Rb than the bitransgenic NDL2/Akt1DD tumours even though the bitransgenic animals had a shorter tumour latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The total amount of Rb is almost the same in all tumours examined indicating differences observed in Rb phosphorylation are not in fact due to differences in total Rb levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>MMTV-c-ErbB2 tumours demonstrate different cell cycle proteins than tumours from bitransgenic MMTV-myr-Akt1, MMTV-c-ErbB2 mice.

Immunoblot analysis revealed cyclin D1 in all samples with the bitransgenic tumours having a higher level of cyclin D1 than normal tissue, but the c-ErbB2 tumours containing more cyclin D1 than the bitransgenic tumours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). This data correlates with the Rb phosphorylation data which is consistent with the role of cyclin D1 in positively regulating cyclin dependent kinase activity and phosphorylation of Rb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The bitransgenic tumours have a shorter latency than the c-ErbB2 tumours, but contain less phosphorylated Rb and less cyclin D1, which led us to examine some cell cycle inhibitors. p15 (INK4b), p27 (Kip1) and p21 (Cip1) are all inhibitors of cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Immunoblot analysis for p15 demonstrated high expression in the c-ErbB2 tumours, a lack of expression in all normal glands and very faint expression in the bitransgenic tumours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>). The expression profile of p27 was similar with a lack of expression in all normal tissue, high expression in c-ErbB2 tumours and slightly lower level of expression in the bitransgenic tumours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5e</xref>). We were unable to detect p53 and p21 in any of the tumour and normal mammary tissue samples, though both were present in an irradiated control gland (data not shown). While c-ErbB2 tumours contain more positive markers of the cell cycle than the bitransgenic tumours (phosphorylated Rb and cyclin D1), they also express more negative regulators of the cell cycle (p15 and p27), which likely serves to balance cell cycle progression.</p></sec><sec><title>An elevated metabolic phenotype in bitransgenic tumours compared with MMTV-c-ErbB2 tumours</title><p>One of the hallmarks of tumours and tumour cell lines is the elevated level of glucose transport to support the high glycolytic rate of tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Myr-Akt1 can stimulate the translocation of the GLUT1 glucose transporter to the cell surface of lymphoid cells cultured in the absence of growth factors as well as increase hexokinase activity, glucose consumption and lactate production, which suggests that Akt stimulates aerobic glycolysis and produces the so-called 'Warburg effect' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Immunoblot analysis demonstrates elevated levels of GLUT1 (the major glucose transporter in cancer cells) in lysates from mammary tumours from both the MMTV-c-ErbB2 and the bitransgenic mice compared with levels in normal glands. However, GLUT1 protein expression was greater in the bitransgenic tumours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>).

The mammary tumours examined in this study are of epithelial cell origin, so the use of mammary tissue from day two of lactation (L2) as a control tissue allows for the comparison of normal epithelium with tumour epithelium, whereas the normal virgin mammary gland is composed mostly of adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Compared with normal L2 tissue, there was a four-fold increase in the amount of lactate in the MMTV-c-ErbB2 tumours and a six-fold increase in the bitransgenic tumours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>) (p &#x0003c; 0.00001 between L2 and both tumours and p &#x0003c; 0.02 between ErbB2 and bitransgenic tumours, all n = 5). This increase in tumour glycolytic activity was accompanied by significantly decreased intratumuor concentrations of glucose: 1.10 nmol/mg in the L2 mammary gland, 0.46 nmol/mg in ErbB2 tumours (p &#x0003c; 0.01) and 0.14 nmol/mg in bitransgenic tumours (p &#x0003c; 0.0004) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>). This indicates high glucose utilisation due to the increased activity of glycolytic enzymes. Thus, the bitransgenic tumours appear to consume more glucose and secrete more lactate than the c-ErbB2 tumours or the normal epithelial cell-enriched lactating mammary gland.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have demonstrated that expression of activated myr-Akt1 in MMTV-c-ErbB2 mice accelerates mammary tumourigenesis. Hutchinson <italic>et al. </italic>used a similar mammary tumourigenesis model using MMTV-NDL2-5 animals (which express activated ErbB2 in the mammary gland) and compared them with bitransgenic MMTV-NDL2-5, MMTV-Akt1DD animals (which express activated ErbB2 and an activated Akt1 gene that contains phosphomimetic mutations of Ser473 and Thr308) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. They found that expression of activated Akt1 accelerated ErbB2-induced tumourigenesis in their NDL2 model. The NDL2/Akt1DD bitransgenic tumours were more differentiated glandular tumours which expressed milk proteins. Expression of activated Akt1 in the MMTV-c-ErbB2 model did not induce more differentiated glandular tumours, but rather accelerated tumour formation often appearing to cause necrosis. Compared with the c-ErbB2 tumours, the bitransgenic tumours demonstrated half the amount of apoptosis and twice the amount of mitosis, suggesting that a decrease of apoptosis and increase in proliferation in the bitransgenic tumours contributed to faster tumour formation. Similar to Hutchinson <italic>et al</italic>., evaluation of apoptosis by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) staining revealed almost no apoptotic cells in any of our tissue samples (data not shown), but evaluation of apoptosis by activated caspase-3 immunohistochemistry identified some apoptotic cells.</p><p>ErbB3, the major EGFR family member that activates the PI3K/Akt pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], is required for ErbB2-induced cancer cell proliferation, transformation and colony formation <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. There is a functional interaction between ErbB2 and ErbB3 in the MMTV-c-ErbB2 mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Activated Src is important for efficient ErbB2/ErbB3 heterocomplex formation and full activation of the ErbB2 kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We have demonstrated that tumourigenesis in the MMTV-c-ErbB2 model proceeds with reduced activation of ErbB2, ErbB3, Src, Gab2 and Shc when activated Akt1 is expressed by transgene. Akt is often activated in cancer cells by the activating mutation of PI3K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], inactivation of PTEN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and, a recently demonstrated mechanism, by mutation of Akt itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Our results demonstrate that Akt activation by any of these means may lead to less dependency on ErbB2/ErbB3 and Src signalling without inhibiting tumourigenesis. It is not clear whether the diminished activation of these signalling molecules reflects a reduced need for them to be activated due to the presence of activated Akt or a negative feedback loop by which activated Akt can suppress activation of ErbB3-dependent signalling.</p><p>Two recent reports studying tumourigenesis in MMTV-ErbB2 mice on an Akt1-/- background highlight the importance of Akt1 in ErbB2-induced tumourigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Both groups used activated ErbB2 models of tumourigenesis in Akt1-/- and Akt+/+ backgrounds and demonstrated the importance of Akt1 in mediating ErbB2-induced tumourigenesis: mice lacking Akt1 either failed to develop tumours or tumourigenesis was delayed. However, while Akt1 is required for efficient tumour formation in MMTV-ErbB2 mouse models, activation of Akt1 alone is not sufficient for mammary tumourigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] indicating that other pathways downstream of ErbB2 activation are important for tumour formation.</p><p>The Erk pathway is activated in many types of cancer and can be activated by numerous oncogenic signals, including ErbB2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4h</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The bitransgenic tumours used in the current study maintained Erk activation (despite the loss of numerous other signalling events), which suggests that Erk signalling is necessary in these tumours. This may be one explanation for why Akt is necessary for ErbB2 tumourigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], but is not sufficient for mammary tumourigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]: activation of Akt alone may fail to activate Erk.</p><p>Most tumour cells rely on increased glycolysis, even in the presence of available oxygen (the Warburg effect). It has been shown that p53, HIF-1 (hypoxia inducible factor 1), c-Myc as well as Akt can all upregulate glycolytic enzymes (often through inhibition of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle) to trigger increased tumour cell glucose consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The increased levels of lactate and reduced concentrations of glucose in both types of tumours in the present study is consistent with an increased glycolytic rate in the tumours, but the bitransgenic tumours contained more lactate and more GLUT1 than the c-ErbB2 tumours. This led to the hypothesis that activation of Akt1 induced aerobic glycolysis in these mammary carcinomas. This may offer another explanation for the accelerated tumour onset in the bitransgenic animals because glycolysis, while inefficient in terms of wasting the full oxidative potential of glucose, is efficient at producing ATP and also generating metabolic byproducts necessary for membrane synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p><p>Human breast carcinomas overexpress ErbB2 in 20% to 30% of cases and patients with this type of tumour bear a poor prognosis and are currently treated with trastuzumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody. Trastuzumab treatment significantly boosts the prognosis for patients with breast tumours that overexpress ErbB2, but the response rate for these patients is about 50% to 60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Nagata <italic>et al. </italic>demonstrated that loss of the PTEN tumour suppressor (which induces Akt activation) predicts resistance to trastuzumab treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. We predict that our bitransgenic animals represent a model of a patient who would be resistant to trastuzumab. Tumours from bitransgenic animals overexpress ErbB2, making them candidates for ErbB2-targeted therapy, but drugs which molecularly target ErbB2 (such as trastuzumab) or ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimers (such as pertuzumab) may be futile because signalling downstream of ErbB2/ErbB3 is already attenuated in bitransgenic animals. If activation of Akt1 in human tumours (which can occur by loss of PTEN function or activating mutation of either PI3K or Akt) is critical to ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells becoming trastuzumab resistant, then evaluation of the activation status of Akt may assist in deciding the prognosis and treatment strategy for breast cancer patients as compared with the current screening that only identifies amplification of ErbB2. Additionally, therapies which molecularly target the Akt pathway may be critical to overcome trastuzumab resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Expression of activated Akt1 in the mammary gland of MMTV-c-ErbB2 mice accelerates tumourigenesis and attenuates signalling events sometimes thought to be critical to tumourigenesis. The bitransgenic tumours also have an accelerated glucose metabolism. Our studies suggest that tumours that overexpress ErbB2 which activate Akt by means of mutating PI3K, PTEN or Akt (rather than via ErbB2/ErbB3 activation of PI3K) may be resistant to ErbB2-targeted therapies. Therefore, therapies which molecularly target signalling events downstream of ErbB2, such as those mediated by Akt, may prove to be valuable.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ANOVA = analysis of variance; Akt1DD = constitutively active Akt1 mutant bearing two phospho-mimetic mutations; EGFR = epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK = extracellular-signal regulated kinase; FVB = inbred mouse strain which was exclusively used in this study; Gab2 = Grb2 associated binding protein 2; GLUT1 = glucose transporter 1; L2 = lactation day 2; HIF1 = Hypoxia inducible factor 1; MMTV = mouse mammary tumour virus; MRS = magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Myr-Akt1 = constitutively active Akt1 mutant bearing the myristolation sequence from Src; NMR = nuclear magnetic resonance; PI3K = phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase; PTEN = phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10; PVDF = polyvinylidene difluoride; Rb = retinoblastoma; SD = standard deviation; SDS-PAGE = sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Shc = Src homology 2 domain-containing transforming protein C1; TMSP = trimethylsilyl propionic-2,2,3,3,-d4 acid.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CDY performed the immunoblot analyses, interpreted data, assembled the figures and drafted the manuscript.
