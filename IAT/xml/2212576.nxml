To identify novel genes regulated by SOX9 we investigated changes in gene expression by microarray analysis following retroviral transduction with <italic>SOX9 </italic>of a human chondrocytic cell line (SW1353). From the results the expression of a group of genes (<italic>SRPX</italic>, <italic>S100A1</italic>, <italic>APOD</italic>, <italic>RGC32</italic>, <italic>CRTL1</italic>, <italic>MYBPH</italic>, <italic>CRLF1 </italic>and <italic>SPINT1</italic>) was evaluated further in human articular chondrocytes (HACs). First, the same genes were investigated in primary cultures of HACs following <italic>SOX9 </italic>transduction, and four were found to be similarly regulated (<italic>SRPX</italic>, <italic>APOD</italic>, <italic>CRTL1 </italic>and <italic>S100A1</italic>). Second, during dedifferentiation of HACs by passage in monolayer cell culture, during which the expression of SOX9 progressively decreased, four of the genes (<italic>S100A1</italic>, <italic>RGC32</italic>, <italic>CRTL1 </italic>and <italic>SPINT1</italic>) also decreased in their expression. Third, in samples of osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage, which had decreased <italic>SOX9 </italic>expression compared with age-matched controls, there was decreased expression of <italic>SRPX, APOD, RGC32, CRTL1 </italic>and <italic>SPINT1</italic>. The results showed that a group of genes identified as being upregulated by SOX9 in the initial SW1353 screen were also regulated in expression in healthy and OA cartilage. Other genes initially identified were differently expressed in isolated OA chondrocytes and their expression was unrelated to changes in SOX9. The results thus identified some genes whose expression appeared to be linked to SOX9 expression in isolated chondrocytes and were also altered during cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The chondrocytes within articular cartilage are responsible for the maintenance of the specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tissue and for its biomechanical properties. The chondrocyte phenotype is characterized by the expression of specific genes, such as collagen type II and the transcription factor <italic>SOX9 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Collagen type II is an abundant component in the cartilage ECM and is essential for its integrity. Damage to collagen type II and loss of other cartilage ECM components occur during degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA), which result in severe disability and present a major health problem in the ageing population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This may arise from complex pathogenic mechanisms, which result in decreased matrix synthesis and upregulated pathways of tissue degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Characteristic of cartilage in OA are changes in the expression of ECM genes and the downregulation of the key chondrogenic transcription factor <italic>SOX9 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>A large number of cartilage matrix genes have been shown to come under the transcriptional control of <italic>SOX9</italic>. They include <italic>COL2A1</italic>, <italic>COL9A1</italic>, <italic>COL11A2</italic>, aggrecan and cartilage link protein (<italic>CRTL1</italic>) genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], all of which play important roles in articular cartilage structure and function. Furthermore, <italic>SOX9 </italic>is expressed in presumptive cartilage during embryo development, and mutations in the human <italic>SOX9 </italic>gene, which result in haploinsufficiency of SOX9, cause campomelic dysplasia with skeletal malformation and dwarfism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Moreover, mice chimaeras containing both wild-type and <italic>SOX9</italic>-null cells develop normally, but there is no contribution by the <italic>SOX9</italic>-null cells towards cartilage formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The expression of <italic>SOX9 </italic>declines rapidly in chondrocytes that are isolated and cultured in monolayer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and this is accompanied by a reduction in the expression of cartilage matrix genes such as <italic>COL2A1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Overexpression of <italic>SOX9 </italic>in human chondrocytes passaged in culture increases <italic>COL2A1 </italic>expression and increases their capacity to reform a cartilage ECM when placed in chondrogenic culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In view of the importance of <italic>SOX9 </italic>in the development and maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype, its down regulation in OA is clearly likely to contribute to cartilage pathology. We investigated <italic>SOX9 </italic>transduction of a human chondrocytic cell line to identify genes that are differentially expressed in the presence by <italic>SOX9</italic>. We then investigated the expression of these genes in both cDNA samples representative of normal or OA cartilage and in primary human articular chondrocytes during culture and dedifferentiation to establish whether they were similarly regulated <italic>in vitro </italic>and in cartilage pathology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Tissue collection</title><p>Osteoarthritic cartilage was obtained from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty for clinically and radiologically diagnosed OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Patients were excluded if there was any history of inflammatory arthropathies, or infection within the knee. Normal articular cartilage was obtained from patients undergoing above-knee amputation who had no history of joint disease. All tissue was obtained with fully informed consent and ethical approval. For tissue culture, cartilage from intact regions of joints with clinical confirmation of degenerative OA was harvested and subject to sequential trypsin/collagenase digestion to isolate chondrocytes as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. For gene-expression studies, paired full depth samples were taken from each joint (8 normal joints and 15 OA joints), with one sample being harvested from a major loaded area on the medial femoral condyle (MFC), and one from the less loaded lateral posterior condyle (LPC), placed in RNAlater and transferred to the laboratory on ice.</p></sec><sec><title>Culture and retroviral transduction of cells</title><p>Monolayer cultures of SW1353 cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin (all from Cambrex, Wokingham, UK) at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For retroviral transductions, 40% confluent cultures were infected in standard culture medium with an RKAT retrovirus containing a bicistronically expressed cDNA encoding human FLAG tagged <italic>SOX9 </italic>and green fluorescent protein (<italic>GFP</italic>), at a titre of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. After three repeated transductions, more than 90% of the cells were transduced and the cells were designated SOX9-SW1353. Cells transduced with a <italic>GFP</italic>-only retrovirus were used as controls and designated GFP-SW1353. SOX9 protein was assessed in the cells by immunoblotting using an anti-SOX9 goat polyclonal antibody (H-90, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Calne UK). Human articular chondrocytes were isolated from cartilage on OA knee joints and maintained in culture in medium (as above) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Cells were harvested for gene-expression analysis within the first week of culture (P0) and after 1 and 2 passages (P1 and P2). HACs were transduced with SOX9 or GFP-only retrovirus at passage 4 after first increasing their proliferation rate by adding platelet derived growth factor BB, transforming growth factor &#x003b2;1 and fibroblast growth factor 2 to the culture medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Gene expression in these cells was analysed at passage 6&#x02013;8.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray analysis</title><p>Glass spotted microarrays (Human known gene SGC oligo set array number 1) were obtained from the Human Genome Mapping Project. Each glass slide contains 9600 spotted oligonucleotides printed in duplicate, approximately 600 bp in length corresponding to the 3' region of each gene's mRNA. Probes were created from RNA, which was isolated from confluent monolayer cultures of GFP-SW1353 or SOX9-SW1353 using Tri Reagent (Sigma, Poole UK). 50 &#x003bc;g of total RNA was added to 2 &#x003bc;g of oligo d(T)<sub>16 </sub>(Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and incubated at 70&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes before snap cooling on ice for 2 minutes. RNA was reverse transcribed to produce a cDNA probe in a labelling mix containing 1&#x000d7; first strand synthesis buffer, 500 &#x003bc;M DTT, 500 &#x003bc;M dATP, 500 &#x003bc;M dTTP, 500 &#x003bc;M dGTP, 100 &#x003bc;M dCTP, 400 units of superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and either 100 &#x003bc;M Cy3&#x02013;dCTP or 100 &#x003bc;M Cy5&#x02013;dCTP (Amersham, Uxbridge, UK). Labelling reactions were incubated for 2 hours at 42&#x000b0;C before adding EDTA to 1 mM to stop the reaction. RNA in the samples was degraded by adding sodium hydroxide to 25 mM and heating at 70&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes. Samples were neutralised by addition of hydrochloric acid, and labelled cDNA was purified using a PCR clean up kit (Qiagen, Crawley UK). The purified probe was eluted in 50 &#x003bc;l of nuclease free water and combined with 10 &#x003bc;g of human Cot-1 DNA, 6 &#x003bc;g oligo d(A)<sub>10&#x02013;20</sub>, and 3 &#x003bc;g oligo d(T)<sub>16 </sub>(all from Invitrogen), and the volume reduced to 18 &#x003bc;l by vacuum centrifugation. The probe was then combined with 18 &#x003bc;l of a 2&#x000d7; hybridisation solution (final concentration: 25% formamide, 5 &#x000d7; SSC and 0.1% SDS), boiled for 3 minutes and hybridised overnight at 42&#x000b0;C under a glass cover slip. The arrays were then washed for 3 minutes each in 2&#x000d7; SSC, 0.1&#x000d7; SSC/0.1% SDS, and 0.1&#x000d7; SSC. Raw intensities at 635 nm and 532 nm were obtained for analysis from four independently probed arrays using the same starting RNA sample using a GenePix 4000A confocal microarray scanner. This data was imported into MaxDView software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and each pair of red/green measurements were subjected to intensity-dependant normalization. This removed intensity-dependent bias introduced by the use of the two different fluorophores as probe labels using the Loess (Lowess) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and converted the data to a log ratio with the mean set to zero following normalisation. Quadruplicate log ratios were averaged and standard deviations were determined. In addition, <italic>t</italic>-tests were carried out comparing the four replicates to zero to determine potentially significantly regulated genes. Data was filtered to display only those genes with <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 and greater than twofold change in expression. Raw data from each individual channel of each array was also subjected to principle components analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering following normalisation of data (log2, mean set to 0 and standard deviation set to 1) using Partek software.

It is able to interact with a conserved cartilage-specific enhancer element in the <italic>COL2A1 </italic>gene and can bind to promoter and enhancer regions in a number of other cartilage matrix genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This work has now identified a number of genes whose expression was changed in SW1353 cells by increasing SOX9 expression by retroviral transduction and may similarly contain conserved SOX9 response elements</p><p>The human SW1353 cells have previously been used to elucidate cytokine regulation of ECM-degrading proteases as model chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and their <italic>SOX9 </italic>expression was shown to be increased by fibroblast growth factors 1, 2 and 9 and decreased by IL1&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. They have also been used to identify cyclic AMP response element binding protein and p300 as novel partners of SOX9 that bind at cartilage-specific promoter sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Thus the SW1353 cells have some features of chondrocytes, but as with other chondrocytic cells in monolayer culture they expressed low levels of both cartilage ECM genes and SOX9, 6 and 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Their transduction of cytokine signals has also been reported to differ from that seen in primary articular chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In this study SOX9-transduction increased the expression of target genes (such as <italic>COL2A1</italic>), although others appeared unaffected (such as aggrecan). The SW1353 cells therefore appear to lack some chondrocyte properties, but their response to SOX9 transduction was clearly more chondrocyte-like than dermal fibroblasts, which showed no regulation cartilage matrix genes in response to the overexpression of SOX9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>From the initial microarray analysis we followed up gene-expression changes by qRT-PCR analysis in SOX9-SW1353 cells to confirm their regulation. Investigation of changes in the expression of this panel of genes in primary human chondrocytes following SOX9 transduction showed that some genes showed evidence of similar control to SW1353 cells, although some showed no comparable response. To extend these observations we investigated the expression in articular chondrocytes under conditions where the expression of SOX9 was changed by both natural and pathological factors. The expression was investigated in primary human chondrocytes cultured and passaged in monolayer, under which conditions the expression of SOX9 progressively becomes reduced. It was only after culture of the OA chondrocytes that the expression of SOX9 became reduced to the level found in the SW1353 cells before transduction. The change in expression during this fall in endogenous SOX9 expression showed <italic>S100A1</italic>, <italic>RGC32</italic>, <italic>CRTL1 </italic>and <italic>SPINT1 </italic>to decrease, which were therefore correlated with SOX9, as in SW1353 cells.</p><p>The identification of these SOX9-regulated genes led us to probe a human normal and OA cartilage library of globally amplified cDNA representing mRNA levels in chondrocytes in cartilage taken from load bearing or non-load-bearing regions from age-matched normal and OA human knees. <italic>SOX9 </italic>has been shown to be downregulated in osteoarthritis, and this may contribute to the pathological process by causing a reduction in the expression of ECM genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We found that many of the genes whose expression was altered by SOX9 in SW1353 cells and/or isolated primary chondrocytes displayed altered expression levels in OA cartilage (<italic>CRTL1 </italic>(<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01), <italic>SRPX </italic>(<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001), <italic>SPINT1 </italic>(<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001), <italic>RGC32 </italic>(<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) and <italic>APOD </italic>(<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001)) compared with age-matched controls. It is worth noting that even a gene such as COL2A1, which is known to have SOX9 regulatory elements, has been demonstrated to poorly correlate with the expression of SOX9 in control and osteoarthritic cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], suggesting that in OA its expression is more dominantly controlled by other factors. It was therefore more interesting to identify genes such as <italic>CRTL1</italic>, <italic>RGC32</italic>, <italic>S100A1 </italic>and <italic>APOD</italic>, which had a pattern of expression closely correlating with SOX9 expression levels in SW1353 cells, in primary chondrocytes, and also in OA cartilage. <italic>SRPX </italic>generally correlated with SOX9, except during chondrocyte dedifferentiation, which may indicate that other factors predominantly influence it during this process.</p><p><italic>APOD</italic>, which was expressed at relatively low levels in SW1353 cells, was expressed more strongly in cartilage, and the expression was reduced in OA, which was consistent with the decrease in <italic>SOX9</italic>. <italic>APOD </italic>encodes apolipoprotein D, which is a protein component of low density lipoprotein in human plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and is reported to be a transit protein in the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It may therefore have some function in cartilage ECM. The finding that <italic>APOD </italic>is downregulated in OA agrees with two previous microarray studies comparing normal and OA tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The present results showed further that <italic>APOD </italic>expression was not only downregulated in OA, but was also most strongly downregulated in the highly loaded, more physically damaged cartilage. <italic>APOD </italic>expression thus correlated with cartilage damage, whereas matrix genes, such as <italic>CTRL1 </italic>and <italic>SOX9</italic>, were similarly changed in OA in both low-loaded and high-loaded cartilage sites.</p><p><italic>S100A1 </italic>encodes an intercellular calcium-binding protein, which can control myocardial contractility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and has recently been identified as an important SOX9 regulated gene that controls the terminal differentiation of chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. <italic>S100A1 </italic>has previously been reported to be downregulated in osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In the OA and control cartilage samples investigated here, <italic>S100A1 </italic>had lower mean expression in OA, but the difference was not statistically significant. However, its expression was found to be significantly correlated with <italic>SOX9 </italic>when the results from all cartilage samples were analysed (data not shown).</p><p><italic>SRPX </italic>expression was increased by SOX9 transduction in SOX9-SW1353 and in primary human articular chondrocytes, and its expression was greatly reduced in OA cartilage. It therefore correlated well with SOX9 expression, although during chondrocyte dedifferentiation its expression increased more than sevenfold by passage 2 and was clearly unrelated to SOX9. This perhaps emphasises that any loss of chondrocyte phenotype in OA cartilage does not occur through a mechanism closely related to the loss of phenotype that occurs in these cells in monolayer culture. <italic>SRPX </italic>has a recognised role in ocular biology and disease. The <italic>SRPX </italic>gene encodes a putative membrane protein expressed abundantly in the retina, and was discovered as a candidate gene responsible for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. SOX9 has a potential regulatory role in the development of the retina, and may regulate the synthesis of collagen type II in the vitreous of the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, disrupted <italic>SOX9 </italic>expression in the 'odd sex' transgenic mouse, which results in sex reversal, also causes an eye phenotype with microphthalmia with cataracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The expression of SRPX may therefore be regulated by SOX9 during ocular development and may also have a role in cartilage biology.</p><p>Despite being unable to confirm any regulation by SOX9 in SW1353 by real time PCR, and with its expression unaffected in primary chondrocytes by the transition to monolayer culture, it was interesting that CRLF1 was significantly upregulated in osteoarthritic cartilage. CRLF1 protein is a member of the cytokine type I receptor family, and when expressed as a heterodimer with the cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) can activate the membrane bound ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor-&#x003b1; (CNTFR&#x003b1;), which causes an interaction between gp130 and leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor, leading to cell signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Further work characterising the expression of the genes encoding CNTFR&#x003b1; and CLC in cartilage is required as does the possibility that upregulation of <italic>CRLF1 </italic>expression could have a use as a marker of OA.</p><p>This study identified genes whose expression in chondrocytes was consistently correlated with changes in SOX9 expression. The results suggested that the expression of these genes may be regulated by SOX9, and as SOX9 is essential for chondrocyte phenotype, the novel genes with unknown function may help control the differentiated state of chondrocytes within cartilage. The correlation of expression with SOX9 linked these genes to changes in cartilage in OA. As OA is characterized by degenerative changes in cartilage it will be important to establish how the changes in the expression of SOX9-regulated genes contribute to the progressive loss of chondrocyte function and the compromise in cartilage integrity that occurs in OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified genes in a human chondrosarcoma cell line whose expression is altered by the overexpression of the chondrogenic transcription factor SOX9. Some of these genes were similarly regulated in primary human chondrocytes in response to changes in SOX9 induced by overexpression or by dedifferentiation in culture. The expression of some of these genes was also correlated with SOX9 expression in intact human articular cartilage, and was therefore suppressed in OA cartilage compared with age-matched control cartilage.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CLC = cardiotrophin-like cytokine; CNTFR = ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor; DMEM = Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ECM = extracellular matrix; FBS = foetal bovine serum; GFP = green fluorescent protein; LPC = lateral posterior condyle; MFC = medial femoral condyle; OA = osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SRT conceived, designed and performed the experimental work associated with the microarray and was responsible for the initial versions of this manuscript.
