TRADD is also recruited by the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) oncoprotein of Epstein-Barr virus, but its role in LMP1 signaling has remained enigmatic. In human B lymphocytes, we have generated, to our knowledge, the first genetic knockout of <italic>TRADD</italic> to investigate TRADD's role in LMP1 signal transduction. Our data from TRADD-deficient cells demonstrate that TRADD is a critical signaling mediator of LMP1 that is required for LMP1 to recruit and activate I-&#x003ba;B kinase &#x003b2; (IKK&#x003b2;). However, in contrast to TNFR1, LMP1-induced TRADD signaling does not induce apoptosis. Searching for the molecular basis for this observation, we characterized the 16 C-terminal amino acids of LMP1 as an autonomous and unique virus-derived TRADD-binding domain. Replacing the death domain of TNFR1 by LMP1&#x02032;s TRADD-binding domain converts TNFR1 into a nonapoptotic receptor that activates NF-&#x003ba;B through a TRAF6-dependent pathway, like LMP1 but unlike wild-type TNFR1. Thus, the unique interaction of LMP1 with TRADD encodes the transforming phenotype of viral TRADD signaling and masks TRADD's pro-apoptotic function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>For viral infection to succeed, viral proteins must interact with the cellular signaling machinery of its target cell. An oncoprotein encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) called latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is a primary contributor to the transformation of human B cells by the virus and the development of EBV-associated B cell malignancies by recruiting signaling molecules provided by the host. One such molecule, the cellular adapter protein TRADD, is among the few direct interaction partners of LMP1. But because TRADD promotes cell death (apoptosis) in the cellular tumor necrosis factor-receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling pathway, it seems counterintuitive that TRADD could play a role in LMP1 biology, since LMP1 promotes cell survival and proliferation. We provide genetic evidence that TRADD is critical for LMP1 to assemble its transforming signaling network. LMP1 requires TRADD to recruit and activate I-&#x003ba;B kinase &#x003b2; and, thus, to induce canonical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling. Simultaneously, LMP1 masks TRADD's pro-apoptotic activity. We show that LMP1 carries a unique and autonomous viral TRADD-binding domain, which dictates an unusual structure of the LMP1-TRADD complex and the nonapoptotic phenotype of TRADD signaling, irrespective of the receptor context in which this domain is located. Thus, DNA tumor viruses alter the functional properties of cellular signaling molecules to exploit them for their own purpose of cell transformation.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A unique Epstein Barr virus-derived protein interaction domain uses the cellular death domain protein TRADD to assemble its transforming signaling complex and dictates a transferable nonapoptitic phenotype of TRADD signaling.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Schneider F, Neugebauer J, Griese J, Liefold N, Kutz H, et al.

However, it cannot be excluded that TRADD overexpression caused unspecific effects unrelated to LMP1 signaling in these studies.

Therefore, it is currently believed that TRADD is dispensable for LMP1 signaling, and no molecular role of TRADD in organizing the CTAR2 signaling complex has been demonstrated. In analogy to TNFR1 signaling, it has been suggested that TRADD recruits TRAF2 to CTAR2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060008-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. However, no experimental evidence for a physical interaction of TRAF2 with the signaling complex at CTAR2 is available.

Subsequently, TRADD binds the Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) to activate caspase 8&#x02013;dependent apoptosis. In contrast to TNFR1, LMP1 is devoid of a death domain, and TRADD's death domain is dispensable for TRADD interaction with LMP1, suggesting that the molecular architectures of the TNFR1-TRADD and LMP1-TRADD complexes are different &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060008-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. However, it is unknown whether this unique type of TRADD recruitment is determined by LMP1 and whether it has relevance for the biological function of LMP1. Although amino acid residues Y384 and Y385 of CTAR2 are known to be essential for TRADD recruitment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060008-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;, the functional TRADD-binding site of LMP1 has not been well defined.</p><p>Here, we report the first genetic knockout, to our knowledge, of the <italic>TRADD</italic> gene, which we have generated in human B lymphocytes to characterize TRADD's role in LMP1 signal transduction. Using TRADD-deficient cells, we found that TRADD has an essential role in LMP1 activation of canonical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling by mediating the recruitment and activation of IKK&#x003b2;. In contrast, JNK induction by LMP1 is independent of TRADD, demonstrating that the NF-&#x003ba;B and JNK pathways bifurcate upstream of TRADD at the level of CTAR2. We narrowed down the functional TRADD-binding domain of LMP1 to the 16 C-terminal amino acids of LMP1. The deletion of this domain resulted in a loss of IKK&#x003b2; binding to LMP1. We were able to transplant the nonapoptotic phenotype of LMP1-induced TRADD signaling to TNFR1 by replacing its death domain by the TRADD-binding sequence of LMP1. Thus, the viral oncoprotein LMP1 exploits TRADD for nonapoptotic signaling, which is intrinsically encoded by the viral TRADD-binding domain but not by the receptor context in which it operates.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Somatic Knockout of <italic>TRADD</italic> in Human B Lymphocytes</title><p>Studies on the role of TRADD in LMP1 signaling were hampered by the lack of TRADD-deficient mice or cell lines.

Due to the high endogenous NF-&#x003ba;B activity levels in DG75 cells, NF-&#x003ba;B reporter gene assays did not result in reliable induction levels after LMP1 expression (unpublished data). HA-LMP1&#x00394;371&#x02013;386, which lacks the 16 C-terminal amino acids of LMP1, is defective in CTAR2 signaling and served as null control. Expression of wild-type HA-LMP1 resulted in a 2.8-fold activation of IKK&#x003b2; in <italic>TRADD</italic>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; cells, monitored as I-&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; substrate phosphorylation and IKK&#x003b2; autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060008-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).

To demonstrate specificity of this effect for LMP1, we analyzed CD40 signaling in wild-type and TRADD-deficient cells. CD40 does not recruit TRADD and was therefore anticipated to signal also in the absence of TRADD.

In addition, we found that TRADD was present in the complex together with HA-LMP1 and IKK&#x003b2;. Deletion of the 16 C-terminal amino acids of LMP1 resulted in a loss of TRADD and IKK&#x003b2; interaction with LMP1, demonstrating that aa 371&#x02013;386 of LMP1 are essential for the recruitment of the NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;inducing signaling complex to CTAR2.

Moreover, HA-LMP1-TNFR1 required TRADD to exert its killing activity in B lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060008-g005">Figure 5</xref>D).

Most notably and in contrast to HA-LMP1-TNFR1, the HA-LMP1-TNFR1-LTB chimera did not induce cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060008-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Thus, although being fully functional with regard to the binding of TRADD and the induction of signal transduction, the TRADD-binding site of LMP1 had no apoptotic potential in the context of the TNFR1 signaling domain. We concluded from these results that the unique TRADD-binding site of LMP1, but not the context of the receptor signaling domain, encodes the nonapoptotic type of viral TRADD signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>The TRADD-Binding Site of LMP1 Converts TNFR1 into a Nonapoptotic Receptor</title><p>To further corroborate our findings, we transferred LMP1 aa 371&#x02013;386 into the context of wild-type TNFR1, replacing TNFR1&#x02032;s death domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060008-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).

After electroporation, all constructs were expressed to similar levels in TNFR1/TNFR2-double deficient MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060008-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). We used TNFR-deficient cells for our experiments to avoid cross-talk or the formation of heterocomplexes between the exogenously expressed TNFR1-LTB chimera and endogenous wild-type TNF-receptors. Activation of the TNFR1 constructs was achieved by spontaneous patching upon high exogenous expression in TNFR-deficient cells. Both, TNFR1 and TNFR1-LTB induced NF-&#x003ba;B to comparable levels in TNFR-deficient MEFs in the presence or absence of caspase inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060008-g006">Figure 6</xref>C).

To be able to investigate TRADD's molecular role in LMP1 signaling in a clean genetic system, we generated a <italic>TRADD</italic> knockout by deleting both <italic>TRADD</italic> alleles from human DG75 B lymphocytes. This is a biologically relevant cell system, because human B lymphocytes are the target cells of EBV.

Here we demonstrate that the CTAR2 domain of LMP1 recruits IKK&#x003b2; for signaling and that IKK&#x003b2; recruitment and, thus, activation by LMP1 depends on TRADD. In TNFR1 signaling, activation of IKK&#x003b2; can be functionally separated from its recruitment to the signaling complex.

We propose a mechanism of IKK&#x003b2; activation at CTAR2 that involves two pathways: a TRADD-dependent IKK&#x003b2; recruitment pathway and a parallel activation pathway that is critically mediated by TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060008-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Such a mechanism resolves the paradox that TRADD is solely required for CTAR2-triggered NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, whereas TRAF6 is essential for both NF-&#x003ba;B and JNK activation. Because TRAF2 is dispensable for NF-&#x003ba;B induction by LMP1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060008-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, a yet-undefined factor must be postulated that bridges IKK&#x003b2; binding to TRADD in LMP1 signaling. We exclude TRAF3 or TRAF6 as candidates, because TRADD has affinity for only TRAF1 and TRAF2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060008-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, and we did not detect TRAF3 or TRAF6 in immunoprecipitations together with TRADD and IKK&#x003b2; (unpublished data).

Despite their role in canonical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling, a physical and/or functional interaction of TRAF3 and TRAF6 with CTAR2 must be independent of TRADD, because both TRAFs are critical for JNK activation by CTAR2, which is still intact in TRADD&#x02013;/&#x02013; cells. The transcriptional corepressor BS69 was suggested as the potential mediator of TRAF6 interaction with CTAR2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060008-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, although a recent report showed that endogenous BS69 is exclusively located within the nucleus interacting with chromatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060008-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. However, cytoplasmic BS69 protein levels beyond the detection limit of the applied BS69 antibody possibly suffice to mediate LMP1 signaling.

Thus, TRADD has a unique biological role in LMP1-induced cell proliferation and, therefore, contributes to B cell transformation by EBV. How does LMP1 achieve to exploit TRADD without inducing apoptosis? Our results demonstrated that aa 371&#x02013;386 of LMP1 encompass an autonomous and unique viral TRADD-binding domain that encodes the nonapoptotic properties of TRADD signaling. This domain has no sequence homology to any known TRADD-binding site of cellular receptors or signaling molecules. Accordingly, the interaction between LMP1 and TRADD does not require a functional death domain in either of the two molecules. Our data demonstrated that this unique molecular structure of the LMP1&#x02013;TRADD complex is intrinsically determined by the TRADD-binding site of LMP1 and can be transferred together with the nonapoptotic phenotype of TRADD signaling to TNFR1. Therefore, the unique interaction of TRADD with the TRADD-binding site of LMP1 must prevent apoptosis induction by TRADD. Accordingly, we could not detect an interaction of TRADD with the apoptosis mediator FADD in the presence of LMP1 (unpublished data). Sequences within the TRADD death domain, which are required for apoptosis induction, might be masked by components of the LMP1&#x02013;TRADD complex. Based on our domain-swapping experiments, we can further exclude the possibility that signals originating elsewhere at the LMP1 signaling domain, for instance at CTAR1, are required to suppress apoptosis induction by TRADD, because the 16 C-terminal amino acids of LMP1 did not induce apoptosis in the context of wild-type TNFR1.</p><p>We also showed that LMP1 and its anticipated functional analogue, CD40, substantially differ in their receptor-proximal mechanisms activating signal transduction. Very much in contrast to LMP1, CD40 does not require TRADD for signaling.
