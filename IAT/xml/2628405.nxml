Furthermore, this single mutation results in profound enhancement of central nervous system feedback to the cochlea. And finally, as a consequence, mutant mice possessing this altered receptor have substantially improved resistance to traumatic sound.

Each system responds with some specificity to a stimulus, and each one employs some specialized receptor cells at the periphery to translate specific stimuli into electrical signals that all neurons can use. That initial electrical event begins the process by which the central nervous system constructs an orderly representation of, for example, sounds, odors, tastes, and objects. Thus, basic sound detection begins when sound waves strike the eardrum, which transmits that physical stimulus to the organ of Corti within the cochlea, the sensory epithelium of the mammalian inner ear. Here, the primary receptor cells known as inner hair cells (IHCs) transform the information into electrical signals that are sent to the central nervous system by the auditory nerve &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000018-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. However, unlike vision, touch, and the chemical senses, sound processing is modulated by efferent signals that travel in reverse, from the brain back to the inner ear &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000018-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

In contrast to IHCs, OHCs act as biological motors to amplify the sound-evoked motions of the organ of Corti through a type of somatic electromotility generated by a specialized membrane protein known as prestin. Activation of the MOC pathway, either by sound or by shock trains delivered to the bundle at the floor of the IVth ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000018-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), reduces cochlear sensitivity through the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) on nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) at the base of OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000018-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000018-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although fast, direct nicotinic synaptic activity drives neurotransmission in autonomic ganglia, only rare cases of fast nicotinic transmission mediated by neuronal nAChRs have been reported in the mammalian brain. Because cholinergic neurons in the brain are usually loosely distributed and often sparsely innervate broad areas, it is experimentally difficult to stimulate a large number of those neurons and to record selectively from their postsynaptic targets. Indeed, it is likely that authentic fast nicotinic transmission is present at low densities in more neuronal areas than the few that have been reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000018-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.

Moreover, these changes in channel gating properties translate into increased synaptic efficacy, as seen from the prolonged synaptic currents observed in IHCs and OHCs of mutant mice. In addition, the inhibitory signature of the efferent synapse is conserved, since the nAChR currents remain coupled to the associated SK2 currents, which were also substantially prolonged. In fact, the increase in overall charge transfer during sIPSCs between wild-type and knockin mice was more pronounced when the secondary SK2 currents were measured, than for the nAChR-only currents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000018-t001">Table 1</xref>), pointing to an additional amplified step, possibly calcium-induced calcium release from the nearby synaptic cistern &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000018-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.

This baseline inhibition could arise from an increased sensitivity of mutant receptors to normal low levels of spontaneous ACh release from MOC terminals or to the increased probability of spontaneous channel openings of <italic>L9&#x02032;T</italic> mutant receptors in the absence of ACh &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000018-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. The appearance of spontaneous channel openings, as described for the mutant receptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000018-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, may also explain how low-dose strychnine can speed the onset kinetics of the in vivo response in mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000018-g009">Figure 9</xref>B), i.e., by restoring mutant channels to the closed state, from which rapid ACh-mediated channel openings can occur.</p><p>Hair cell recordings from the <italic>L9&#x02032;T</italic> mutant mice in the present study show (1) ACh-evoked currents with a greatly reduced desensitization rate, and (2) spontaneous miniature synaptic currents with slower activation and decay kinetics. These changes in ACh response kinetics provide likely explanations for some aspects of the electrically evoked suppression of DPOAEs. The doubling of onset time for the ACh-evoked SK2 current in mutant hair cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000018-t001">Table 1</xref>) must contribute to the slowed onset of MOC-mediated suppression in vivo, by reducing linear summation of postsynaptic effects. However, the slowing of suppression onset is so dramatic (&#x0003c;1 s in wild type vs. &#x0003e;20 s in mutant mice) that other possible factors, e.g., alterations of release probability or slowed facilitation in the efferent terminals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000018-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, might also contribute to this delayed time course.</p><p>In addition to rising more slowly, MOC-mediated cochlear suppression was also larger and longer lasting in <italic>L9&#x02032;T</italic> mutant mice. The normal adaptation of suppression during continuous MOC activation was absent in the presence of slowly desensitizing &#x003b1;9L9&#x02032;T mutant receptors, consistent with the idea that receptor desensitization is a key factor in the decay of the wild-type response after shock-train onset. However, the dramatic prolongation of cochlear suppression after shock-train offset (500 s in mutants vs. &#x0003c;5 s in wild types) is too large to be explained only by the 2- to 3-fold prolongation of synaptic currents observed in the mutant hair cells. Another contributing factor may be the observation that choline, the metabolite produced when acetylcholinesterase degrades ACh released at the synapse, is a full agonist of the mutant &#x003b1;9&#x003b1;10 receptor, and only a weak partial agonist of the wild-type receptor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000018-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, in vivo, the suppression can only decay after choline is taken up by the synaptic terminal or otherwise diffuses away. Treatment with a low dose of the &#x003b1;9&#x003b1;10 antagonist strychnine (3 mg/kg) supports this interpretation. This treatment completely abolished the prolonged postshock suppression in mutant mice (and unmasked a fast onset). Since choline has 4-fold lower affinity for &#x003b1;9L9&#x02032;T mutant receptors than ACh &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000018-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, a low concentration of strychnine may be differentiating the effects of the two agonists (i.e., blocking the effects of the agonist with a lower potency, choline, but leaving unchanged the effects of the high-affinity agonist, ACh), as well as modulating the resting level of desensitization. Beyond the possibility of metabolite activation, extended inhibitory effects could involve more than changes in membrane conductance. For example, it has been shown that exposure to ACh alters the stiffness and motility of OHCs isolated from the gerbil cochlea over tens of minutes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000018-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;.

Thus, it remains to be determined whether prolonged Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx through mutated &#x003b1;9&#x003b1;10 receptors leads to changes in prestin structure or function resulting in prolonged MOC efferent effects.</p><p>The presence of mutant &#x003b1;9L9&#x02032;T receptors, designed to increase the magnitude of MOC effects on OHCs, also increased the protective action of the MOC system in vivo. This is consistent with previous work showing that overexpression of wild-type &#x003b1;9 channels, which more modestly increased the magnitude of MOC-mediated DPOAE suppression, also increased the resistance of the ear to acoustic injury &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000018-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;.

The fast suppression, with an onset time course of approximately 100 ms, arises from the increased K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> conductance in neighboring SK2 channels and the effects of the resultant OHC hyperpolarization on the magnitude of electromotility and thus on cochlear vibration amplitude. The slow suppression, with an onset time course of approximately 10 s, may require a wave of calcium-induced calcium release along the OHC membrane and appears to reflect a change in OHC stiffness &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000018-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d; that also reduces cochlear vibrations.

The further observation that in the &#x003b1;9L9&#x02032;T mutants, protection was seen only for exposures intense enough to produce irreversible damage and permanent threshold shifts, and not in less traumatic exposures producing only reversible changes, argues against a general reduction of vibration amplitude as the underlying mechanism. Most of the permanent threshold elevation underlying this type of noise exposure arises from damage to the hair cell stereocilia bundles, including disarray loss and/or fusion of these modified microvilli &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000018-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;, which house the mechanoelectric transduction channels.

This alteration provides enhanced protection from permanent acoustic trauma, indicating that cholinergic synaptic feedback is not only necessary, but sufficient for this effect. In addition, the enhanced activity of the modified nAChR revealed a novel tonic inhibitory effect, raising baseline acoustic thresholds over those of wild-type littermates, confirming the inhibitory nature of the MOC efferent system. Thus, this &#x003b1;9L9&#x02032;T knockin presents new insights into the cellular mechanisms of cholinergic inhibition, as well as a promising model in which to probe the functional role of MOC efferents. In addition, the hair cell's efferent synapse, much like the neuromuscular junction, can provide insights into cholinergic signaling, and promises to be an equally informative model for studying activity-dependent synaptic function.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Genetic engineering and genotyping of <italic>Chrna9L9&#x02032;T</italic> knockin mutant mice.</title><p>A HindIII-NotI (the latter derived from the construction of the library) restriction endonuclease fragment of approximately 9,500 bp encoding <italic>Chrna9</italic> exons 1&#x02013;4 (see GenBank accession number NT&#x0005f;039305.7 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000018-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) was obtained from a mouse strain 129S4/SvJae genomic DNA library (kindly provided by Dr Bernhard Bettler, University of Basel) and subcloned into the vector pKO-Select DT (Lexicon Genetics).

All working solutions containing either ACh or elevated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or both, were made up in a saline containing low Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (0.5 mM) and no Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> so as to optimize the experimental conditions for measuring currents flowing through the &#x003b1;9&#x003b1;10 receptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000018-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. sIPSCs were recorded immediately after rupturing into the cell, in the extracellular saline containing 1.3 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and no Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. All experiments designed to record synaptic currents, either spontaneous or evoked with high K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, were done using an extracellular solution containing 1.3 mM Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and no Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. sIPSCs were recorded immediately after rupturing the cell.</p><p>Glass pipettes, 1.2-mm I.D., had resistances of 5&#x02013;8 M&#x003a9;. Currents in both IHCs and OHCs were recorded in the whole-cell patch-clamp mode with an Axopatch 200B amplifier, low-pass filtered at 2&#x02013;10 kHz, and digitized at 5&#x02013;20 kHz with a Digidata 1322A board (Molecular Devices). Recordings were made at room temperature (22&#x02013;25 &#x000b0;C). Holding potentials were not corrected for liquid junction potentials or for the voltage drop across the uncompensated series resistance. IPSCs were analyzed with Minianalyis (Synaptosoft; Jaejin Software). IPSCs were identified using a search routine for event detection and confirmed by eye. The individual events of each cell were aligned and averaged using Minianalysis. Rise time was used as the criterion to align. For further analysis, Prism 4 (GraphPad Software) was used. The <italic>&#x003c4;</italic><sub>rise</sub> and <italic>&#x003c4;</italic><sub>decay</sub> were fit to a monoexponential.</p><p>Prolonged agonist application responses and concentration-response curves to ACh in IHCs were performed in the nAChR-only condition, normalized to the maximal agonist response, and iteratively fitted with the equation: <italic>I/I<sub>max</sub></italic> &#x0003d; <italic>A<sup>n</sup></italic>/(<italic>A<sup>n</sup></italic> &#x0002b; EC<sub>50</sub><italic><sup>n</sup></italic>), where <italic>I</italic> is the peak inward current evoked by agonist at concentration <italic>A</italic>; <italic>I<sub>max</sub></italic> is current evoked by the concentration of agonist eliciting a maximal response; EC<sub>50</sub> is the concentration of agonist inducing half-maximal current response, and <italic>n</italic> is the Hill coefficient.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Auditory brainstem responses and distortion product otoacoustic emissions.</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with xylazine (20 mg/kg i.p.) and ketamine (100 mg/kg i.p.). DPOAEs at 2f<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;f<sub>2</sub> were recorded with a custom acoustic assembly consisting of two electrostatic drivers (TDT EC-1; Tucker-Davis Technologies) to generate primary tones (f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> with f<sub>2</sub>/f<sub>1</sub> &#x0003d; 1.2 and f<sub>2</sub> level 10 dB &#x0003c; f<sub>1</sub> level) and a Knowles miniature microphone (EK3103) to record ear-canal sound pressure. Stimuli were generated digitally, while resultant ear-canal sound pressure was amplified and digitally sampled at 4 &#x003bc;s (16-bit DAQ boards, NI 6052E; National Instruments). Fast Fourier Transforms were computed and averaged over five consecutive waveform traces, and 2f<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;f<sub>2</sub> DPOAE amplitude and surrounding noise floor were extracted. Iso-response curves were interpolated from plots of amplitude versus sound level, performed in 5-dB steps of f<sub>1</sub> level. &#x0201c;Threshold&#x0201d; is defined as the f<sub>1</sub> level required to produce a DPOAE with amplitude &#x0003d; 0 dB sound pressure level (SPL). For measurement of ABRs, needle electrodes were inserted at vertex and pinna, with a ground near the tail. ABRs were evoked with 5-ms tone pips (0.5-ms rise-fall, cos<sup>2</sup> onset, at 35/s). The response was amplified (10,000&#x000d7;), filtered (100 Hz&#x02013;3 kHz), and averaged with an A-D board in a LabVIEW-driven data-acquisition system. Sound level was raised in 5-dB steps from 10 dB below threshold to 80 dB SPL. At each level, 1,024 responses were averaged (with stimulus polarity alternated), using an &#x0201c;artifact reject&#x0201d; whereby response waveforms were discarded when peak-to-peak amplitude exceeded 15 &#x003bc;V. Upon visual inspection of stacked waveforms, &#x0201c;threshold&#x0201d; was defined as the lowest SPL level at which any wave could be detected, usually the level step just below that at which the response amplitude exceeded the noise floor (&#x0223c;0.25 &#x003bc;V). For amplitude versus level functions, wave-I peak was identified by visual inspection at each sound level and the peak-to-peak amplitude computed.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Olivocochlear assay.</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with urethane (1.20 g/kg i.p.) and xylazine (20 mg/kg i.p.). A posterior craniotomy and partial cerebellar aspiration were performed to expose the floor of the IVth ventricle. To stimulate the MOC bundle, shocks (monophasic pulses, 150-&#x003bc;s duration, 200/s) were applied through fine silver wires (0.4-mm spacing) placed along the midline, spanning the olivocochlear decussation. Shock threshold for facial twitches was determined, muscle paralysis induced with &#x003b1;-d-tubocurarine (1.25 mg/kg i.p.), and the animal connected to a respirator via a tracheal cannula. Shock levels were raised to 6 dB above twitch threshold. During the MOC suppression assay, f<sub>2</sub> level was set to produce a DPOAE 10&#x02013;15 dB or 20&#x02013;25 dB greater than the noise floor. To measure MOC effects, repeated measures of baseline DPOAE amplitude were first obtained (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 56), followed by a series of 70 contiguous periods in which DPOAE amplitudes were measured with simultaneous shocks to the MOC bundle and additional periods during which DPOAE measures continued after the termination of the shock train.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Acoustic overexposure.</title><p>Animals were exposed free-field, in a small reverberant chamber. Acoustic trauma consisted of a 2-h exposure to an 8&#x02013;16-kHz octave band noise presented at 100 dB SPL (for permanent injury) or a 15-min exposure to the same noise at 94 dB SPL (for temporary injury). For the higher level exposure, animals were anesthetized (ketamine and xylazine, exactly as for the ABR and DPOAE testing), because many mutant animals experienced audiogenic seizures as soon as the high-level noise was turned on. The exposure stimulus was generated by a custom white-noise source, filtered (Brickwall Filter with a 60-dB/octave slope), amplified (Crown power amplifier), and delivered (JBL compression driver) through an exponential horn fitted securely to a hole in the top of a reverberant box. Sound exposure levels were measured at four positions within each cage using a 0.25'' Bruel and Kjaer condenser microphone: sound pressure was found to vary by less than 0.5 dB across these measurement positions.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Data analysis.</title><p>Statistical analyses of in vitro electrophysiology experiments were carried by the Student <italic>t</italic>-test in the case of pairwise comparisons or a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnet test for multiple comparisons.
