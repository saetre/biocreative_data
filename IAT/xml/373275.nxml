This mechanistic feature is distinct from DNA glycosylase-mediated base excision repair. Here we report that Ape1, the major apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease in human cells, is the damage- specific endonuclease involved in NIR. We show that Ape1 incises DNA containing 5,6-dihydro-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine, 5,6-dihydrothymidine, 5-hydroxy-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine, alpha-2&#x02032;-deoxyadenosine and alpha-thymidine adducts, generating 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl and 5&#x02032;-phosphate termini. The kinetic constants indicate that Ape1-catalysed NIR activity is highly efficient. The substrate specificity and protein conformation of Ape1 is modulated by MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations, thus providing conditions under which NIR becomes a major activity in cell-free extracts. While the N-terminal region of Ape1 is not required for AP endonuclease function, we show that it regulates the NIR activity. The physiological relevance of the mammalian NIR pathway is discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA is a critical cellular target of reactive oxygen species such as O<sub>2</sub>&#x000b7;<sup>&#x02013;</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and OH&#x000b7;, which are constantly formed in cells by cellular metabolism and by exogenous factors such as ionizing radiation (IR) and certain drugs. 5,6-Dihydro thymidine (DHT), 5,6-dihydro-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine (DHU) and alpha-2&#x02032;-deoxyadenosine (&#x003b1;A) constitute the major adducts detected in irradiated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c3">3</xref>). Importantly, &#x003b1;A and DHT are unique due to their strict requirement for anoxia during irradiation. The alpha-anomers of 2&#x02032;-deoxynucleosides such as &#x003b1;A and alpha-thymidine (&#x003b1;T) are produced by abstraction of the anomeric hydrogen atom at C1&#x02032; by OH radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c5">5</xref>). &#x003b1;A constitutes a moderate replication block both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and generates exclusively a single nucleotide deletion <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c6">6</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, ring-saturated pyrimidines are formed in DNA at rates higher than that of 8-oxoguanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c7">7</xref>). The fragmentation products of DHT strongly inhibits DNA synthesis and have been shown to be lethal lesions <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c8">8</xref>). 5-Hydroxy-2&#x02032;-uridine (5ohU) arises from cytosine glycol, an unstable DNA adduct, followed by deamination and dehydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c9">9</xref>). DHU, another cytosine-derived product, is generated by IR under anoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c10">10</xref>). 5ohU and DHU resulting from C are miscoding lesions generating a C&#x02192;T transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c11">11</xref>).</p><p>Base excision repair (BER), initiated by DNA glycosylases is thought to be the major pathway for the removal of most of these oxidized bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c12">12</xref>). Nevertheless, BER which requires the sequential action of two enzymes for proper incision of DNA, raises theoretical problems for the efficient repair of oxidative DNA damage, because it generates genotoxic intermediates such as apurinic/apyrimidinique (AP) sites, 2&#x02032;-deoxyribose-5&#x02032;-phosphate and/or 3&#x02032;-blocking groups that must be eliminated before initiating DNA repair synthesis. Although some studies have shown that DNA glycosylase mutants show increased sensitivity to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c14">14</xref>), the majority of genetic data indicate that the lack of DNA glycosylases does not render cells or mice more sensitive to oxidizing agents and IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c17">17</xref>). This is in striking contrast to the highly sensitive phenotype of AP endonuclease deficient bacterial, yeast and mammalian mutant cells towards oxidizing agents and IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c20">20</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, oxidative DNA damage such as &#x003b1;A is not repaired by DNA glycosylases/AP lyases but rather by the Nfo protein (endonuclease IV) in a DNA glycosylase-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c21">21</xref>). Furthermore, we have shown previously that DHT, DHU and 5ohU residues can be processed by the alternative nucleotide incision repair (NIR) pathway that is initiated by one of two homologous AP endonucleases: the Nfo protein from <italic>E.coli</italic> and Apn1 protein from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c22">22</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DNA polymerase I (pol I) in the presence of dNTPs and/or human flap-endonuclease 1 (FEN-1) in the presence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen efficiently eliminate the 5&#x02032;-terminal dangling DHU residue from the nicked duplex oligonucleotide as a mononucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c22">22</xref>). Thus, completion of NIR in eukaryotes would occur through the FEN-1-dependent long-patch repair pathway described in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c23">23</xref>). While we also presented evidence for the existence of a human NIR damage-specific endonuclease, its identity was not established and searches of the human genome database did not reveal any homologue of Nfo or Apn1. In this study, we have used HeLa S3 cells to purify to near homogeneity the endonuclease that incises DHU&#x000b7;G-containing duplex oligonucleotides 5&#x02032; of the lesion in a DNA glycosylase-independent manner. The enzyme has been purified to near homogeneity and identified as human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (Ape1), also known as Ref-1/HAP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c24">24</xref>).</p><p>Ape1 is homologous to <italic>E.coli</italic> Xth protein (exonuclease III), and was first purified from human (HeLa) cells more than two decades ago by Kane and Linn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c25">25</xref>). The cDNA encoding Ape1 was cloned 10 years later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c27">27</xref>) and subsequently also identified as a redox-regulator of the DNA binding domain of Fos, Jun and several other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c28">28</xref>). Ape1 is a 35.5 kDa nuclear protein that plays a central role in both short-patch and long-patch BER and can substitute for exonuclease III in <italic>E.coli</italic> and for Apn1 in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c29">29</xref>). In addition to its AP endonuclease activity, it exhibits other DNA repair activities: 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease, phosphodiesterase, 3&#x02032;-phosphatase and Rnase H, but it should be noted that these additional activities are much weaker than its AP endonuclease activity. Recently, it has been shown that Ape1 also has a 3&#x02032;-mismatch exonuclease activity and so it might also be considered to be a proofreading enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c30">30</xref>).</p><p>Loss-of-function studies in mice indicate an absolute requirement for Ape1 in normal embryonic development and animal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c31">31</xref>). Indeed, Ape1 is a multifunctional enzyme, involved in DNA repair, transcription regulation, oxidative signalling, etc. The physiological significance of the DNA repair function is supported by the fact that explanted homozygous Ape1 null blastocysts display increased sensitivity to &#x003b3;-irradiation, indicating a deficiency in the repair of IR-induced DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c20">20</xref>). Furthermore, targeted anti-sense experiments in mammalian cells indicate that reduced Ape1 levels also increase cellular sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, menadione, paraquat and IR, but not UV radiation, and Ape1 expression and activity levels correlate with chemo/radiosensitivity of tumour cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c32">32</xref>).</p><p>The ability of Ape1 to incise the DNA sugar&#x02013;phosphate backbone 5&#x02032; to a bulky lesion such as 3,<italic>N</italic><sup>4</sup>-benzetheno-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine and 3,<italic>N</italic><sup>4</sup>-benzetheno-2&#x02032;-deoxyadenosine has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c34">34</xref>). However, these benzene-derived DNA adducts are neither a consequence of oxidative damage, nor substrates for any known DNA glycosylase. Therefore, this activity of Ape1 is not involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage and was not considered an alternative, back-up function to DNA glycosylases. In the present work we show, for the first time, that Ape1 and human thymine glycol-DNA glycosylase (hNth1) have overlapping substrate specificities towards DHU, DHT and 5ohU residues. The novel NIR function of Ape1 serves as an alternative and back-up repair pathway to BER for oxidative DNA base damage. The potential importance of Ape1-NIR activity in cleansing genomic DNA of potentially mutagenic and cytotoxic lesions is discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>DNA substrates</title><p>Oligonucleotides (17mer) containing either a single &#x003b1;A or &#x003b1;T adduct were prepared as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c21">21</xref>). All other oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium), including those containing THF, DHT, DHU and 5ohU nucleosides and complementary oligonucleotides, containing either dA, dG, dC or T opposite the adduct. The oligonucleotide sequences were: 5&#x02032;-AGCATTCGXGACTGGGT containing &#x003b1;A, &#x003b1;T or THF; d(AAATACATCGTCACCTGGGXCATGTTGCAGATCC) containing THF, DHU or 5ohU; d(TGACTGCATAXGCATGTAGACGATGTGCAT) containing DHT or DHU, where X is the position of the modified base. To generate oxidized bases, pUC19 plasmid DNA was treated with 10 mM KMnO<sub>4</sub> at 0&#x000b0;C for 5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c35">35</xref>). The DNA samples were desalted on a Sephadex G50 column equilibrated in 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.5 and 1 mM EDTA.

The fluorescence emission was measured at 330 nm with excitation at 282 nm on an SFM-23/B spectrofluorometer (Kontron AG, Switzerland).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Identification of a human endonuclease that incises a DHU-containing oligonucleotide</title><p>We have purified an NIR incision activity from HeLa S3 cells using a 3&#x02032;-labelled DHU-containing oligonucleotide to monitor the DNA glycosylase-independent incision of the oligonucleotide duplex. Although we reported previously only weak NIR activity in HeLa cell extracts, subsequent experiments showed that the addition of a divalent cation (0.3 mM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>) greatly stimulated the NIR incision activity towards DHU and DHT adducts. Therefore, using these assay conditions, the NIR activity was eluted as a single symmetrical peak after seven chromatographic steps of protein purification, suggesting that it could be due to a single protein (see Supplementary Material). The most active fraction after heparin Sepharose chromatography (Fraction VII) was found to be essentially homogeneous and consisted of one polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa (Supplementary Material, Fig. 1). The polypeptide was recovered from the gel, and a partial amino acid sequence was determined using quadrapole mass spectroscopy. The sequence matched that of human Ape1. To further substantiate the identity of the purified protein, western blot analyses were performed using antibodies specific to Ape1. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f1">1</xref>A the antibodies recognize specifically the major 37 kDa protein in Fraction VII (lane 3) that migrates similarly to the recombinant Ape1 (rec-Ape1) protein, which was over-expressed and purified from <italic>E.coli</italic> (lane 2). As expected, the Ape1 antibodies selectively inhibit NIR activity in HeLa cell extracts indicating that Ape1 is the major NIR initiating enzyme in human cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f1">1</xref>B, lane 4).</p></sec><sec><title>Substrate specificity of Ape1</title><p>Since our previous study failed to detect Ape1-catalysed NIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c22">22</xref>), we analysed the substrate specificity of rec-Ape1 under the reaction conditions used for the purified protein from HeLa cells (HeLa-Ape1). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f2">2</xref>, rec-Ape1, along with Nfo and HeLa-Ape1, cleaved 5ohU&#x000b7;G, DHU&#x000b7;G, THF&#x000b7;T, &#x003b1;A&#x000b7;T, &#x003b1;T&#x000b7;A and DHT&#x000b7;A oligonucleotide duplexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f2">2</xref>A and B, lanes 4 and 9 and lanes 3, 7 and 11, respectively, and data not shown). In addition, rec-Ape1 incises damaged supercoiled plasmid DNA containing either methylformamidopyrimidines or oxidized bases (Supplementary Material, Fig. 2). We did not observe any difference in the activity of the Ape1 proteins when either 0.3 mM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> or 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was used, in agreement with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c39">39</xref>).</p><p>In order to determine the mechanism of Ape1-catalysed incision, the DNA fragments generated by the <italic>E.coli</italic> proteins Nth and Nfo were used as size markers. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f2">2</xref>A, Nth (a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase) generates 15 or 20mer fragments from 3&#x02032;-labelled 5ohU&#x000b7;G and DHU&#x000b7;G oligonucleotides, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f2">2</xref>A, lanes 2 and 7). In contrast, Nfo (an AP endonuclease) generates 16 and 21mer fragments containing the dangling base, from the same substrates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f2">2</xref>A, lanes 3 and 8). Thus, the migration pattern of Ape1-cleavage products corresponds to that of Nfo, indicating a DNA glycosylase-independent, endonucleolytic mechanism of action (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f2">2</xref>A and B, lanes 4, 5, 9 and 10 and lanes 3, 4, 7, 8, 11 and 12, respectively). Taken together these results confirm that the NIR activity is indeed due to Ape1.</p></sec><sec><title>Optimal assay conditions for the NIR activity of Ape1</title><p>To characterize the biochemical properties of NIR incision by Ape1, we measured Ape1-mediated cleavage of THF&#x000b7;G and DHU&#x000b7;G in the presence of varying concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub>. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f3">3</xref>A, inverse sigmoid dependencies of the two activities were observed in the concentration range 1&#x02013;5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Ape1 efficiently catalysed DHU&#x000b7;G incision even under very low magnesium concentrations (0.001 mM), but this activity was strongly inhibited by concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> above 2 mM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f3">3</xref>A). Concentrations of at least 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> were required for optimal AP endonuclease activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f3">3</xref>A), in good agreement with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c40">40</xref>). The pH and salt concentration profiles of Ape1 activities were also examined in the presence of 0.5 and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> for NIR and AP endonuclease activities, respectively. The results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f3">3</xref>B reveal dramatic differences between the two activities: the AP endonuclease activity was optimal between pH 7.8 and 8.2, whereas NIR activity was optimal between pH 6.4 and 6.8. Furthermore, while AP endonuclease activity was maximal over a broad range of KCl concentrations (25&#x02013;200 mM), the NIR activity decreased dramatically when the KCl concentration exceeded 50 mM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f3">3</xref>C). Taken together these data suggest that <italic>in vivo</italic>, the NIR and the AP endonuclease activities could be mutually exclusive depending on intracellular Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations, pH and ionic strength.</p></sec><sec><title>Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> induced conformational effects in Ape1</title><p>As the sigmoid dependencies induced by an effector are characteristic of allosteric regulation, we investigated magnesium induced conformational changes of Ape1 structure by measuring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence that results from modifications in the environment of one or more of the seven tryptophanyl residues in the Ape1 protein.

Comparison of the kinetic constants (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh165tb1">1</xref>) shows that under reaction conditions optimal for AP endonuclease activity (5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and pH 7.6), the THF residue is the preferred substrate for Ape1 (<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> 19 nM, <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> 1600 min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>&#x000b5;M<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>). However, under reaction conditions optimal for NIR activity (pH 6.8 and 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values for the incision of THF&#x000b7;G, &#x003b1;A&#x000b7;T and DHU&#x000b7;G were in a similar range (45, 16 and 19 min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>&#x000b5;M<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>). The apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values measured for Ape1 and hNth1 when acting upon DHU&#x000b7;G indicate that <italic>in vitro</italic>, the AP endonuclease is somewhat more efficient than the DNA glycosylase/AP lyase (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh165tb1">1</xref>). Thus, the analysis of kinetic constants suggests that Ape1 can efficiently back-up the DNA glycosylases to repair DHU residues. As shown in Supplementary Material, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f3">3</xref>, Ape1 incised DHU, DHT, 5ohU and THF residues irrespective of the base opposite with similar efficiency. The apparently similar activity profiles of Ape1 towards different mismatches may reflect the fact that the enzyme recognizes a broad range of structures and is not sensitive to the variation in thermodynamic stability of the various mismatches.</p></sec><sec><title>NIR activity in cell-free extracts</title><p>Reconstitution of DNA repair in whole-cell extracts suggests that BER is the major pathway for removal of oxidative DNA base damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c42">42</xref>). However, kinetic data indicate that both Ape1 and the DNA glycosylases/AP lyases can act directly on DHU&#x000b7;G. To understand which of the two pathways is responsible for repair of the majority of oxidative DNA base damage <italic>in vivo</italic>, we compared AP endonuclease and DNA glycosylase activities towards 3&#x02032;-&#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dCMP-labelled DHU&#x000b7;G in HeLa cell-free extracts under different reaction conditions. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f4">4</xref>A, at pH 7.6, with or without 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, we detect mainly a DNA glycosylase activity (lanes 3 and 4). Addition of 0.3 mM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> increases the NIR activity up to the level of the DNA glycosylase-dependent incision (lane 5). However, at pH 6.8, NIR was the major activity (lane 6). Similar results were obtained when 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was substituted for 0.3 mM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. Interestingly, the level of BER activity remained constant under the various reaction conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f4">4</xref>A).</p><p>To investigate whether the faster migrating fragments observed below the NIR reaction product in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f4">4</xref>A (lanes 5 and 6) might be due to nuclease degradation from the 5&#x02032; end of DHU&#x000b7;G, the HeLa cell-free extracts were incubated under various reaction conditions with the same 30mer oligonucleotide, but 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P-end-labelled. Under these conditions a 10mer fragment was obtained (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f4">4</xref>B, lanes 6&#x02013;11). As purified Nfo and Ape1 also generate 10mer products, it is likely that the substrate oligonucleotide was cleaved by an AP endonuclease present in the crude extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f4">4</xref>B, lanes 4 and 5). This result excludes the possibility that the 3&#x02032;-labelled NIR product generated by cell-free extracts is due to non-specific 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonuclease degradation and supports our belief that the migration pattern of incision products is consistent with the NIR mode of incision with subsequent 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonucleolytic degradation of the NIR fragment. These results also suggest that AP endonuclease and DNA glycosylase activities in cell-free extracts can vary depending on the reaction conditions showing that the respective activities are finely tuned.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of the redox-domain of Ape1 in NIR function</title><p>The DNA repair domain of Ape1, which is located in the C-terminal region, is highly conserved, sharing 28&#x00025; sequence identity with Xth, the major AP endonuclease in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c29">29</xref>). Therefore, we reassessed the activity of Xth towards oxidative DNA base damage under various reaction conditions. Within the MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration range 0.01&#x02013;10 mM and at pH 6.8 or 7.6, no Xth-mediated incision of DHU&#x000b7;G or &#x003b1;A&#x000b7;T was observed (data not shown). We reasoned that this could be due to the non-conserved N-terminal region of Ape1, which is absent in the prokaryotic homologue and known as the redox (Ref)-domain. To understand the role of the Ref domain in NIR activity we generated truncated Ape1 lacking the N-terminal 61 residues (N&#x00394;61-Ape1) and measured the AP endonuclease and NIR activities. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f5">5</xref> the AP endonuclease activity of N&#x00394;61-Ape1 is similar to that of Ape1 (lanes 3 and 5 versus lanes 2 and 4). However, N&#x00394;61-Ape1 displayed a dramatic loss of activity towards &#x003b1;A&#x000b7;T (lane 8) and a significant reduction in activity towards DHU&#x000b7;G (lane 12), compared with the full-length protein (lanes 7 and 11). Interestingly, in contrast to full-length Ape1, we detected a significant decrease in the NIR activity of N&#x00394;61-Ape1 (&#x0223c;1.5-fold) in the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol (not shown). Taken together these results indicate an important role for the N-terminal region of Ape1 in NIR function.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Oxygen radicals generated as by-products of cellular metabolism cause extensive damage to DNA. Oxidative DNA damage have been postulated to be the major type of endogenous damage leading to human degenerative disorders including cancer, cardiovascular disease and brain dysfunction. Following the acquisition of the nucleus during the formation of the eukaryotic cell, oxidative metabolism was confined to the mitochondria, thus creating pseudo-anoxic conditions and protecting the genome located in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c43">43</xref>). Since the eukaryotic nucleus is a very poorly oxygenated cellular compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c44">44</xref>), oxidative DNA damage preferentially formed under anoxic conditions might result in significant biological consequences <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, cancer cells can grow under reduced oxygen-supply conditions, and tumour hypoxia is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to radiation therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c45">45</xref>). In contrast to oxidatively damaged bases such as 8-oxoguanine and thymine glycol, formation of 5,6-dihydropyrimidines and alpha-anomeric 2&#x02032;-deoxynucleotides requires strict anoxic condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c2">2</xref>). This might suggest that the latter lesions are biologically important DNA damage formed in the eukaryotic nucleus <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In NIR, an Nfo/Apn1-like damage-specific endonuclease directly nicks DNA containing free radical-induced base lesions acting as a back-up repair pathway to BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c22">22</xref>). As the identity of the human functional homologue of Nfo was unknown, we proceeded to purify the enzyme responsible for the incision of DHU&#x000b7;G oligonucleotide duplexes from HeLa cell extracts. Following seven chromatographic steps, we identified this activity as belonging to Ape1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f1">1</xref>). To characterize the substrate specificity of Ape1, we compared the activity of HeLa-purified and recombinant proteins towards various free radical-induced base lesions. The DNA duplexes containing DHT&#x000b7;A, DHU&#x000b7;G, 5ohU&#x000b7;G, THF&#x000b7;T, &#x003b1;A&#x000b7;T and &#x003b1;T&#x000b7;A were readily incised by both Ape1 proteins. Like Nfo and Apn1, Ape1 nicks DNA on the 5&#x02032; side of the damaged base, leaving the dangling damaged nucleotide on the 5&#x02032;-terminus of the downstream reaction product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f2">2</xref>). Taken together the results show that Ape1 is involved in the NIR pathway for oxidative DNA base damage. In contrast to both <italic>E.coli</italic> and humans, the major AP endonuclease of the budding yeast is Apn1, an Nfo homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c46">46</xref>). While the reason for the reversal in AP endonuclease prevalence is not understood, here we provide evidence that Ape1 is in fact the mammalian functional counterpart of Apn1, rather than <italic>E.coli</italic> Xth. Thus, in eukaryotes the major AP endonuclease is also involved in the DNA glycosylase-independent repair pathway.</p><p>Dramatic differences in reaction conditions were found for AP endonuclease and NIR activities of Ape1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f3">3</xref>). Thus, the AP endonuclease activity was maximal between pH 7.8 and 8.2, while NIR activity was maximal between pH 6.4 and 6.8 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f3">3</xref>B), conditions that are also optimal for AP site&#x02013;DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c47">47</xref>). Likewise, AP endonuclease activity was maximal over a broad range of KCl concentrations (25&#x02013;200 mM), whereas NIR activity decreased dramatically when the KCl concentration exceeded 50 mM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f3">3</xref>C). Interestingly, optimal conditions for NIR activity are similar to those for the 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity of Ape1 observed on matched, 3&#x02032;-mispaired and nucleoside analogue &#x003b2;-<sc>l</sc>-dioxolane-cytidine terminated nicked DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c30">30</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with previous data for AP endonuclease activity of Ape1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c40">40</xref>) over the concentration range 1&#x02013;5 mM, Ape1-mediated cleavage of THF&#x000b7;G and DHU&#x000b7;G shows a sigmoid dependency on MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f3">3</xref>A). Furthermore, MgCl<sub>2</sub> titration led to an increase in conformation related fluorescence of Ape1 but not of Apn1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f3">3</xref>C). Based on this it is tempting to speculate that Ape1 could be an allosteric enzyme, regulated by the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-effector. Although, initial structural studies indicated that the active site of Ape1 is unlikely to undergo radical structural changes upon Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c49">49</xref>). A more recent study, on the X-ray structure of the full-length Ape1 protein crystals made at different pH reveals two metal ions bound 5 &#x0212b; apart in the active site at pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c47">47</xref>), whereas only one metal ion is bound at acidic pH. In addition, the loop regions of Ape1, consisting of residues 100&#x02013;110 and 120&#x02013;125, exhibit significant structural variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c47">47</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent conformational change regulates catalytic activity of Ape1 and may channel the repair of oxidative DNA damage to either the BER or NIR pathways. However, structural studies of the NIR complex are required to fully investigate these phenomena.</p><p>Analysis of the kinetic data presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh165tb1">1</xref> indicates that the primary substrate for Ape1 is a THF residue and although reduced under the NIR-conditions, the AP endonuclease activity of Ape1 is still robust. The <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> value of Ape1 acting upon DHU is 1.5-fold more efficient than the value for hNth1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c50">50</xref>), indicating that DHU might be processed equally well by both BER and NIR (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh165tb1">1</xref>). Overall, a comparison of the kinetic parameters for the BER and NIR activities demonstrates that Ape1 can efficiently back-up the DNA glycosylases to repair DHU adducts.</p><p>To determine the balance between BER and NIR pathways, we measured activities towards DHU&#x000b7;G in HeLa cell-free extracts under different reaction conditions. We found that, at pH 6.8 in the presence of 0.3 mM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, NIR was the major activity in the extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f4">4</xref>A, lane 6). We propose that under certain conditions the extremely high cellular concentration of Ape1 (3.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>&#x02013;7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> molecules/cell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c51">51</xref>) may direct the processing of oxidative DNA damage to the NIR pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>. A 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonucleolytic degradation of the NIR fragment can be seen in cell-free extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f4">4</xref>A, lanes 5 and 6). This activity might be due to FEN-1. Indeed, FEN-1 exonuclease activity is stimulated at low Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and monovalent salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c52">52</xref>). However, to exclude the possibility that the NIR fragment emerges from non-specific 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonuclease activity, we used a 5&#x02032;-labelled DHU&#x000b7;G duplex oligonucleotide in our assay. As expected, incubation of the 30mer oligonucleotide in HeLa cell-free extracts under different reaction conditions gave rise to a 10mer fragment retaining 5&#x02032;-label (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f4">4</xref>B, lanes 6 and 8&#x02013;11). These results exclude the possibility that the NIR fragment generated by the purified Ape1 proteins and cell-free extracts is due to a 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; non-specific exonuclease halting at the modified site. Taken together the results suggest that the repair mode for oxidative DNA damage <italic>in vivo</italic> depends upon the intracellular environment and concentration of a given repair enzyme.</p><p>As the first 61 N-terminal residues of Ape1 are indispensable for redox but not for AP endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c53">53</xref>), we generated a truncated Ape1 lacking the N-terminal 61 amino acids (N&#x00394;61-Ape1) and assayed it for AP endonuclease and NIR activities. Although N&#x00394;61-Ape1 exhibited no decrease in THF&#x000b7;G incision, we observed a 2.5- and 20-fold decrease in NIR activity towards DHU&#x000b7;G and &#x003b1;A&#x000b7;T, respectively, compared with wild type Ape1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh165f5">5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c38">38</xref>). The results indicate that the redox-domain of Ape1 regulates the NIR activity, thus providing insight for an additional role of the Ref domain. Importantly, in known Ape1 crystals the N-terminal 35&#x02013;42 residues were truncated or not visible in the electronic density maps and the final models of Ape1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c48">48</xref>). In conclusion, it is tempting to speculate that the Ref domain was acquired during evolution by an AP endonuclease to repair oxidative damage to both DNA bases and proteins.</p><p>Evolutionary conservation of two types of AP endonucleases with overlapping substrate specificity &#x0005b;Xth and Nfo in <italic>E.coli</italic>, Apn1 and Apn2 in yeast, and Ape1 and Ape2 in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c29">29</xref>)&#x0005d;, highlights the existence of two alternative repair pathways for oxidative DNA damage. However, the biological impact of the different Ape1-DNA repair activities, including NIR, needs further investigation. As Ape1-initiated NIR can excise alpha-anomeric nucleotides, DNA adducts that are not substrates for BER, we suggest that NIR targets oxidative DNA damage formed under natural (anoxic) conditions. Therefore, as NIR and BER also share many common substrates, we propose that they work in concert to cleanse genomic DNA of potentially mutagenic and cytotoxic lesions. This in part, may explain the lack of readily discernable phenotype of DNA glycosylase-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c17">17</xref>) and the increased susceptibility to oxidative stress of Ape1 heterozygous null mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh165c54">54</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_32_1_73__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_1_73__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh165f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Human damage-specific endonuclease purified from HeLa cells is identical to Ape1.
