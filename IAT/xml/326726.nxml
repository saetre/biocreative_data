The sequences of the C gene segment itself and parts of the upstream region were determined both in liver and in myeloma T DNA clones derived from the same mouse inbred strain. The sequences were identical, i.e. no somatic mutations were detected. Two sites in the region not coding for protein are discussed as possible targets of aberrant variable (V) gene translocations. Doublet frequencies were calculated in the approx. 2500 bp of the C region sequence reported in this paper and in the approx. 3400 bp of two rearranged V gene regions.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0228-a" xlink:role="976"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0223.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="971"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0224.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="972"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0225.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="973"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0226.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="974"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0227.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="975"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0228.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="976"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0229.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="977"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0230.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="978"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0231.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="979"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0232.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="980"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0233.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="981"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
