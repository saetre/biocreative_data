Although insulin-mediated improved glucose control reduced cardiovascular events in subjects with type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>), less definitive information is available relating diabetes control and atherosclerosis prevention in type 2 diabetes. Recent findings suggest that hyperglycemia is associated with increased arterial wall inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>) and increased expression of vascular inflammatory molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and E-Selectin (SELE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>); nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>); and inflammatory cytokine production. Fundamental understanding of the effects of diabetes on arterial genes and pathways may contribute to the discovery of new strategies for the treatment of diabetic vascular diseases beyond blood glucose control.</p><p>Animal models of diabetes have been used to study the effects of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance at different stages of disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>) have demonstrated that mouse models of type 2 diabetes such as leptin receptor mutant <italic>db/db</italic> and diet-induced obesity mice have impaired vascular function. Kim et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>) demonstrated that high-fat diet feeding increases expression of markers of vascular inflammation in mouse thoracic aortas. Also, apolipoprotein E knockout <italic>db/db</italic> mice have increased VCAM-1 expression in aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>) and greater aortic sinus atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). However, not all investigators have observed changes in expression of adhesion molecules in <italic>db/db</italic> mouse aortas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>).</p><p>A number of studies have focused on the effects of diabetes on vascular cells. Endothelial cells isolated from <italic>db/db</italic> aortas have increased inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression and more monocyte adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>). The reasons for the altered biology of these cells is thought by many to be due to hyperglycemia; increased glucose concentrations induce interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) secretion and adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells. IL-6/IL-6R&#x003b1; complex can induce an inflammatory phenotype in endothelial cells, promoting SELE, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 expression and monocyte adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we performed gene expression profiling of aortas from two mouse models of type 2 diabetes to identify new genes and pathways that contribute to diabetic vascular diseases. We found that neuronatin (<italic>Nnat</italic>), a gene with unknown vascular function, was upregulated in the aortas of both <italic>db/db</italic> and high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mice. Immunohistochemical studies localized Nnat to the vascular endothelium. To gain insight into the function of this molecule, the effects of adenovirus-induced Nnat expression in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and mouse arteries were studied.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>All procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Male C57BL/6J (strain 000664), <italic>db/db</italic> (Lepr<italic><sup>db/db</sup></italic> strain 000642), and heterozygous littermate (<italic>db</italic>/&#x0002b;) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were maintained in a temperature-controlled barrier facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle and were given free access to food and water. <italic>db/db</italic> mice were killed at 16&#x02013;20 weeks of age. To induce obesity and diabetes, C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat TD03584 diet (Harlan Tekland, Indianapolis, IN) for 16&#x02013;20 weeks starting at the age of 10 weeks. Control mice were fed regular chow. The high-fat diet contained 35&#x00025; fat and 37&#x00025; carbohydrate.</p><sec><title>Mouse aorta endothelial cell isolation.</title><p>Endothelial cells were isolated by sorting with magnetic beads using anti&#x02013;platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31) biotin-conjugated antibody (Millipore). In brief, mice were anesthetized and perfused with 1,000 units/ml heparin in PBS. Aortas were isolated, stripped of perivascular fat, and incubated in RPMI containing 2 mg/ml collagenase 2 and 2 units/ml dispase for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 400<italic>g</italic> at 4&#x000b0;C and washed twice with MACS (magnetic cell sorting) buffer (Hanks&#x02019; balanced salt solution &#x0005b;Ca/Mg free&#x0005d;, 2 mmol/l EDTA, and 0.5&#x00025; BSA). The cells suspension was run through 70- and 40-&#x003bc;m cell strainers. Cells were incubated with CD31 antibody for 15 min, washed and incubated with streptavidin SA-Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) for another 15 min, washed again, and applied to an equilibrated column. After several washes, the column was removed from the magnetic holder, and cells were eluted with MACS buffer. Endothelial cells were collected by centrifugation at 400<italic>g</italic> and processed for RNA isolation.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of adenovirus-encoded <italic>Nnat</italic> in endothelial cells.</title><p>HAECs were obtained from Cambrex Life Science. Cells were grown in endothelial cell growth medium EGM-2 to confluency and were infected with Ad-Nnat, Ad&#x02013;green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP), or Ad-Empty at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 10 unless indicated otherwise. Gene expression was assessed by real-time PCR, and proteins were analyzed by Western blot 48 h after infection. For treatment with tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;), TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;blocking antibody, or kinase inhibitors, cells were treated 24 h after infection for another 24 h. Kinase inhibitors used in the study are 20 &#x003bc;mol/l U0126, 20 &#x003bc;mol/l SP600125, 5 &#x003bc;mol/l IKK-VII, 10 &#x003bc;mol/l SB202190, 50 &#x003bc;mol/l LY294002, and 0.2 &#x003bc;mol/l wortmannin.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time PCR.</title><p>Primers for conventional real-time PCR were designed (supplementary Table S1, available in an online appendix at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db07-1746">http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db07-1746</ext-link>) or obtained from SuperArray Bioscience (Frederick, MD). Expression levels for individual genes were normalized to &#x003b2;-actin in mouse tissue and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in HAECs. For RT<sup>2</sup> Profiler PCR array, 1 &#x003bc;g RNA pool from HAECs infected with adenovirus was used for cDNA synthesis and analysis by human endothelial cell biology RT<sup>2</sup> Profiler PCR array according to manufacturer's instructions (SuperArray Bioscience).</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis.</title><p>Cell homogenates were made in buffer (10 mmol/l Tris-Cl, pH 7.4; 5 mmol/l EDTA; 150 mmol/l NaCl; 10&#x00025; glycerol; and 1&#x00025; Triton X-100) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail for mammalian tissues (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Antibodies used are as follows: inhibitor of &#x003ba;B (I&#x003ba;B)-&#x003b1;, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, extracellular signal&#x02013;related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), NF-&#x003ba;B activating kinase (NAK), p65, and Akt (Cell Signaling Technology); SELE (BioVision); &#x003b2;-actin (ABcam); and TNF-&#x003b1; (BioLegend).</p></sec><sec><title>Gene transfer into mouse carotid artery.</title><p>According to the method of Vassalli et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>), in vivo gene transfer was conducted using Ad-GFP or Ad-Nnat virus. Two days after the adenovirus infection, carotid arteries were isolated and fixed in 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde and processed for immunohistochemical analysis as described above. Intensity of staining was determined in sections from 4 to 7 Ad-Nnat&#x02013;and Ad-GFP&#x02013;infected mouse carotid arteries using Image Pro Plus software.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Gene expression profiling of aortas from diabetic mice.</title><p>Gene expression profiling was performed to identify differentially expressed genes in the aortas of diabetic mice. Metabolic data for <italic>db/db</italic> and high-fat diet&#x02013;fed C67BL6/J mice are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. To create mice with comparable weights and insulin levels, we used 16- to 18-week-old <italic>db/db</italic> mice and &#x0223c;28-week-old high-fat diet&#x02013;fed animals. Glucose levels were higher in <italic>db/db</italic> compared with high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mice, but body weight (47 and 49 g, respectively) and insulin (912 and 775 pmol/l, respectively) were comparable between the two groups. As expected, cholesterol levels were greater in <italic>db/db</italic> than <italic>db</italic>/&#x0002b; mice. Expression of 43 genes increased and expression of 3 genes decreased at least twofold in aortas of <italic>db/db</italic> mice when compared with nondiabetic <italic>db</italic>/&#x0002b; controls (supplementary Table S2). In high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mice, 85 aortic genes were upregulated, and 42 aortic genes were downregulated (supplementary Table S3). Analysis of gene expression across the two diabetic models revealed 10 genes that were differentially expressed in the aortas of diabetic mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>), but there were only 4 genes in which the direction of change was similar. These genes were <italic>Nnat</italic>, leptin, natriuretic peptide receptor 3, and lectin galactose binding, soluble 3. Among these common genes, the most strongly upregulated gene was <italic>Nnat</italic>. Nnat mRNA was upregulated 9-fold in the <italic>db/db</italic> and 2.5-fold in the high-fat diet&#x02013;induced model. Therefore, we elected to focus our subsequent studies on identifying a role for <italic>Nnat</italic> in the aorta of diabetic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Nnat was upregulated in the aortic endothelium of diabetic mice.</title><p>Real-time PCR was performed to quantify <italic>Nnat</italic> expression in the mouse aorta. Nnat mRNA expression was higher in the aorta of <italic>db/db</italic> and high-fat diet&#x02013;fed diabetic mice when compared with littermate controls (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Immunohistochemical staining of mouse aorta localized the Nnat protein in endothelial cells (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). Compared with control mice, the endothelium of <italic>db/db</italic> mice had more intense staining (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). The difference in Nnat staining was less prominent in the aortas from high-fat diet&#x02013;fed compared with chow diet&#x02013;fed control mice, and the difference was not statistically significant (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). Analysis of aorta sections stained with Nnat antibody revealed that not only endothelial cells but also perivascular fat stains positive for Nnat (supplementary Fig. S2).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Nnat</italic> gene expression was increased in endothelial cells of <italic>db/db</italic> mouse aorta.</title><p>To reassure that the increase in <italic>Nnat</italic> is due to endothelial cell expression, we isolated mouse aorta endothelial cells using magnetic bead cell sorting with CD31 antibody. Endothelial cell isolation was confirmed by assessing endothelial-specific (endothelial nitric oxide &#x0005b;NO&#x0005d; synthase, vascular endothelial&#x02013;cadherin), macrophage-specific (<italic>F4/80</italic>), and fibroblast- and smooth muscle cell&#x02013;specific (<italic>Col3a</italic>) gene expression in CD31-positive and -negative cells (supplementary Fig. S2<italic>A</italic>). <italic>&#x003b1;-Nnat</italic> expression was increased approximately fourfold in the <italic>db/db</italic> endothelial cell preparations (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>), whereas total nnat expression was increased only approximately twofold (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>E</italic></xref>); the confirmation that this analysis detected both &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-isoforms of Nnat in mouse endothelial cells is shown in <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>F</italic></xref>. Because total Nnat expression changed less than &#x003b1;-Nnat, it is likely that &#x003b2;-Nnat expression did not change or decreased in these mice.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Nnat</italic> expression in cultured primary aortic endothelial cells.</title><p>The effects of Nnat expression were investigated in cultured HAECs. At baseline conditions, real-time PCR and Western blotting studies revealed low levels of transcript and no detectable protein in these cells (data not shown). To determine whether metabolic stimuli would induce <italic>Nnat</italic> expression, HAECs were cultured for 1&#x02013;4 days in the presence of 25 mmol/l glucose, 100 ng/ml leptin, or 10 &#x003bc;g/ml insulin. These manipulations did not increase <italic>Nnat</italic> gene expression (data not shown). Because <italic>Nnat</italic> is an imprinted gene, it was possible that <italic>Nnat</italic> expression was repressed by DNA methylation. Treatment of HAECs with 5-Aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine (ADC), an inhibitor of DNA methyl transferase, increased Nnat mRNA levels (supplementary Figure S4<italic>A</italic>). Treatment of the cells with high-glucose insulin and leptin after induction of Nnat expression with ADC did not result in the further increase of Nnat (supplementary Figure S4<italic>B</italic>).</p><p>HAECs were infected with an Ad-Nnat to determine the downstream effects of Nnat expression. Western blotting revealed high levels of the Nnat protein in infected cells (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>; see below). Because the function of Nnat in endothelium was unknown, we compared gene expression in endothelial cells infected with Ad-Nnat to that of an empty adenovirus control (Ad-Empty) using an endothelial cell biology RT<sup>2</sup> Profiler PCR array. Of 84 endothelial-specific genes, 27 were differentially regulated in Ad-Nnat&#x02013;infected cells. Twenty-one genes were increased, and six were decreased (supplementary Table S4). Among the increased genes, four major groups were apparent: <italic>1</italic>) cytokines (IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-7, IL-11, and TNF-&#x003b1;) and chemokines (CX3CL1 and CCL2); <italic>2</italic>) adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and SELE); <italic>3</italic>) growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial cell growth factor-1, and placental growth factor); and <italic>4</italic>) extracellular matrix proteases/inhibitors (matrix metallopeptidase-1; serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade E, member-1; and plasminogen activator urokinase). The changes in TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, MCP-1 (CCL2), ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and SELE expression in Ad-Nnat&#x02013;infected cells were verified by real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>). These results suggest that Nnat expression activates endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Nnat expression activates NF-&#x003ba;B in endothelial cells.</title><p>Many genes induced by Nnat expression in HAECs are regulated by NF-&#x003ba;B. To study this, HAECs were infected with increasing numbers of Ad-Nnat particles per cell from MOI 3 to 20. At MOI 10&#x02013;20, Nnat protein expression paralleled with I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; decrease and with ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 protein (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>) and IL-6 mRNA increase (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Time course analysis of Nnat expression also demonstrated that accumulation of Nnat protein was accompanied by an increase of immunoreactive NAK, a decrease in I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1;, and an increase in phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of the NF-&#x003ba;B transcription complex (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). Increases in IL-6 accompanied the time-dependent increase in Nnat expression and activation of NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>D</italic></xref>). ICAM-1 and TNF-&#x003b1; mRNA expression also increased with time, and IL-1&#x003b2; and SELE were increased only after 48 h (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Nnat- versus TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced activation of NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor.</title><p>Additional experiments were performed to identify the signal transduction pathways by which Nnat activated NF-&#x003ba;B in endothelial cells. Because Nnat induced TNF-&#x003b1; mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>), we entertained the possibility that Nnat might induce inflammatory gene expression through stimulation of TNF-&#x003b1; release by the cell, leading to ligation of TNF-&#x003b1; cell surface receptors. Cells were first infected with Ad-Nnat to determine whether Nnat expression would result in activation of NF-&#x003ba;B in the presence of exogenous TNF-&#x003b1;. Treatment of Ad-Empty&#x02013;infected HAECs with TNF-&#x003b1; decreased I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; protein level (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Treatment of Nnat-expressing HAECs with TNF-&#x003b1; further decreased I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; protein.</p><p>We then removed any cellular TNF-&#x003b1; using a neutralizing antibody. This did not block the Nnat-mediated decrease in I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; protein (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>), increase in ICAM-1 mRNA, or increase in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 protein expression (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). Expression of VCAM-1 was increased with antibody treatment; VCAM-1 shedding was decreased by TNF-&#x003b1; absence in the culture media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>).</p><p>IL-6 mRNA expression, another read-out for NF-&#x003ba;B activation, was increased by TNF-&#x003b1;, and this was further augmented by Ad-Nnat viral infection (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>). TNF-&#x003b1; neutralizing antibody blocked the TNF-&#x003b1; induced increase in <italic>IL-6</italic> gene expression but had no effect on Nnat induced <italic>IL-6</italic> gene expression. These data indicate that Nnat activates the NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor and induces inflammatory gene expression by a pathway that does not require cell surface TNF-&#x003b1; receptor activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Nnat expression in HAEC-activated kinases.</title><p>As we have shown above, Nnat expression increased NAK and phospho-p65 and decreased I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; protein. To learn what kinases were involved in the signal transduction from Nnat to NAK or p65 phosphorylation, we looked at mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and compared it with that of TNF-&#x003b1;. Nnat expression induced phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and ERK kinase (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>E</italic></xref>). TNF-&#x003b1; treatment of HAECs induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK kinase but decreased Nnat-induced ERK phosphorylation. Nnat expression in HAECs also induced Akt phosphorylation (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>F</italic></xref>), suggesting a role in activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase).</p></sec><sec><title>Nnat induced signal transduction in endothelial cells.</title><p>To test whether Nnat-induced kinase phosphorylation was involved in activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, we treated Ad-Nnat&#x02013;infected endothelial cells with p38 (SB202190), JNK1,2,3 (SP600125), ERK1/2 kinase (U0126), PI 3-kinase (LY294002 and wortmannin), or I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK) (IKK-VII) inhibitors (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). SB202190, LY294002, wortmannin, and IKKVII blocked the Nnat-induced I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; degradation and increase in VCAM-1 protein. U0126 had the opposite effect; it further increased VCAM-1 expression. SP600125 deceased VCAM-1 protein expression without affecting I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; protein levels. LY294002 and wortmannin partially decreased phosphorylation of p65 subunit. SB202190, SP600125, and IKK-VII had no effect. Both LY294002 and SB202190 blocked (&#x0223c;95&#x00025;) the increase in IL-6 and SELE gene expression in Ad-Nnat&#x02013;infected endothelial cells (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). U0126 had the opposite effect and increased IL-6 and SELE expression. SP600125 inhibitor only partially (&#x0223c;40&#x00025;) blocked the Nnat-mediated increase in IL-6 but not SELE expression. U0126 inhibited ERK phosphorylation and increased <italic>p</italic>-JNK and <italic>p</italic>-AKT. SB202190 decreased AKT and increased ERK phosphorylation. SP600125 decreased JNK and p38 phosphorylation without having an effect on others. This inhibitor is able to inhibit kinases upstream of p38 and JNK. We could speculate that partial inhibition of IL-6 but not SELE expression by this compound is a result of blocking kinase upstream from p38 but not JNK itself. LY294002 and wortmannin blocked Nnat-induced phosphorylation of NAK, p38, and JNK, suggesting that these kinases are downstream from PI 3-kinase. IKK-VII treatment blocked I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; degradation and did not effect p65 phosphorylation. On the other hand, IKK-VII inhibited phosphorylation of all three MAPKs. As summarized in <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>D</italic></xref>, Nnat effects on NF-&#x003ba;B appear to be mediated via PI 3-kinase and p38 and inhibited by ERK1/2.</p></sec><sec><title>Adenovirus-induced expression of Nnat in mouse carotid arteries.</title><p>To test whether Nnat can induce adhesion molecule expression in endothelium in vivo, Ad-Nnat or Ad-GFP was injected into carotid arteries of C57BL/6J wild-type mice. Mouse arteries were harvested 2 days after infection, and arterial sections were processed for determination of immunoreactive Nnat and VCAM-1. Ad-Nnat increased the intensity of staining for the Nnat protein in the endothelium approximately fourfold. Staining for VCAM-1 increased by ninefold compared with staining of arteries that had been infected with Ad-GFP (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). These data demonstrate that expression of Nnat in endothelium induces endothelial expression of adhesion molecules in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, using Affymetrix arrays, we found that <italic>Nnat</italic>, a gene with unknown vascular functions, was upregulated in both <italic>db/db</italic> and high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mouse aortas. Diabetes-associated changes in gene expression were quite different between the two mouse models. Although insulin resistance was present in both <italic>db/db</italic> and high-fat diet&#x02013;fed mice, the <italic>db/db</italic> mouse has higher glucose levels. The degree of metabolic abnormalities, the duration of diabetes (longer in <italic>db/db</italic>), and the effect of the high-fat diet may be responsible for the differences in gene expression across the two diabetic models. Some gene expression changes found only in <italic>db/db</italic> aortas are known to be associated with obesity or diabetes. Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4), which is increased in the <italic>db/db</italic> aorta, inhibits lipoprotein lipase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). ANGPTL4 also markedly inhibits the proliferation, chemotaxis, and tubule formation of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>). Two genes, other than leptin and Nnat, were increased in both models of obesity and insulin resistance: lectin, galactose binding, soluble 3, galectin-3 (LGALS3) and natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (Npr3). LGALS3 produces a receptor that interacts with advanced glycation end products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>). Npr3 encodes for a receptor for natriuretic peptides, which are important in the maintenance of blood pressure and extracellular fluid volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). Another gene differentially expressed in this model is transthyretin. Blood levels of transthyretin are increased in serum of humans with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>).</p><p>Immunohistochemical staining revealed that Nnat was expressed on the vascular endothelium. The function of Nnat in vascular tissue is unknown. Previous studies identified Nnat mRNA in the developing rat brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>). <italic>Nnat</italic> is an imprinted gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>) and is expressed in neonatal mouse brain, eye, bladder, colon, and lung; mouse and human pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>); and mouse pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>). <italic>Nnat</italic> expression in pancreas appears to be regulated by the &#x003b2;2 transcription factor, also known as NeuroD1. Knockdown of Nnat with small interfering RNA in the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell line NIT1 deceased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>).</p><p>It is not clear why <italic>Nnat</italic> expression was increased in endothelial cells of obese and diabetic mice. <italic>Nnat</italic> is an imprinted gene because its expression should be increased by hypomethylation. Recent studies by several groups found changes in concentrations of <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and <italic>S</italic>-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) associated with diabetes in human subjects and in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>). SAM is a universal donor of methyl groups. Increased intracellular SAH levels are associated with DNA hypomethylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>). Patients with vascular disease had significantly higher plasma SAH concentrations and significantly lower plasma SAM-to-SAH ratios and genomic DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>). Glycine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase (GNMT) is the enzyme that converts SAM to SAH. We found a dramatic increase in GNMT in aortas of <italic>db/db</italic> versus control mice (supplementary <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>) and speculated that the elevated levels of this enzyme increased SAH levels and caused DNA hypomethylation and greater <italic>Nnat</italic> expression. We found that treatment of HAECs with DNA methyl transferase inhibitor ADC increased Nnat transcript expression. ADC also induced Nnat expression in HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>). It is interesting to note that the leptin gene, which was also dramatically increased in aortas, is regulated by promoter methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>) and could also have been induced by hypomethylation.</p><p>To investigate the function of Nnat in endothelial cells, Nnat was expressed in HAECs using adenovirus mediated gene transfer. Nnat expression induced a gene expression pattern characteristic of endothelial cell activation with increased inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6), endothelial cell adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and SELE), and chemokine (MCP-1) expression. Nnat expression also induced VCAM-1 expression in the mouse carotid artery. ICAM-1 expression was variable and did not show a statistically significant increase (data not shown). It is possible that the increased Nnat in the arteries of the diabetic mice increased inflammatory responses under certain conditions.</p><p>Cell adhesion molecule and inflammatory cytokine gene expression is regulated by NF-&#x003ba;B. Expression of Nnat in HAECs increased expression of NAK, decreased I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; protein, and increased phosphorylation of the p65 subunit, consistent with the activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B transcription complex. TNF-&#x003b1; treatment of endothelial cells activates JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>). In our study, TNF-&#x003b1; increased JNK1/2 and p38 and inhibited Nnat-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. To understand whether Nnat overexpression directly induced degradation of I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; or increased TNF-&#x003b1; triggered activation of other NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;regulated genes, HAECs were transduced with Ad-Nnat and incubated in medium containing TNF-&#x003b1; antibody. TNF-&#x003b1; antibody did not block Nnat-induced activation of gene expression. Therefore, Nnat effects do not appear to involve extracellular TNF-&#x003b1; interaction with cell surface receptors.</p><p>We attempted to define the pathway whereby Nnat induced inflammatory gene expression. We showed that Nnat expression in HAECs induced phosphorylation of p38, JNK, ERK, and Akt. Increased Akt suggested involvement of PI 3-kinase in signal transduction from Nnat to NF-&#x003ba;B. PI 3-kinase inhibitors blocked Nnat-induced activation of IL-6 and SELE gene and VCAM-1 protein expression. SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 kinase, also blocked Nnat-induced expression of IL-6 and SELE genes. Shedding of VCAM-1 protein from cell membrane is regulated by p38 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>); therefore, the seemingly paradoxical increase in VCAM-1 protein by SB202190 might be secondary to blocked shedding of this protein from the cell surface. As expected, VCAM-1 expression was blocked by an IKK inhibitor. Inhibition of JNK had no effect on SELE but decreased IL-6 mRNA and VCAM-1 protein expression.</p><p>NF-&#x003ba;B signaling can be inhibited at several levels, including phosphorylation of I&#x003ba; B-&#x003b1; and p65. Nnat-induced decrease in I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1; protein level was reversed by IKK, p38, and PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Blocking IKK or p38 had no effect on phosphorylation of p65 subunit, whereas JNK1/2 and PI 3-kinase inhibitors decreased P-p65. Even though Nnat increased JNK phosphorylation, the role of this kinase in signal transduction from Nnat to NF-&#x003ba;B is not clear. Partial inhibition of gene expression by SP600125 could have resulted from decrease in p65 phosphorylation. It is also possible that JNK activates other transcription factors that work in concert with NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>In contrast, inhibition of ERK kinase augmented Nnat-induced activation of NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;regulated gene (IL-6 and SELE) and protein (VCAM-1) expression. Several investigators found inhibitory effects of ERK on NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor&#x02013;regulated gene expression; ERK inhibits IKK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>), p65 subunit phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>), and TATA binding protein phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>).</p><p>In summary, using a gene discovery approach, we identified <italic>Nnat</italic> as a gene upregulated in the aortas of two mouse models of obesity and type 2 diabetes, <italic>db/db</italic> and high-fat&#x02013;fed mice. The Nnat protein was localized to the aortic endothelium. Overexpression of Nnat in HAECs or in mouse carotid artery increased endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression. This effect of Nnat was mediated through PI 3-kinase/p38&#x02013;dependent activation of NF-&#x003ba;B. <italic>Nnat</italic> is an imprinted gene, and its expression in diabetes might reflect alterations in the methylation status of endothelial cells. We conclude that Nnat is a candidate molecule involved in inflammatory pathways associated with obesity and insulin resistance. Experiments to alter <italic>Nnat</italic> gene expression in genetically modified mice are underway to assess whether Nnat expression will promote endothelial dysfunction and/or accelerate the development of atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1"
