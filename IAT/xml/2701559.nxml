Knockdowns of individual Cdx genes lead to a similar range of posterior defects; compound Cdx knockdowns result in increasingly severe posterior truncations, accompanied by posterior shifts and reduction of 5&#x02032; Hox gene expression. We provide evidence that Cdx and Wnt3A genes are components of a positive feedback loop operating in the posterior axis. We show that Cdx function is required during later, but not early stages of development, for correct regional specification of the endoderm and morphogenesis of the gut. Our results support the hypothesis that during amphibian development the overall landscape of Cdx activity in the embryo is more important than the specific function of individual Cdx proteins. <italic>Developmental Dynamics 238:835&#x02013;852, 2009</italic>. &#x000a9; 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cdx</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd><kwd>Hox</kwd><kwd>caudal</kwd><kwd>mesoderm</kwd><kwd>endoderm</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>wnt</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The Cdx family of homedomain transcription factors has conserved functions in the development of several animal groups. The prototype of the Cdx family is the <italic>caudal</italic> gene, which is required for normal posterior development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">MacDonald and Struhl, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Mlodzik and Gehring, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Mlodzik et al., 1987</xref>). The Cdx class, together with the Gsx and Pdx classes, comprise the ParaHox family of homeobox genes. In the cephalochordate amphioxus, the single representatives of each ParaHox class are clustered, having a similar genomic organization to that of the closely related Hox gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Brooke et al., 1998</xref>). In the vertebrate lineage sequential genome duplication has led to cluster expansion and subsequent degeneration, such that the typical vertebrate genome contains the remains of four ParaHox gene clusters but only three Cdx genes (<italic>Cdx1</italic>, <italic>Cdx2</italic>, and <italic>Cdx4</italic>). Only <italic>Cdx2</italic> remains clustered with members of the Pdx and Gsx classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Ferrier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Illes et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of Cdx gene expression in several vertebrate species, including mouse, chick, fish, and frog shows that Cdx genes are initially expressed during gastrula stages in overlapping domains in the mesoderm; subsequently, they are expressed in all three germ layers in dynamic patterns in the posterior of the developing body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Gamer and Wright, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Meyer and Gruss, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Marom et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Pillemer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Reece-Hoyes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Gaunt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Lohnes, 2003</xref>). The expression patterns of the Cdx genes resemble that of the Hox genes, in that all Cdx genes are typically expressed in the posterior of the embryo but each individual Cdx gene exhibits a different anterior boundary of expression. This produces a nested set of Cdx gene expression, establishing a gradient of Cdx activity along the posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Marom et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Pillemer et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Gene inhibition and overexpression studies in several chordates including ascidians, fish, frogs, chick, and mouse have shown that the role of Cdx genes in posterior development has been conserved during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Subramanian et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Pownall et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Epstein et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Katsuyama et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bel-Vialar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">van den Akker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Davidson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Lohnes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chawengsaksophak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Shimizu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">van Nes et al., 2006</xref>). Cumulative evidence suggests that <italic>Cdx</italic> factors act as transducers of positional information by regulating the boundaries of <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Charite et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">van den Akker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gaunt et al., 2004</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2008</xref>).</p><p>In keeping with their regulatory role during axis development, Cdx proteins are crucial factors involved in anteroposterior patterning of the digestive tract. The regulation of gene expression in the digestive tract by Cdx proteins in vertebrates is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Beck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Guo et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Cdx2</italic> misexpression has been implicated in homeotic anterior to posterior transformation in the gut epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Mutoh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Silberg et al., 2002</xref>), indicating a role for Cdx genes in establishing regional identity.</p><p>Single and double gene knockout and knockdown experiments in various species support roles for Cdx gene function in anteroposterior patterning of the main body axis. However, establishing a clear picture of the overall role of the Cdx family in these processes is difficult because individual Cdx genes exhibit significant overlap of expression during early development. It is, therefore, likely that there is some functional redundancy among the Cdx genes and that some degree of compensation may occur in the event of single and double gene deficiencies. This underlines the importance of undertaking studies involving inhibition of the activity of the full complement of Cdx genes present in model vertebrate organisms.</p><p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic> the three Cdx genes were originally designated <italic>Xcad1</italic>, <italic>Xcad2</italic>, and <italic>Xcad3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Pillemer et al., 1998</xref>). However, for the sake of consistency, we have adopted the human and mouse nomenclature for the frog Cdx genes. Thus, <italic>Xcad1</italic> is the orthologue of amniote <italic>Cdx2</italic>, and <italic>Xcad2</italic>, and <italic>Xcad3</italic> are the orthologues of <italic>Cdx1</italic> and <italic>Cdx4</italic>, respectively.</p><p>In the present study, we have undertaken a systematic analysis of the developmental effects resulting from single and compound knockdown of the three <italic>Cdx</italic> family members in the frog <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> using translation blocking antisense morpholino oligos (MOs).

Similar ranges of developmental abnormalities are seen when each individual <italic>Cdx</italic> gene is knocked down, indicating that the <italic>Cdx</italic> genes have overlapping functions in posterior axial development. However, the increased severity of the phenotypes in the compound knockdowns argue in favor of a cooperative effect of <italic>Cdx</italic> genes on posterior patterning.</p><p>We present data indicating that the amphibian Cdx genes are components of gene regulatory pathways, involving Wnt ligands and 5&#x02032; Hox genes, that are required for morphogenesis and patterning in the posterior of the main body axis during postgastrula stages. In addition, we find a requirement for Cdx function in the normal morphogenesis and regional specification of the amphibian gut during later stages of development. Data in this study support the hypothesis that, during early amphibian development, individual <italic>Cdx</italic> genes have overlapping function and that in a given region of the embryo, it is the overall level of Cdx activity that is relevant, rather than the specific function of individual Cdx proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Antisense Morpholino Oligos That Block <italic>Cdx</italic> Translation</title><p>Antisense morpholino oligos (AMOs) targeted to the initiating AUG and/or the 5&#x02032; UTR of the <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic><italic>Cdx1</italic>, <italic>Cdx2</italic>, and <italic>Cdx4</italic> mRNAs were tested for their ability to block translation of myc-epitope tagged Cdx proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>).

A second set of translation blocking Cdx MOs (set-2 in the Experimental Procedures section) also inhibit translation of their respective targets but less efficiently (data not shown).

To facilitate comparison between experiments, we have classified the range of knockdown phenotypes at swimming larval stage 41 into types 1, 2, and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). Type 1 embryos display a mild shortening of the axis and a &#x0201c;pigeon chested&#x0201d; appearance; development of the head is relatively normal.

As mentioned earlier, single and double Cdx knockdowns using the set-1 MOs result in similar profiles of phenotypes; however, the triple Cdx knockdown results in a much higher proportion of the more severe type 3 phenotype. Triple Cdx knockdown using the set-2 MOs produced similar effects on axial development but with reduced number of type 3 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>), consistent with their reduced efficiency at blocking target Cdx protein translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>, and data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Specificity of the <italic>Cdx</italic> Knockdown Phenotype</title><p>As an important test of the specificity of knockdown MOs, we show that the mutant Cdx protein Xcad-VP16 rescues the effects on axial development resulting from Cdx knockdown. XcadVP16 consists of an amino-terminal fusion of the transcriptional activation domain from the viral VP16 protein to the DNA binding domain of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> Cdx4 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Isaacs et al., 1998</xref>). Xcad-VP16 mimics the activity of native Cdx protein but the 5&#x02032; end of the Xcad-VP16 mRNA is not targeted by the Cdx translation blocking MOs.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2D</xref> shows that injection of 5 pg of XcadVP16 mRNA produces an anterior truncation phenotype, similar to that previously reported for overexpression of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> Cdx4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Isaacs et al., 1998</xref>). Injection of XcadVP16 mRNA in the 10- to 15-pg range produces a very strong phenotype characterized by a vestigial dorsal axis (data not shown). Injecting a combination of Cdx1, Cdx2, and Cdx4 MOs results in the typical, highly penetrant posterior truncation phenotype (100%, n = 32). However, co-injection of Xcad-VP16 mRNA, in the 5- to 10-pg range, with the Cdx MOs rescues axial abnormalities in a dose dependent manner (85%, n = 72). The phenotype of embryos co-injected with the Cdx MOs and 15 pg of XcadVP16 mRNA exhibit mild anterior truncations, similar to that produced by the injection of low doses of XcadVP16 mRNA alone.</p><p>Of interest, this anterior truncation phenotype is mild compared with that resulting from injection of 15 pg of XcadVP16 mRNA alone (data not shown). These data indicate that the observed effects in this rescue experiment result from integration of Cdx activity present within the embryo and suggest that the overall level of Cdx activity plays a critical role in regulating axial development.</p><p>As another test of the specificity of the knockdown effects, five base mismatch MOs were injected into embryos. At a given concentration, five mismatch MOs give far lower numbers of abnormal embryos than do the translation blocking MOs. Co-injecting a combination Cdx1, Cdx2, and Cdx4 MOs results in 67% (n = 87) abnormal embryos, compared to 5% abnormal for uninjected stage control embryos (n = 137). In contrast, co-injecting the same amounts of the corresponding mismatch MOs results in just 12% (n = 128) abnormally developing embryos. This is similar to the approximately 10% of abnormal embryos typically observed after injection of the standard control MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>, and data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue Organization in <italic>Cdx</italic> Knockdown Embryos</title><p>Our data indicate that injection of the triple Cdx knockdown MO combination in the range 20 to 40 ng per embryo produces a highly penetrant phenotype. Based upon these findings, in subsequent experiments, we used injection of these amounts or pro rata amounts for injection into individual cells. Due to the endodermal degeneration observed in tail bud embryos injected with 40 ng of the triple Cdx knockdown MO cocktail, injections in experiments requiring culture to later tail bud stages were limited to 20 ng. To control for nonspecific effects that might arise from the injection of a given mass of MO, in experiments comparing the effects of single, double, or triple knockdowns, the total amount of MO injected was divided equally between the constituent MOs.</p><p>We undertook histology on type 2 and type 3 embryos to analyze the effects resulting from triple Cdx knockdown on the differentiation and patterning of the major tissues. The length of the main body axis is severely reduced in the knockdown embryos; despite this, within the remaining vestigial axis the organization of the major axial tissues (notochord and neural tube) is relatively normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Paraxial tissues, such as the somites, are present and exhibit segmentation similar to that seen in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A&#x02013;C</xref>). However, we note that the typical three ventricle organization of forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain of the anterior nervous system is lost and is reduced to a single enlarged ventricle in the high grade type 3 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3C</xref>).

Double Cdx1+2 knockdowns produced a more severe phenotype, with the majority of the embryos displaying an almost linear, tubular gut structure (66%, n = 30; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10L</xref> and insert).</p><p>It could be argued that such effects on gut development might be secondary to the primary effects on axial development. As a way to discriminate the effect of Cdx knockdown in gut development from axial patterning, combined Cdx1 and Cdx2 knockdown MOs were targeted to the presumptive endoderm of the vegetal hemisphere. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10M</xref> shows that embryos injected with Cdx1+Cdx2 MOs into the four vegetal hemisphere cells at the eight cell stage exhibit rather normal axial development. However, severe disruption of gut coiling is still observed, with embryos either exhibiting a simple, linear, or an S-shaped gut (51% and 20%, respectively, n = 45).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The presence of multiple Cdx genes in vertebrate genomes with overlapping expression and upstream regulators raises questions with regard to redundancy in Cdx gene function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Lohnes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Keenan et al., 2006</xref>). This issue is addressed in the present study, where for the first time we report the developmental effects of knocking down the function all three Cdx genes in a vertebrate genome. In common with many gene knockdown studies, we are unable to determine the amount of residual Cdx activity present in knockdown embryos and the degree to which this remaining activity ameliorates the observed effects. Despite this caveat, several conclusions can be drawn from our study.</p><sec><title>Overlapping <italic>Cdx</italic> Function During Axial Elongation</title><p>Our data show that single knockdowns of amphibian Cdx1, Cdx2, or Cdx4 result in a broadly similar spectrum of effects on posterior axial development, indicating that individual amphibian Cdx genes have overlapping roles in posterior development. The triple knockdown gives rise to a marked increase in severity of the posterior defects. These observations argue for a model in which it is the overall level of Cdx activity in the posterior, rather the distinct function of individual Cdx genes which is required for posterior axial extension. Support for this hypothesis comes from our observation that the posterior truncation phenotype can be rescued by expression of a single mutant Cdx protein (Xcad-VP16). Furthermore, we show that double Cdx combination knockdowns can be rescued by overexpressing the third nontargeted wild-type Cdx protein. We note that rescue with the wild-type proteins is somewhat less efficient than that achieved with the mutant Cdx protein and might indicate that the wild-type Cdx proteins are subject to regulatory interactions that are not apparent with the mutant protein. Further evidence of overlapping function is provided by the additive effects of knockdown on the expression of genes in Cdx regulated pathways, such as the 5&#x02032; Hox genes, and on the development of the digestive tract, both of which are discussed in detail below.</p><p>Although we provide evidence that the amphibian Cdx proteins have similar biological activities in the processes analyzed in this study, we cannot exclude that, in a given context, individual Cdx proteins have different biological activities. Further studies involving the analysis of global changes in gene transcription, in response to knockdown of individual Cdx proteins, will be required to address this issue.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Cdx</italic> Regulation of Posterior Hox Genes</title><p>There is ample evidence from both <italic>Xenopus</italic> and other vertebrate models that Cdx function is linked to posterior Hox gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Subramanian et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chawengsaksophak et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Epstein et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Isaacs et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">van den Akker et al., 2002</xref>). However, the relationship between Cdx levels and posterior Hox expression remains unclear. Some general principles can be drawn form the present study.</p><p>In Cdx knockdown embryos, we see effects on Hox genes from the onset of their expression (late gastrula stages) through neurula stages, indicating that Cdx function is required from early stages of development to establish and then maintain correct domains of 5&#x02032; Hox gene expression. Our data provide some evidence that knockdown of amphibian Cdx4 has somewhat stronger effects on Hox gene expression than does the single knockdown of Cdx1 or Cdx2. However, the picture that emerges is that a given Cdx gene does not regulate a subset of target 5&#x02032; Hox genes, but rather it is the overall level of Cdx activity in the embryo that is critical for normal posterior Hox gene expression. The increased effect of the triple Cdx knockdowns over the single knockdowns on Hox gene expression, and the increased effect of the double Cdx1+2 knockdown compared to the single Cdx1 or Cdx2 knockdown shown in this study also support this view. These data are in keeping with previous studies indicating that a gradient of Cdx activity in the posterior axis is required for establishing the boundaries of posterior Hox gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Marom et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">van den Akker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gaunt et al., 2004</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2008</xref>).</p><p>A previous study from our laboratory used an antimorphic Cdx protein (XcadEnR) containing the DNA binding domain form Cdx4 to investigate Cdx function in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Isaacs et al., 1998</xref>). This mutant acts as constitutive repressor of transcription from Cdx target genes. The inhibition of posterior elongation resulting from Cdx knockdown reported here is broadly in keeping with the phenotypes that result from overexpression of XcadEnR. However, high level expression of the antimorphic protein gives rise to a much stronger phenotype of extreme posterior truncation than is seen with the knockdown strategy. This is to be expected given that overexpression of the antimorphic protein represents gain of function rather than loss of function. Similar phenotypic effects have also been reported for another antimorphic Cdx protein derived from the Cdx1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Levy et al., 2002</xref>). In keeping with the present study, overexpression of XcadEnR inhibits Hox gene expression through gastrula and neurula stages and has little effect on the expression of the mesodermal marker <italic>brachyury</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Other <italic>Cdx</italic> Regulated Pathways in the Early Embryo</title><p>We did not detect effects on the early expression of the key germ layer regulators <italic>brachyury</italic> or <italic>Sox17b</italic> in Cdx knockdown embryos. This indicates that mesoderm and endoderm are specified, although at present we cannot exclude the possibility that Cdx knockdown has other effects on the patterning of early mesodermal tissues. Similarly, we find that, despite the obvious deficit of posterior dorsal axial and paraxial tissue in later development, early markers of these tissues are unaffected by Cdx knockdown, suggesting that Cdx genes regulate other pathways than those required for the initial specification these tissues.</p><p>Canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways play key roles in the patterning and morphogenesis of the vertebrate posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Takada et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Wallingford, 2004</xref>). Cdx regulation of these pathways provides a possible mechanism that underlies the observed Cdx knockdown phenotype of reduced axial elongation and subsequent inhibition of tail bud outgrowth. Our data support this hypothesis; we show that expression of the <italic>Wnt3A</italic> and <italic>Wnt5A</italic> ligand genes are downregulated in response to Cdx knockdown. Furthermore, we show that increasing Cdx activity upregulates expression of <italic>Wnt3A</italic> and <italic>Wnt5A</italic> in both whole embryos and tissue explants. However, our data do not indicate if the regulation of Wnt genes is direct or requires the activation of intermediate pathway components by Cdx proteins.</p><p>Wnt5a is a regulator of morphogenesis acting through a noncanonical pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Wallingford et al., 2001</xref>). Consistent with our findings with Cdx knockdown embryos, it has been shown that zebrafish <italic>wnt5</italic> (<italic>pipetail</italic>) mutants gastrulate normally but subsequently exhibit abnormal posterior morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Kilian et al., 2003</xref>). It appears that, in <italic>pipetail</italic> mutant fish, Wnt11 is able to compensate for the lack of Wnt5 activity during gastrula stages, allowing normal gastrulation movements. Subsequently, there is increasing reliance on Wnt5 function to regulate posterior morphogenesis. In keeping with such a model, our data show that in contrast to <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, <italic>Wnt11</italic> expression is unaffected by Cdx knockdown and morphogenetic activity associated with gastrulation movements are normal. As with the <italic>pipetail</italic> mutant, subsequent posterior morphogenesis is inhibited by Cdx knockdown. It has also been noted that the phenotype of the <italic>Wnt5a</italic> null mouse is very similar to that reported for <italic>Cdx1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic></sup>/<sup><italic>+/&#x02212;</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Yamaguchi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">van den Akker et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that the reduced elongation of isolated dorsal and ventral half explants during the neurula to tail bud stage is in part due to inhibition of Wnt5a signaling. However, at present, there is no direct evidence to support a role for noncanonical Wnt signaling in regulating the cell rearrangements involved in dorsal or ventral elongation during these stages.</p><p>The canonical Wnt ligand Wnt3A is another important regulator of posterior development in vertebrates. <italic>Wnt3a</italic> null mice embryos lack posterior somites and fail to form a tail bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Takada et al., 1994</xref>). In addition, Wnt3A has been implicated as a signal involved in the out growth of the tail bud during amphibian development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Beck and Slack, 1999</xref>). It has been proposed the Wnt3A is a key regulator of Cdx gene expression in the mouse and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Shimizu et al., 2005</xref>). Our data indicate that Cdx function is itself required for normal <italic>Wnt3A</italic> expression in the postgastrula embryo, suggesting that Wnt3A and Cdx factors are components of a regulatory loop necessary for normal posterior development.</p><p>Wnt3A and Cdx2 knockout mice exhibit similar phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chawengsaksophak et al., 2004</xref>). Early <italic>Wnt3A</italic> expression in the primitive streak is normal in <italic>Cdx2</italic> null mice but by the nine somite stage its expression is reduced relative to control embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chawengsaksophak et al., 2004</xref>). Reduced <italic>Wnt3A</italic> expression at this stage was interpreted as resulting from an overall reduction in posterior development. This is unlikely to be the case in <italic>Xenopus</italic> because we detect reduced <italic>Wnt3A</italic> expression in a region of the embryo where expression of other markers such as <italic>MyoD</italic>, <italic>Wnt11</italic>, and <italic>brachyury</italic> are unaffected.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Cdx</italic> Function in Development of the Amphibian Gut</title><p>Due to its complex, developmentally structured architecture, the vertebrate gut provides an excellent system to study the effect of factors involved in the anteroposterior patterning. In this regard, there is evidence showing that Cdx genes are involved in the regional specification of the gut. Heterozygote <italic>Cdx2</italic> knockout mice develop polyp-like lesions in the caecum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Chawengsaksophak et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Beck et al., 1999</xref>). The presence of anterior-type epithelial morphology in these lesions, and the finding that ectopic <italic>Cdx2</italic> gene expression in the stomach results in a transformation of the gastric mucosa to a more posterior intestinal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Mutoh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Silberg et al., 2002</xref>), indicate that the Cdx genes act as homeotic genes to define the identity of the intestinal territory.</p><p>It has also been shown that Cdx factors are required for differentiation of the intestinal epithelium. Several studies indicate that Cdx factors directly regulate the expression from several intestine specific differentiation genes, including <italic>sucrose isomaltase</italic>, <italic>MUC2</italic>, and <italic>KLF4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Guo et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In common with other vertebrates, <italic>Xenopus</italic><italic>Cdx1</italic> and <italic>Cdx2</italic> are expressed in the endoderm of the small and large intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Chalmers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Reece-Hoyes et al., 2002</xref>). We show that loss of Cdx activity in the early embryo does not alter the expression of the endodermal markers <italic>Xsox17b</italic>, <italic>darmin</italic>, and <italic>vito</italic>, indicating that initial endodermal specification is not affected by Cdx knockdown. Regional specification of the endoderm occurs rather late in <italic>Xenopus</italic> development, between tail bud and tadpole stages 25 and 35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Horb and Slack, 2001</xref>). At these stages, our data demonstrate that regional specification is impaired in Cdx-deficient embryos. Thus, whereas the expression patterns of the endodermal markers analyzed in this study show little or no difference between early neurula and tail bud stages, from tail bud stages onward, down-regulation of posterior gut markers like <italic>darmin</italic> and <italic>IFABP</italic> indicates that regional specification is perturbed as a result of Cdx deficiency. Our results show that expression of the intestinal marker <italic>IFABP</italic> is almost absent in double Cdx1+Cdx2 embryos but is relatively normal in the single knockdowns, indicating that amphibian Cdx1 and Cdx2 have essential roles in specifying regional identity within the gut, and that their functions are partially overlapping. However, the loss of <italic>IFABP</italic> expression is not accompanied by ectopic expression of the anterior gut marker <italic>Sox2</italic>. Thus our experiments do not indicate that loss of Cdx function in the amphibian gut leads to posterior to anterior transformation, as has been noted in the gut epithelium of mice heterozygote for a null allele of <italic>Cdx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Beck et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Given the <italic>Cdx1</italic> and <italic>Cdx2</italic> expression in the endoderm from tail bud stages, it seems likely that at least some of effects on regional specification in the gut in knockdown embryos at these later stages are directly due to effects on Cdx function in endodermal cells. However, a previous study indicates that the mesoderm surrounding the gut plays a key role in its regional specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Horb and Slack, 2001</xref>). It is possible that Cdx knockdown compromises the mesoderm's role in regional specification of the gut. In this regard, we note the down-regulation of <italic>Vent2</italic> expression in the ventrolateral mesoderm in response to Cdx knockdown, indicating that Cdx knockdown affects the properties of the ventrolateral mesoderm involved in regional specification of the gut. The ventrally expressed mesodermal marker and hematopoietic regulator <italic>Scl</italic> is also down-regulated in Cdx knockdown embryos, which is in keeping with the proposed role of Cdx factors in regulating vertebrate blood formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Davidson et al., 2003</xref>) and provides further evidence for abnormal ventrolateral mesoderm development in Cdx knockdowns.</p><p>It has been proposed that radial intercalation of endodermal cells drive the elongation and later coiling of the gut. This process occurs from stage 30 onward, accompanying cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Horb and Slack, 2001</xref>). Our results show that the knockdown of either <italic>Cdx1</italic> or <italic>Cdx2</italic> gene function dramatically reduces the normal complex coiling of the gut, and in compound Cdx1+Cdx2 knockdown embryos the gut resembles a simple linear tube. It is interesting to speculate that the requirement for Cdx function in elongation of the posterior body axis and the elongation of the gut during gut coiling demonstrate a general role for Cdx factors in regulating tissue morphogenesis and cell movements during postneurula stages. Further studies will be necessary to determine the molecular pathways involved in regulating posterior identity and morphogenesis in the amphibian gut.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Cdx</italic> Genes as Conserved Regulators of Posterior Development</title><p>There is a wealth of functional data demonstrating that a requirement for Cdx gene function in posterior axial development has been conserved during animal evolution. However, there is increasing evidence that the requirement for individual Cdx genes varies between animal groups. The evolution of the vertebrates was accompanied by an expansion in the number of Cdx genes. Thus in amphibians and amniotes three Cdx genes are present (<italic>Cdx1</italic>, <italic>Cdx2</italic>, and <italic>Cdx4</italic>). The orthology of the amphibian Cdx genes with the amniote Cdx genes is confirmed by analysis of their genomic context. In both amphibians and amniotes <italic>Cdx2</italic> is contained in the single intact ParaHox A gene cluster and <italic>Cdx1</italic> and <italic>Cdx4</italic> are contained within the degenerate ParaHox D and B clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Ferrier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Reece-Hoyes et al., 2005</xref>; Isaacs, unpublished data).</p><p>Despite the high degree of conservation in the genomic organization of the Cdx genes, important differences have emerged in how these genes are deployed during the development of amniotes and amphibians. For example, in <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>, <italic>Cdx4</italic> has the most anterior boundary of expression and <italic>Cdx1</italic> the most posterior boundary in the dorsal axis, whereas in the mouse <italic>Cdx1</italic> has the most anterior boundary. This calls into question the &#x0201c;functional&#x0201d; orthology of these genes despite their proven orthology at the genomic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gaunt et al., 2004</xref>). We also note that outside the homeodomain regions the peptide sequences of the amphibian orthologs are relatively poorly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Reece-Hoyes et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Analyses of single and compound Cdx knockdown in other model systems also indicate that the requirements for individual Cdx genes in posterior development vary between animal groups. Thus mutation in or knockdown of the zebrafish <italic>Cdx4</italic> gene leads to posterior truncation, whereas knockdown of zebrafish <italic>Cdx1a</italic> has no effect on posterior morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Shimizu et al., 2005</xref>). Also, <italic>Cdx4</italic> knockout mice have rather normal axial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">van Nes et al., 2006</xref>), whereas <italic>Cdx1</italic> knockout mice have alterations in patterning of the cervical vertebrae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Subramanian et al., 1995</xref>). These relatively mild effects are in contrast with the dramatic inhibition of posterior axial development noted in <italic>Cdx2</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Chawengsaksophak et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast to the situation in mice and zebrafish, we find that knockdown of each of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> Cdx genes results in a rather similar range of effects on elongation of the posterior axis.</p><p>Despite differences in the requirement for individual Cdx genes between species, a common theme that emerges from this and previous studies is that the overall level of Cdx function in the embryo is critical in regulating posterior development. For example, the compound knockdown of zebrafish Cdx4 and Cdx1a results in synergistic reduction in posterior axial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Shimizu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Davidson and Zon, 2006</xref>). Heterozygote <italic>Cdx2</italic> null mice exhibit mild defects in elongation of the posterior axis in comparison to the marked posterior truncation in the homozygous nulls. Similarly, axial development in <italic>Cdx4</italic> knockout mice is relatively normal, whereas Cdx4 knockout mice, which are also heterozygous for a <italic>Cdx2</italic> null allele, are truncated posterior to the hindlimbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">van Nes et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Evidence indicates that Cdx function is required for the regulation of similar key pathways in all vertebrate groups examined. However, there appears to be considerable variability in exactly how the individual Cdx genes are deployed in individual species to fulfill this set of conserved Cdx functions. These observations support the notion that during vertebrate evolution the main selective pressure on the complement of Cdx genes has been to maintain the overall landscape of Cdx activity in the developing embryo rather than to select for the specific functions associated with individual Cdx proteins. Relatedly, we note that the <italic>Cdx2</italic> gene has been lost from the teleost fish genome, while there are two Cdx1 orthologues present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Mulley et al., 2006</xref>). Such flexibility during evolution almost certainly emerges from the overlapping and partially redundant function of the three Cdx proteins. The observed variability underlines the importance of detailed analysis of Cdx function in a wide range of animal species.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title>Embryo Culture and Micromanipulation</title><p><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> eggs were obtained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Isaacs et al., 1992</xref>). <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> eggs were obtained by inducing females with 100 units of human chorionic gonadotrophin (Intervet) and fertilized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Khokha et al., 2005</xref>).
