We present the first in-depth study of how a human imprinted domain evolved, analyzing a domain containing several imprinted genes that are involved in human disease. Using comparisons of orthologous genes in humans, marsupials, and the platypus, we discovered that the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome region on human Chromosome 15q was assembled only recently (105&#x02013;180 million years ago). This imprinted domain arose after a region bearing <italic>UBE3A</italic> (Angelman syndrome) fused with an unlinked region bearing <italic>SNRPN</italic> (Prader-Willi syndrome), which had duplicated from the non-imprinted <italic>SNRPB/B&#x02032;.</italic> This region independently acquired several retroposed gene copies and arrays of small nucleolar RNAs from different parts of the genome. In their original configurations, <italic>SNRPN</italic> and <italic>UBE3A</italic> are expressed from both alleles, implying that acquisition of imprinting occurred after their rearrangement and required the evolution of a control locus. Thus, the evolution of imprinting in viviparous mammals is ongoing.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Humans and other mammals have two copies of the genome. For most genes, both copies are active. However, some genes are active only when they are inherited from the father, others only when inherited from the mother. These &#x0201c;imprinted&#x0201d; genes are clustered in domains that are controlled coordinately. Only mammals show genomic imprinting. It is not understood how or why genes became imprinted during mammalian evolution. The authors used comparisons between humans and the most distantly related mammals, marsupials and monotremes, to discover how one of these imprinted domains evolved. The authors studied an imprinted domain on human Chromosome 15, mutations which cause Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes (PWS-AS). They discovered that the PWS and AS genes lie on different chromosomes in kangaroos and platypus and are not imprinted. Other imprinted genes in the domain, including the putative control region, are absent from the genome and derived from copies of genes from yet other chromosomes. The arrangement in kangaroos and platypus is present also in the chicken genome, so it must be ancestral. This study concludes that the PWS-AS imprinted region was assembled relatively recently from non-imprinted components that were moved together or copied from all over the genome.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Rapkins RW, Hore T, Smithwick M, Ager E, Pask AJ, et al.

Among vertebrates, imprinting is specific to mammals, with about 83 mammalian genes shown to be imprinted. About half are paternally expressed (that is, the maternally derived allele is suppressed) and half maternally expressed (the paternally derived allele is suppressed) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Many genes subject to imprinting are involved with either developmental disorders or cancer (sometimes both), so understanding how and why genomic imprinting evolved and how it functions is therefore of compelling interest to medicine as well as biology.</p><p>Imprinting is an important model system for studying epigenetic regulation&#x02014;an accelerating field of biology that focuses on how identical DNA sequences are differentially expressed to produce different phenotypes. The molecular mechanism of imprinting resembles X chromosome inactivation in females, another mammal-specific epigenetic phenomenon, suggesting that X inactivation and autosomal imprinting may share a common origin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We do not yet understand what selective forces eschewed the benefits of diploidy in favor of parental imprinting, and there are many hypotheses to account for the seemingly perverse evolution of hemizygosity at these loci. Perhaps the most interesting and widely debated is the parental conflict hypothesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, now developed into the kinship hypothesis (reviewed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;), which proposes that imprinting evolved in response to the antagonistic interests of parental genomes.</p><p>The origin, as well as the mechanism, of imprinting can be investigated by comparing gene arrangement and expression between divergent species. The observation that genes imprinted in human and mouse <italic>(IGF2, M6P/IGF2R)</italic> are not imprinted in chicken &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; implies that imprinting is specific to mammals. Nonetheless, the gene content and arrangement of human imprinted domains is highly conserved in chicken &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d; and other vertebrates. For instance, the content and arrangement of coding genes in the human Beckwith-Wiedemann imprinted cluster (including <italic>IGF2, H19, ASCL2, KCNQ1,</italic> and <italic>CDKN1C</italic>) is largely shared with birds and fish, but the non-coding regulatory <italic>H19</italic> RNA is missing, along with large stretches of repetitive sequences and retroelements and several sequences thought to exert local control of imprinting &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The transition of a region from a non-imprinted state in fish and chicken to an imprinted state in placental mammals could therefore be dissected by comparing orthologous regions with the most divergent mammal groups. Marsupials and monotremes diverged from placental mammals 180 and 210 million years ago (MYA), respectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, so fill the 310-MY evolutionary void that separates birds and reptiles from humans and mice. This permits the reconstruction of gene content and arrangement over a long evolutionary period and provides informative sequence comparisons with high signal to noise ratios &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Importantly, these &#x0201c;alternative mammals&#x0201d; represent the transition between egg-laying and viviparous animals. Monotremes lay eggs, like reptiles. Marsupial young are born at an early developmental stage and complete development attached to a teat (often protected in a pouch). These modes of reproductive strategy represent major differences in the level of maternal investment, as well as the ability of paternally derived genes to influence maternal resources.</p><p>Genomic imprinting has been demonstrated in marsupials for <italic>IGF2</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>PEG1</italic>/<italic>MEST</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, and <italic>IGF2R</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

A comparative study, specifically of the non-imprinted <italic>IGF2</italic> in platypus with the imprinted opossum, mouse, and human locus, reveals that the absence of <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, such as short interspersed transposable elements and an intergenic conserved inverted repeat containing putative CTCF-binding sites, may be important for <italic>IGF2</italic> imprinting &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The occurrence of imprinting in marsupials, but not monotremes, would date the emergence of genomic imprinting in vertebrates to after 210 MYA, when therian mammals diverged from the egg-laying monotremes and before the divergence of marsupials and placentals 180 MYA. These limited data are consistent with the hypothesis that imprinting evolved after viviparity, as would be expected if it is selected as a response to parental conflict. However, this important conclusion is rather tenuous, since it is based upon expression data from only three of the ~80 genes imprinted in placental mammals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We have therefore made a detailed comparison of the arrangement and expression of orthologs of another cluster of imprinted genes in the three major mammal groups (placentals, marsupials, and monotremes) and other vertebrates.</p><p>Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes (PWS and AS) are phenotypically distinct disorders associated with abnormalities (usually deletions) of a cluster of imprinted genes on human Chromosome 15q11-q13 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d; that amongst other things, influence feeding behavior. The regulation of imprinted genes in the PWS-AS domain has been studied in detail in humans and mice. The region comprises the AS and PWS domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020182-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), within which deletions cause one or another disease. In the distal AS region lie two genes, <italic>UBE3A</italic> (thought to be solely responsible for AS) and <italic>ATP10A,</italic> both maternally expressed (paternally silenced) in brain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b019">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. The larger, more proximal PWS domain encompasses five paternally expressed (maternally silenced) genes responsible for Prader-Willi syndrome, including <italic>SNRPN,</italic> which encodes the SmN antigen. A large paternal transcript originating upstream of the <italic>SNURF-SNRPN</italic> genes liberates several classes of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. The imprinted expression of the AS and PWS domains is orchestrated by a bipartite imprinting control region (ICR) located within a 35-kilobase (kb) region which encompasses the <italic>SNRPN</italic> promoter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

We therefore cloned and characterized marsupial and monotreme orthologs of genes in the human 15q11-q13 region. To our astonishment, we discovered that marsupial and monotreme AS and PWS genes lie on different chromosomes, and we used bioinformatic analysis to show that this constitutes the ancestral arrangement. Both genes are biallelically expressed in marsupials and monotremes. Other genes from the PWS-AS region are absent from the marsupial and monotreme genomes. Thus, rearrangement of PWS-AS genes and acquisition of retrotransposed genes and key regulatory elements occurred much later in placental mammals, allowing their coordinate imprinted expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We examined the evolutionary origin of genes in and adjacent to the human PWS-AS imprinted region by isolating, mapping, and assessing transcription of their orthologs in marsupials, platypus, chicken, and fish.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation of Marsupial and Monotreme Homologs of PWS-AS Genes</title><p>We screened bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and cDNA libraries from the model kangaroo <named-content content-type="genus-species">Macropus eugenii</named-content> (tammar wallaby) for several human 15q11-q13 genes. cDNA clones containing <italic>GABRB3</italic> and <italic>HERC2</italic> and two BACs containing the AS gene <italic>UBE3A</italic> were confirmed by partial sequencing.</p><p>Numerous attempts over several years to isolate other imprinted genes, using PCR amplification, Southern blot analysis, and screening several genomic and cDNA libraries, were consistently unsuccessful.

The Prader-Willi gene <italic>SNRPN,</italic> represented by a tandem duplication of the non-imprinted gene <italic>SNRPB&#x02032;</italic> in marsupials, also does not appear to be imprinted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results demonstrate that the PWS-AS imprinted region of placental mammals was assembled from a variety of disparate genomic elements and suggest that imprinting was acquired relatively recently in the placental lineage. These conclusions follow from differences in arrangement and expression of <italic>SNRPN</italic> and <italic>UBE3A</italic> in the three major mammal groups, placentals, marsupials, and monotremes.</p><p><italic>SNRPN</italic> and <italic>UBE3A</italic> lie together in all placental mammals investigated, including the fully sequenced human, mouse, and dog. In the basal placental clades, Afrotheria and Xenarthra, sequence assembly is not sufficiently advanced to ascertain gene arrangement, but chromosome painting experiments reveal that human Chromosome 15q is represented as a single block in elephant and armadillo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, we demonstrate that the two primary PWS-AS loci <italic>SNRPN</italic> and <italic>UBE3A</italic> lie on different chromosomes in marsupials and monotremes, and that other PWS-AS loci have no orthologs in marsupials or monotremes. Since this gene arrangement is shared by birds and fish, it must be ancestral.</p><p>This implies that a major rearrangement occurred in the placental lineage to unite <italic>UBE3A</italic> and <italic>SNRPN.</italic> The evolutionary breakpoints lie between <italic>SLC9A7</italic> and <italic>TUBGCP5</italic> and between <italic>UBE3A</italic> and <italic>CNGA3</italic> in the ancestral sequence. Fission between <italic>UBE3A</italic> and <italic>CNGA3</italic> was evidently preceded by expansion of the interval from ~7.0 kb (chicken, fish, and monotremes) to &#x0003e;60 kb (marsupials) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020182-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The <italic>UBE3A</italic> region then fused with an ancestral region represented by chicken Chromosome 10 that bears homologs of genes in human 15q11-q13 and flanking genes located distal to <italic>HERC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020182-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The presence of <italic>MKRN3, MAGEL2,</italic> and <italic>NDN</italic> in the genomes of dogs, mice, and humans, but their absence from chicken, fish, and the recently sequenced opossum and platypus genomes (each of which are 6&#x000d7; coverage or greater), implies that these genes were all acquired by the placental PWS-AS domain 180&#x02013;90 MYA. They arrived independently by retrotransposition from paralogs on different chromosomes. The intronless <italic>MKRN3</italic> arose by retrotransposition from the intron-containing source gene <italic>MKRN1</italic> on human Chromosome 20 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, and the intronless <italic>MAGEL2</italic> and <italic>NDN</italic> arose by retrotransposition from genes on different sites on the X. Since no snoRNA arrays lie near the ancestral <italic>UBE3A</italic> or <italic>SNRPN,</italic> these must also have been seeded from other locations. Thus, the expanded and fused region was evidently a target for insertions and rearrangements. It seems to have remained unstable, since the mouse and human regions differ by several retrotranspositions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, and the region contains breakpoint hotspots that are the source of many PWS and AS deletions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We conclude from our expression studies that <italic>UBE3A</italic> and <italic>SNRPN</italic> are biallelically expressed in marsupial and monotreme brain. Because imprinted expression of <italic>UBE3A</italic> is found within neurons, but not glial cells of the brain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, it is possible that we could not detect some level of allelic attenuation for <italic>UBE3A</italic> in marsupials and monotremes. However, considering that the brain of AS patients produces only about 10&#x00025; <italic>UBE3A</italic> expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, we consider that even semi-quantitative methods such as direct sequencing should have detected this level of imprinting in marsupial and monotreme brain. Our finding that <italic>SNRPN</italic> and <italic>UBE3A</italic> are not imprinted in their original locations is consistent with the hypothesis that rearrangement was required for the establishment of imprinting.</p><p>Since <italic>UBE3A</italic> and <italic>SNRPN</italic> appear not to be imprinted in marsupials and monotremes, we would not expect to find sequences that control imprinting of these genes, so the absence of <italic>SNURF</italic> and the ICR from the marsupial genome is particularly telling. <italic>SNURF</italic> lies in the ICR (as defined by the region of shortest deletion in human PWS patients) and the <italic>UBE3A</italic> anti-sense transcript originates either at its 5&#x02032; end or at alternative upstream exons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. We propose that coordinate regulation of the PWS-AS domain required introduction of these sequences into the unstable fused region.</p><p>The time at which chromosome rearrangement occurred and imprinting was acquired can be deduced from the mammalian phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020182-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Gene arrangement in the PWS-AS domain is conserved at least between dog, mouse, and human, and the region was syntenic even in the most distantly related placentals, implying that it predated the placental radiation ~105 MYA. The ancestral arrangement in chicken and fish is shared by marsupials and monotremes, which diverged from placentals 180 and 210 MYA, respectively. Major rearrangements therefore occurred after placentals and marsupials diverged 180 MYA, but before the placental radiation 105 MYA. Our demonstration that <italic>SNRPN</italic> and <italic>UBE3A</italic> are also biallelically expressed in marsupials shows that imprinting evolved considerably later (180&#x02013;80 MYA) in this region than, for instance, in the <italic>IGF2</italic> region. This is consistent with the view that imprinting evolved after the evolution of viviparity in therian mammals, but shows, also, that at least some loci evolved imprinting considerably after this time. The recent findings that the imprinted gene <italic>Nnat</italic> is eutherian-specific &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, and <italic>DLK1</italic> is not imprinted in the opossum &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, also suggest that novel genes could be imprinted more recently. Thus, imprinting has been acquired at different times in different domains, after the evolution of viviparity, and suggests that viviparity is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the evolution of imprinting.</p><p>Is there any significance in our finding that the PWS-AS imprinted domain once shared synteny with the genome region that became part of the placental X and was recruited into the X inactivation system in placental mammals? There has been continuing speculation that genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation are related by descent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. One possibility is that the entire region was added to the ancestral therian X and recruited to the X inactivation system, and then the PWS-AS region was subsequently relocated to an autosome, carrying elements that control <italic>cis</italic>-silencing. This could also explain the acquisition by this human Chromosome 15 region of <italic>MAGE</italic> (cancer-testis antigen) genes, nearly all of which accumulated on the X chromosome in placentals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020182-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that the Prader-Willi/Angelman imprinted domain on human Chromosome 15q11&#x02013;13 was assembled relatively recently from unlinked and non-imprinted components in a mammalian ancestor. Two non-imprinted regions fused 105&#x02013;180 MYA, and several retroposed genes and snoRNAs from different regions were independently inserted. We propose that genomic rearrangement early in the eutherian lineage was required for the acquisition of imprinting at this locus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Tissue samples.</title><p>Tammar wallaby tissue samples were sourced at the Research School of Biological Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra, and the Department of Zoology, University of Melbourne, according to the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee.
