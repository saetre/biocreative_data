The regulation of chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>biosynthesis is an important determinant for the antenna size of photosystems. Chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>synthesis is partly regulated on a transcriptional level by the expression of the <italic>CAO </italic>gene. In addition, the synthesis of chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>is strictly regulated on a protein level by the stability of the CAO enzyme. CAO consists of three domains, which are sequentially named from the N terminus as the A, B and C domains. The A domain of CAO participates in the regulation of the CAO protein stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to clarify the physiological function of the A domain, we constructed transgenic Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) plants which either overexpressed the complete CAO or a truncated version of CAO lacking the A domain. The transgenic plants overexpressing the A-domain-deleted CAO accumulated an excess amount of chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>during greening. The transgenic plants which lacked the A domain either died or were obviously retarded when they were exposed to continuous light immediately after etiolation. In addition, the loss of the A domain in CAO impaired another step of chlorophyll biosynthesis, namely the conversion of divinyl-protochlorophyllide <italic>a </italic>to monovinyl protochlorophyllide <italic>a </italic>under dark conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The A domain of CAO regulates the level of CAO, and thus prevents the excess accumulation of chlorophyll <italic>b</italic>. This function of the A domain is especially important during the greening stage of etiolated seedlings. At this stage, the plants are vulnerable to photodamages which could be caused by excessive chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>accumulation. In addition, de-regulation of the CAO level affects monovinyl-protochlorophyllide biosynthesis in darkness by unknown mechanisms. In conclusion, the A domain of CAO is essential in the control of chlorophyll biosynthesis and in the survival of seedlings during de-etiolation especially under strong illumination.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Chlorophyll molecules are major components of photosynthesis and play essential roles in harvesting light energy and charge separation. Chlorophylls are actively synthesized during greening and are assembled with various apoproteins to form chlorophyll-protein complexes. Apoproteins of core antenna complexes solely bind chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>, while apoproteins of peripheral antenna complexes bind both chlorophyll <italic>a </italic>and chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Since these chlorophyll-protein complexes are stoichiometrically assembled to form functional photosystems, chlorophyll metabolism must be tightly regulated to coordinate with the formation of these complexes. Previous reports have suggested that the regulation of chlorophyll metabolisms is important from the viewpoint of photodamage. Most of the chlorophyll intermediates are photoreactive compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. If the regulation of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a precursor of tetrapyrrole synthesis, is defective as the result of mutation of a regulation factor, protochlorophyllide is accumulated in excessive amounts under dark conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Consequently, this overabundance of protochlorophyllide results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and finally causes growth retardation or cell death during greening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>At the last step of chlorophyll biosynthesis, chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>is synthesized from chlorophyll <italic>a </italic>by chlorophyllide <italic>a </italic>oxygenase (CAO)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Since an increase in <italic>CAO </italic>mRNA levels stimulates chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>synthesis, CAO activity is considered to be partly regulated by <italic>CAO </italic>gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition to the regulation on the transcriptional level, chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>synthesis is also regulated by protein stability. CAO consists of three domains, which are named sequentially from the N terminus as the A, B and C domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The C domain contains binding motifs for a Rieske center and non-heme iron and catalyzes the conversion of chlorophyll <italic>a </italic>to chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although the precise function of the B domain is not known, it is considered to possibly function as a linker between the A and C domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although the A domain is not involved in catalytic function, it regulates CAO protein stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. When the A domain was removed from CAO, and only BC domains were introduced and overexpressed in Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>), the protein levels of CAO were drastically increased and chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>was excessively accumulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We recently determined that the chloroplast Clp protease plays an important role in CAO protein stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, excess chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>accumulation does not result in a distinct alteration of photosynthetic activity and does not induce photodamage in green leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, at the present time it is still not known why the protein level of CAO is strictly regulated by the A domain.</p><p>In order to answer this question, we introduced genes corresponding to either the complete CAO sequence or BC domains into Arabidopsis. We subsequently investigated the greening processes of these transgenic plants under various light conditions. Interestingly, transgenic plants expressing only the BC domains died when the etiolated seedlings were exposed to continuous light. In addition, chlorophyll synthesis was disturbed in these plants during etiolation and greening of seedlings. We discuss the role of the A domain in the regulation of chlorophyll synthesis and chloroplast development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>CAO without the A domain caused photodamage during greening</title><p>In order to elucidate the physiological role of the A domain, we examined the light sensitivity of two types of transgenic plants that we named tGBC<italic>ch </italic>and tGABC<italic>ch </italic>in the <italic>ch1-1 </italic>mutant background. The <italic>ch1-1 </italic>mutant contains a deletion in the <italic>CAO </italic>gene and does not contain chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The tGBC<italic>ch </italic>lines overexpress a chimeric transgene containing the <italic>GFP </italic>gene and the <italic>CAO </italic>gene lacking the A-domain coding sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast, the tGABC<italic>ch </italic>lines overexpress another chimeric transgene encoding GFP and the full-length CAO protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Both types of transgenic plants were grown under different light conditions and their phenotypes were compared to those of wild type and the <italic>ch1-1 </italic>mutant. When the seeds were germinated and grown under low light conditions, all four strains grew well, although the <italic>ch1-1 </italic>exhibited a pale green phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). When etiolated seedlings were transferred to low light conditions, most of the tGBC<italic>ch </italic>plants were bleached and the growth of the tGBC<italic>ch </italic>seedlings was retarded (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). When exposed to high light conditions, no etiolated and green seedlings of tGBC<italic>ch </italic>survived (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). On the contrary, seedlings from the other three strains developed normally and grew under low and high light conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). These results confirmed that the overexpression of the <italic>CAO </italic>gene lacking the A domain resulted in photodamage to Arabidopsis seedlings.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Light sensitivities of the Arabidopsis seedlings</bold>.

C and D: Etiolated seedlings were grown for 4 days and transferred to low or high light conditions for an additional 3 days.

The expression levels of the transgenes, which correspond to GFP-ABC or GFP-BC, were higher than that of full-length CAO in wild type seedlings (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The tGBC<italic>ch </italic>transgenic lines accumulated a large amount of GFP-BC protein (a fusion of GFP and B-C domains of CAO) in both etiolated and green seedlings (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The GFP-BC proteins localized to etioplasts and chloroplasts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In contrast, the full-length CAO (A-B-C domains) and the GFP-full-length CAO (a fusion of GFP and A-B-C domains of CAO) proteins were under a detectable level by immunoblotting in both etiolated and greening seedlings (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). It was evident that the full-length CAO and the GFP-full-length CAO proteins accumulated to certain levels in the green leaves because chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>was actively synthesized in the transgenic plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, the protein levels of CAO in the seedlings were too low for detection by immunoblot analysis. These data suggest that the low accumulation level of CAO is sufficient to synthesize chlorophyll <italic>b</italic>. We should note that the excess accumulation of the fusion protein in the GFP-BC overexpressing plants was not due to the transcriptional or translational activation in these plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It was most likely that the lack of the A domain impaired the degradation of CAO by Clp protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Expression levels of CAO in the etiolated and greening seedlings</bold>.

In good accordance with chlorophyll accumulation, Lhcb protein levels were higher in tGABC<italic>ch </italic>and lower in tGBC<italic>ch </italic>compared to wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The chlorophyll <italic>a/b </italic>ratio was very high soon after the onset of illumination and decreased gradually during the greening in wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In contrast, the chlorophyll <italic>a/b </italic>ratio was already low after illumination and gradually increased during greening in tGABC<italic>ch </italic>and tGBC<italic>ch </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In tGBC<italic>ch</italic>, the chlorophyll <italic>a/b </italic>ratio was extremely low. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> shows the HPLC profiles of chlorophyll that accumulated after 5 min of illumination in wild type and two types of transgenic plants. Under this condition, most of the chlorophyll molecules were derived from protochlorophyllide <italic>a </italic>that pre-accumulated during the dark condition.

It should be noted that the small peak at 25 min in wild type was not chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>because the spectrum showed different peaks (data not shown).

These transgenic plants accumulated much more chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>than tGBC<italic>ch </italic>plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this previous report, we concluded that the excess accumulation of chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>did not cause photodamage in the fully greened leaves of the transgenic plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, in this study, we found that most of the etiolated tGBC<italic>ch </italic>seedlings died during greening not only under high light conditions, but also under low light conditions. Without the presence of chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>, chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>would not be incorporated into apoproteins. As a consequence, the free chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>might generate ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In contrast to tGBC<italic>ch</italic>, transgenic plants overexpressing the full-length CAO accumulated both chlorophyll <italic>a </italic>and chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>immediately after the onset of illumination. Unlike tGBC<italic>ch </italic>plants, the full-length-CAO overexpression lines did not exhibit photodamage. It is possible that chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>is assembled with apoproteins in the presence of chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>. As a result, the generation of ROS might have been suppressed. Collectively, these results indicate that the A domain is essential in preventing photodamages that could be caused by excess chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>accumulation during greening. The etiolated seedlings of the transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing prokaryotic CAO might cause obvious photodamage.</p><p>An unusually high level of 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>, an intermediate molecule in the conversion between chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>to chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>, accumulated in the green leaves of tGBC<italic>ch </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This observation might indicate that excess chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>is reconverted to chlorophyll <italic>a </italic>by the chlorophyll cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It is not likely that 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll was formed in the course of the chlorophyll <italic>a </italic>to chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>conversion. Since CAO catalyzes the two-step reaction from chlorophyll <italic>a </italic>to chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>by itself, the intermediate molecule, 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll, is supposed to be associated with the CAO enzyme and is not released during the reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In our study, 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll was not found just after the start of the illumination of etiolated seedlings, although chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>was actively synthesized (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll was predominantly formed in the course of the chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>to chlorophyll <italic>a </italic>conversion.</p></sec><sec><title>Accumulation of GFP-BC protein interferes with the regulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis</title><p>In comparison to wild type plants, chlorophyll accumulation during greening was suppressed in tGBC<italic>ch </italic>seedlings, even under low light conditions. It is possible that this suppression might be due to the oxidative stress generated by free chlorophyll <italic>b</italic>. The overabundance of protochlorophyllide generates ROS, which causes growth retardation or cell death during greening in the <italic>flu </italic>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Recently, we found that the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway is a target of oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, all of the phenotypes of tGBC<italic>ch </italic>could not be explained by oxidative stress alone. For example, the level of protochlorophyllide <italic>a </italic>in etiolated tissues of tGBC<italic>ch </italic>was lower than that of wild type. Since these plants were not exposed to light, the involvement of ROS in the inhibition of protochlorophyllide accumulation can be excluded. We also observed an increase in the ratio of divinyl-protochlorophyllide to the total protochlorophyllide in tGBC<italic>ch </italic>transgenic plants. These data indicate that the accumulation of the BC domains of CAO inhibits the activity of 3, 8-divinyl protochlorophyllide <italic>a </italic>8-vinyl reductase. On the contrary, overexpression of the GFP-ABC protein enhanced chlorophyll accumulation. These phenomena are very interesting in terms of biological regulation since both CAO and truncated CAO affected not only chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>synthesis but also other chlorophyll metabolic steps. These results are reasonable because some enzymes, which are related to chlorophyll biosynthesis, are reported to form complexes or interact with other enzymes. For example, glutamyl-tRNA reductase and glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase form a complex which enables an efficient substrate trafficking between two enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, BchH, one of the three subunits of Mg chelatase of <italic>Rhodobacter capsulatus</italic>, accelerated the Mg-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl transferase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. If CAO does indeed interact with other enzymes, the accumulation of truncated CAO could potentially interfere with the activity of the target enzymes.</p><p>In addition, the loss of the A domain in CAO impaired the conversion of divinyl-protochlorophyllide <italic>a </italic>to monovinyl protochlorophyllide <italic>a</italic>, and obviously reduced total protochlorophyllide <italic>a </italic>level under dark conditions. A possible scenario for the reduction of protochlorophyllide accumulation in the tGBC<italic>ch </italic>seedlings is that the excessively-accumulated CAO in these seedlings interfered with the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of monovinyl-protochlorophyllide <italic>a </italic>from divinyl-protochlorophyllide <italic>a</italic>, the latter of which may inhibit an earlier step of chlorophyll biosynthesis in a feedback manner. Further studies are necessary and warranted to clarify this question.</p></sec><sec><title>CAO does not catalyze the conversion of protochlorophyllide <italic>a </italic>to protochlorophyllide <italic>b</italic></title><p>When etiolated seedlings of wild type are exposed to continuous light, chlorophyll <italic>a </italic>immediately accumulates after the onset of illumination. Subsequent to illumination, chlorophyll <italic>a </italic>and <italic>b </italic>levels gradually increase after several hours of a lag phase. Conversely, in tGBC<italic>ch </italic>plants, chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>accumulated but chlorophyll <italic>a </italic>was not detected after 5 min of illumination (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Considering that protochlorophyllide <italic>b </italic>was not found in etiolated seedlings, these data indicate that chlorophyll <italic>a </italic>was immediately converted to chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>in tGBC<italic>ch </italic>seedlings during the early phase of greening (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p><p>Several research groups report that protochlorophyllide <italic>b </italic>does not exist in etioplasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Contrary to these reports, another group claimed that the protochlorophyllide <italic>b </italic>could be detected in etiolated seedlings when they use diethylpyrrocarbonate-containing acetone for the extraction of pigments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It was also proposed that protochlorophyllide <italic>b </italic>is synthesized via a pathway that is independent from the CAO protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, a cyanobacteria transformant with the <italic>CAO </italic>and <italic>Lhcb </italic>transgenes, accumulated protochlorophyllide <italic>b </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This observation indicates that CAO is capable of converting protochlorophyllide <italic>a </italic>to protochlorophyllide <italic>b</italic>. In this study, we used 100% acetone as an extraction solvent for chlorophyll intermediates in order to avoid the artificial formation of chlorophyll derivatives and to maximize our extraction of the chlorophyll intermediates from seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Consequently, we did not detect any protochlorophyllide <italic>b </italic>in etiolated tGBC<italic>ch </italic>seedlings, even though a large amount of the CAO protein accumulated. These results indicate that protochlorophyllide <italic>b </italic>is not a major intermediate product for chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>synthesis <italic>in planta</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our results demonstrated that excessive accumulation of chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>is harmful to plants. This deleterious effect likely disturbs the proper synthesis of chlorophyll intermediates and the accumulation of photosynthetic proteins. Therefore, we conclude that the regulation of the CAO protein by the A domain is essential for the survival of etiolated seedlings under light conditions. Since the A domain functions to maintain proper chlorophyll <italic>b </italic>levels throughout the development of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], it would be reasonable to assume that the regulation of the CAO protein level is essential in various aspects of plant development and acclimation to light conditions. Further studies on the regulatory mechanism of CAO may elucidate the physiological roles of this mechanism throughout the life cycle of plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p>The Arabidopsis CAO protein consists of three domains, which are respectively named: A (V37-L170), B (P171-G200) and C (A201-G537) domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].
