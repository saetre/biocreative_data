Both T helper (Th)2 and Th1 lymphocytes, play an important role in the pathophysiology of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Local overproduction of T helper (Th)2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13) by Th2 cells in the asthmatic airways is well defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and recent studies indicate that Th1 cells, secreting IFN-&#x003b3;, might cause severe airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recently, a separate T cell lineage, called Th<sub>17 </sub>cells or inflammatory T cells, producing IL-17A (or IL-17), has been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Th<sub>17 </sub>cells might potentially play an important role in the pathophysiology of asthma. IL-17 is especially important for the recruitment of neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and is expressed in bronchial biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum of patients with asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A role for IL-17 in murine asthma models has also been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and overexpression of IL-17 in lung epithelium causes chemokine production and leukocyte infiltration <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Neutrophils are especially prominent in acute, severe exacerbations of asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Moreover, it has been suggested that at least two inflammatory subtypes of asthma exist: the eosinophilic and the non-eosinophilic type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The subgroup of patients with neutrophilic asthma is characterized by poor response to corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Neutrophils potentially contribute to airway gland hypersecretion, bronchial hyper-reactivity and to airway wall remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] by producing matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) observed in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid from moderate-to-severe asthma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism of neutrophil recruitment in asthma is still unclear, but several chemokines may have a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Among those, CXCL8 (IL-8), secreted by T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells and macrophages might especially be important, as CXCL8 (IL-8) is increased in the airways of patients with asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The non-invasive technique of sputum induction has been developed to obtain viable cells from the lower airways of asthma patients and healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and was later shown to be useful for studies on cytokine mRNA expression by semi-quantitative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and quantitative RT-PCR techniques. With this technique, mRNA levels for cytokines and chemokines are normalized to a house-keeping gene in order to correct for differences in the cell number and amount of cDNA amongst the different samples studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This method therefore avoids some of the problems associated with protein measurements in sputum samples. We have recently described the use of this method for the quantification of Th1/Th2 cytokines at the mRNA level in induced sputum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To further study a potential role of Th<sub>17 </sub>cells in asthma, we used the technique of induced sputum in combination with quantitative real-time RT-PCR to quantify the expression of IL-17A and IL-8 mRNA in relation to each other, to CD3&#x003b3; mRNA as a quantification of T cells, and to the neutrophilic inflammation in the airways of patients with asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study was performed between September 2002 and August 2004. Subjects have been extensively described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In brief, thirty-nine asthmatic subjects (16 women, 23 men), not taking systemic steroids and 15 age-matched healthy controls (8 women, 7 men) between 18 and 65 years were recruited. Asthma severity was scored on the basis of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Mild intermittent (n = 11) and mild persistent (n = 12) asthma patients were grouped as mild asthmatics, and moderate (n = 8) and severe (n = 8) asthmatics were grouped as moderate-to-severe asthmatics. Asthmatic subjects were further subdivided into atopics (n = 21) and non-atopics, (n = 17) based on detection of specific IgE antibodies for house-dust-mite (n = 19), pets (n = 12) and/or pollen (grass or tree) (n = 17) and on a clinical history suggestive of allergic responses to those allergens. No differences in FEV1% (Fishers' exact test: p = 0.48), asthma severity (GINA classification) (Fishers' exact test: p = 0.49) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) use (Fishers' exact test: p = 0.28) between the allergic and the non-allergic asthmatics were found.</p><p>Patients were allowed to continue their usual treatment. Thirteen patients regularly used ICS: &#x0003c;500 &#x003bc;g/day Beclomethason Dipropionate (BDP) or equivalent (n = 1), 500&#x02013;1000 &#x003bc;g/day BDP or equivalent (n = 5) and &#x0003e;1000 &#x003bc;g/day BDP or equivalent (n = 7); "non-users" either had never used ICS or had not used them since at least 3 months. A significantly larger proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe asthma used ICS in comparison to patients with mild asthma (Fishers' exact test: p &#x0003c; 0.0001).</p><p>Symptoms were measured using the asthma symptom scores (ASS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and the Asthma Control Questionnaire developed by Juniper of which a validated Dutch translation is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Those scores significantly correlated with each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The FEV1 was measured by means of a spirometry. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was determined by measuring the histamine concentration that provoked a 20% decrease in FEV1 (PC20). Exhaled nitric oxide (NO) was measured with an Ecophysics CLD 700 AL MED chemiluminescence analyser (n = 16)(D&#x000fc;rnten, Switzerland).</p><p>Healthy controls had normal spirometry, no present clinical symptoms of upper or lower airway disease, ASS of zero and they did not use presently or in the past 5 years any anti-asthma medication. Five of the 15 healthy controls had allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and two others had a history of oral allergy symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

In brief, all sputum plugs that appeared free of salivary contamination were selected. Sputum was treated by adding a volume of Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution containing 0.1% dithiothreitol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma). The cell pellet was resuspended in 1000 &#x003bc;l RPMI 1640 (Bio Whittaker Europe, Cambrex) containing 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml) (Bio Whittaker Europe) and 10% bovine calf serum (BCS) (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA). Sputum squamous cell percentage varied between 0% and 35.6% (mean 6.6%). The cell suspension was adjusted to 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml, and 50,000 cells were put in a Shandon 3 Cytocentrifuge (Techgen, Zellik, Belgium). Cytospins were air-dried and stained using May Gr&#x000fc;nwald Giemsa.

Allergic and non-allergic asthmatics had comparable sputum neutrophil counts (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we have investigated local IL-17A, IL-8 and CD3&#x003b3; mRNA expression in relation to the cellular infiltration in the airway lumen from asthmatic patients and healthy controls as assessed by sputum induction. We found higher levels of both IL-17A and CD3&#x003b3; (reflecting T cell infiltration) mRNA in asthmatic patients when compared to healthy controls. Levels of CD3&#x003b3; were highest in the moderate and severe patient group and correlated in that group with IL-17A mRNA expression, suggesting increased levels of the newly described Th<sub>17 </sub>cell lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This correlation was absent in healthy controls and even tended to be negative, showing that T cells in the airways of healthy individuals do not belong to the Th<sub>17 </sub>cell lineage. Moreover, all healthy individuals had low to undetectable IL-17A and IL-8 mRNA levels in their sputum cells, which makes increased IL-17A or IL-8 mRNA levels potentially useful as a diagnostic aid in asthma. We also found in the asthmatic population that both IL-17A and IL-8 mRNA levels correlate significantly with the sputum neutrophil count. This correlation was recently also observed by other authors at the protein level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A significant correlation between IL-8 mRNA and IL-17A mRNA on the one hand and with neutrophils on the other hand suggests (although it does not provide proof for) cause-effect relationship. Human bronchial epithelial cells, fibroblasts and airway smooth muscle cells recruit neutrophils into the airways by the release of CXCL8 (IL-8) and/or other chemokines (such as granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 and growth-related oncogene(GRO)-&#x003b1;) upon stimulation by IL-17[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Until now, no other cellular source for IL-17 besides T cells has been identified. IL-17 in the airways is most likely produced by a T helper lineage called 'inflammatory T cells' or Th<sub>17 </sub>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and this could represent the link between T cell inflammation and granulocytic influx. The study of those 'inflammatory T cells' might become of specific interest in order to unravel differences between eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic asthma phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Somewhat surprising, the levels of IL-17 and IL-5 mRNA positively correlated with each other. This suggests that the inflammatory cell type and the Th2 type are both recruited in inflamed airways. Another explanation could be that both cytokines can be secreted by the same cell type. This is the aim of further study.</p><p>In order to study whether different subgroups of asthma patients could have differences in the expression of sputum IL-17A or IL-8 mRNA levels, we compared allergic to non-allergic asthmatics and mild to moderate/severe asthmatics. Allergic and non-allergic patients had similar IL-17A and IL-8 mRNA levels, but differences in the IL-17A and IL-8 mRNA expression level depending on disease severity could be found. High IL-17A and/or IL-8 mRNA levels were always found in patients with moderate/severe asthma while only approximately half of the mild asthmatics had increased IL-17A and/or IL-8 mRNA levels in their sputum. In accordance with this, the highest sputum neutrophil count was also found in the subgroup of patients with moderate-to-severe asthma, as also observed by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Most of the moderate-to-severe asthmatic patients were treated by inhaled corticosteroids. Our findings are consistent with recent observations suggesting that corticosteroid treatment can increase the number of neutrophils in endoscopic biopsy specimens from patients with moderate-to-severe asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Increased presence of neutrophils as observed in patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids might thus reflect enhanced neutrophil survival upon treatment with steroids, rather than higher disease severity. This might be due to the fact that corticosteroids protect neutrophils against apoptosis while they induce eosinophil apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Another potential explanation is that neutrophil recruiting Th<sub>17 </sub>cells or cytokines are steroid resistant. A significant limitation is that it is clinically challenging to correlate sputum IL-17A mRNA expression with neutrophil influx (and disease severity) while excluding the confounding variable of inhaled corticosteroid use, which could independently contribute to neutrophil influx. To resolve this discussion, IL-17A and IL-8 mRNA expression as well as neutrophil influx should now be studied before and after the introduction of inhaled steroids. The persistence of IL-17 and of neutrophils despite steroid treatment is indeed of potential prognostic significance as neutrophils can contribute to the phenomenon of airway remodeling and irreversible airway obstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion our findings suggest Th<sub>17 </sub>T cell infiltration and ensuring production of IL-17A mRNA in asthmatic airways in parallel with increased IL-8 mRNA levels as the plausible cause of neutrophilic infiltration. High IL-17A and/or IL-8 mRNA levels were found in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma, even if those patients were treated with corticosteroids. In those patients, high IL-17A levels correlate with CD3&#x003b3; expression, suggesting that a substantial proportion of airway T cells are Th<sub>17 </sub>cells. These might be responsible for neutrophil recruitment, with IL-8 as an important intermediate chemokine.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ASS: asthma symptom score</p><p>BDP: Beclomethason Dipropionate</p><p>ICS: inhaled corticosteroids</p><p>eNO: exhaled nitric oxide</p><p>FEV1: forced expiratory volume in 1 second</p><p>IFN-: interferon</p><p>IL: interleukin</p><p>mAb: monoclonal antibody</p><p>mRNA: messenger RNA</p><p>PC20: histamine dose resulting in a 20% decrease in FEV1</p><p>Th: T helper</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DMA Bullens participated in study design, was responsible for primers and probes design, performed statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
