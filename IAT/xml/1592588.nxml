We investigated the effects of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, AG-490 and WHI-P154, on iNOS expression and NO production in J774 murine macrophages stimulated with interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;). JAK inhibitors AG-490 and WHI-P154 decreased IFN-&#x003b3;-induced nuclear levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1&#x003b1; (STAT1&#x003b1;). JAK inhibitors AG-490 and WHI-P154 decreased also iNOS protein and mRNA expression and NO production in a concentration-dependent manner. Neither of the JAK inhibitors affected the decay of iNOS mRNA when determined by actinomycin D assay. Our results suggest that the inhibition of JAK-STAT1-pathway by AG-490 or WHI-P154 leads to the attenuation of iNOS expression and NO production in IFN-&#x003b3;-stimulated macrophages.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a small gaseous signalling molecule that is synthesized from amino acid L-arginine in a reaction catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). In mammalian cells, there are three isoforms of the enzyme: neuronal nNOS and endothelial eNOS are constitutively expressed and the third isoform, iNOS, is induced in response to proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial products in inflammatory and tissue cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Once iNOS is expressed, it produces high amounts of NO for prolonged periods. NO production through iNOS pathway is regulated mainly at the level of iNOS expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In inflammation, NO modulates immune responses and inflammatory process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and is associated with the pathophysiology of various inflammatory diseases such as asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Compounds that inhibit iNOS expression or iNOS activity have a promise as antiinflammatory drugs based on their effects in various forms of experimentally-induced inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>One of the central cytokines involved in the induction of iNOS expression and NO production in macrophages is interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;). IFN-&#x003b3; regulates iNOS expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. One of the intracellular signal transduction pathways that are activated by IFN-&#x003b3; is Janus kinase (JAK)&#x02014;signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) -pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the present study, we investigated the effects of two JAK inhibitors, AG-490 and WHI-P154, on the IFN-&#x003b3;-induced iNOS expression and NO production in cultured macrophages. Both compounds inhibited iNOS expression and NO production in IFN-&#x003b3;-treated macrophages along with their inhibitory effect on activation of STAT1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>JAK inhibitors AG-490 (tyrphostin B42) and WHI-P154 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, Calif, USA), rabbit polyclonal mouse iNOS and STAT1&#x003b1; p91 antibodies and goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif, USA), rabbit polyclonal phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Inc, Beverly, Mass, USA) and recombinant mouse &#x003b3;-interferon (R&#x00026;D systems, Minneapolis, Minn, USA) were obtained as indicated.

The level of STAT1&#x003b1; in the nucleus increased in a time-dependent manner after addition of IFN-&#x003b3; into the culture.

JAK inhibitors AG-490 and WHI-P154 decreased IFN-&#x003b3;-induced iNOS expression and NO production along with inhibition of STAT1 activation. To our knowledge, down-regulation of iNOS expression and NO production by JAK inhibitor WHI-P154 has not been reported previously. The inhibitors did not affect the decay of iNOS mRNA.</p><p>Typically, cytokine stimulation involves the ligation of two different receptor subunits, and this results in the formation of JAK heterodimers and their subsequent autophosphorylation. IFN-&#x003b3; signalling preferentially leads to activation of STAT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], which is phosphorylated on Tyr701 by JAK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Phosphorylation of STAT1 induces STAT1 dimerization, nuclear translocation, and initiation of transcription of gamma activated site (GAS) -driven genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In our study, we followed STAT1 activation by detecting STAT1 (Tyr701) phosphorylation and by probing nuclear lysates for STAT1&#x003b1; at different time points after IFN-&#x003b3; activation. The results show that STAT1 was activated in 15 minutes after IFN-&#x003b3;-stimulation in J774 cells. Similar results have been reported recently when whole cell and nuclear lysates of J774 cells were immunoblotted for phosphorylated STAT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>STAT1 has been reported to act as a key transcription factor in IFN-&#x003b3;-dependent mouse iNOS expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], whereas NF-&#x003ba;B, another important transcription factor in the induction of iNOS, is merely involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced iNOS expression and has a minor role following IFN-&#x003b3; stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. An IFN-&#x003b3;-activated site (GAS) is necessary for full expression of iNOS in response to IFN-&#x003b3; and LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, macrophages derived from STAT1-deficient mice displayed severely impaired NO production in response to a combination of IFN-&#x003b3; and LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, stimulation of J774 macrophages by IFN-&#x003b3; led to the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1, which was inhibited by AG-490 and WHI-P154. On molar basis, WHI-P154 was somewhat more potent inhibitor than AG-490. Similarly to our results, AG-490 has previously been shown to prevent JAK2 phosphorylation and to decrease STAT1 phosphorylation in J774 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and to decrease activation of STAT1 pathway in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. WHI-P154 was designed to specifically inhibit JAK3, and it has been shown to inhibit IL-2-triggered JAK3-dependent STAT activation in 32Dc11-IL-2R&#x003b2;-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. WHI-P131 (another WHI-P154-related JAK inhibitor) has been shown to inhibit STAT1 activation in B-CLL cells, in platelets, and in mesenchymal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Here we extend the earlier data by showing that WHI-P154 inhibits STAT1 activation also in IFN-&#x003b3;-treated macrophages.</p><p>In the present study, IFN-&#x003b3; induced iNOS expression and NO production in J774 macrophages, and it was inhibited by JAK inhibitors, AG-490 and WHI-P154, in a dose-dependent manner along with their inhibitory action on STAT1 activation. When the drugs were added to the culture 6 h after IFN-&#x003b3;, no effect on NO production was detected suggesting that the compounds do not inhibit iNOS activity. The results confirm the earlier studies showing that AG-490 inhibits IFN-&#x003b3;-induced iNOS expression in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. To our knowledge, down-regulation of iNOS expression and NO production by JAK inhibitor WHI-P154 has not been reported previously.</p><p>The regulation of iNOS expresion is controlled at the level of mRNA stability in addition to the transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In murine macrophages, dexamethasone, and SP600125, an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), reduced LPS-induced iNOS expression by destabilizing the mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast, IFN-&#x003b3; has been shown to retard iNOS mRNA degradation when compared to iNOS mRNA induced by LPS alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the present study, the effects of AG-490 and WHI-P154 on iNOS mRNA decay were tested by actinomycin D assay. JAK inhibitors, AG-490 and WHI-P154 did not affect the rate of degradation of iNOS mRNA in cells treated with IFN-&#x003b3;. This suggests that AG-490 and WHI-P154 inhibit iNOS expression at transcriptional level and they do not regulate mechanisms involved in the iNOS mRNA stabilization.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that JAK inhibitors, AG-490 and WHI-P154 down-regulate STAT1 activation, iNOS expression, and NO production in IFN-&#x003b3;-treated macrophages. A better understanding of the mechanisms regulating iNOS expression and NO production in inflammation could facilitate the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs acting through iNOS pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="abbreviations"><title>ABBREVIATIONS</title><p>AG-490, &#x003b1;-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide; B-CLL, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GAS, gamma activated site; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; JAK, Janus kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NO, nitric oxide; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; WHI-P154, 4-(3&#x02032;-bromo-4&#x02032;-hydroxylphenyl)-amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank Mrs Niina Ikonen for the skillful technical assistance and Mrs Heli M&#x000e4;&#x000e4;tt&#x000e4; for secretarial help.
