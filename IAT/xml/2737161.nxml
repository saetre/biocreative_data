Compounds that stimulate innate immune pathways may be valuable in the design of novel adjuvants, vaccines, and other immunotherapeutics. The cyclic dinucleotide cyclic-di&#x02013;guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a recently appreciated second messenger that plays critical regulatory roles in many species of bacteria but is not produced by eukaryotic cells. In vivo and in vitro studies have previously suggested that c-di-GMP is a potent immunostimulatory compound recognized by mouse and human cells. We provide evidence that c-di-GMP is sensed in the cytosol of mammalian cells via a novel immunosurveillance pathway. The potency of cytosolic signaling induced by c-di-GMP is comparable to that induced by cytosolic delivery of DNA, and both nucleic acids induce a similar transcriptional profile, including triggering of type I interferons and coregulated genes via induction of TBK1, IRF3, nuclear factor &#x003ba;B, and MAP kinases. However, the cytosolic pathway that senses c-di-GMP appears to be distinct from all known nucleic acid&#x02013;sensing pathways. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which host cells can induce an inflammatory response to a widely produced bacterial ligand.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>To sense infection, the innate immune system preferentially responds to conserved molecular signatures of microbes that are absent from normal host cells. There is currently great interest in determining what molecular features of pathogens are detected, and how these features are sensed by the innate immune system. A better understanding of the fundamental principles of how immune responses are stimulated is critical for the design of more effective vaccines, adjuvants, and immune therapeutics.</p><p>One important class of ligands sensed by the innate immune system is nucleic acids. Several distinct nucleic acid sensors have been described and have been found to be distributed to distinct subcellular locations and exhibit distinct specificities for different nucleic acid ligands. A common theme is that nucleic acid sensors tend to induce expression of type I IFN genes and, thus, appear to be particularly important for initiating immune responses to viruses.</p><p>Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, 7, 8, and 9 are transmembrane nucleic acid receptors that reside in intracellular compartments, where they detect endocytosed or autophagocytosed nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawai and Akira, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Medzhitov, 2007</xref>). TLR7, 8, and 9 all require the signaling adaptor MyD88 to initiate downstream signaling, whereas TLR3 requires the signaling adaptor TRIF. Thus, <italic>MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>Trif<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> double-knockout cells are deficient in signaling through all known TLRs that sense nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hoebe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamamoto et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, recent work has established that <italic>MyD88<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>Trif<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells are capable of responding to nucleic acid ligands via cytosolic immunosurveillance pathways. Cytosolic RNA appears to be sensed by two RNA helicase&#x02013;containing proteins, RIG-I and Mda5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoneyama et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, RIG-I and Mda5 do not perform redundant functions and appear to respond to distinct classes of viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gitlin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hornung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pichlmair et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saito and Gale, 2008</xref>). Signaling by RIG-I and Mda5 requires a common adaptor molecule called MAVS (also known as IPS-1, Cardif, or VISA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kawai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meylan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2006</xref>). MAVS recruits the TBK1 kinase that phosphorylates and activates the IRF3 transcription factor. Other transcription factors such as ATF2/c-Jun and NK-&#x003ba;B form a coordinated DNA-bound complex with IRF3, and are together required for robust activation of the IFN-&#x003b2; promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maniatis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Panne, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Many cell types also appear to respond to the cytosolic presence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ishii et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006a</xref>). The cytosolic response to DNA does not require MAVS, but does require TBK1 and IRF3 in most cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ishii et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2006</xref>). Recently, a putative cytosolic sensor of DNA was identified, and was named DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factors (DAI; previously known as DLM-1 or ZBP1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takaoka et al., 2007</xref>). Knockdown experiments indicated that DAI was involved in sensing cytosolic DNA in the L929 fibroblast-like and RAW macrophage-like cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takaoka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). DAI was expressed in other cell types, such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), but was dispensable for the response to cytosolic DNA in these cell types, suggesting that additional uncharacterized nucleic acid sensor proteins also exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, cells from DAI knockouts appear to respond normally to cytosolic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ishii et al., 2008</xref>), possibly because of redundancy with other cytosolic DNA sensors.</p><p>Although type I IFNs are primarily considered to be antiviral cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006b</xref>), there is growing appreciation for their complex role in bacterial infections as well. Indeed, it is clear that type I IFNs are induced by many, if not all, bacterial pathogens, and can contribute to diverse outcomes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Coers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Riordan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Opitz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Henry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stanley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Charrel-Dennis et al., 2008</xref>). For several bacterial pathogens, including <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic>, group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, and <italic>Brucella abortus</italic>, it appears that induction of type I IFN is via a novel cytosolic pathway and is independent of TLRs. It has been suggested that these pathogens trigger the cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, but neither the host sensors nor the bacterial ligands that trigger cytosolic induction of type I IFNs by these pathogens have been identified. Intriguingly, evidence from <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> suggests that bacterial multidrug efflux pumps are required for induction of type I IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crimmins et al., 2008</xref>), and raises the possibility that a small molecule substrate of these pumps, rather than DNA, is the bacterial trigger of type I IFN gene expression.</p><p>Nucleotide second messengers are critical transmitters of signaling in all living things. cAMP is used by bacteria and eukaryotes alike, whereas certain nucleotide second messengers are unique to bacteria. For example, guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) is a key regulator of the stringent response in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Srivatsan and Wang, 2008</xref>). Another nucleotide second messenger, cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP), is a relatively recently appreciated cyclic ribonucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ross et al., 1987</xref>) synthesized by bacteria from two GTP precursors that are hydrolyzed and ultimately circularized via 5&#x02032;-to-3&#x02032; monophosphate linkages. The bacterial diguanylate cyclases that synthesize c-di-GMP all contain a characteristic GGDEF domain, whereas the phosphodiesterases that specifically degrade c-di-GMP to pGpG contain an EAL domain. The GGDEF domain, and presumably c-di-GMP, appears to be limited to Bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Galperin et al., 2001</xref>) and is not found in Archaea or Eukarya. c-di-GMP appears to play complex roles as a second messenger in most bacterial species, and regulates diverse processes, such as motility, biofilm formation, and virulence gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tamayo et al., 2007</xref>). The molecular mechanisms by which c-di-GMP regulates these biological processes in bacteria are only beginning to be understood. It appears that c-di-GMP is capable of specific binding to regulatory proteins containing the PilZ protein domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cotter and Stibitz, 2007</xref>). The PelD protein of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is an additional non-PilZ&#x02013;containing c-di-GMP sensor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Several recent reports have suggested that c-di-GMP can stimulate a variety of signaling pathways in mammalian cells in vivo. One early report demonstrated that 50 &#x003bc;M of exogenous c-di-GMP inhibited growth of human colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Karaolis et al., 2005a</xref>) without toxicity against normal kidney cells. Two additional reports have indicated that c-di-GMP can function as an adjuvant. One group demonstrated a highly significant (&#x0003e;200-fold; P &#x0003c; 0.001) induction of anti-ClfA IgG2a titers when mice were vaccinated with ClfA and c-di-GMP as compared with vaccination with ClfA alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karaolis et al., 2007a</xref>). Another group found a similar induction of anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;-Gal titers when c-di-GMP was used as an adjuvant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ebensen et al., 2007</xref>). Both groups also found increased T cell responses in mice injected with c-di-GMP. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karoalis et al. (2007a)</xref> also showed that c-di-GMP has immunostimulatory effects in vivo and in vitro on innate cell populations, including monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. c-di-GMP induced dendritic cell maturation and led to the production of various cytokines and chemokines, including TNF, IL-1&#x003b2;, IP-10, Rantes, and CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karaolis et al., 2007a</xref>). However, c-di-GMP did not stimulate induction of type I IFNs by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Impressively, preinjection of 2.5 mg/kg c-di-GMP protected against subsequent lethal challenge with <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> or <italic>Staphlyococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karaolis et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karaolis et al., 2007b</xref>). Despite the impressive in vivo biological effects of c-di-GMP, the mechanism by which c-di-GMP stimulates host immunity remains unknown.</p><p>In this study, we provide evidence that mammalian cells survey their cytosol for the presence of c-di-GMP. We find that c-di-GMP triggers a transcriptional response virtually indistinguishable from the response triggered by cytosolic DNA. Like the response to DNA, the response to c-di-GMP requires the TBK1 kinase and IRF3 transcription factor. However, the pathway for sensing c-di-GMP can be distinguished from that for sensing DNA in certain cell types and, moreover, appears to be distinct from all other known cytosolic sensing pathways. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which host cells can induce an inflammatory response to a widely produced bacterial ligand.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Cytosolic recognition of c-di-GMP leads to potent induction of type I IFN</title><p>We hypothesized that c-di-GMP might be sensed by a cytosolic sensor leading to the induction of type I IFNs. To test this hypothesis, we compared the ability of overlayed versus transfected c-di-GMP to induce type I IFN in bone marrow macrophages. At the concentrations used (up to 25 &#x003bc;g/ml), overlay of c-di-GMP did not elicit a significant response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), although IFN-&#x003b2; production could be detected at higher concentrations (50 or 100 &#x003bc;g/ml; not depicted). In contrast, delivery of c-di-GMP to the cytosol by transfection elicited robust activation of IFN-&#x003b2; in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). A significant response was detected with a concentration of c-di-GMP as low as 2.5 &#x003bc;g/ml (equivalent to 3.6 &#x003bc;M). These results suggested that c-di-GMP signals via a cytosolic immunosurveillance pathway.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>c-di-GMP is a potent cytosolic inducer of type I IFNs.</bold> (A) Bone marrow macrophages were overlaid or transfected with the indicated amounts of synthetic, purified c-di-GMP.

Most genes lie on the diagonal, indicative of similar induction ratios by both treatments. Selected highly induced genes are labeled. Two independent microarray experiments gave similar results.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM_20082874_LW_Fig1"/></fig><p>We tested whether compounds related to c-di-GMP were capable of stimulating IFN-&#x003b2; expression when delivered to the cytosol. We measured induction of endogenous type I IFN protein by bioassay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), and induction of IFN-&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b1;5 mRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). No detectable IFN-&#x003b2; production was observed upon transfection with GTP, cGMP, ppGpp (a different bacterial nucleotide second messenger), or pGpG (hydrolyzed c-di-GMP), whereas the cytosolic response to 3.3 &#x003bc;g/ml of transfected c-di-GMP was of a similar magnitude to that of 3.3 &#x003bc;g/ml of transfected DNA (pdA:dT) and RNA (pI:C), which are known cytosolic inducers of type I IFN. We do not believe that the cytosolic induction of type I IFNs in response to c-di-GMP is caused by a contaminant (such as LPS) because (a) the c-di-GMP compound was chemically synthesized and &#x0003e;98% pure by HPLC (not depicted), (b) phosphodiesterase treatment of c-di-GMP resulted in a product that is no longer stimulatory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>), and (c) macrophages deficient in all TLR signaling and unable to respond to LPS still responded to c-di-GMP (see below). Thus, these observations suggest that c-di-GMP is sensed in the cytosol, resulting in a potent induction of type I IFN in bone marrow macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Cytosolic c-di-GMP and DNA induce similar transcriptional responses</title><p>We performed microarray experiments to compare the global transcriptional response induced by cytosolic c-di-GMP with that induced by cytosolic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082874/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>). Whole transcriptome spotted MEEBO microarrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Verdugo and Medrano, 2006</xref>) were used in these experiments. The results indicated that the transcriptional profile of cells stimulated by cytosolic c-di-GMP was very similar to the transcriptional profile of cells stimulated with cytosolic DNA. Induction of type I IFNs and known type I IFN-inducible genes dominated the transcriptional response, but other genes (e.g., <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Cd86</italic>, and <italic>Cxcl9</italic>) were also strongly induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref> and Table S1). Although the transcriptional profiles of cells stimulated with c-di-GMP and DNA were highly similar, a small number of genes were reproducibly preferentially induced by c-di-GMP as compared with DNA (e.g., HtrA serine peptidase 4 and claudin 23; Table S1). Collectively, these results suggested that similar but not identical downstream signaling pathways are triggered by DNA and c-di-GMP.</p></sec><sec><title>Cytosolic c-di-GMP signals independently of TLRs but requires TBK1 and IRF3</title><p>It was previously reported that HEK293 cells stably transfected with various TLRs failed to respond to c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karaolis et al., 2007a</xref>), but the reason for this failure was unclear.

The relatively low levels and late time course of NF-&#x003ba;B induction by c-di-GMP (as compared with induction by LPS), as well as the fact that we transfected c-di-GMP into cells, may explain why NF-&#x003ba;B induction was not previously observed in response to c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karaolis et al., 2007a</xref>).</p><p>We also tested whether MAP kinase pathways are activated by c-di-GMP.

Nucleic acids appear to be a favored target of immune recognition, and are sensed by a variety of endosomal and cytosolic sensor proteins. The cyclic dinucleotide c-di-GMP is a bacterial second messenger that exhibits several characteristics that are desirable in an immunostimulatory ligand: it is produced by numerous species of bacteria, it is a critical regulator of bacterial physiology, and it is not similar to host molecules. Indeed, several previous reports have demonstrated that c-di-GMP can provoke potent immune responses when injected in vivo into mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Karaolis et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karaolis et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karaolis et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karaolis et al., 2007b</xref>). However, the mechanism by which c-di-GMP stimulates immune responses remained unclear. Our data provide evidence that c-di-GMP is sensed by a novel cytosolic immunosurveillance pathway. Responsiveness to c-di-GMP is independent of TLRs that monitor the extracellular/endosomal compartments and is strongly potentiated by transfection of c-di-GMP into the host cell cytosol. Moreover, c-di-GMP provokes a transcriptional response highly reminiscent of that triggered by the cytosolic presence of DNA or RNA, and involves activation of TBK-1, MAP kinases, and the IRF-3 and NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factors. Thus, we propose that c-di-GMP is sensed in the cytosol.</p><p>How many different cytosolic sensors exist for nucleic acids? Our data suggest that sensing of c-di-GMP occurs via a novel cytosolic immunosurveillance pathway. Known nucleic acid sensors include Mda5 and RIG-I, which sense viral RNA and signal via MAVS, as well as DAI, a putative sensor of DNA that signals independently of MAVS. Based on the finding that most cell types, including MEFs, can still respond to DNA in the absence of DAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ishii et al., 2008</xref>), it has been proposed that an additional DNA sensor must exist and that MEFs express both of these sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Our results now suggest that there is at least one additional nucleic acid sensor in the cytosol, because we find that MEFs do not respond well to c-di-GMP. Given the marked chemical dissimilarities among DNA, RNA, and c-di-GMP, it is perhaps not surprising that these nucleic acids appear to be recognized by different sensors. Indeed, we favor the idea that there are multiple cytosolic sensors for nucleic acids leading to induction of type I IFNs. The specificities of these various sensors will require further dissection. For example, although DAI knockout cells still responded to c-di-GMP, it remains formally possible that DAI is just one of several redundant sensors for c-di-GMP. These possibilities can be addressed once additional cytosolic nucleic acid sensors are identified.</p><p>Our results suggest that cytosolic sensing of c-di-GMP is relatively specific. Other related small nucleic acid compounds such as GTP, cGMP, ppGpp, and pGpG did not trigger transcriptional induction of type I IFNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). In addition, c-di-GMP that was hydrolyzed by snake venom phosphodiesterase did not induce type I IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). However, our results cannot eliminate the possibility that a metabolite of c-di-GMP, rather than c-di-GMP itself, is the true molecular moiety that is sensed in the cytosol. Elimination of this possibility awaits identification of the c-di-GMP sensor and biophysical or crystallographic characterization of its binding to c-di-GMP. Our results also cannot eliminate the possibility that c-di-GMP triggers type I IFN expression indirectly, for example, by stimulating the synthesis of a host ligand that functions as the &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; proximal trigger of type I IFN gene expression. It is also possible that c-di-GMP acts &#x0201c;pharmacologically&#x0201d; by disrupting host physiology in a way that results in type I IFN expression. Moreover, because the signaling triggered by c-di-GMP and cytosolic DNA are very similar, it is possible that the c-di-GMP pathway is a branch off of the DNA-sensing pathway rather than a fully independent pathway. However, even if these alternative models are correct, our data indicate that the pathway downstream of c-di-GMP contains at least some novel components and is at least partially independent of known cytosolic or TLR signaling pathways.</p><p>Several bacterial pathogens, including <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, <italic>F. tularensis</italic>, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, have been reported to induce type I IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Coers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Riordan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Opitz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Henry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stanley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Charrel-Dennis et al., 2008</xref>). The mechanism by which these pathogens induce type I IFN resembles that of c-di-GMP: in all cases, type I IFN induction is independent of MyD88/Trif and TLRs, requires TBK1 and IRF3, and (with one exception; unpublished data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Opitz et al., 2006</xref>) is independent of the cytosolic RNA-sensing pathway. It is widely assumed that bacterial DNA, perhaps released after bacterial cell lysis, is the relevant ligand that triggers type I IFNs in response to pathogens. There are no data that eliminate or confirm this possibility, as sensors required for IFN induction in response to cytosolic bacteria have not yet been reported. However, it is noteworthy that in all cases, induction of type I IFNs by cytosolic bacteria requires expression of an auxiliary secretion system, namely the ESX-1 system of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the <italic>Francisella</italic> pathogenicity island-encoded secretion system of <italic>F. tularensis</italic>, the Dot/Icm system of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, or the MdrM multidrug efflux pump of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. It is tempting to speculate that a small, bacterially derived molecule such as c-di-GMP could be transported or leak through these secretion systems. It has not yet been possible to test this idea directly because all of these bacterial species encode numerous c-di-GMP synthases, and a strain lacking all c-di-GMP synthesis has not been reported. In any case, interpretation of these experiments would be complicated by the fact that c-di-GMP plays important regulatory roles in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis. Nevertheless, our results with synthetic purified c-di-GMP suggest that in addition to DNA, c-di-GMP is a candidate for a conserved molecule unique to bacteria that is responsible for triggering transcription of type I IFN genes. In light of a recent report that bacteria appear to be able to synthesize c-di-AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Witte et al., 2008</xref>), it is interesting to consider whether additional nucleic acids produced specifically by bacteria might also trigger host immunosurveillance pathways. Non&#x02013;nucleic acid small molecules, such as the drug DMXAA, also appear to be able to stimulate the TBK1&#x02013;IRF3 axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roberts et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, there may be multiple redundant pathways for cytosolic sensing of bacteria. Collectively, the available evidence suggests that host cells may sense a wider array of bacterial ligands than was previously appreciated.</p><p>Our results may have important implications for the design of new adjuvants and vaccines. DNA vaccines have attracted considerable enthusiasm as an approach for protecting against a variety of infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2004</xref>), but there are safety concerns about the insertional mutagenic potential of DNA vaccines and/or their potential to trigger pathogenic anti-DNA autoimmune antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schalk et al., 2006</xref>). The potency of DNA vaccines appears to derive from their ability to stimulate the TBK1 and innate cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ishii et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, our demonstration that a synthetic nonself non-DNA molecule such as c-di-GMP can stimulate an in vitro and in vivo innate and adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>) similar to that induced by DNA, without similar autoimmune or mutagenic risks, suggests that c-di-GMP might have valuable application as a small-molecule adjuvant. Understanding the molecular basis of c-di-GMP signaling in mammalian cells will be a crucial step toward achieving this aim.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice and cell lines.</title><p>Bone marrow macrophages were derived from various mouse strains, including <italic>Mavs<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>Mda5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gitlin et al., 2006</xref>), and <italic>Zbp1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ishii et al., 2008</xref>).
