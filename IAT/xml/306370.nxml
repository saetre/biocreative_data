The double-stranded DNA genome (7743 base pairs) contained eight open reading frames (ORFs), seven of which corresponded approximately in size and location to the ORFs found in the genome of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and carnation etched ring virus (CERV). ORFs I and V of FMV demonstrated the highest degrees of nucleotide and amino acid sequence homology with the equivalent coding regions of CaMV and CERV. Regions II, III and IV showed somewhat less homology with the analogous regions of CaMV and CERV, and ORF VI showed homology with the corresponding gene of CaMV and CERV in only a short segment near the middle of the putative gene product. A 16 nucleotide sequence, complementary to the 3' terminus of methionine initiator tRNA (tRNAimet) and presumed to be the primer binding site for initiation of reverse transcription to produce minus strand DNA, was found in the FMV genome near the discontinuity in the minus strand. Sequences near the three interruptions in the plus strand of FMV DNA bear strong resemblance to similarly located sequences of 3 other caulimoviruses and are inferred to be initiation sites for second strand DNA synthesis. Additional conserved sequences in the small and large intergenic regions are pointed out including a highly conserved 35 bp sequence that occurs in the latter region.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0328.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8451"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0329.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8452"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0330.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8453"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0331.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8454"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0332.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8455"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0333.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8456"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0334.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8457"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0335.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8458"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0336.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8459"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0337.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8460"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0338.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8461"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0339.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8462"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0340.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8463"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0341.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8464"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0342.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8465"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00264-0343.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8466"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
