[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]) was sequenced to determine if the strains evaluated had any differences. An alignment of the sequences showed that all strains had identical promoter sequences (data not shown). Sequencing of the <italic>tcdC </italic>gene itself demonstrated that there were deletions that would lead to a premature termination codon in the protein sequence that would affect the expected length of the protein product (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Alignment of the amino acid sequences is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. It is apparent that for strains 1083, 57A and 83 that the proteins transcribed and translated from the <italic>tcd</italic>C gene would be substantially shorter compared to the other strains evaluated that had no deletions or premature stop codons. Although the truncated proteins are somewhat similar in length (63 vs 65 amino acids long), the position of the 1 bp change leads to very different amino acid sequence changes. Strain 1083 has a 1 bp substitution at position 191 that results in a C to A transversion that creates a premature stop codon and results in a 63 amino acid long protein that has an unchanged amino acid sequence up to position 174. Whereas the 1 bp deletion at position 117 in strains 57A and 83 results in a frame shift that leads to an altered amino acid sequence from position 117 onwards and a premature stop codon at positions 187&#x02013;189 resulting in a predicted product of 65 amino acids.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Amino acid sequence alignment from <italic>tcdC </italic>gene of various strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic></bold>.

Assessment of deletions in this gene could be very misleading if used as a diagnostic approach in patients with CDAD to try to predict who will have more severe disease. Furthermore, our data suggested that <italic>tcdC </italic>deletions may not be the sole factor responsible for the increased toxin production observed in the NAP-1 isolates. Studies of toxin production using isogenic mutants are warranted to confirm our results.</p><p>There are a number of possible explanations for what has been referred to as "hyperproduction" of toxins by some <italic>C. difficile </italic>strains and not by others. If the positive regulator <italic>tcdR </italic>was genetically altered in various strains it might result in differing toxin expression between strains. Our sequencing data indicates that the <italic>tcdR </italic>gene in all strains is identical ruling out genetic differences in the positive regulator gene as an explanation of differences in Toxin A and B production. An alternative mechanism for "hyperproduction" might be that the putative negative regulator <italic>tcdC </italic>is mutated thereby allowing earlier and more efficient expression of toxin due to the lack of a functional negative regulator. Although there were multiple changes found in <italic>tcdC </italic>in various strains of <italic>C. difficile </italic>(e.g. 57A, 83, and 1083) that resulted in predicted truncated proteins that are likely not active, these defects do not always correlate with increased toxin expression. Furthermore, strain ATCC 43255 does not have deletions or mutations in <italic>tcdC </italic>yet it has the highest levels of Toxin B and Toxin A production <italic>in vitro </italic>(higher even than the NAP1-related clinical isolates). Strains can differ in the proportion of the population that is in the spore form and this might explain the differences in secreted toxin levels. However, the growth conditions in our study did not result in variation in spore levels for the different strains evaluated. Therefore, the differences in toxin production observed cannot be explained by differences in spore form population. Our data therefore suggest that alterations in the <italic>tcdC </italic>gene sequence are not accurate predictors of hyper-production of Toxin B or Toxin A.</p><p>The ATCC 43255 strain is a known hyperproducer of Toxin B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and our data for biologically active toxin production in BHI broth culture support this determination. The use of ATCC 43255 as the "type strain" may be misleading as Warny et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] assessed 25 Toxinotype 0 clinical isolates (non NAP1-related) and reported that hyperproduction of toxin is not common in non-NAP1 clinical isolates.</p><p>The TcdC protein has a predicted transmembrane domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] which was lost for the truncated product and altered amino acid sequence for strains 57A and 83. However, the transmembrane folding motif for TcdC was retained for strain 1083 despite the truncation of this protein. Despite this retained transmembrane motif for strain 1083 it is unlikely that the TcdC protein is fully functional when only a predicted 63 of the total 232 amino acids are present.</p><p>Another possible explanation for increased toxin activity in our experiments might be that secretion of the toxins outside the bacterial cell is increased in "hyperproducing" strains. Sequencing of <italic>tcdE </italic>indicates that there are no differences in this gene in the strains evaluated except for strain 1083 that has a 1 bp deletion that results in a truncated product of 18 amino acids compared to the expected size of 166 amino acids. If secretion was negatively impacted because the TcdE protein product was non-functional (i.e. unable to secrete toxins properly), this might explain why the levels of Toxin B were low in this strain despite the truncation to the <italic>tcdC </italic>gene that is suspected to predict toxin hyperproduction. Our study evaluated the levels of secreted toxin B, therefore, the levels of toxin detected in our assays would be low if the strain had decreased ability to secrete toxin. However, there are other strains (e.g. 79A292 and 81A330) that are low toxin producers that do not have defects in <italic>tcdE</italic>. Furthermore, neither ATCC 43255 nor the NAP1-related clinical isolates have defects in <italic>tcdE </italic>yet they produce high titres of biologically active Toxin B in broth culture.</p><p>Our data confirms previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] as near maximal biologically active Toxin B production was reached earlier in the growth curve (24 hours) of "hyperproducing" strains in BHI compared to "non-hyperproducing" strains (36 to 48 hours). We found that "hyperproducing" strains produced 100 to 1000 fold more Toxin B at 24 and 48 hours in BHI compared to "non-hyperproducing" strains. Our studies focused on biological activity of Toxin A and B whereas, Warny et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] assessed total protein concentration irrespective of functionality, so this may explain the difference in ratios between "hyperproducing" and "non-hyperproducing" strains. Both studies assessed the culture supernatant from broth cultures as the source of secreted toxin. We used BHI broth and Warny et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] used an Acambis proprietary broth media, so there may be some differences in the kinetics of toxin production due to different growth medium. In our studies <italic>C. difficile </italic>strain 43255 produced the highest levels of biologically active Toxin B in BHI broth culture compared to all other strains tested, yet it has no deletions in <italic>tcdE</italic>, <italic>tcdC </italic>or <italic>tcdR</italic>, therefore, our data do not support the conclusion by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] that the mutations found in <italic>tcdC </italic>of NAP1 strains accounts for their higher Toxin B production.</p><p>The recent study of Matamouros et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] used cloning experiments and concluded that <italic>tcdR</italic>, which is a positive regulator for Toxin A and B production, was under the negative regulatory control of <italic>tcdC</italic>. They concluded that the TcdC protein product does not directly interact with the Toxin A promoter but rather interacts with TcdR to prevent it from functioning properly and thereby causing a negative impact on Toxin A production (i.e. it acts as a sigma-factor antagonist). They suggest that their data provide the first proof that <italic>tcdC </italic>is a negative regulator and furthermore, they suggest that epidemic strains have mutations in <italic>tcdC </italic>that result in hyper-production of toxin. Despite their elegant data to show how TcdR is negatively impacted by TcdC, their data do not provide an explanation for why the <italic>C. difficile </italic>ATCC strain 43255 is a hyper-producer of Toxins A and B (it has no <italic>tcd</italic>C mutations and has an intact <italic>tcdR</italic>). Furthermore, <italic>C. difficile </italic>strain 1083 has a predicted truncated TcdC yet it does not hyper-produce Toxin A or B. Whether the use of the glutamate dehydrogenase promoter for tcd<italic>C </italic>in these studies (rather than the actual tcdC promoter) has any role in the finding is unknown (all other genes cloned were under control of their natural promoter) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>The assays used in our study to assess biological activity are different so we cannot directly compare the titres of Toxin B to those of Toxin A. Despite this limitation our data does allow comparison of relative production of each toxin across a range of <italic>C. difficile </italic>strains. Strain 43255 produced significantly higher titres of biologically active Toxin B and Toxin A in broth culture compared to all other strains. Differences in the binding avidity, or kinetics of glucosyltransferase activity of Toxin A and B was not assessed. Previous studies have reported that mutation of tryptophan-101 in Toxin A (a similar effect was also seen for Toxin B) resulted in reduced glucosyltransferease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Our results demonstrated that there was approximately 100&#x02013;1000-fold higher titres of biologically active Toxin B production after 24 and 48 hours in broth culture for "hyper" versus "non-hyper" producing clinical isolates. Our results were obtained from the analysis of a small number of isolates that were chosen to represent sub-types of <italic>C. difficile </italic>that have been associated with CDAD. The control strains, ATCC 43255, 43594 and 700057, included the wild-type strain, a second toxigenic strain and a non-toxigenic strain respectively. It is not possible from our data or any of the currently published data to conclusively determine what gene(s) (if any) are responsible for "hyperproduction" of toxins in some strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic>. Furthermore, the significance of <italic>in vitro </italic>"hyperproduction" of Toxin A and B may or may not reflect what occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>. There have been no evaluations of humans infected with "hyperproducing" strains to establish that the titre of Toxin A or B/gram of stool is higher compared to levels in patients infected with non-hyper producing strains of <italic>C. difficile</italic>. However, the recent study by Freeman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] using the human gut model showed that post-exposure to clindamycin, the level of Toxin B production was similar for NAP1-related strain and a ribotype 001 strain.</p><p>Our data would suggest that the Caco2 transmembrane resistance assay is an insensitive test method for Toxin A as &#x02265; 460 ng/ml was needed to give a detectable trans-membrane electrical resistance drop whereas &#x02265; 150 ng/ml of Toxin B produced detectable CPE in HFF cells. Alternatively Toxin A activity may degrade more rapidly in BHI broth culture compared to Toxin B activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our data do not support the role of mutations in <italic>tcdC </italic>as the sole basis for NAP1-related strains being hyper-producers of Toxins A and B. The production of isogenic <italic>C. difficile </italic>mutants has been described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and this approach may be necessary to clarify the role of <italic>tcdC</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
