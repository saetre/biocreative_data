After aqueous subcellular fractionation and removal of the nuclear membranes, three species of DNA-dependent DNA polymerases were characterized: 1) a DNA polymerase-beta in the nuclei. 2) a DNA polymerase-alpha in the cytosol which was not dissociated at high salt concentrations; and 3) an intermediate form in the cytosol and in the Triton wash containing the nuclear membranes. The latter form behaved like DNA polymerase-alpha et low salt concentration but was dissociated at high salt concentrations to a low molecular weight species with properties like DNA polymerase-beta (resistance to inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide, heparin and KCL). In vitro reassociation experiments suggest that this intermediate form corresponds to the association of DNA polymerase-beta with a membrane component or cytoplasmic protein(s) which appear(s) in regenerating rat liver.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00493-0008.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1823"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00493-0009.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1824"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00493-0010.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1825"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00493-0011.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1826"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00493-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1827"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00493-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1828"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00493-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1829"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00493-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1830"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00493-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1831"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00493-0017.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1832"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00493-0018.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1833"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00493-0019.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1834"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00493-0020.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1835"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00493-0021.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1836"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00493-0022.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1837"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
