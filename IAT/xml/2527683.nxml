The respiratory chain comprises the proton-pumping respirasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Schagger1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> associating complexes I, III, and IV and a number of dehydrogenases including complex II. Electrons from respiratory substrates competitively converge from the various dehydrogenases to the CIII-associated quinone pool and are then conveyed to cytochrome oxidase and molecular oxygen by cytochrome <italic>c</italic> loosely bound to the mitochondrial inner membrane. The pumped protons are used to produce ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate via the enzyme ATPase, which associates with adenylate and phosphate carriers to form the ATP synthasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Chen1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. OXPHOS dysfunction underlies a wide spectrum of human diseases, known as mitochondrial diseases. Respiratory chain complex I (RCCI) deficiency contributes 30&#x00025; to 40&#x00025; of all cases of mitochondrial disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Bnit1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Features of RCCI deficiency include optic atrophy, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, growth retardation, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Bnit2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanism, tissue-specificity, and course of mitochondrial diseases are poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Briere1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The number of reported human mitochondrial diseases has increased considerably in recent years. The underlying mutations affect either the mitochondrial DNA or the nuclear genes, of which more than 100 have been incriminated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Zeviani1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Treatments are extremely limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-DiMauro1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. A major obstacle to the development of effective treatments is the absence of reliable animal models. Obtaining mice with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations has proved challenging, and the animals rarely transmit the mutant mtDNA to their progeny, which limits their usefulness as tools for designing treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Larsson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Targeting nuclear genes encoding OXPHOS components has proved more efficient. However, extinction of a majority of the nuclear OXPHOS genes caused early embryonic death or produced no major phenotypic abnormalities. Cre-Lox recombination, in contrast, has been successful in producing mitochondrial abnormalities in specific tissue types. Thus, studies of Tfam-KO and frataxin-KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Wang1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Puccio1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> have shed light on a number of pathological mechanisms. However, the severe biochemical abnormalities in the target tissues fail to replicate human mitochondrial disease, limiting the value of these animal models for designing treatments. Recently, targeting the NDUFS4 subunit of complex I produced mice that exhibit several of the features seen in patients with RCCI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Kruse1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the severe RCCI deficiency in these mice causes death at 7 weeks of age, and the animals do not exhibit the extraordinary variability in disease symptoms and course that characterizes human RCCI deficiency.</p><p>We recently established the occurrence of partial complex I deficiency in the Harlequin (<italic>Hq</italic>) mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Vahsen1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, which is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Klein1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Other features in these animals include early fur abnormalities, optic tract dysfunction with retinitis pigmentosa, and a risk of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Klein1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-vanEmpel2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>Hq</italic> phenotype is due to a proviral insertion in the X-linked gene encoding the mitochondrial protein Apoptosis Inducing Factor (Aif) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Klein1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The insertion causes a partial decrease in the Aif protein to about 20&#x00025; of the amount seen in wild-type mice. Gross development is not significantly affected, but the animals exhibit the typical features of mitochondrial disease. Total loss of Aif function caused abnormal cell death, presumably related to RCCI deficiency, during embryonic development but did not affect the temporal progression of patterning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Brown1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although the involvement of Aif in RCCI assembly and stability is still being investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Porter1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Cheung1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, the characteristics of the <italic>Hq</italic> mouse make it a potential model to investigate complex I deficiencies. With the aim to establish the value of this model, our main objective was to study in details the course of the abnormalities in <italic>Hq</italic> mice and the tissue-specific biochemical features at various time points. We found that the temporal progression of complex I deficiency differed across tissues and that the involvement of each tissue correlated with the residual amount of complex I 20 kDa subunit. Although oxidative injury has been suggested as a key mechanism in the <italic>Hq</italic> phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-vanEmpel2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, antioxidant enzymes were normal except in skeletal muscle, where they were moderately increased.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>I. The <italic>Harlequin</italic> phenotype course</title><p>The onset of most of the gross phenotypic abnormalities varied widely across individuals. Although all the mutant animals eventually developed the disease phenotype, the time-course ranged from early ataxia and death to the slow development of functional impairment over several months. These differences were detected by monitoring body weight, fur abnormalities, and ataxia.</p><p>Weight loss and growth retardation are common among patients with RC disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-vonKleistRetzow1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Munnich1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, we therefore first studied this parameter in wild type and <italic>Hq</italic> mice. B6CBACa Aw-J/A-Pdcd8 mice are relatively small. Thus, in our study, the wild type mice achieved their adult weight of 27&#x000b1;2 g for males (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;19) and 22&#x000b1;2 g for females (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;22) within 4 months. Body weight varied widely in the hemizygous <italic>Hq</italic>/Y males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003208-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) and homozygous <italic>Hq</italic>/<italic>Hq</italic> females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003208-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), with some <italic>Hq</italic> individuals having similar weights to those of wild type animals. No growth retardation occurred in the heterozygous females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003208-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). At 1 month of age, about half the <italic>Hq</italic> males had marked growth retardation with a greater than 30&#x00025; decrease in body weight compared to wild type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003208-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Most of these animals had normal body weights (within 30&#x00025; of the control mean) at 3 months of age and significantly decreased body weights at 6 months of age compared to controls. However, 30&#x00025; of <italic>Hq</italic> animals had no significant growth retardation at 6 mo of age. Growth retardation probably started before birth, as birth weight was significantly lower in the <italic>Hq</italic> population than in the wild type population (1.2&#x000b1;0.2 g (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;15) and 1.5&#x000b1;0.2 g (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;13) respectively; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). The sex ratio was normal in all the litters and the number of <italic>Hq</italic> individuals was consistent with Mendelian inheritance. About 30&#x00025; of <italic>Hq</italic> animals died during the 6-month study, with most deaths occurring between 15 and 30 d of age.

Primary complex I deficiency has been reported to result in oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Koopman1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, but there is no evidence that oxidative stress can specifically cause complex I deficiency. Impairment of mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, manganese-dependent SOD) results instead in a generalized deficiency of the RC, including the iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes (complexes I, II, and III) and the Krebs cycle enzyme aconitase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Melov1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, treatment of Aif-depleted human cells (Hep3B and HeLa cell lines) with antioxidants (<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-cysteine or MitoQ) failed to restore complex I integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Apostolova1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting primary loss of complex I, which might increase superoxide leakage.

Taken in concert, the data suggest that any antioxidant effects of Aif may be confined to the close vicinity of complex I, so that Aif acts as a complex I maintenance protein.

Although the role for Aif remains debated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Joza2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Apostolova1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003208-Qiu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, the effects of Aif deficiency are similar to those of deficiency in any complex I assembly/maintenance factor. NDUFS4 knockout mice exhibit severe RCCI with features similar to those of <italic>Hq</italic> mice (growth retardation, blindness, ataxia, and baldness) but greater disease severity leading to death at 7 weeks of age after only 2 weeks with symptoms. Thus, complex I deficiency seems to be the key determinant of the <italic>Hq</italic> and NDUFS4 knockout models.</p><p>Multivisceral disease develops in <italic>Hq</italic> mice over time.

We failed so far to obtain a clear analogy between the standard Leigh syndrome images observed in a number of patients with complex I deficiency and the <italic>Hq</italic> mice. Similarly, T2-weighted MRI images showing signal hyper intensity have not been reported for the NDUFS4 mutant mice. Disease progression follows the same pattern in all NDUFS4 knockout mice but varies considerably across <italic>Hq</italic> mice. As with humans, both genetic and non-genetic factors may explain this variability, since the animals do not have a pure genetic background (B6CBACa Aw-J/A-Pdcd8) and the phenotypic consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction depend on a number of unidentified factors. Marked inter-individual variability also occurs in human mitochondrial diseases. Thus, the <italic>Hq</italic> model, although difficult to study, constitutes a good model of human mitochondrial diseases. Obviously, as long as the intimate mechanism linking Aif depletion and impaired complex I deficiency is not fully depicted, this model will be best used to test for efficiency of compounds/strategies aiming at counterbalancing the consequences of complex I deficiency.</p><p>Reduced birth weight was the earliest abnormality in <italic>Hq</italic> animals compared to their wild type littermates and suggested intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR).

Body weight in our <italic>Hq</italic> animals was low at birth and subsequently remained lower than in the control animals. The mechanism of IUGR associated with RC deficiencies remains unclear.

This fact, together with the hair abnormalities seen in NDUFS4 knockout mice, supports a role for RCCI deficiency in the hair abnormalities of <italic>Hq</italic> mice. The correlation in our <italic>Hq</italic> mice between the severity of baldness and the severity of growth retardation also suggests a role for RCCI deficiency in the hair abnormalities, as delayed growth is probably due to RCCI deficiency.</p><p>The severity of cerebellar ataxia varied widely in our <italic>Hq</italic> mice, probably reflecting a variable degree of neuron loss.
