To enable incorporation of PBj Vpx into HIV-1 vector particles, a HA-Vpr/Vpx fusion protein was generated. Supplementation of HIV-1 vector particles with this fusion protein was not sufficient to facilitate transduction of human monocytes. However, monocyte transduction with HIV-1-derived vectors was significantly enhanced after delivery of Vpx proteins by virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from SIVsmmPBj. Moreover, pre-incubation with Vpx-containing VLPs restored replication capacity of infectious HIV-1 in human monocytes.

At first, a HA-Vpr/Vpx fusion protein was generated to link Vpx function to the HIV-1 counterpart Vpr in order to mediate packaging of Vpx via Vpr into HIV-1 vector particles and subsequent targeting to the PIC. Furthermore, we attempted to provide Vpx by preincubation of target cells with virus like particles (VLPs) containing Vpx. We analyzed whether Vpx functions enabled single-round infection and full replication of HIV-1 in human and simian monocytes. The results indicate that abolition of the HIV-1 restriction block in monocytes is enabled by Vpx but also requires SIVsmmPBj Gag or Pol functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Packaging of SIVsmmPBj Vpx into HIV-1-derived particles using Vpr-Vpx fusion proteins</title><p>Previously, we have shown that the Vpx protein of SIVsmmPBj is not incorporated into unmodified HIV-1 vector particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Wolfrum1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

This effect increased dose-dependently up to an MOIeq of about 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007098-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).

Transduction rates increased with increasing vector MOI. The highest transduction rate of about 50&#x00025; was reached with an MOI of 10. In contrast, no transduction was detected after preincubation of monocytes with VLPs lacking Vpx, even at an MOI of HIV-1 vector particles of 10.

We described recently that transduction of monocytes with vectors derived from SIVsmmPBj <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Mhlebach1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Wolfrum1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> is clearly enhanced in the presence of the viral protein Vpx, which is not encoded by the genome of HIV-1. To determine whether Vpx is the single factor within the SIVsmmPBj derived virus required for transduction of quiescent cells like monocytes, we decided to assign the functional activities of Vpx to HIV-1. To allow packaging of Vpx into HIV-1 derived virus particles, we generated a chimeric HIV-1 vector harboring the p6 domain of the SIVsmmPBj virus. However, Vpx did not enhance transduction of monocytes with this chimeric HIV-1 vector, although efficient packaging was demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Mhlebach1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Wolfrum1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The block occurred after reverse transcription of vector RNA and before translocation of the PIC into the nucleus, similar to that previously described for HIV-1 wild-type vectors or for SIVsmmPBj vectors lacking Vpx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Neil1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Mhlebach1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Wolfrum1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Schuitemaker1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. We considered that Vpx might not be present in the HIV-1 PIC to enable trafficking of the PIC into the nucleus, since Vpx requires interaction with other virus specific components such as integrase, MA or RNA. Therefore, two further strategies were pursued to assign functional activities of Vpx to HIV-1-derived vectors. First, we achieved packaging into HIV-1 vector particles by fusing PBj Vpx to HIV-1 Vpr, generating a HA-Vpr/Vpx fusion protein. Like Vpx, Vpr has been described to be present in the PIC and thus might transfer the Vpx protein into the HIV-1 PIC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Fletcher1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Mahalingam1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Pancio1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Translocation of the PIC into the nucleus can directly be linked to the nuclear localization of Vpx and Vpr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Belshan1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Singhal1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, and this capacity was retained for the fusion protein HA-Vpr/Vpx. Furthermore, the Vpx part within the HA-Vpr/Vpx fusion protein was still functional in terms of enabling efficient transduction of monocytes, as proven in the context of the PBj4xko-EGFP vector. However, the fusion protein HA-Vpr/Vpx did not enhance transduction of monocytes or monocyte-derived cells if packaged into an HIV-1 vector. We concluded that beside Vpx, other viral components of the PBj-virus are required for efficient monocyte transduction.</p><p>Secondly, we used virus-like particles to assign Vpx functions to HIV-1-derived vectors, thus allowing monocyte transduction. Goujon <italic>et al.</italic> showed that SIVmac Vpx can be functionally provided <italic>in trans</italic> by pre-incubation of dendritic cells (DCs) with non-infectious SIVmac-derived virus-like particles (VLPs), which were simply used as carriers of the Vpx proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Goujon1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Goujon2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. We investigated the suitability of SIVsmmPBj Vpx-containing VLPs derived from SIVsmmPBj to enhance transduction of monocytes by HIV-1 vectors. Remarkably, upon pre-incubation with Vpx-supplemented SIVsmmPBj-derived VLPs, the transduction efficiency of HIV-1 vectors was enhanced 10-fold, which is in line with a very recent publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Goujon3">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. By using increasing amounts of VLPs, we could show that the transduction efficiency was dose-dependent. Transduction with HIV-1 vectors was also mediated when the PBj-derived VLPs were supplemented with the HA-Vpr/Vpx fusion protein, but not by supplementation of HIV-1-derived VLPs with HA-Vpr/Vpx (data not shown). Thus, as already concluded from the transduction experiments using Vpx directly packaged into HIV-1 vector particles, it is evident that the Vpx protein is only capable of mediating monocyte transduction if it is delivered in the background of SIVsmmPBj capsids. Whether SIVsmmPBj capsid components are required for efficient release of Vpx from the particles to the cytoplasm, for a certain activation of Vpx, or for nuclear localization of the PIC, remains still elusive.</p><p>In contrast to our findings, Sharova <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Sharova1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> observed an enhancing effect when Vpx was co-packaged into HIV-1 particles. In this case, no further viral components of SIVsmmPBj were necessary, indicating that the restriction mechanism described by Sharova <italic>et al</italic>. for macrophages may be different from the restriction block present in monocytes investigated by us. In our hands, packaging of Vpx into HIV-1 particles was only possible after insertion of the p6 domain into the HIV-1 genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Wolfrum1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> or after fusion of Vpx to Vpr, thus preventing direct comparison of the function of Vpx-containing HIV-1 particles.</p><p>Remarkably, PBj Vpx did also enable full replication of HIV-1 wild-type virus on human monocytes. Single pre-incubation of monocytes with PBj-derived Vpx-supplemented VLPs was sufficient to promote full replication of a CCR5-tropic HIV-1 virus comparable to that of SIVsmmPBj1.9 wild-type virus encoding Vpx. There are several possible explanations for this observation. It might be possible that the initial infection step during virus replication is most crucial and that once it has entered the nucleus the virus may efficiently replicate in the infected cell. Another explanation might be that Vpx has a sustained effect in the target cells, allowing several rounds of infection. This hypothesis is supported by our own observations that Vpx containing VLPs, delivered to monocytes 20 h before the HIV-1-derived vector still enabled efficient single round transduction (data not shown).</p><p>Possible modes of action of Vpx could be by counteracting the function of cellular antiviral genes, or induction of important cofactors lacking in monocytes and required e.g. for cell cycle progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Dong1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Liou1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. However, surface marker expression indicative for induction of differentiation or activation like CD11c, CD14, CD86, DC-SIGN or MHC-II were not or only marginally influenced by Vpx provided by VLPs, especially at day two after isolation when all of the cells are still monocytes. Similar results have been described for dendritic cells treated with Vpx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Goujon1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we suggest that counteraction of cellular antiviral genes, rather than induction of differentiation or activation, constitutes the functionality of Vpx.</p><p>Several proteins mediating retroviral post-entry and post-integration blocks of HIV-1 in monocytes or DCs have been described. As the suppression of protein expression by specific siRNAs against different members of the APOBEC family, namely A3G, A3A and A3F, restored the susceptibility of monocytes and DCs to HIV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Peng1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Pion1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Peng2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, we analyzed the influence of Vpx on APOBEC expression. Recent experiments indicated that pre-incubation of monocytes with Vpx-supplemented PBj-VLPs did not alter either mRNA levels of A3G, A3A, A3F, A3C or Trim5&#x003b1;<sub>hu</sub>, protein levels of A3A or A3G, although the transduction efficiency of HIV-1 was significantly enhanced (data not shown). From these experiments we concluded that Vpx may not act as a direct antagonist of APOBEC proteins. APOBEC3G has been described to impair the initiation of HIV-1 reverse transcription and/or processivity of reverse transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Iwatani1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since transduction of monocytes was also enhanced when the Vpx containing VLPs were added up to 20 h post HIV-1 transduction (data not shown), it might be likely that the restriction occurs just before translocation of the PIC in the nucleus or even in the nucleus, before integration. However, it remains still elusive in which way Vpx might counteract different APOBEC or Trim5&#x003b1; restriction pathways, considering that we have not observed a change in APOBEC gene expression.</p><p>For non-human primate cells, additional species specific pre- and post- integration blocks of retroviruses, such as Trim5&#x003b1; have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Stremlau1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Sakuma1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007098-Stremlau2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.

Vpx allowed a single-round infection of non-human primate monocytes but did not enable full replication of HIV-1 wild-type virus in monocytes from the simian species tested.

HIV-1-derived vectors were generated likewise but using the vector encoding plasmid pHR-CMV-EGFP and the packaging construct pCMV&#x00394;R8.9. For production of PBj- or HIV-1-derived VLPs, the respective packaging construct was co-transfected with pMD.G. For supplementation of SIVsmmPBj1.9 or HIV-1 vectors or VLPs with Vpx, HA-Vpr or HA-Vpr/Vpx, the respective expression plasmid was additionally co-transfected into vector producing cells. After 48 hours, the vector containing supernatants were collected, filtrated (0.45 &#x000b5;m filter, Sartorius, G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany), concentrated by ultracentrifugation (125,000 x g, 2 h, 4&#x000b0;C) through a 20&#x00025; sucrose cushion and subsequently stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. For titration, vectors were added in serial dilutions to permissive HT1080 cells seeded in 24-well plates. After 4 h, culture medium was exchanged. Four days later, cells were monitored for EGFP expression by FACS analysis. The amount of VLPs was determined by Lenti RT Activity kit (Cavidi AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and normalized in comparison to PBj- or HIV-1-vectors of known infectivity. For incubation experiments, the amount of VLPs per cell was given as MOI-equivalents (MOIeq).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Isolation, transduction and infection of primary human and simian monocytes</title><p>Primary human CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes were isolated from purified PBMC from healthy donors by negative depletion, and monocytes of rhesus macaques or Pig-tailed macaques by positive selection employing magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) using the Monocyte Isolation Kit II or the isolation Kit for non-human primate cells, respectively (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Housing of monkeys and blood donation was maintained in accordance with the German animal license regulations (Tierschutzgesetz). Purity of isolated monocytes was assessed by flow cytometry (FACScan&#x02122;, Becton Dickinson) analysing expression of the monocyte marker CD14 using a specific phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibody (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany). Monocytes were seeded at a density of 4&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/well into 48-well tissue culture plates (BD Falcon, Bedford, MA, USA) and maintained in VLE-RPMI1640 (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 &#x000b5;g/ml), L-glutamine (2 mM), non essential amino acids (Gibco), 10 ml/L OPI (oxaloacetic acid,. pyruvate and insulin; SIGMA-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) and 10&#x00025; human-AB serum (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany). For cultivation of simian cells, culture medium was supplied with 10&#x00025; autologous serum. In some experiments, at the desired day after isolation, monocytes or monocyte-derived cells were pre-exposed for two hours to VLPs where the amount of VLPs per cell was given as MOI-equivalents (MOIeq). For transduction, cells were exposed for 4 h to SIVsmmPBj1.9- or HIV-1-derived vectors. EGFP expression of vector-transduced cells was measured by FACS analysis 6 days post transduction. For analysis of virus replication, monocytes were infected in triplicate on day 1 post isolation with an MOI of 0.5 with HIV-1 or SIVsmmPBj strains and cultured up to day 21. Before infection with the respective wild type viruses, non-human primate cells were pre-stimulated for 8 h with 20 ng/ml TPA. To determine the amount of SIVsmmPBj and HIV-1, supernatants (200 &#x000b5;l) were collected and the amount of reverse transcriptase activity was determined by Lenti RT Activity kit (Cavidi AB, Uppsala, Sweden).</p><p>For determination of cell surface marker expression, primary monocytes were isolated as described above and seeded at a density of 3&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/well into 6-well tissue culture plates (BD Falcon, Bedford, MA, USA).
