This gene is split between codons 121 and 122 and within codon 204 by two introns which are 233 and 181 nucleotides in length, respectively. Comparison of the sequence of the two introns indicates a region of distant relatedness which covers about 25% of their lengths, suggesting that these sequences might have derived from a common ancestral sequence. The encoded amino acid sequence, which matches plasmic-like than muscle-like when compared to vertebrate actins. Analysis of the coding-flanking regions indicates the presence of sequences similar to those thought to be important for initiation of transcription and polyadenylation of mRNA. The location of these sequences and the size of an actin mRNA, transcribed from this or a very closely related gene, suggests that initiation occurs 347 nucleotides 5' of coding and polyadenylation approximately 515 nucleotides 3' of coding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00382-0261.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4081"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00382-0262.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4082"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00382-0263.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4083"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00382-0264.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4084"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00382-0265.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4085"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00382-0266.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4086"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00382-0267.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4087"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00382-0268.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4088"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00382-0269.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4089"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00382-0270.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4090"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00382-0271.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4091"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00382-0272.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4092"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
