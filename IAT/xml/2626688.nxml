Although the antiinflammatory actions of these mediators may contribute to the restoration of homeostasis after tissue injury, their potential impact on antibacterial defense is unknown. The lung is highly susceptible to diverse forms of injury, and secondary bacterial infections after injury are of enormous clinical importance. We show that ACs suppress in vitro phagocytosis and bacterial killing by alveolar macrophages and that this is mediated by a cyclooxygenase&#x02013;PGE<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;E prostanoid receptor 2 (EP2)&#x02013;adenylyl cyclase&#x02013;cyclic AMP pathway. Moreover, intrapulmonary administration of ACs demonstrated that PGE<sub>2</sub> generated during efferocytosis and acting via EP2 accounts for subsequent impairment of lung recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and clearance of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, as well as enhanced generation of IL-10 in vivo. These results suggest that in addition to their beneficial homeostatic influence, antiinflammatory programs activated by efferocytosis in the lung have the undesirable potential to dampen innate antimicrobial responses. They also identify an opportunity to reduce the incidence and severity of pneumonia in the setting of lung injury by pharmacologically targeting synthesis of PGE<sub>2</sub> or ligation of EP2.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The lung is highly susceptible to injury from systemic (e.g., sepsis) or inhalational (e.g., acid aspiration) exposures, and acute lung injury, manifesting clinically as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), exacts a huge human toll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). ARDS is characterized by apoptosis of pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells as well as of infiltrating neutrophils recruited during the inflammatory response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). The surface binding/ingestion of ACs during macrophage efferocytosis has been shown to trigger release of antiinflammatory molecules, including TGF-&#x003b2;, IL-10, nitric oxide, and PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), while inhibiting their secretion of proinflammatory mediators such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, KC, IL-8, and leukotriene C<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). An antiinflammatory program may be critical to restoration of homeostasis and prevention of fibrosis after acute lung injury, as exemplified by the demonstration that intratracheal instillation of ACs enhanced the resolution of acute pulmonary inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). However, it might also impair the lung's capacity to defend itself against infection. Patients being treated in intensive care units for ARDS frequently develop bacterial pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), but the role of efferocytosis in its pathogenesis is difficult to distinguish from that of other existing risk factors, including the altered lung architecture by itself, mechanical ventilation, nutritional deficiencies, and potentially immunosuppressive medications. This study was designed to specifically characterize the impact of efferocytosis on antibacterial defense of the lung and on its resident phagocyte, the alveolar macrophage (AM).</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>Using a variety of recognition receptors for opsonins or pathogen-associated molecular patterns, AMs ingest and kill pathogens, thereby serving a critical function in immune defense of the delicate gas-exchanging region of the lung. One such receptor that plays an important role in antimicrobial responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>) and that has been extensively investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) is the Fc&#x003b3; receptor (FcR) for IgG antibodies. To determine if efferocytosis suppresses in vitro FcR-mediated phagocytosis, rat AMs were preincubated with different ratios of ACs and then challenged with IgG-opsonized erythrocytes (RBCs) or <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> for 90 min. As a source of ACs, we used Jurkat T cells treated with camptothecin using a protocol resulting in 25.6% of cells in early apoptosis with only 3.1% contamination by late apoptotic or necrotic cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Because Fadok et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) previously demonstrated that PGE<sub>2</sub> production by human macrophages occurred after 90 min of incubation with ACs, we initially used this pretreatment interval. Microscopic visualization (unpublished data) indicated that AMs bound and ingested ACs, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Preincubation of AMs for 90 min with various ratios of ACs dose-dependently inhibited subsequent FcR-mediated phagocytosis of both RBCs and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), with &#x02265;50% inhibition being observed at AC/AM ratios of 3:1. The inhibition by ACs (3:1) of FcR-mediated ingestion of both targets was also time dependent over a 15&#x02013;90-min pretreatment interval, and a 16-h pretreatment resulted in near complete suppression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Similar inhibitory effects were obtained when rat thymocytes, rat PMNs, or RLE-6TN rat lung epithelial cells were used as the source of ACs (unpublished data). Preincubation with either viable or necrotic cells had no effect on subsequent FcR-mediated phagocytosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). After their ingestion, macrophages must kill bacteria. Preincubation with ACs (3:1) for 90 min significantly enhanced the intracellular survival of phagocytosed bacteria, reflecting an impairment of AM microbicidal activity against IgG-opsonized <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that preexposure to ACs markedly impairs the ability of AMs to carry out two crucial functions involved in immune defense against bacterial pneumonia: microbial phagocytosis and killing.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Efferocytosis inhibits FcR-mediated phagocytosis and bacterial killing by AMs.</bold> (A) Jurkat T cells were incubated with 8 &#x003bc;g/ml camptothecin for 5 h and apoptotic cells were detected by AnnexinV-FITC/PI and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors indomethacin and aspirin completely abrogated the inhibition of FcR-mediated phagocytosis by ACs, and such inhibition was reproduced by addition of exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Indeed, AMs secreted PGE<sub>2</sub> in response to ACs and this was inhibited by aspirin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). These results suggest that endogenous PGE<sub>2</sub>, produced after binding/ingestion of ACs, is a candidate COX-derived mediator of the immunosuppression of FcR-mediated phagocytosis in AMs. Freire-de-Lima et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) reported that peritoneal or RAW 264.7 macrophages incubated with apoptotic Jurkat cells for 18 h generated increased amounts of TGF-&#x003b2;, and PGE<sub>2</sub> production was inhibited when TGF-&#x003b2; responses were blocked using a dominant negative receptor. In our experimental system, however, we observed no increase over control in TGF-&#x003b2; levels measured in culture supernatants derived from incubations of ACs/AMs after either 90 min or 16 h (unpublished data). Ren et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) recently demonstrated in dendritic cells that nitric oxide, but not IL-10, TGF-&#x003b2;, or PGE<sub>2</sub>, mediates the immunosuppressive effects induced by ACs. These findings suggest that the soluble mediators involved in the suppression of various immune responses after efferocytosis may depend largely on the type and activation state of the phagocytes.</p><p>We have reported that the suppressive effects of PGE<sub>2</sub> on AM antimicrobial functions are primarily mediated by its binding to the EP2 receptor, a G&#x003b1;s-coupled receptor that activates adenylyl cyclase activity with resulting cAMP formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). To assess the specific contribution of PGE<sub>2</sub>, among other prostanoids, to the efferocytosis-induced inhibition of FcR-mediated phagocytosis and to specifically dissect the participation of EP2 in this process, AMs were pretreated with ACs in the presence or absence of the EP2 antagonist AH-6809 and then challenged with IgG RBCs. Inhibition of FcR phagocytosis by ACs was completely abrogated by the EP2 antagonist (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Moreover, AC pretreatment of AMs harvested from mice genetically deficient in the EP2 receptor was unable to significantly inhibit FcR-mediated phagocytosis as it was in cells from WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). The suppressive effect of ACs on AM phagocytosis was also abrogated when these cells were pretreated with the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In addition, inhibition of phagocytosis by ACs directly correlated with increased intracellular levels of cAMP, which was also abrogated by aspirin and SQ 22536 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Bactericidal capacity in the context of efferocytosis was likewise markedly augmented by coincubation with a COX inhibitor, an EP2 antagonist, or an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). These results demonstrate that PGE<sub>2</sub>, acting via an EP2&#x02013;adenylyl cyclase&#x02013;cAMP pathway, mediates the suppressive effects of efferocytosis on FcR-mediated antimicrobial functions by AMs.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Adenylyl cyclase generation of cAMP mediates the suppressive effects of efferocytosis on AM antimicrobial functions.</bold> (A) Phagocytosis of IgG RBCs or IgG <italic>E. coli</italic> was determined after 90-min pretreatment with ACs (3:1) in the absence or presence of 10 &#x003bc;M of the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536.

For these experiments, ACs were generated by dexamethasone treatment of murine thymocytes for 6 h, which yielded 40.3% early apoptotic and 4.93% late apoptotic plus necrotic cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Initially, different numbers of ACs were coadministered intratracheally in C57BL/6 WT mice along with a standard inoculum of the important respiratory pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, and 48 h after challenge the bacterial burdens in lung homogenates were evaluated. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>, there was no difference in pulmonary bacterial clearance of mice that were infected and simultaneously exposed to ACs using this protocol compared with those infected alone. Because our in vitro results indicated that the efferocytosis-induced inhibition of FcR-mediated phagocytosis was time dependent and reached a level of 89% when phagocytic target challenge was performed after an interval of 16 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), we devised a second model in which <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> was administered intratracheally 16 h after various numbers of apoptotic thymocytes were instilled intranasally. As &#x0223c;55% of the total numbers of cells obtained after treatment of thymocytes with dexamethasone remain viable, viable cells were also administrated intranasally as an experimental control. Results showed that pretreatment with ACs, but not viable cells, using this protocol dose-dependently impaired pulmonary bacterial clearance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>) and also led to the dissemination of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> into the bloodstream (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>) 48 h after infection. Finally, to test the role of the EP2 receptor in this impairment of in vivo pulmonary defense against <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> by AC pretreatment, we compared the lung and the bloodstream bacterial burdens in WT versus EP2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In contrast with WT mice, the pulmonary bacterial burden in AC-pretreated EP2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was no greater than in non&#x02013;AC-pretreated controls but was 2.5 logs lower than in AC-pretreated WT mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>). In addition, EP2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibited no bacteremia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). Because these mice lack preexisting antibodies against <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, bacterial recognition and clearance by phagocytes in the in vivo model is likely independent of FcR, indicating that the PGE<sub>2</sub>/EP2/cAMP axis also suppresses innate immune responses when bacterial recognition proceeds via other relevant recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), collectins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), or scavenger receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Intrapulmonary administration of ACs impairs host defense in a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia.</bold> (A) Thymocytes were incubated with 1 &#x003bc;M dexamethasone for 6 h and ACs were detected by AnnexinV-FITC/PI and analyzed by flow cytometry.

As World Health Organization statistics document that respiratory infections account for more life years lost around the world than any other category of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), the implications of these findings for global health may be substantial. Although ARDS is the most conspicuous example of such a scenario, chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>) and emphysema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>) also involve ongoing apoptosis and confer a high risk of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). The capacities of AMs to bind and ingest ACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), as well as to generate prostanoids including PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), are known to be reduced relative to those of peritoneal macrophages. For this reason, it was not obvious that either efferocytosis itself or PGE<sub>2</sub> generated under such conditions would mediate suppression of antimicrobial defense in AMs in vitro or in the lung in vivo. Nevertheless, the studies reported here demonstrate that efferocytosing AMs generate sufficient PGE<sub>2</sub> as well as sufficient EP2-mediated signaling responses to this lipid mediator to largely account for impairment of subsequent antibacterial responses in vitro and in vivo. As a variety of COX inhibitors are currently available, and as EP2 antagonists are under active development, our findings suggest that therapeutic targeting of this pathway has the potential to augment innate immunity in the lung under conditions characterized by apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Reagents.</title><p>RPMI 1640 and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B solution were purchased from Invitrogen.
