We have identified a novel population of dysfunctional T cells marked by surface expression of the glycoprotein Tim-3. The frequency of this population was increased in HIV-1&#x02013;infected individuals to a mean of 49.4 &#x000b1; SD 12.9% of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells expressing Tim-3 in HIV-1&#x02013;infected chronic progressors versus 28.5 &#x000b1; 6.8% in HIV-1&#x02013;uninfected individuals. Levels of Tim-3 expression on T cells from HIV-1&#x02013;infected inviduals correlated positively with HIV-1 viral load and CD38 expression and inversely with CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count. In progressive HIV-1 infection, Tim-3 expression was up-regulated on HIV-1&#x02013;specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Tim-3&#x02013;expressing T cells failed to produce cytokine or proliferate in response to antigen and exhibited impaired Stat5, Erk1/2, and p38 signaling. Blocking the Tim-3 signaling pathway restored proliferation and enhanced cytokine production in HIV-1&#x02013;specific T cells. Thus, Tim-3 represents a novel target for the therapeutic reversal of HIV-1&#x02013;associated T cell dysfunction.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: bDNA, branched-chain DNA; CEF, CMV/EBV/Influenza; CIRC, Canadian Immunodeficiency Research Collaborative; HAART, highly active antiretroviral therapy; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; mRNA, messenger RNA; P&#x0002b;I, PMA/Ionomycin; SEB, staphylococcus enterotoxin B; sTIM-3, soluble TIM-3.</p></fn><fn><p>R.B.

However, in most cases cellular immunity to HIV-1 proves incapable of long-term control of viremia and, without antiretroviral therapy, progression to AIDS occurs. The failure of the host immune system to contain HIV-1 is related to the functional impairment of HIV-1&#x02013;specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that accompanies progressive HIV-1 infection, a phenomenon which is referred to as T cell exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). In HIV-1 infection, the deterioration of the T cell response follows a characteristic pattern: proliferative capacity, cytotoxic potential, and the ability to produce IL-2 are lost early, whereas the production of IFN-&#x003b3; is more enduring. Ultimately, the majority of T cells chronically exposed to HIV-1 antigens enter into a state of dysfunction and, as disease advances, even the ability to produce IFN-&#x003b3; is progressively impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). The causal relationship between this progressive T cell exhaustion and high levels of HIV-1 replication in progressive infection remains unclear. Recently, signaling through PD-1 was shown to play an important role in T cell exhaustion in three models of chronic viral infection: LCMV in mice, SIV in rhesus macaques, and HIV-1 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Blockade of the PD-1&#x02013;PD-L1 signaling pathway results in enhanced T cell responses and viral control in mouse LCMV infection, as well as in enhanced survival and proliferation of HIV-1&#x02013;specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in vitro. Increased levels of total cytokine production and increased frequencies of cells producing cytokine in response to antigen are also induced in 6-d in vitro cultures treated with anti&#x02013;PD-L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). However, it has been demonstrated that there is no direct relationship between the level of PD-1 expression of an HIV-1&#x02013; or SIV-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell and the ability of that cell to produce cytokine upon ex vivo stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). This has lead to the suggestion that the enhanced levels of total cytokine production observed in vitro with the addition of anti&#x02013;PD-L1 is the result of greater survival and expansion of antigen-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells rather than improved functionality on a per-cell basis. These data suggest that PD-1 expression marks a population exhibiting features of relatively early T cell exhaustion, where cell survival and proliferation are impaired but cytokine production remains intact. Thus, the mechanisms leading to advanced stages of T cell exhaustion, where cytokine production becomes impaired, remain largely undefined.</p><p>Tim-3 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain&#x02013;containing molecule 3) is an Ig superfamily member that was identified as a specific cell surface marker of mouse Th1 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Interaction of mouse Tim-3 with its ligand, galectin-9, regulates Th1 responses by promoting the death of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). In mice, blocking the interaction of Tim-3 with its ligands prevents the acquisition of transplantation tolerance induced by costimulatory blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Furthermore, Tim-3&#x02013;deficient mice are refractory to the induction of high-dose tolerance in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, and anti&#x02013;Tim-3 monoclonal antibody treatment of SJL/J mice exacerbated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). These results indicate that Tim-3 plays a role in suppressing Th1-mediated immune responses, at least partially through the termination of effector Th1 cells. In humans, a defect in up-regulation of Tim-3 on IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells has been implicated as a contributing factor to the pathology associated with multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). No study has yet examined the role of Tim-3 in chronic viral infection.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Tim-3 expression on T cells correlates with clinical parameters of progression in HIV-1&#x02013;infected individuals</title><p>We profiled Tim-3 expression by flow cytometry on PBMC from 9 HIV-1&#x02013;uninfected individuals and 31 treatment-naive, acute/early, and chronically HIV-1&#x02013;infected subjects (Canadian Immunodeficiency Research Collaborative [CIRC] cohort) that included both viral controllers (nonprogressors) and progressors using a polyclonal anti&#x02013;Tim-3 antibody. We observed elevated frequencies of Tim-3&#x02013;expressing CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in acute/early and chronic progressive HIV-1&#x02013;infected individuals, but not in viral controllers, relative to uninfected individuals (mean 28.5 &#x000b1; SD 6.8% for HIV-1&#x02013;uninfected versus 52.2 &#x000b1; 19.0% for acutely/early infected individuals [P &#x0003d; 0.0015], 49.4 &#x000b1; 12.9% for chronic progressors [P &#x0003d; 0.0003], and 31.6 &#x000b1; 7.3% for viral controllers [P &#x0003d; 0.48]; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, a and b</xref>). Tim-3 expression was also elevated on CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from acutely/early infected individuals and chronic progressors, as compared with both viral controllers and HIV-1&#x02013;uninfected individuals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, a and b</xref>). The frequency of Tim-3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells correlated positively with HIV-1 viral load (P &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 d</xref>) and inversely with absolute CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell counts (P &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 d</xref>). Similarly, the frequencies of Tim-3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were significantly correlated with viral load (P &#x0003d; 0.0087) and absolute CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell counts (P &#x0003d; 0.0273; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 d</xref>). T cell activation, as reported by CD38 expression, is an additional predictor of disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). CD38 expression on CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells correlated with the frequency of Tim-3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (P &#x0003c; 0.0001; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 d</xref>), and CD38 expression on CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells correlated with the frequency of Tim-3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (P &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 d</xref>). In acute/early and chronic progressive HIV-1 infection, increased expression of both Tim-3 and CD38 manifested as a frequent dual Tim-3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD38<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081398/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081398/DC1</ext-link>). In a separate cohort of 60 treatment-naive acutely/early HIV-1&#x02013;infected individuals (OPTIONS cohort), we observed an analogous increase in the frequency of Tim-3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells as assessed with a monoclonal anti&#x02013;Tim-3 antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref> and Fig. S2 a).

We observed significantly higher levels of Tim-3 on HIV-1&#x02013;specific versus CMV-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (P &#x0003d; 0.0065 by mean fluorescence intensity [MFI], P &#x0003d; 0.0026 by percentage of Tim-3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, a&#x02013;e</xref>). CMV-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells exhibited low levels of Tim-3 expression, with the exception of one response to CMV-pp65-TPRVTGGGAM, which exhibited high levels of Tim-3 expression as measured by MFI, observed in cells from an individual with AIDS (absolute CD4 count, 132 cells/&#x003bc;l). Tim-3 expression was heterogenous among HIV-1&#x02013;specific responses, with some exhibiting very high levels of Tim-3, whereas others exhibited only baseline levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, c and e</xref>). The heterogeneity observed in Tim-3 expression levels on HIV-1&#x02013;specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells cannot be attributed solely to intersubject variability, as responses with high levels of Tim-3 expression were frequently observed contemporaneously with responses exhibiting low levels of Tim-3 expression within the same individual.

Four subjects with chronic infection demonstrated a steady decline in Tim-3 levels on both CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells with HAART, whereas three subjects (OM 304, 331, and 287) maintained high levels of Tim-3 expression despite achieving undetectable HIV-1 viral loads (&#x0003c;50 copies/ml branched-chain DNA [bDNA]; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, a and b</xref>; and Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081398/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081398/DC1</ext-link>). In a mixed-effects longitudinal analysis we observed that CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell activation, as measured by CD38 expression, was significantly associated with Tim-3 expression over the period of HAART. Levels of CD38 expression on CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, as measured by either percentage or MFI, were associated with levels of Tim-3 expression on CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells during therapy, with a 0.38% higher Tim-3 expression per 1% higher CD38 expression (SE &#x0003d; 0.11; P &#x0003d; 0.001; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>) and a 0.7% higher Tim-3 expression per unit higher CD38 MFI (SE &#x0003d; 0.19; P &#x0003d; 0.001).

Ki67 antigen is a nuclear protein that is generally expressed only in cells in the late G<sub>1</sub>, S, G<sub>2</sub>, and M phases of cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Hence, it is generally used as a marker of proliferating cells. In chronic HIV-1 infection, however, it has been demonstrated that the large majority (92 &#x000b1; 5%) of Ki67<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in peripheral blood are activated cells that are arrested in the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phases of cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Several studies have noted that Ki67 expression on T cells from HIV-1&#x02013;infected individuals is associated with dysfunction or anergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>).

Expression of Tim-3 on this population, which has been characterized as activated but arrested in cell cycle, is consistent with our in vitro data showing a lack of proliferation of Tim-3&#x02013;expressing cells. Collectively, these studies indicate that Tim-3 expression defines a population of activated, but dysfunctional, T cells in HIV-1 infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Blocking the Tim-3&#x02013;Tim-3L pathway enhances the functionality of HIV-1&#x02013;specific T cells</title><p>To delineate the causal relationship between Tim-3 expression and T cell dysfunction, we tested whether blocking the interaction of Tim-3 with its ligands would restore function in Tim-3&#x02013;expressing cells.

Addition of sTim-3 enhanced the expansion of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells specific for the HLA-A&#x0002a;0201 restricted HIV-1&#x02013;Gag epitope SLYNTVATL (SL9) in HIV-1&#x02013;infected chronic progressors in a dose-dependent manner up to 2 &#x003bc;g/ml (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 a</xref>).

Shown are flow cytometry plots showing CD3 by CFSE, where diminution of CFSE is indicative of proliferated cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jem2052763f06"></graphic></fig><p>An additional observation from these experiments is that cells that had undergone proliferation in vitro exhibited high levels of Tim-3 expression (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081398/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081398/DC1</ext-link>). Tim-3 up-regulation in response to anti-CD3/anti-CD28 was observed as early as 20 h after stimulation and progressively increased out to at least 120 h (unpublished data). This is consistent with Tim-3 acting as a negative immune regulator, where antigen-stimulated cells perform effector functions and then up-regulate Tim-3 as a means of terminating responses. In reconciling our ex vivo data showing a lack of cytokine production from Tim-3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells with published in vitro data demonstrating an association between IFN-&#x003b3; production and high levels of Tim-3 expression, there is an important distinction to make. Cells expressing Tim-3 ex vivo have been subjected to chronic stimulation in vivo and are dysfunctional to further in vitro stimulation. In contrast, when Tim-3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cultured cells are stimulated in vitro they perform effector functions, such as producing IFN-&#x003b3;, and then up-regulate Tim-3 to dampen these responses. Thus, depending on when one observes these cultures, high levels of Tim-3 and IFN-&#x003b3; could be observed in association. This model predicts that in addition to restoring functions of exhausted HIV-1&#x02013;specific T cells, in vitro treatment with sTim-3 should prolong effector function in response to other antigens. This is supported by examining the level of IFN-&#x003b3; production at day 5 of in vitro stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28. Under these conditions, all cells that have undergone division express high levels of Tim-3 (unpublished data). In the presence of sTim-3, these cells consistently express higher levels of IFN-&#x003b3; than in the presence of a control (Fig. S7, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081398/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081398/DC1</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>The Tim-3&#x02013;expressing T cell population is distinct from the PD-1&#x02013;expressing population.</title><p>Because PD-1 has been identified as a marker of exhausted T cells in HIV-1 infection, we determined whether Tim-3 expression defines the same or a distinct population.

This complements and integrates previous studies that have identified an important role for Tim-3 in immunoregulation and have implicated defective Tim-3 signaling in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). We show that in HIV-1 infection, the proportion of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in peripheral blood that express Tim-3 can reach in excess of 70 and 30%, respectively (in contrast to means of 28.5 and 17.6% in HIV-1&#x02013;uninfected individuals). As these frequencies exceed the proportion of HIV-1&#x02013;specific cells in the periphery, suppression of T cell function by Tim-3 likely contributes not only to the loss-of-functional virus-specific responses but also to the impairment of responses to other antigens. This is supported by our observation that a subset of CMV and EBV-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in chronic HIV-1&#x02013;infected individuals expresses high levels of Tim-3 and is consistent with observations that HIV-1&#x02013;infected individuals have reduced responses to recall antigens and vaccinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). The factors leading to this generalized expression of Tim-3 are unknown. Our data does, however, show a disproportionately high level of Tim-3 expression on HIV-1&#x02013;specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, which is consistent with the preferential dysfunction of HIV-1&#x02013;specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in chronic HIV-1 infection. We speculate that the heterogeneity that we observed in levels of Tim-3 expression on HIV-1&#x02013;specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses may reflect the relative functionality of that response, with greater frequencies of Tim-3&#x02013;expressing antigen-specific cells associated with more advanced exhaustion and dysfunction. It will also be important to determine whether the fixation of escape mutations results in diminished Tim-3 expression on epitope-specific T cells and improvement in functionality, as has been described for PD-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). These questions will be addressed by future studies.</p><p>We observed that the initiation of HAART in chronic progressive HIV-1 infection frequently resulted in a decline in Tim-3 expression (four out of seven individuals). However, we observed that a subset of chronically HIV-1&#x02013;infected individuals on HAART therapy (three out of seven) retained high levels of Tim-3 expression despite suppression of HIV-1 viral load to undetectable levels. Maintenance of Tim-3 expression in the context of HAART was associated with sustained high levels of T cell activation (CD38 expression). Persistence of CD38 expression on T cells during HAART is predictive of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). In cases where HAART has failed to result in a reduction in CD38 expression, it has been demonstrated that intensification of HAART by eradicating persistent low-level replication can have a positive impact on immunological parameters, including diminishment of CD38 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>).</p><p>Our demonstration that blockade of the Tim-3 pathway can enhance HIV-1&#x02013;specific T cell responses ex vivo clearly demonstrates that the Tim-3 pathway plays a critical role in suppressing the overall T cell response to HIV-1. It should be noted, however, that although T cell exhaustion is associated with increased viral replication, it is unclear whether this phenotype leads to loss of viral control in vivo or whether this loss results primarily from other factors, such as viral escape from CTL epitopes or the persistence of viral replication in sanctuaries inaccessible to CTL. The identification of Tim-3 as a novel mechanism of T cell exhaustion constitutes an important prerequisite for designing studies aimed at delineating the relative contributions of T cell exhaustion versus other factors in the overall inability of the cellular immune response to maintain control of HIV-1 replication.</p><p>An important implication of the present study is the possibility that pharmacological agents that block Tim-3 signaling may be of benefit in HIV-1 infection and potentially in other chronic viral diseases. However, it is unclear whether the high level of Tim-3 expressed in HIV-1 infection is the result of a pathological mechanism on the part of the virus to incapacitate the host immune system or if it is a physiological response to chronic immune activation necessary to hold immunopathology in check. With regard to the latter, recent data supporting that a dysregulation of the Tim-3 pathway may contribute to the pathology of multiple sclerosis highlights the importance of Tim-3 in regulating potentially harmful immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). This situation is analogous to the considerations required in pursuing PD-1 as a therapeutic target. An important distinction of Tim-3 as a therapeutic target is its unique association with T cells that are impaired not only in their survival and proliferative potential but also in their ability to produce cytokine. Thus, blockade of the Tim-3 pathway carries the novel potential to enhance not only the numbers of T cells in HIV-1 infection but also to improve the functionality of both CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in HIV-1&#x02013;infected individuals. Because a subset of subjects maintain high levels of Tim-3 expression despite seemingly effective HAART regimens, Tim-3 therapeutics may also play a role in reversing immune defects that persist with HAART.</p><p>The data presented in the present study clearly demonstrate that Tim-3 expression defines a distinct population of exhausted T cells from that of the recently identified PD-1&#x02013;expressing population. This corroborates a recent study that reported that PD-1&#x02013;expressing cells comprise only a subpopulation of dysfunctional HIV-1&#x02013;specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in chronic progressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). The mechanisms leading to T cell exhaustion in the context of HIV-1 infection are clearly complex and cannot be attributed to a single pathway. It will be intriguing in future studies to explore the possibility of an additive or a synergistic effect of simultaneously blocking both the Tim-3 and PD-1 pathways. Such strategies may allow for a more comprehensive reversal of T cell exhaustion, potentially leading to potent combination therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Subjects.</title><p>Subjects were selected from participants in the CIRC Cohort, Toronto, Canada, and the OPTIONS Cohort, University of California San Francisco (UCSF). The CIRC cohort represented acutely/early HIV-1&#x02013;infected subjects, HIV-1&#x02013;infected chronic progressors, and HIV-1&#x02013;infected viral controllers. Acute/early subjects were defined as individuals infected with HIV-1 within the last 4 mo. Chronic progressors were defined as individuals infected with HIV-1 for &#x0003e;1 yr with a CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count decline of &#x0003e;50 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>/year. Viral controllers were defined as individuals infected with HIV-1 for &#x0003e;1 yr, no evidence of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count decline, and a viral load of &#x0003c;5,000 copies/ml bDNA. Clinical data for the cohort used in this study were the following: acute/early, absolute CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell counts median &#x0003d; 542 and range &#x0003d; 180&#x02013;1,240 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, and viral loads median &#x0003d; 227,567 and range &#x0003d; 79,000 to &#x0003e;500,000 copies/ml; chronic progressors, absolute CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell counts median &#x0003d; 250 and range &#x0003d; 132&#x02013;660 cells/ml, and viral loads median &#x0003d; 50,000 and range &#x0003d; 290&#x02013;500,000 copies/ml; and viral controllers, absolute CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell counts median &#x0003d; 936 and range &#x0003d; 600&#x02013;1,440 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, and viral loads median &#x0003d; 100 and range &#x0003d; 50&#x02013;250 copies/mm<sup>3</sup>. The subject with a viral load of 290 copies/ml, defined as a chronic progressor, was included in this patient group based on a CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count that had declined to 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. The next lowest viral load in the chronic progressor group was 11,608 copies/ml. The chronic progressor with a relatively healthy absolute CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count of 660 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> had a viral load of 51,250 copies/ml and exhibited CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count decline. The relatively high CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count in this individual was likely because of their relatively recent infection (13 mo). Controls were obtained from HIV-1&#x02013;uninfected patients in the same demographic area with a similar age and sex profile and were processed in an identical manner. For the OPTIONS Cohort, baseline samples from all recruited subjects were evaluated to establish their HIV-1 infection status. Screened subjects must meet one of three criteria to be defined as having acute/early HIV-1 infection: (1) HIV-1 RNA &#x0003e;5,000 copies/ml with a negative or indeterminate HIV-1 antibody test; (2) a documented negative HIV-1 antibody test within 6 mo with current seroconversion; or (3) a history compatible with acute/early HIV-1 infection with laboratory confirmation based on a nonreactive less sensitive antibody test. All subjects discuss the advantages and disadvantages of early antiretroviral therapy with study staff and arrangements are made for therapy for those who elect to initiate treatment. Slightly over half of participants decline therapy. A total of 60 individuals with acute/early HIV-1 infection from the OPTIONS cohort were examined in this study. A median CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell count of 544 (interquartile range 429.5, 721) cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and median HIV-1 viral load of 4.7 (interquartile range 3.66, 5.2) log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml. Controls were obtained from HIV-1&#x02013;uninfected patients from both the Stanford Blood Bank and uninfected individuals from the cohort demographics. Additional subjects on HAART were recruited from these cohorts. This study was approved by the University of Toronto Institutional Review Board and by the UCSF Committee on Human Research, and subjects gave written informed consent.

The Tim-3 insert was obtained from PCR using the following primers : Tim-3 external forward, 5&#x02032;-TTCGGCCGGC<underline>CCTCAGAAGTGGAATACAGAGCGG</underline>-3&#x02032;; and Tim-3 external reverse, 5&#x02032;-TGAGCGGCCGCTCATCA<underline>TCTGATGGTTGCTCCAGAGTC</underline>-3&#x02032;. For each primer, the underlined bases represent the template annealing sequence. Additional 5&#x02032; sequences comprise restriction sites and stop codons. The region amplified by these primers constitutes only the IgV and mucin domains of Tim-3. The resultant Tim-3 amplicon was cloned into the FseI&#x02013;NotI cloning site of pPA-TEV. 10 &#x003bc;g of circular DNA plasmid was then transfected into HEK293T cells using the calcium phosphate method (Invitrogen). Expression of Tim-3 was confirmed by Western blot using a 1/5,000 dilution of a polyclonal anti&#x02013;Tim-3 antibody (R&#x00026;D Systems) and a 1/5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase&#x02013;conjugated streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Transfection was then repeated with linearized pPA&#x02013;TEV&#x02013;Tim-3 plasmid to generate stable cell lines. A parallel transfection was performed with empty linearized pPA-TEV. 3 d after transfection, puromycin drug selection was initiated by replacing the media with fresh media supplemented with 1&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;g/ml puromycin. The media was exchanged with fresh puromycin-containing media every 2 d. 10 d later, six colonies from the pPA&#x02013;TEV&#x02013;Tim-3 transfection and six from the pPA-TEV transfection were isolated and expanded into 6-well tissue culture plates. Secreted proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using an anti&#x02013;Tim-3 antibody for pPA&#x02013;TEV&#x02013;Tim-3 and an anti&#x02013;protein-A antibody for pPA-TEV. A Tim-3&#x02013;secreting clone (pPA&#x02013;TEV&#x02013;Tim-3 transfected) and a control protein A&#x02013;secreting clone (pPA-TEV transfected) were selected and grown up in 2 liters each of CHO-SFM-II media supplemented with 2% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, Hepes, <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and 1 &#x003bc;g/liter apoprotinin (Sigma-Aldrich) in six T175 tissue culture flasks. Cells were plated at 50% confluency, and protein secretion was allowed to continue for 5 d. Supernatants were concentrated from 2 liters to 10 ml using Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filter units (Millipore). Proteins were purified using IgG Sepharose 6 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare) as per the manufacturer's instructions. 200 &#x003bc;l of 0.33 mg/ml His-tagged TEV protease was then added to the beads, and cleavage was allowed to proceed overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Supernatants were removed from beads, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml Tris-saline Tween, pH 7.2, and supernatants were pooled with wash eluates. This combined eluate was passed through a 1-ml nickel column (B-PER 6&#x000d7; His fusion protein purification kit; Thermo Fisher Scientific) to remove TEV protease and washed with 3 &#x000d7; 2 ml of wash buffer 2 from the same kit. The eluates were subsequently passed through Detoxi-Gel endotoxin removal columns (Thermo FIsher Scientific), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then concentrated to 0.5 ml using Centricon plus-20 centrifugal filter units (Millipore). Volumes were then adjusted to 15 ml using sterile PBS and reconcentrated to 0.5 ml. The purity and identity of products were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay. As expected, only small amounts of residual protein were detectable in the protein A control purification.

Real-time PCRs were performed using the Prism 7900HT (Applied Biosystems) in 384-microwell plates. All samples, including the external standards, nontemplate control, and RT controls, were run in triplicate. Each 10-&#x003bc;l reaction contained PCR buffer (Invitrogen), 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM dNTP (Applied Biosystems), 1 nM each of forward and reverse primers (Invitrogen), a 1/50 dilution of ROX reference dye (Sigma-Aldrich), a 3/100,000 dilution of SYBR Green I (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.05 U of Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), and template DNA. Template was a sevenfold serial dilution of genomic DNA for generation of standard curves, 5 &#x003bc;l of complementary DNA synthesis reactions, or 5 &#x003bc;l of matching RT control. Reaction conditions were 95&#x000b0;C for 3 min, followed by 36 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s, 64&#x000b0;C for 15 s, and 72&#x000b0;C for 20 s. A final dissociation stage was run to generate a melting curve for verification of amplification product specificity. Real-time PCR was monitored and analyzed by the Sequence Detection System (version 2.0; Applied Biosystems).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Statistical analyses.</title><p>We used mixed effects longitudinal analyses to determine if CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell activation levels independently associated with Tim-3 on CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells during antiretroviral therapy.
