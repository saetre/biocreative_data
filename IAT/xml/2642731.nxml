In addition to influencing the misfolding and aggregation behavior of the mutant proteins, polymorphisms in putative modifier genes may affect the molecular processes leading to the disease phenotype. Mutations in <italic>SOD1</italic> in a subset of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases confer dominant but clinically variable toxicity, thought to be mediated by misfolding and aggregation of mutant SOD1 protein. While the mechanism of toxicity remains unknown, both the nature of the <italic>SOD1</italic> mutation and the genetic background in which it is expressed appear important. To address this, we established a <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> model to systematically examine the aggregation behavior and genetic interactions of mutant forms of SOD1. Expression of three structurally distinct SOD1 mutants in <italic>C. elegans</italic> muscle cells resulted in the appearance of heterogeneous populations of aggregates and was associated with only mild cellular dysfunction. However, introduction of destabilizing temperature-sensitive mutations into the genetic background strongly enhanced the toxicity of SOD1 mutants, resulting in exposure of several deleterious phenotypes at permissive conditions in a manner dependent on the specific SOD1 mutation. The nature of the observed phenotype was dependent on the temperature-sensitive mutation present, while its penetrance reflected the specific combination of temperature-sensitive and SOD1 mutations. Thus, the specific toxic phenotypes of conformational disease may not be simply due to misfolding/aggregation toxicity of the causative mutant proteins, but may be defined by their genetic interactions with cellular pathways harboring mildly destabilizing missense alleles.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Correct folding and stability are essential for protein function. In cells, a network of molecular chaperones and degradative enzymes facilitate folding, prevent aggregation and ensure degradation of the misfolded proteins, thus maintaining protein homeostasis. In many diseases, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), expression of a single mutant protein that misfolds and aggregates causes cellular toxicity that is strongly dependent on the genetic background. To address the influence of genetic background on the toxicity of aggregation-prone proteins, we established a <italic>C. elegans</italic> model of misfolding and aggregation of several distinct ALS-related mutants of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). In one wild type genetic background (N2), these proteins exhibited only mild cellular toxicity despite strong, mutant-specific aggregation phenotypes. However, when SOD1 mutants were expressed in the background of mildly destabilized protein polymorphisms, their toxicity was enhanced and a number of distinct phenotypes were exposed. These synthetic phenotypes reflected the loss-of-function of the destabilized polymorphic proteins. Furthermore, the degree to which each of these phenotypes was exposed depended on the nature of the SOD1 mutation. These data suggest that the presence of mildly destabilizing polymorphisms in the genetic background may modulate and direct the specific toxic phenotypes in protein aggregation diseases.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>ALS (OMIM #105400 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?cmd=entry&#x00026;id=105400">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?cmd=entry&#x00026;id=105400</ext-link>) is a progressive degenerative disorder affecting motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord.

The second hypothesis suggests that, as for many other neurodegenerative diseases, the toxicity is mediated by misfolding and aggregation of mutant proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000399-Wang1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000399-Jonsson1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000399-Rakhit1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, when mutant SOD1 was introduced into genetic backgrounds harboring destabilizing temperature-sensitive mutations, the toxicity was enhanced significantly and a variety of toxic phenotypes was observed.

Furthermore, metastable proteins encoded by these ts mutations were found to misfold and lose function in polyQ strains, indicating that protein folding homeostasis was disrupted by chronic protein misfolding. Unlike polyQ, mutant SOD1 proteins, though highly aggregation-prone, exhibited much lower toxicity on their own. The demonstration that toxicity of both mutant SOD1 and polyQ expansions can be modulated by metastable proteins supports our contention that the proteostasis network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000399-Balch1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> is sensitive to cumulative protein damage, and that the disruption of protein folding may be a common mechanism that underlies the toxicity of different aggregation-prone proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Aggregation-Prone Proteins and Mildly Destabilized Protein Polymorphisms Compete for Folding Resources</title><p>Each of the SOD1 mutant proteins used in this study exhibits distinct biophysical properties <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000399-Rakhit2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, and forms morphologically, structurally and enzymatically distinct molecular species and aggregates in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. It is thus possible that SOD1 mutant proteins form different intermediate folding states <italic>in vivo</italic> depending on the nature of the mutation, and as such may possess different functional interactions with the folding machinery of the cell. Indeed, G85R and G93A proteins were recently shown to have different interactions with HSP70 in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000399-Ganesan1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, the structure and functions of paramyosin, UNC-45, and Ras are diverse (a structural coiled-coil protein, a soluble TPR domain-containing protein and a small GTPase, respectively) and these proteins are not overexpressed as they are expressed from their endogenous chromosomal loci. Thus, it is unlikely that the synergistic effects on toxicity are because of direct and specific molecular interactions between these protein polymorphisms and mutant SOD1. This is in agreement with our previous observation that polyQs cause misfolding of metastable proteins in the absence of direct molecular interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000399-Gidalevitz1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, and with a recent report that many of the modifiers of toxicity of polyQ-expanded ataxin-3 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> also rescue the generic toxicity of protein misfolding due to the reduced function of HSP70 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000399-Bilen1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, both the functionality of metastable proteins and polyglutamine aggregation can be compromised by neuronally-mediated overexcitation of the muscle cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000399-Garcia1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings parallel recent computational evidence that the selection against the toxicity of misfolding due to mistranslation exerts strong evolutionary pressure specifically on the highly expressed proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000399-Drummond1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, indicating that the flux of destabilized proteins in a cell bears a significant fitness cost, and that folding resources are indeed limiting. In support of this, we show that overexpression of the heat-shock transcription factor HSF-1 rescues the toxic phenotypes in a strain co-expressing an SOD1 mutant G93A and a metastable ts mutant of UNC-45 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000399.s005">Figure S5<italic>B</italic></xref>). Thus, we propose that the genetic interactions between disease-causing mutations and mildly destabilizing protein polymorphisms are mediated at the cellular level by competition of their respective gene products for folding resources.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Cell-Type Specific Toxicity of Aggregation-Prone Proteins</title><p>This hypothesis could offer an explanation for the apparent paradox of cell-type-specific toxicity caused by ubiquitously expressed toxic proteins in conformational diseases. Indeed, in SOD1-related ALS, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, specific neuronal subtypes are affected despite ubiquitous expression of SOD1, huntingtin and APP, respectively. The differential modulation of mutant SOD1 toxicity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by specific ts mutations suggest that the presence of mildly destabilizing protein polymorphisms in the genetically diverse human population could direct such specific phenotypes: because each cell type contains characteristic complement of expressed proteins, the genetic interactions of aggregation-prone proteins with destabilizing polymorphisms are expected to manifest in a cell type-specific manner. The disease variability across the population suggests that such protein polymorphisms may be specific to individuals or families, and missed in the population-based linkage analyses. A recent study found that up to 70&#x00025; of rare missense alleles are mildly deleterious in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000399-Kryukov1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>; some of these polymorphisms may result in the production of metastable or folding-deficient proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000399-Pakula1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000399-Suckow1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Identification of cell-specific pathways or protein complexes, which may disfunction when folding or stability of their components is challenged by co-expression with an aggregation-prone protein, may thus provide specific toxic mechanisms for conformational diseases and help focus the search for disease-modifying polymorphisms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Nematode Strains and Growth Conditions</title><p>Nematodes were grown on NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 strain.
