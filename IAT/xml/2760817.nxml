SgrS is a dual function RNA that performs base pairing-dependent regulation of mRNA targets and encodes a small protein, SgrT. Homologs of SgrR were analyzed for gene synteny and inter-homolog identity to identify those that are likely to be functionally analogous. These 22 SgrR homologs were used to manually locate adjacent sRNAs functionally analogous to SgrS. SgrS homologs shared little sequence identity with <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrS, but most shared several structural features. The most conserved feature of SgrS homologs was the base pairing region while the most variable feature was the <italic>sgrT</italic>-coding sequence. Analyses of predicted interactions between SgrS:<italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA pairs in different organisms revealed interesting differences in the patterns of base pairing interactions. RNA pairs with more interrupted regions of complementarity had a higher proportion of G:C base pairs than those with longer contiguous stretches of complementarity. The identification of this set of homologous sRNAs and their targets sets the stage for future studies to further elucidate the molecular requirements for regulation by SgrS.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Small RNAs (sRNAs) are ubiquitous and have been identified in the genomes of organisms from all three domains of life. Numerous studies using a variety of global approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>) have identified more than 80 sRNAs in the genome of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K12. The most abundant class of sRNAs is comprised of those that post-transcriptionally regulate expression of target genes by a base pairing-dependent mechanism that requires the RNA chaperone Hfq (referred to as riboregulation). The most extensively studied member of this class is RyhB, which was first identified in <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 and has been shown to regulate numerous genes involved in cellular iron homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>). RyhB homologs have been identified in <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) species on the basis of nucleotide sequence identity with the <italic>E. coli</italic> RyhB. Functionally analogous sRNAs have been identified by other means in more distantly related species such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). These RyhB-like sRNAs are expressed under the same conditions (iron limitation) and regulate the same types of target genes as the RyhB sRNAs in <italic>E. coli</italic> and related organisms yet share little sequence similarity. How widely RyhB and other base pairing-dependent sRNAs occur in the bacterial world remains to be determined, and this is no small task given the divergence of primary sequences of sRNAs and the inherent difficulty of locating sRNAs in genomes of distantly related organisms. Nevertheless, elucidating the conserved structural and functional features of bacterial sRNAs is a crucial step toward understanding how they evolve.</p><p>In this study, the species distribution and conservation of the sRNA SgrS was investigated. SgrS is an Hfq-dependent sRNA that was first identified in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). SgrS expression is induced by a metabolic stress referred to as glucose-phosphate stress, so named because stress is associated with intracellular accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) or its analog &#x003b1;-methyl glucoside-6-phosphate (&#x003b1;MG6P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). SgrS is unique from other characterized Hfq-dependent sRNAs because it has two distinct functions. The first is a base pairing dependent riboregulation function that results in translational repression and degradation of mRNAs that encode glucose transporters of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The second is an mRNA function whereby SgrS encodes the 43-amino-acid polypeptide SgrT. SgrT inhibits glucose transport by a mechanism independent of the riboregulation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Together, these two functions serve to prevent further uptake of G6P or &#x003b1;MG6P and thus promote recovery from glucose-phosphate stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>The goals of the present study were 2-fold: (i) to define the distribution of SgrS and SgrT homologs and (ii) to analyze the conservation of determinants known from other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) to be important for function. The genetic linkage of <italic>sgrS</italic> to <italic>sgrR</italic>, the gene encoding its regulator, greatly facilitated identification of SgrS homologs. Since sRNAs are typically not conserved at the primary nucleotide sequence level except between very closely related organisms, most homologs are not identifiable by BlastN searches. However, we were able to utilize <italic>sgrR</italic> as a genomic &#x02018;handle&#x02019; to identify SgrS homologs that we would not have found by BlastN searches. This approach was used successfully to identify homologs of the sRNA GcvB, which, like SgrS, is encoded divergently from the gene encoding its transcriptional regulator, GcvA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In another study (C. S. Wadler and C. K. Vanderpool, submitted for publication), the functions of a subset of the SgrS homologs identified here were tested in a heterologous host (<italic>E. coli</italic>) in order to confirm their function and gain insight into the requirements for riboregulation and SgrT in the glucose-phosphate stress response.</p><p>Here we describe the identification of SgrR, SgrS and SgrT homologs in a variety of bacterial species. SgrR homologs are found in bacterial species belonging to a number of different phyla, however, those that we believe are most likely functionally analogous to <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrR are distributed only among the &#x003b3;-Proteobacteria, primarily in enteric species. Likewise, our findings suggest that SgrS and SgrT homologs are mainly confined to enteric bacteria. Predictions for SgrS:target mRNA interactions suggest that the riboregulation function is relatively conserved, while comparison of SgrT homologs revealed that the mRNA function of SgrS is more variably distributed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Identification of SgrR homologs</title><p>The SgrR amino-acid sequence was retrieved from <italic>Echo</italic>BASE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and used as a query in a BlastP search against the non-redundant protein sequence databases at NCBI, UniProt database at EBI and the OMNIOME pep database at CMR. Additional BlastP searches using the same databases were performed using a subset of proteins obtained in the results of the primary search as queries. Results from all searches were curated to remove redundancy, which produced a list of 60 unique SgrR homologs. The Blast searches were completed in November 2008. The amino-acid sequences of the 60 SgrR homologs were aligned using ClustalW (Gonnet protein weight matrix) (The FASTA format amino-acid sequence alignment is available in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp501/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA version 4 with the UPGMA, Neighbor Joining and Minimum Evolution algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).

For analyses of gene synteny, chromosomal sequences were obtained from NCBI Entrez and EBI Genomes for each species containing a SgrR homolog. These GenBank files were analyzed using Artemis (Version 10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) from the Sanger Centre to examine gene context surrounding the <italic>sgrR</italic> homolog and obtain DNA sequences of the region between the nearest conserved upstream and downstream genes, <italic>tbpA</italic> and <italic>leuD</italic>, respectively. Where <italic>tbpA</italic> and/or <italic>leuD</italic> could not be found in close proximity to a <italic>sgrR</italic> homolog, Artemis (or WebACT) and <italic>coli</italic>BASE were used to identify their locations elsewhere on the chromosome.

All open reading frames within the retrieved sequences were compared against the SgrT amino-acid sequence of <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 using Bl2Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In all genomes where a peptide with identity to SgrT was found, Artemis was used to define the start and stop codons for the open reading frame.

To define interactions between this region of SgrS and <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA, a Microsoft Excel Macro (created by R.S.P.H., available upon request) was used to produce an alignment that yielded the maximal complementarity between the base pairing region of SgrS and the 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) of <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA (defined for this purpose as a region from &#x02212;100 through +30 with respect to the start codons).

This search identified a total of 60 potential SgrR homologs. Alignments and phylogenetic analyses allowed us to divide these 60 members into seven clades that contained homologs from more than one genus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp501/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>); an additional clade contained two homologs found only in <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic>. Representative proteins from each of the seven main clades show between 24% and 39% identity to SgrR of <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 (DR_B042 from <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> and STM3860 from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar typhimurium, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Within the clade defined by <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrR (Clade 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A), identity with SgrR of <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 ranges from 57% to 98% (plu3677 from <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic> and SSON_0075 from <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic>, respectively). Clade 2 members are homologous to an <italic>E. coli</italic> protein of unknown function, YbaE, and can be found in a variety of other enteric species. Proteins belonging to Clade 3 are more closely related to those of Clade 1 (SgrR) than those in other clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp501/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>); these proteins, found in <italic>Salmonella</italic> species, <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum, Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> and <italic>Aeromonas</italic> species, may have originated from the duplication of an ancestral <italic>sgrR</italic>-like gene. Homologs belonging to Clades 4, 5 and 6 are narrowly distributed among gram negative enteric bacteria and Clade 7 encompasses proteins from gram positive organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).</p><p>The helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif weight and frequency tables of Dodd and Egan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) revealed that homologs from Clades 5 and 7 were not predicted to contain a functional HTH motif characteristic of DNA-binding proteins (indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Thus, these proteins may not be transcription factors like <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrR. Alternatively, they may be <italic>bona fide</italic> DNA-binding proteins that are too divergent from the proteins in the training set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) to be accurately analyzed. Of the SgrR homologs that contain a conserved HTH motif, several are located on the opposite DNA strand divergent from genes that encode proteins with putative functions related to sugar transport or metabolism. By analogy with the <italic>E. coli sgrR-sgrS</italic> organization and pattern of regulation, we hypothesize that the genes encoded divergently from <italic>sgrR</italic> homologs are targets of transcriptional regulation by these homologs.</p><p>To narrow the list of homologs to those likely to be functionally analogous to <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrR, we focused on members of Clades 1 and 3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp501/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>) and further analyzed gene synteny and identity to SgrR of <italic>E. coli</italic> K12. We also examined genes divergently transcribed from each of these homologs and looked for characteristics of small RNAs. This analysis cut the list of proteins likely to be functional analogs of SgrR to 22. (Hereafter, when referring to &#x02018;SgrR homologs&#x02019;, we mean this subset likely to be functionally analogous to <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 SgrR.) The gene neighborhoods of putative SgrR homologs are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Two genes that flank the <italic>sgrR</italic> region in all but three genomes and have no obvious link to the function of SgrRST are <italic>tbpA</italic>, which encodes the extracytoplasmic solute receptor of the thiamine ABC transporter, and <italic>leuD</italic>, encoding a leucine biosynthesis enzyme. Both of these genes were present near the location of all putative <italic>sgrR</italic> homologs, except those of <italic>Aeromonas</italic> species and <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic>. In <italic>Aeromonas</italic> genomes, the <italic>tbpA</italic> and <italic>leuD</italic> genes are present in close proximity to one another but distant from the <italic>sgrR</italic> homolog. In <italic>P</italic>. <italic>luminescens</italic>, the <italic>leuD</italic> gene is encoded upstream of the <italic>sgrR</italic> homolog, but a genome rearrangement appears to have translocated <italic>tbpA/thiPQ</italic> and <italic>mutH/ygdB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The <italic>sgrR</italic> homologs of these organisms have the lowest levels of identity to <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 SgrR out of the set of 22 homologs. Although there are contradictory indicators for the <italic>sgrR</italic> homologs from <italic>Aeromonas</italic> species and <italic>P. luminescens</italic>, we retained them on the list of putative functional analogs because we found signatures of <italic>sgrS</italic> and/or <italic>sgrT</italic> adjacent to them. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Gene synteny of the region centered on <italic>sgrRST</italic>.

This region corresponds to the sequences of <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 SgrS that constitute the determinants for base pairing with <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA. The consensus sequence for this region is 5&#x02032;- CUGAGUAuUGGUG-3&#x02032; where the central &#x02018;u&#x02019; is the only position that varies among all SgrS homologs except those from <italic>Aeromonas</italic> and <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> species. The 22 SgrS homologs are found exclusively in species of &#x003b3;-Proteobacteria, and with the exception of <italic>Aeromonas</italic> species, all are members of the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>. This distribution is similar to that of several other Hfq-dependent sRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32 B33 B34">32&#x02013;34</xref>), but is narrower than that of the GcvB sRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) which is found in a broader range of &#x003b3;-Proteobacteria. <table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Characteristics of SgrS homologs and base pairing to <italic>ptsG</italic></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkp501i1.jpg"/></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Twenty-two homologs of SgrS were identified; 17 were unique as indicated by the rows in the table that contain more than one strain name.

Although there are few bacterial riboregulators whose structures have been mapped, for those that have, base pairing sequences have often been localized to single-stranded regions. These single-stranded regions are sometimes localized to loop regions of stem-loop (SL) structures and are important for making initial interactions with loop sequences of their targets through formation of so-called &#x02018;kissing complexes&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Loop sequences of sRNAs can also interact with non-loop single-stranded regions of their mRNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Alternatively, single-stranded regions of sRNAs important for interactions with targets may be located adjacent to SL structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Structural rearrangements promoted by the RNA chaperone Hfq may subsequently allow more extensive sRNA&#x02013;mRNA interactions beyond those made by initial contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p><p>Structural predictions for SgrS homologs were made by the RNA folding algorithms MFOLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), which calculates secondary structure based only on thermodynamic properties and RNAalifold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), which predicts a consensus structure based on a set of aligned RNA sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp501/DC1">Supplementary Figure S6A</ext-link>) and uses information from covariation to compute the secondary structure and energy score. The predictions of the two folding programs were highly similar, and revealed several conserved structural features that are shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B (Mfold outputs are shown). The most conserved structural feature is the terminator SL at the 3&#x02032; end. Most of the homologs are predicted to have an additional SL preceding the terminator. The base pairing sequences of most homologs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) are localized to a single-stranded region adjacent to this hairpin; in a number of cases some of the predicted base pairing residues extend into one side of the stem of this hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). Only in the case of the <italic>Enterobacter</italic> SgrS homolog is the base pairing region predicted to be fully contained within a hairpin structure. Several SgrS homologs, including those of <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 and <italic>Shigella</italic> and <italic>Citrobacter</italic> species, have an additional small hairpin at the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>sgrT</italic>-coding sequence; the significance of this structure, if any, is not known. The 5&#x02032; region of SgrS encompassing the <italic>sgrT</italic> coding sequence is represented as an unstructured dashed line because it is expected that translation of <italic>sgrT</italic> would result in unfolding of the mRNA region of SgrS. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mfold prediction for secondary structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 SgrS.

This additional length for SgrS homologs is due to the presence of the <italic>sgrT</italic> coding sequence (CDS) (ranging from 120 to 171 bases) at the 5&#x02032; end of most homologs. Homologs from <italic>Yersinia</italic> species, <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> deviate from this size range for reasons that will be discussed below. SgrT homologs range in size from 40 to 57 amino acids.

Below and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> we have summarized the characteristics of individual homologs that may have relevance for their physiological functions. We begin the descriptions with <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrS and proceed to homologs from organisms that are increasingly more distantly related to <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>Among complete and partially sequenced <italic>Escherichia</italic> genomes, we identified approximately 20 SgrS homologs. These homologs range in identity with <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 SgrS from 99% for <italic>E. coli</italic> strains 55989, SE11, ATCC8739, E24377A and HS to 81% for <italic>Escherichia fergusonii</italic>. Further analyses concentrated on SgrS homologs from three <italic>E. coli</italic> species whose genomes are fully sequenced and annotated, namely MG1655 (K12), CFT073 and 0157:H7 Sakai. These three <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrS homologs are highly similar with 88% identity between K12 SgrS and the SgrS homolog of either pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. The identity between the homologs of the two pathogenic strains is 99%, and this is explained by two single nucleotide changes in the <italic>sgrS</italic> sequence of <italic>E. coli</italic> 0157:H7 Sakai, one of which results in mutation of the <italic>sgrT</italic> start codon. Strikingly, this point mutation is present in both 0157:H7 strains whose genomes are fully sequenced as well as numerous 0157:H7 strains with partially sequenced genomes, suggesting that the SgrS made by these strains does not encode a functional SgrT. <italic>Shigella</italic> SgrS homologs also show a high degree of identity to <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrS and <italic>Shigella</italic> SgrT sequences are 100% identical to <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 SgrT. The <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 SgrS has one feature present in only 3 out of 15 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains (K12, 53638 and 101.1) and not present in any other <italic>Escherichia</italic> or <italic>Shigella</italic> species: this is the presence of a small SL structure immediately before the <italic>sgrT</italic> CDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B). This SL sequesters the ribosome-binding sequence and was shown in another study to inhibit <italic>sgrT</italic> translation (C. S. Wadler and C. K. Vanderpool, submitted for publication).</p><p><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar typhimurium LT2 and <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovar choleraesuis (referred to hereafter as <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enterica</italic>, respectively) contain identical SgrS and SgrT homologs. The <italic>Salmonella</italic> SgrT homolog is slightly shorter (40 aa) than <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrT (43 aa). The predicted secondary structure, shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, shows that the <italic>Salmonella</italic> homologs lack the SL structure that occurs directly upstream of <italic>sgrT</italic> in the <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 SgrS homolog. This suggests that the ribosome-binding site of <italic>Salmonella</italic> SgrS would not be occluded, a prediction supported by experimental data showing higher levels of SgrT production from <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> SgrS compared with <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrS (C. S. Wadler and C. K. Vanderpool, submitted for publication). The SL terminator for <italic>Salmonella</italic> SgrS is positioned 22-nt downstream of the base pairing region, rather than the 10 nt that is more common among the homologs; the significance of this is unknown. The additional nucleotides are predicted to participate in formation of the SL preceeding the terminator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B).</p><p>The <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> SgrS homolog contains a longer SgrT (50 aa) than <italic>E. coli</italic>; the well-conserved base pairing region is located in the usual position 3&#x02032; of the <italic>sgrT</italic> CDS. However, the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> homolog does not contain a terminator SL in the typical position. Termination at the nearest predicted factor-independent terminator downstream would result in an sRNA of 410 nt. When the <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> homolog is expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, an RNA of &#x0223c;400 nt is produced (C. S. Wadler and C. K. Vanderpool, submitted for publication), consistent with the idea that transcription of this <italic>sgrS</italic> homolog terminates at the distal structure, which is 174-nt downstream of the base pairing region. There are no additional ORFs that would encode peptides longer than 15 aa located within this sequence, and the physiological role of this additional sequence is unknown.</p><p>The <italic>Enterobacter</italic> SgrS homolog also encodes a longer SgrT peptide (50 aa) compared with <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrT, but otherwise contains the same functional elements as <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrS. The base pairing region is positioned at the usual location 3&#x02032; of <italic>sgrT</italic>, however, one predicted structural difference is the localization of base pairing elements to an SL structure. This differs from most homologs where the base pairing nucleotides are mostly unpaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). In some cases, Hfq binding to sRNAs has been shown to remodel their secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Perhaps the <italic>Enterobacter</italic> SgrS undergoes more extensive Hfq-induced conformational changes than other homologs in order to interact with its cognate <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA.</p><p>The two homologs from the <italic>Citrobacter</italic> genus both encode a 40 aa SgrT and have similar base pairing sequences complementary to their cognate <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The position of the terminator relative to the base pairing region differs between these two homologs: the <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> SgrS has a 19-nt spacer between these elements in contrast to the 6-nt spacer in <italic>Citrobacter koseri</italic> SgrS.</p><p>The SgrS homolog found in <italic>Erwinia carotovora</italic> encodes the second longest SgrT homolog at 54 aa. Structural analyses indicate a short SL structure upstream of the <italic>sgrT</italic> CDS similar to the one identified in <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 SgrS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). However, unlike the GC-rich stem in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the putative stem in <italic>E. carotovora</italic> contains two A:U base pairs that should weaken the interaction. <italic>In vivo</italic> complementation studies of an <italic>E. coli sgrST</italic> mutant with the <italic>E. carotovora sgrST</italic> strongly suggest that <italic>E. carotovora</italic>'<italic>s sgrT</italic> is well-translated and functional (C. S. Wadler and C. K. Vanderpool, submitted for publication). These data argue against any significant translational inhibition mediated by this structure. The base pairing region and terminator of the <italic>E. carotovora sgrS</italic> are located at the typical 3&#x02032; position.</p><p>SgrS homologs found in <italic>Yersinia</italic> species range in size from 84 to 139 nt owing to the lack of an <italic>sgrT</italic>. For <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic>, this appears to be caused by a 5&#x02032; truncation of <italic>sgrS</italic> resulting from insertion of two genes, <italic>ybiY</italic> and <italic>ybiW</italic>, in the <italic>sgrR-sgrS</italic> intergenic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The <italic>ybiYW</italic> genes are uncharacterized, but they are predicted to encode a pyruvate formate lyase and its activating enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Notably, the <italic>Y. enterocolitica sgrS</italic> homolog is the only one that is not divergently transcribed from <italic>sgrR</italic>. Whether <italic>ybiYW</italic> expression is controlled by SgrR is not known, though the conservation of regulatory sequences adjacent to <italic>sgrR</italic> and upstream of <italic>ybiY</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp501/DC1">Supplementary Figure S5A</ext-link>) suggests that this might be the case. Examination of the region immediately upstream of the <italic>Y. enterocolitica sgrS</italic> homolog (downstream of <italic>ybiW</italic>) did not reveal any additional putative SgrR regulatory sequences, suggesting that if <italic>Y. enterocolitica sgrS</italic> is expressed, it may be operonic with <italic>ybiYW</italic>. For <italic>Y. pestis</italic> and <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> the cause of the 5&#x02032; <italic>sgrS</italic> truncation is not obvious; there are no apparent insertion sequences or other signatures of mobile elements in this region. However, it has been reported that <italic>Yersinia</italic> genomes are extremely plastic and extensive rearrangements are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Despite extensive differences at their 5&#x02032; ends, the base pairing and terminator elements of <italic>Yersinia sgrS</italic> homologs are conserved and located at typical distances from one another. Another interesting characteristic of <italic>Yersinia</italic> SgrS homologs is their extensive pattern of predicted complementarity with their cognate <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNAs. The predicted interactions for <italic>Y. pestis</italic> and <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> SgrS: <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA pairs represent the longest contiguous stretches of complementarity for any homologous pair. In another study, it was shown that the <italic>Y. pestis sgrS</italic> homolog can complement an <italic>E. coli sgrST</italic> mutant, indicating that this truncated SgrS is still a fully functional riboregulator (C. S. Wadler and C. K. Vanderpool, submitted for publication).</p><p>The <italic>Serratia proteamaculans</italic> and <italic>S. marcescens</italic> SgrS homologs encode the longest SgrT proteins at 57 aa. While the sRNA is slightly longer to compensate for the longer CDS, the base pairing region and terminator occur at typical positions relative to one another. The predicted base pairing interactions with the cognate <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA are striking, as they are comprised of a single long stretch of complementarity similar to that predicted for <italic>Yersinia</italic> species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The SgrS homologs of <italic>Aeromonas</italic> species and <italic>P. luminescens</italic> are the most divergent from <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrS. The <italic>sgrT</italic> CDS is not present in the <italic>P. luminescens</italic> SgrS while the SgrT encoded by <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> and <italic>A. salmonicida</italic> shows very low identity with <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp501/DC1">Supplementary Figure S4</ext-link>). The genome of <italic>P. luminescens</italic> does not contain a <italic>ptsG</italic> homolog; however, it does contain genes encoding another PTS capable of transporting glucose, <italic>manXYZ</italic>. Results from our laboratory have shown that <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrS also regulates <italic>manXYZ</italic> mRNA (J. B. Rice and C. K. Vanderpool, unpublished results), so perhaps this regulation is conserved in <italic>P. luminescens</italic>. However, due to the poor similarity between <italic>P. luminescens</italic> and <italic>Aeromonas</italic> SgrS and <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrS, we cannot claim with certainty that these homologs are functionally analogous to <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrS.</p></sec><sec><title>Base pairing of SgrS homologs to mRNA targets</title><p>One of the great challenges in bacterial small RNA research has been to define rules that govern RNA:RNA interactions that result in positive or negative regulation of mRNA targets. Since we have identified a set of homologous sRNAs, we analyzed interactions between these sRNAs and their cognate targets in order to gain some insight into the requirements for regulation by SgrS. In order to conduct these analyses, we first identified <italic>ptsG</italic> homologs in the genomes where we had already identified SgrR, SgrS and SgrT homologs. For each of these genomes, with the sole exception of <italic>P. luminescens</italic>, a <italic>ptsG</italic> homolog with strong identity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp501/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>) and gene synteny to <italic>E. coli ptsG</italic> was identified.</p><p>We previously predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) that for <italic>E. coli</italic>, the SgrS:<italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA base pairing interactions occurred through short, interrupted segments of complementarity that we will refer to as a 5-8-4 pattern (referencing the number of contiguous base pairs in each segment). The 5-8-4 pattern of complementarity sequesters most of the ribosome-binding site (RBS) of <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA resulting in translation inhibition of <italic>ptsG</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). The base pairing predictions were supported by genetic evidence obtained by another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). These results suggested that the central eight contiguous base pair segment was particularly important for regulation. However, one caveat to these experiments is that they only measured the effect on steady state levels of <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA at 20 min after SgrS expression was induced. Thus, subtle contributions of the flanking regions of complementarity to the initial kinetics of regulation would not have been elucidated. At this time there have been no structural probing experiments to validate or refute the base pairing predictions.</p><p>The relative position of interacting sequences is conserved among all homologous pairs, i.e. 3&#x02032; of the <italic>sgrT</italic> CDS for SgrS and at least partially encompassing the RBS of <italic>ptsG</italic>. This strongly suggests that the regulatory outcome of translation inhibition and destabilization of <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA is also conserved. The 5-8-4 pattern is conserved for SgrS:<italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA partners in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> species, and is very similar (4-9-4) for <italic>Salmonella</italic> species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, the more divergent SgrS:<italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA pairs are predicted to have more extensive interactions. The <italic>Erwinia</italic>, <italic>Yersinia</italic> and <italic>Serratia</italic> homologs have a longer contiguous segment of complementarity that encompasses between 15 and 21 base pairs. For the most divergent SgrS homologs in <italic>Aeromonas</italic> species, the predicted interactions are somewhat shorter and more interrupted, but are still predicted to occlude the RBS.</p><p>There is currently little data to shed light on how the base composition of the base pairing region affects regulation by small RNAs. The mutations with the strongest negative effects on regulation by SgrS alter G:C base pairs in the central 8-bp region of SgrS:<italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA interactions in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). As G:C base pairs form three hydrogen bonds versus the two hydrogen bonds contributed by A:U or G:U pairs, it would not be surprising if G:C base pairs make the most substantial contribution to the riboregulation. The <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Shigella</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> interaction regions are all composed of &#x0223c;50% G:C base pairs. Interestingly, for homologous pairs with more extensive complementarity, e.g. <italic>Erwinia, Yersinia</italic> and <italic>Serratia</italic>, G:C base pairs comprise only &#x0223c;35% of the interactions. Perhaps a more A:U/G:U-rich base pairing region requires a greater number of consecutive base pairs to achieve a rapid interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>To provide another qualitative way to compare these predicted sRNA:mRNA complexes, we utilized the DINAMelt server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) to predict melting profiles for the short segments of SgrS and <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The &#x00394;G values reported for each pair (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) are meant only as a means to compare the relative stabilities of these short regions of complementarity for each homologous sRNA:mRNA pair. The &#x00394;G values ranged from &#x02212;16 to &#x02212;28, with the majority falling between &#x02212;22 and &#x02212;26. The native <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 SgrS:<italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA pair had a &#x00394;G value of &#x02212;24.2. A single point mutation in SgrS that alters one G:C base pair in the central segment of complementarity reduced the &#x00394;G value to &#x02212;19; an additional mutation in <italic>sgrS</italic> that alters a second G:C base pair in this region further reduces the &#x00394;G value to &#x02212;10. We have shown that the <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrS single point mutant has a partial defect in regulating <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA while the double point mutant is strongly defective for <italic>ptsG</italic> regulation [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and C.

Given this information, it is interesting to note that <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>C. rodentium</italic> SgrS:<italic>ptsG</italic> mRNA pairs have a &#x00394;G value of &#x02212;20 while the <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> &#x00394;G value is only &#x02212;16, suggesting that SgrS may not regulate <italic>ptsG</italic> in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>. It will be interesting in the future to examine regulation by these SgrS homologs and determine how efficiently they regulate their cognate <italic>ptsG</italic> mRNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>We identified homologs of the transcription factor SgrR and the sRNA SgrS in a variety of enteric bacterial species. Most homologs appear to possess both of the functions that we have previously described for <italic>E. coli</italic> SgrS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>): the riboregulation function and ability to produce the SgrT protein. The bioinformatic analyses described in this study suggest that the riboregulatory function of SgrS is the more conserved of the two functions of SgrS, since in a few homologs the <italic>sgrT</italic> is missing or rendered non-functional by mutation of the start codon. Homologs of SgrR, SgrS and SgrT are more narrowly distributed than PtsG homologs, which are found in a much wider range of organisms. Not surprisingly, conserved sequences in the 5&#x02032; UTR of <italic>ptsG</italic> are found only in the same genomes where a SgrS homolog is found (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp501/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link> and data not shown). These observations suggest that either glucose-phosphate stress is not a problem for all organisms that use PtsG homologs to take up glucose, or that other mechanisms have evolved to deal with the stress.</p><p>To further test the roles of riboregulation and SgrT in the glucose-phosphate stress response, several of the homologs identified in this study were expressed in a heterologous (<italic>E. coli</italic>) <italic>sgrST</italic> mutant host. The experimental results of that study (C. S. Wadler and C. K. Vanderpool, submitted for publication) support the hypotheses generated by the identification and comparison of these homologs. Together, these studies reveal that despite low levels of nucleotide sequence similarity, SgrS and SgrT homologs are functionally interchangeable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp501/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="gkp501_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain" xlink:href="gkp501_nar-00729-r-2009-File007.fas"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain" xlink:href="gkp501_nar-00729-r-2009-File008.PNG"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain" xlink:href="gkp501_nar-00729-r-2009-File009.fas"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain" xlink:href="gkp501_nar-00729-r-2009-File010.fas"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkp501_nar-00729-r-2009-File011.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain" xlink:href="gkp501_nar-00729-r-2009-File012.fas"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkp501_nar-00729-r-2009-File013.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain" xlink:href="gkp501_nar-00729-r-2009-File014.fas"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="gkp501_nar-00729-r-2009-File015.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; American Heart Association [Scientist Development Grant 0835355N].
