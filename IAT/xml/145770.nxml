Positive transcription control elements associated with two DNase I hypersensitive regions in the large first intron of the gene have been identified which confer a differentiation response on the laminin gamma 1 promoter. However, the kinetics of transcriptional activation suggest each DNA region interacts with transcription factors appearing at different times during differentiation. Synergy between the two regions in cis causes high level activation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
