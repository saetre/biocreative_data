More than 90&#x00025; of the methylated cytosines in the human genome occur in retrotransposons, a few percent in&#x000a0;satellite sequences, and only a minority in exons and regulatory sequences. LINE-1 (L1) elements, the major class of non-LTR retrotransposons, are interspersed repeated elements at 516&#x000a0;000 copies per human genome (accounting for 16.9&#x00025; of its mass), containing an internal promoter and two long open reading frames. The overwhelming majority of L1s are retrotransposition defective, because they are 5&#x02032; truncated, internally rearranged, or mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c1">1</xref>). Only a subset of &#x0223c;60 full-length L1s remained retrotransposition competent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c3">3</xref>). Evidence for this subset is documented by 14 known cases of human diseases that arose from new L1 transpositions. Retrotransposition involves intermediate formation of full-length transcripts, reverse transcription and insertion into new genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c4">4</xref>). The promoter, located at the 5&#x02032; end of the element, is unusual in that it contains a CpG island that is very heavily methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c5">5</xref>). Methylation includes symmetric and asymmetric methylation at CpG dinucleotides as well as methylation at non-CpG sites. Alu repeats, the major class of SINEs in the human genome, are also barely transcribed despite the transcriptional potential of 1.09 million templates accounting for 10.6&#x00025; of the mass of the genome. Alu elements are &#x0223c;300 bp in length, have internal RNA polymerase III promoter elements, and transcription produces a non-coding, poly(A) tail-ended RNA. Alu mobilization likely occurs through L1-encoded proteins, because Alu elements are flanked by target site duplications that bear close resemblance to the target site duplications of L1 elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c6">6</xref>). It is believed that hypermethylation of L1 as well as Alu repeats is a major defense mechanism to repress these genetic elements that could be otherwise very damaging if actively transcribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c7">7</xref>).</p><p> Repression by DNA methylation is thought to be established through binding of members of the MBD (methyl-CpG-binding domain) protein family, recruitment of histone deacetylases and generation of a transcriptionally inactive chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c9">9</xref>). The founder member of this family is MeCP2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2), which is characterized by a typical modular organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c11">11</xref>). Methyl-DNA binding resides in an 85-amino acid domain that folds into a &#x003b2;-sheet&#x02013;&#x003b1;-helix&#x02013;hairpin loop sandwich structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c12">12</xref>). The transcriptional-repressor domain (TRD) of MeCP2 residing between amino acids 207 and 310 mediates repression through binding to mSin3A within the mSin3A-HDAC1 and 2 co-repressor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c15">15</xref>). Further results show that MeCP2 can also repress transcription through a histone deacetylase-independent mechanism, in part through direct and indirect interactions with the general transcription factor TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c17">17</xref>). In mouse chromosomes, MeCP2 localizes with great abundance to the highly methylated major satellite DNA in the centromeric region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c10">10</xref>). In human interphase nuclei, EGFP&#x02013;MeCP2 fusion protein experiments suggested that MeCP2 is uniformly spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c18">18</xref>).</p><p> MBD1, the largest member of the MBD family, is expressed either as a 605-amino acid full-length isoform (MBD1v1) or as one of several shorter isoforms, resulting from alternative splicing events (PCM1, MBD1v2, MBD1v3 and MBD1v4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c19">19</xref>). They share an MBD at the N-terminus and a TRD, consisting of a short hydrophobic sequence, close to the C-terminus, but differ in the number of centrally located CxxC motifs and&#x0002f;or absence of short connecting regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c20">20</xref>). The physiological relevance of these variants is unknown. MBD1 has been localized in human chromosomes to the heavily methylated classical satellites 2 and 3 found in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of chromosomes 1, 9, 15 and 16, as well as to euchromatic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c20">20</xref>). The third MBD family member, which can act as a transcriptional repressor (MBD2) is an integral component of an oligomeric complex (MeCP1), which additionally contains mSin3A, HDAC1 and 2, and RbAp46 and 48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c21">21</xref>). In full-length MBD2 (also named MBD2a), the MBD occupies a central position of the protein and overlaps with the TRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c22">22</xref>). A shorter isoform, named MBD2b, starts at the second methionine, thus lacking the sequence N-terminal of the MBD.</p><p> Here we explore the possible capability of MeCP2 to silence L1 and Alu transcription and, furthermore, L1 retrotransposition. To this end, we used two assays. First, using transient transfection assays, we found that the TRD of MeCP2 represses transcription from L1 promoter-driven luciferase constructs and that full-length MeCP2 represses transcription from a methylated version of the construct. Secondly, in a genetic assay employing a full-length <italic>neo</italic>-marked L1 reporter construct, the TRD of MeCP2 effectively reduced L1 retrotransposition. Furthermore, the methylation-induced repression of L1 retrotransposition was increased by full-length MeCP2. In sharp contrast, neither the TRD of MeCP2 nor the full-length protein exhibited any repressive effect on Alu transcription. Our results suggest that MeCP2 is involved in the defense response to the potentially damaging action of L1 elements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>To construct reporter plasmids L1.3-Luc and L1<sub>RP</sub>-Luc the promoter region of L1.3 (nucleotides 1&#x02013;909) and L1<sub>RP</sub> (nucleotides 1&#x02013;905), respectively, (gifts of J.

The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5&#x00025; non-fat milk and incubated with anti-Gal4BD monoclonal antibody (Clontech) or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) in TBS. After two washes in TBS, the membrane was incubated with anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After the membrane had been washed six times with TBS&#x0002f;0.5&#x00025; Tween-20, once with TBS&#x0002f;3&#x00025; Tween-20 and twice with TBS, visualization was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>To monitor the effects of MeCP2 on L1 transcription we used transient co-transfection experiments in HEK293 cells employing a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the internal L1.3 promoter (nucleotides 1&#x02013;909) and an effector plasmid (Gal4-TRD<sub>MeCP2</sub>) encoding a fusion protein that links the transcriptional-repression domain of human MeCP2 (amino acids 196&#x02013;486) to the heterologous Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c16">16</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f1">1</xref>A). Immunoblot analysis using an anti-Gal4BD monoclonal antibody documented efficient expression of the fusion protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f1">1</xref>B). Transcription from the L1.3 promoter was about 1.5-fold more effective than from the SV40 minimal promoter (data not shown). In control experiments, neither insertion of five copies of the Gal4 DNA-binding sequence (G5) upstream of the L1.3 promoter nor co-transfection of the effector plasmid Gal4-TRD<sub>MeCP2</sub> appreciably affected expression of the L1.3-Luc reporter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f1">1</xref>A and C). However, co-transfection of Gal4-TRD<sub>MeCP2</sub> and the G5L1.3-luciferase reporter targeted the TRD of MeCP2 to the L1.3 promoter and repressed expression by 63&#x02013;72&#x00025;, depending on the dose of effector plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f1">1</xref>C). Identical results were obtained in HeLa cells (data not shown). A 24 h treatment with trichostatin A (TSA), a specific inhibitor of all known histone deacetylases, generally decreased the metabolic activity of the transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f1">1</xref>D). Comparison of the expression levels of both reporters in the absence (L1.3:G5L1.3 &#x0003d; 1:0.33) and presence (L1.3:G5L1.3 &#x0003d; 1:0.41) of TSA indicated that TSA only slightly relieved TRD<sub>MeCP2</sub> mediated transcriptional repression, suggesting a minor contribution of histone deacetylases to the repression. We also tested the promoter region of another retrotransposition-competent L1 element, L1<sub>RP</sub>, which was isolated from a patient suffering from X-linked retinitis pigmentosa 2 and is thought to have undergone retrotransposition very recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c28">28</xref>). The L1<sub>RP</sub> promoter (nucleotides 1&#x02013;905) turned out to be 2.1-fold more active than the SV40 minimal promoter (data not shown) and was repressed by the Gal4-linked TRD of MeCP2 by 69&#x00025;, i.e. as efficiently as the L1.3 promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f1">1</xref>C). Identical results were obtained in HEK293 and HeLa cells.</p><p> MeCP2 shares with MBD family members MBD1 and MBD2 the ability to repress transcription, though their TRDs bear no obvious similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c22">22</xref>). We therefore analyzed whether the TRDs of MBD1 and MBD2 would also affect L1 expression. A fusion protein that tethers the Gal4 DNA-binding domain to the TRD of human MBD1 (amino acids 383&#x02013;605 of isoform v1; Gal4-TRD<sub>MBD1</sub>) repressed transcription of the L1.3 promoter by 70&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f1">1</xref>A and E). In contrast, a Gal4 fusion protein containing the TRD of MBD2 (amino acids 45&#x02013;262 of isoform b; Gal4-TRD<sub>MBD2</sub>) failed to repress transcription of the L1.3 promoter appreciably (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f1">1</xref>A and E). These data strongly suggest that the TRDs of MeCP2 and MBD1, but not that of MBD2, can specifically inhibit L1 promoter activity.</p><p> Several lines of evidence indicate that the heavy methylation density of L1 elements plays a key role in their silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c29">29</xref>). Therefore we analyzed the effects of co-expressed full-length FLAG-tagged MeCP2 on transcription of the L1.3 reporter construct in response to its methylation by<italic> Hpa</italic>II methylase in transient transfection assays. We chose this enzyme, which methylates the L1.3 promoter at four nucleotide positions (36, 101, 304 and 481) for two reasons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f2">2</xref>A). First, MeCP2 can bind to a single symmetrically methylated CpG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c30">30</xref>) and, secondly, methylation at nucleotide positions 36 and 304 has been shown previously to correlate inversely with L1 expression in cultured cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c29">29</xref>). Methylation of the L1.3 reporter in the absence of ectopic MeCP2 led to a weak decrease in transcription, probably due to binding of abundant endogenous MeCP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f2">2</xref>B). Furthermore, overexpression of FLAG-tagged MeCP2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f2">2</xref>C) slightly reduced transcription from the unmethylated L1.3 promoter, possibly due to a weak affinity of MeCP2 to the unmethylated template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c11">11</xref>). However, the transcription rate of the methylated promoter was strongly reduced by overexpressed MeCP2. We infer that MeCP2 can bind to methylated L1 <italic>in vivo</italic> and controls its transcription.</p><p> Like MeCP2, MBD1 and MBD2 can bind to a fragment with widely separated methylated CpGs and even to a single methylated CpG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c8">8</xref>). To study their effects on transcription from a <italic>Hpa</italic>II-methylated L1.3 promoter, we selected the MBD1 splice variant v3 (MBD1v3) and the short initiation isoform MBD2b. MBD1v3 lacks the third CxxC motif and, thereby, the complicating ability to bind to unmethylated promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c19">19</xref>). Neither expression of FLAG-tagged MBD1v3 nor that of FLAG-tagged MBD2b significantly inhibited transcription from the unmethylated L1.3 promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f2">2</xref>B). Furthermore methylation with <italic>Hpa</italic>II did not affect a significant change in the expression of the reporter. Immunoblot analysis in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f2">2</xref>C shows that, in comparison to the expression of FLAG-MeCP2, FLAG-MBD1v3 as well as FLAG-MBD2b are expressed in larger molar amounts. Thus, insufficient amounts of protein cannot be used as an explanation for the lack of repression. Summarizing, full-length MBD1v3 failed to decrease L1 expression in response to <italic>Hpa</italic>II methylation, although its TRD is able to repress L1 transcription when targeted to the L1 promoter (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f1">1</xref>E). MBD2b, which has the ability to bind to a single methylated CpG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c8">8</xref>), did not repress L1 transcription either in the targeting experiment (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f1">1</xref>E) or in response to reporter methylation. We conclude that solely full-length MeCP2 can repress transcription from an <italic>Hpa</italic>II-methylated L1 promoter.</p><p> We next investigated the effects of MeCP2 on L1 retrotransposition, employing a recently developed genetic assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c26">26</xref>). The assay is based on an L1.2 reporter containing an antisense copy of the <italic>neo </italic>indicator gene disrupted by intron 2 of the &#x003b3;-globin gene in sense orientation. Splicing and reverse transcription of RNAs from the marked L1.2 reporter allows expression of the <italic>neo</italic> gene and results in G418 resistance after integration of the cDNA into chromosomal DNA. Using reporter constructs JM101&#x0002f;L1.2&#x00394;CMV and G5JM101&#x0002f;L1.2&#x00394;CMV we measured average retrotransposition frequencies of 357 and 303 in 10<sup>6</sup> transfected cells, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f3">3</xref>A; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke575tb1">1</xref>A). This is consistent with the previously reported transposition efficiency of L1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c26">26</xref>). Retrotransposition was previously demonstrated to start 48 h post-transfection and to proceed at a continuous high rate for at least 16 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c31">31</xref>). To verify the presence of Gal4-TRD<sub>MeCP2</sub> while transcription and retrotransposition of the marked L1 was taking place, we first demonstrated its efficient expression 72 h after co-transfection with the L1 reporter, i.e. 1 day after the onset of transposition, by immunoblot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f3">3</xref>C). While retrotransposition of JM101&#x0002f;L1.2&#x00394;CMV was not affected by Gal4-TRD<sub>MeCP2</sub>, targeting of the repressor to the reporter through insertion of Gal4 DNA-binding sites drastically reduced retrotransposition by 82&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f3">3</xref>B). Since G418-resistant foci only arise if the reporter is transcribed and the RNA is spliced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c26">26</xref>), we infer that downregulation of retrotransposition by the TRD of MeCP2 operates through its demonstrated ability to repress transcription (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f1">1</xref>C).</p><p> Next we tested the effects of methylation and co-expression of full-length MeCP2 on L1 retrotransposition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f4">4</xref>A; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke575tb1">1</xref>B). <italic>Hpa</italic>II methylation of reporter JM101&#x0002f;L1.2&#x00394;CMV significantly reduced its ability to retrotranspose (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f4">4</xref>B). This is likely due to binding of methyl-CpG-binding proteins including endogenous MeCP2. Due to conflicting reports on the presence of MeCP2 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c32">32</xref>), we performed a comparative immunoblot analysis on several human and murine cell lines by use of an anti-MeCP2 antibody (Upstate) showing that HeLa cells contain as much MeCP2 as, for example, NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). Overexpression of FLAG-tagged MeCP2, as controlled by immunoblot analysis 72 h post-transfection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f4">4</xref>C), affected a further, although weak, reduction of the retrotransposition frequency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f4">4</xref>B). Methylation-induced repression in the presence and absence of&#x000a0;over-expressed MeCP2 did not differ significantly. Summarizing our results from the luciferase activity assays and the retrotransposition assays, our data support the conclusion that MeCP2 can repress L1 retrotransposition.</p><p> Since Alu elements are likely mobilized by the <italic>trans</italic> action of L1 proteins and share with L1 repeats a heavy methylation density, we also explored whether MeCP2 would affect Alu expression. To this aim, we employed a reporter plasmid, <sup>7SL</sup>AluSx<sup>TMBC1</sup>, whose expression is greatly enhanced by a 7SL-upstream activating sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f5">5</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c25">25</xref>). The reporter contains a diagnostic unique 20 bp sequence derived from the BC1 gene to enable northern dot blot analysis of its activity. When targeted to the reporter by Gal4 DNA-binding sites the Gal4-linked TRD of MeCP2 affected some increase in the transcriptional activity of the reporter, while the TRDs of MBD1 and MBD2 had no statistically significant effect on its expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f5">5</xref>B). Methylation of the <sup>7SL</sup>AluSx<sup>TMBC1</sup> reporter by <italic>Hpa</italic>II methyltransferase did not affect its expression (data not shown), yet complete methylation using <italic>Sss</italic>I methyltransferase drastically reduced its expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f5">5</xref>C). Surprisingly, co-expression of full-length MeCP2 fully abrogated this repressive effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke575f5">5</xref>C). Thus, in contrast to the repressive action of MeCP2 on L1 transcription, it influences Alu transcription positively. The molecular basis of this positive effect is unclear and various possibilities of direct and indirect interactions of MeCP2 with regulatory components of Alu transcription have to be considered (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Two lines of evidence indicate that MeCP2 efficiently represses L1 transcription. First, targeting the Gal4-linked TRD of MeCP2 to Gal4 DNA-binding sequences inserted upstream of L1 luciferase reporter constructs downregulated expression from two active L1 promoters, L1.3 and L1<sub>RP</sub>, by 70&#x00025;. In a second approach, full-length MeCP2 efficiently repressed a <italic>Hpa</italic>II-methylated L1.3 reporter by 77&#x00025;. This is consistent with a previous report indicating an inverse correlation between L1 expression in cultured cell lines and methylation of two <italic>Hpa</italic>II sites at nucleotide positions 36 and 304 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c29">29</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, L1 elements are heavily methylated over the entire CpG-rich promoter, which provides a reasonable explanation why repression of L1 elements in somatic tissues approaches 100&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c5">5</xref>). Cre-mediated deletion of the maintenance methyltransferase gene <italic>Dnmt1</italic> caused demethylation and an increase in the expression of L1 and retroviral elements in cultured murine fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c33">33</xref>). Thus, our results and their combination with reported findings suggest that MeCP2 also mediates repression of endogenous L1 elements. In contrast to two known positive regulatory factors of L1 transcription, the ubiquitous factor YY1 and a neuronally expressed SRY family transcription factor (SOX11), MeCP2 causes repression of L1 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c35">35</xref>). It remains to be elucidated whether MeCP2 interacts with YY1 or SOX11, or competes with these factors for binding to the promoter region. Interestingly, repression of endogenous L1 elements by MeCP2 may be relevant for our understanding of the molecular events leading to Rett syndrome, a neurological disorder that is caused by mutations in the gene encoding MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c36">36</xref>). While the detailed consequences of a non-functional MeCP2 on neuronal gene expression are currently unknown, two mutually non-exclusive hypotheses have been put forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c37">37</xref>). Rett syndrome may be caused by misregulation of genes crucial for neuronal physiology or by an excessive transcriptional &#x02018;noise&#x02019;. Through the recent availability of Mecp2-null mice it is now possible to analyze the effects of missing MeCP2 on endogenous L1 expression and their possible impact on Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c39">39</xref>).</p><p> Furthermore, we used a genetic assay to show that the TRD of MeCP2 strongly represses retrotransposition of a full-length L1 reporter construct by 82&#x00025;. Retrotransposition was also reduced after <italic>in vitro</italic> methylation of the reporter and was further decreased by co-expressed full-length MeCP2. Interestingly, L1 transposition and L1 transcription were repressed to the same degree in the two different assays. This may suggest that L1 transcription is the rate limiting step of retrotransposition. The evolutionary genetics of L1 require its expression and transposition in the germ line. In fact, L1 is expressed at various points of the murine gamete life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c41">41</xref>). The notion that endogenous L1 elements are repressed by MeCP2 would require an expression pattern of MeCP2 inverse to that of L1. In support of this notion, several studies at the mRNA as well as the protein level showed that MeCP2 is widely expressed in mammalian tissues, but a recent RT&#x02013;PCR analysis indicated that MeCP2 mRNA is almost undetectable in murine male germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c42">42</xref>). Thus, MeCP2 is likely to be involved in repression of L1 expression and transposition in most somatic tissues of the mouse, but is not present in male germ cells where retrotransposition is taking place. Besides MeCP2, germ line-specific factors may participate in determining the restricted expression pattern of L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c34">34</xref>). The L1 retrotransposition machinery is thought to be additionally used by Alu elements, since these have no coding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c4">4</xref>). A transcriptional control of L1 expression by MeCP2 therefore postulates a further indirect role of the repressor in the genomic spreading of Alu elements.</p><p> In striking contrast to the repressive effects of MeCP2 on L1 expression, the TRD of MeCP2 failed to decrease transcription of an AluSx reporter, but rather increased its transcription. Furthermore, MeCP2 completely abrogated the methylation-induced decrease in reporter transcription. Relief of repression could occur at several levels. One possible effect could be competition with binding of one or more proteins, which repress Alu transcription. Alternatively, MeCP2 could repress expression of such proteins at the transcriptional level. Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription studies have indicated that methylation of two CpGs in the A box control region of Alu repeats is sufficient to inhibit transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c43">43</xref>). Since this inhibition is relieved by competition with methylated plasmid DNA, it has been concluded that repression is caused by a methyl-CpG-binding protein present in limiting amounts. Based on our transient transfection results, MeCP2, MBD1 and MBD2 are not likely candidates for this protein.</p><p> MeCP2 has been shown previously to repress a number of cellular as well as viral gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c17">17</xref> and references therein). Notably, reports on promoters that are refractory to the repressive effect of MeCP2 were lacking so far, giving MeCP2 the image of a general repressor. We here report on the first example (to our knowledge) of a transcription unit that is <italic>not</italic> repressed by MeCP2. Thus, although Alu elements are likely mobilized by the <italic>trans</italic> action of L1 proteins, the role of MeCP2 in transcriptional regulation of Alu and L1 elements is completely different. Conceivably MeCP2 can only repress genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, possibly through inhibition of factors solely engaged in polymerase II transcription. Interestingly, Alu and L1 repeats also differ in another fundamental chromosomal feature and its impact on gene expression. Compared to bulk chromatin, chromatin encompassing Alus is enriched in histone H4 acetylated at lysines 5, 8, 12 and 16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c44">44</xref>). Contrary to this, chromatin containing L1 repeats is depleted in H4 acetylated at any of the four acetylatable lysines. In the case of L1 elements, the correlation of a presumed involvement of MeCP2 in repression of endogenous L1 elements and the low level of histone H4 acetylation would support the assumption that recruitment of the mSin3A-histone deacetylase co-repressor complex through MeCP2 is partially responsible for the underacetylation of L1 associated chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c15">15</xref>).</p><p> Since Rett syndrome indicates that MeCP2 cannot be (fully) substituted by any other methyl-CpG-binding protein, we searched for potential differences in the L1-repressive effect among other MBD family members. In the Gal4 fusion protein experiment, the TRD of MBD1 repressed transcription from the L1 reporter. Thus, the failure of full-length MBD1v3 to repress an <italic>Hpa</italic>II-methylated L1 reporter may well be explained by an insufficient affinity of MBD1v3 to bind to the few <italic>Hpa</italic>II-methylated sites in the L1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c19">19</xref>). In this context it is relevant to note that methylation at solely <italic>Hpa</italic>II recognition sites does not reflect the<italic> in vivo</italic> situation with many more CpG sequences methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c5">5</xref>). Unfortunately the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation is difficult to imitate, since most CpGs are hemimethylated and, furthermore, a few methylated cytosines are located outside of CpG sequences. In the Gal4 fusion protein experiment the TRD of MBD2 lacked L1-repressing activity. MBD2 is a component of the MeCP1 histone deacetylase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c21">21</xref>). Recent purification of MeCP1 to homogeneity has revealed that the compositions of MeCP1 and the NuRD complex are identical except for the additional presence of MBD2 in MeCP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c45">45</xref>). Both contain nine components, including Mi2 responsible for the chromatin remodeling activity of the complex. This suggests that MBD2 functions by recruiting the NuRD complex to methylated promoters.</p><p> The role of DNA methylation in tissue-specific gene expression during development and in the adult organism has been subject to much debate. A correlation between methylation and gene expression has been observed for several genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c33">33</xref>), but no correlation has been found for other genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c32">32</xref>). This might suggest that methylation is not necessary for transcriptional repression of all genes. Furthermore, it has been postulated that DNA methylation primarily evolved as a defense mechanism against transposable elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke575c7">7</xref>). Although our studies using transient transfections of cultured cells cannot resolve this controversy, they document that recruitment of MeCP2 by methylated L1 sequences has the potential to repress L1 expression in somatic tissues.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke575f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The TRDs of MeCP2 and MBD1 repress L1 transcription.
