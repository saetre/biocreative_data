The input domain of KdpD comprises a domain that belongs to the family of universal stress proteins (Usp). It has been previously demonstrated that UspC binds to this domain, resulting in KdpD/KdpE scaffolding under salt stress.

KdpFABC is a high affinity K<sup>+ </sup>uptake system that serves as an emergency system to scavenge K<sup>+ </sup>when other transporters cannot sustain the cellular requirement for K<sup>+</sup>. The corresponding <italic>kdpFABC </italic>operon is under control of the two-component system KdpD/KdpE, which induces <italic>kdpFABC </italic>expression under K<sup>+ </sup>limiting conditions or under osmotic stress imposed by a salt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Upon stimulus perception, KdpD undergoes autophosphorylation and subsequently, the phosphoryl group is transferred to the cytoplasmic response regulator KdpE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Phosphorylated KdpE exhibits increased affinity for a 23-base pair sequence upstream of the canonical -35 and -10 regions of the <italic>kdpFABC </italic>promoter and triggers <italic>kdpFABC </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The enzymatic activities of purified KdpD and KdpE were determined <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. All data known thus far indicate that KdpD does not sense a single specific parameter, but integrates the information of intracellular parameters imposed by K<sup>+ </sup>limitation or salt stress. The current working model proposes that KdpD perceives alterations in the intracellular K<sup>+ </sup>concentration, the ionic strength, and the ATP concentration as stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>KdpD consists of a characteristic C-terminal transmitter domain, which is fused via a small linker region to the large N-terminal input domain. Several regions of the input domain have been identified as important for stimulus perception and integration. The four transmembrane domains (TM1-TM4) anchor the sensor kinase in the cytoplasmic membrane and separate the two large cytoplasmic domains from each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The transmembrane helices TM2 and TM3 function as a type of clip and are responsible for the correct positioning of the large cytoplasmic domains relative to each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. We have previously shown a direct interaction between these KdpD cytoplasmic domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The &#x003b1;-helix of TM4 extends from the membrane into the cytoplasm and encompasses a cluster of positively charged amino acids (R503-R511) that are mainly involved in stimulus perception, and has therefore been proposed as a K<sup>+ </sup>binding site by Altendorf and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This hypothesis is in accord with the finding that amino acid replacements resulting in K<sup>+</sup>-independent <italic>kdpFABC </italic>expression are located within TM4 and the adjacent region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It was previously shown that the cluster of positively charged amino acids is important for modulation of the kinase and phosphatase activity, because individual replacements of these amino acids resulted in KdpD derivatives with either enhanced kinase and reduced phosphatase activity, or enhanced phosphatase and reduced kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, a KdpD derivative lacking the cytoplasmic N-terminal region and the first two transmembrane domains of KdpD were able to respond to K<sup>+ </sup>limitation, which supports the assumption that the K<sup>+ </sup>binding site is located within this region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The role of the KdpD N-terminal input domain large cytoplasmic region (M1-W395, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) for sensing and signal transduction has been a mystery for a long time. Altendorf and coworkers found that truncations within the N-terminal domain resulted in functional KdpD protein <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Later, a sequence motif was identified within this domain that is very similar to the classical "Walker A" motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Truncations that encompass this motif (R12-D228, R12-W395) result in deregulated phosphatase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Since ATP-binding within this region is known to be involved in modulation of the phosphatase activity, ATP may function as an intracellular stimulus that is sensed by KdpD under osmotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This is in accord with the finding that the intracellular ATP concentration increases significantly upon an osmotic upshift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A truncated version of KdpD comprising only the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (KdpD/1-395) caused constitutive expression of <italic>kdpFABC in vivo</italic>, revealing a stabilizing function of the N-terminal domain of KdpD in complex with phosphorylated KdpE and the corresponding DNA binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This hydrophilic N-terminal domain contains two subdomains: a KdpD domain (pfam02702) and a Usp domain (cd01987) (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The Usp domain within KdpD (I253-P365) shares similarities to the Usp proteins of the UspA subfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The KdpD-Usp domain binds the universal stress protein UspC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It has been puzzling how KdpD is activated under salt stress when K<sup>+ </sup>accumulates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], although the kinase activity is inhibited by K<sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Recent data indicate that UspC scaffolds the KdpD/KdpE signaling cascade under salt stress by stabilizing the KdpD/KdpE~P/DNA complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This is in accord with the earlier finding according to which cells producing a truncated KdpD lacking the Usp domain exhibit reduced <italic>kdpFABC </italic>expression under salt stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Sequence alignment of the N-terminal domain of KdpD (KdpD/1-395) comprising the Usp-domain, marked by the blue line</bold>.

KdpD contains the conserved domains of histidine kinases: HATPase_c (Histidine kinase-like ATPases; Histidine kinase-, DNA gyrase B-, phytochrome-like ATPases, SMART00387) and HisKA (His Kinase A phosphoacceptor domain; dimerization and phosphoacceptor domain of histidine kinases, SMART00388).

Usp-containing organisms are usually equipped with several copies of <italic>usp </italic>genes. The <italic>usp </italic>genes encode either small Usp proteins (one Usp domain), larger versions with two Usp domains in tandem, or Usp domains integrated in multi-domain proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. <italic>E. coli </italic>contains six Usp proteins that can be divided into two subfamilies on the basis of sequence similarities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Three of these proteins belong to the UspA subfamily (UspA, UspC, and UspD), and two to the UspFG subfamily (UspF and UspG). The UspE protein is a tandem-like protein consisting of two Usp domains. The UspE domain1 is more related to the UspA sub-family, whereas the domain2 is closer related to the UspFG sub-family. The intracellular copy number of UspA, UspC, UspD, and UspE increases upon stress conditions such as starvation, moderate heat stress, oxidative stress, and osmotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. UspG is induced under osmotic stress and has recently been shown to undergo autophosphorylation and autoadenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, the exact functions of these small proteins are unclear.</p><p>The degree of similarity of the Usp domain within KdpD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) varies among all known KdpD sequences.

These KdpD chimeras were characterized <italic>in vivo </italic>as well as <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>"Domain swapping" of the Usp domain within KdpD</title><p>The N-terminal region of the cytoplasmic input domain containing the KdpD domain (pfam02702) is highly conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], whereas the C-terminal region containing the Usp-domain (cd01987) (I253-P365) is less conserved (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The KdpD-Usp domain of other bacteria, for example <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic>(KdpD/R249-D372), <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor </italic>(KdpD/R233-I354), <italic>Salmonella enterica </italic>serotype Typhimurium (KdpD/I253-P365), and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>(KdpD/R248-R358) are characterized by different degrees of identity and similarity. The highest degree of sequence identity has the KdpD-Usp domain of <italic>S. enterica </italic>serotype Typhimurium compared to the corresponding <italic>E. coli </italic>domain (86% identity, 89% similarity). The other KdpD-Usp domains are less conserved (<italic>A. tumefaciens</italic>: 30% identity, 45% similarity; <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>: 28% identity, 43% similarity; <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>: 25% identity, 42% similarity). The KdpD-Usp domain belongs to the UspA subfamily. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence identity, proteins of this (sub)family (UspA, UspC and UspD) are predicted to have a homologous tertiary structure which consists of four to five central &#x003b2;-sheets surrounded by four a-helices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. To examine the specifics of the KdpD-Usp domain and its importance in KdpD signaling, we replaced amino acids L221-V358 of <italic>E. coli </italic>KdpD with the homologous KdpD-Usp domains of <italic>A. tumefaciens </italic>(L218-I371), <italic>S. enterica </italic>serotype Typhimurium (L221-V358), <italic>S. coelicolor </italic>(L202-V355), and <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>(L218-Q361) as described in <italic>Methods</italic>, and designated the chimeras Agrocoli-KdpD, Salmocoli-KdpD, Streptocoli-KdpD, and Pseudocoli-KdpD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, we exchanged the KdpD-Usp domain of <italic>E. coli </italic>with the six soluble Usp protein sequences of <italic>E. coli</italic>, yielding the chimeras KdpD-UspA, KdpD-UspC, KdpD-UspD, KdpD-UspE, KdpD-UspF, and KdpD-UspG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

KdpD has an ATP-dependent phosphatase activity, which is modulated upon binding of ATP to the N-terminal KdpD-domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The ATP-dependency of the phosphatase activity was not changed in any of the KdpD-Usp chimeras, because significant dephosphorylation could only be observed in the presence of ATP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Despite detection of enzymatic activities for all chimeras, the ratio between kinase-phosphotransferase to phosphatase activities is important for the corresponding output (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The ratios for Salmocoli-KdpD, Agrocoli-KdpD and KdpD-UspA, KdpD-UspD, KdpD-UspF, KdpD-UspG were comparable to wild-type KdpD (deviation less than 20%). In KdpD-UspC and Streptocoli-KdpD, these ratios were shifted toward the kinase-phosphotransferase activity, resulting in higher levels of phosphorylated KdpE. The enhanced <italic>kdpFABC </italic>expression mediated by KdpD-UspC and Streptocoli-KdpD under K<sup>+ </sup>limitation can therefore be explained by decreased phosphatase activities (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Pseudocoli-KdpD was characterized by a ratio that was drastically shifted to the phosphatase activity, resulting in less phosphorylated KdpE. This result might explain the low induction potential of this chimera in response to K<sup>+ </sup>limitation and salt stress. Remarkably, KdpD-UspF and KdpD-UspG were characterized by decreased phosphatase activities.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Kinase-phosphotransferase to phosphatase ratios of the KdpD chimeras.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Chimera</th><th align="center">Kinase-phosphotransferase to phosphatase ratio</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">KdpD</td><td align="center">1.00</td></tr><tr><td align="left">KdpD-UspA</td><td align="center">0.81</td></tr><tr><td align="left">KdpD-UspC</td><td align="center">1.44</td></tr><tr><td align="left">KdpD-UspD</td><td align="center">0.89</td></tr><tr><td align="left">KdpD-UspF</td><td align="center">1.15</td></tr><tr><td align="left">KdpD-UspG</td><td align="center">1.00</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Agrocoli-KdpD</td><td align="center">0.78</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Salmocoli-KdpD</td><td align="center">0.83</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Streptocoli-KdpD</td><td align="center">1.44</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Pseudocoli-KdpD</td><td align="center">0.35</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In vitro </italic>activities of the KdpD-Usp chimeras</bold>.

Although the amino acid sequences of these proteins lack a high degree of sequence identity, all proteins share the same predicted tertiary structure, which consists of a bundle of four to five &#x003b2;-sheets surrounded by four &#x003b1;-helices (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). As indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, the <italic>E. coli </italic>KdpD-Usp domain is highly charged. The flexible regions between a-helix1 and a-helix2, as well as between &#x003b2;-sheet4 and a-helix4 contain an accumulation of positively charged amino acids (especially Arg), which are not found in UspF or UspG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In addition, the KdpD-Usp domain contains a cluster of positively charged Arg residues on the surface of a-helix1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), which are neither present in UspF nor in UspG. In contrast, UspF and UspG are characterized by a predominantly negatively charged surface (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Based on these results, differences in the net surface charges between KdpD-Usp and UspF/UspG may be the reason for the non-functionality of KdpD-UspF and KdpD-UspG <italic>in vivo</italic>. In support of this hypothesis, replacing UspC with the KdpD-Usp domain resulted in a fully functional KdpD. UspC contains a positively charged amino acid cluster between a-helix1 and a-helix2 as well as between &#x003b2;-sheet4 and a-helix5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Surface charge of the Usp domain within KdpD (amino acids 253&#x02013;373) compared to UspC, UspF, and UspG</bold>.

This domain has been characterized as an interaction site for the soluble UspC protein. Moreover, binding of UspC scaffolds the KdpD/KdpE signaling cascade under salt stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Since the mechanistic significance of the KdpD-Usp domain for signaling was still unclear, we employed a "domain swapping" approach to replace this domain with four homologous domains or the six soluble Usp proteins. As shown earlier, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and corroborated here (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), the tertiary structure of all inserted domains is very similar, although the degree of amino acid identity is rather low. In general, we have hypothesized three different mechanisms of how Usp domain swapping could affect KdpD/KdpE signaling: (i) UspC scaffolding under salt stress is increased/abolished due to affinity alterations of the inserted domains towards UspC, (ii) the enzymatic activities of the KdpD chimeras are altered, and (iii) the protein dynamics of the sensor are altered. Interestingly, we generated chimeras covering all these possibilities.</p><p>Scaffolding under salt stress was only observed when UspC was inserted into KdpD. In contrast, all other domains prevented scaffolding by UspC. It should be noted that the KdpD-Usp domain sequences differ among bacteria, and also the set of available soluble Usp proteins within these bacteria is variable. <italic>A. tumefaciens </italic>has three <italic>usp </italic>homologues (<italic>atu0496, atu0904</italic>, and <italic>atu1730</italic>), <italic>S. coelicolor </italic>has eleven <italic>usp </italic>homologues (<italic>sco0172, sco0178, sco0167, sco0180, sco0181, sco0198, sco0200, sco0937, sco7156, sco7247</italic>, and <italic>sco7299</italic>), <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>has seven (<italic>pa1753, pa1789, pa3017, pa3309, pa4328, pa4352</italic>, and <italic>pa5027</italic>), and <italic>S. enterica </italic>serotype Typhimurium has six homologues similar to <italic>E. coli </italic>(<italic>uspA, uspC, uspD, uspE, uspF</italic>, and <italic>uspG</italic>). With the exception of <italic>S. enterica</italic>, none of these organisms has a <italic>uspC </italic>homologue, suggesting that KdpD/KdpE scaffolding either does not exist in these bacteria, or it is mediated by other Usp proteins. This leads to the conclusion that UspC is the specific scaffolding protein for KdpD/KdpE in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Although all chimeras exhibited enzymatic activity, the ratio between kinase-phosphotransferase to phosphatase activity was shifted in some chimeras. In Pseudocoli-KdpD, the ratio was shifted towards the phosphatase activity, producing a significantly lower expression level than wild-type KdpD. Likewise, KdpD-UspC and Streptocoli-Usp had increased kinase-phosphotransferase to phosphatase ratios and were characterized by significantly higher induction values compared to wild-type KdpD.</p><p>Last but not least, the "domain swapping" approach identified the first two KdpD derivatives (KdpD-UspG and KdpD-UspF) with alterations in the N-terminal domain that lost the sensing/signal processing (signaling) properties towards K<sup>+ </sup>limitation, while these proteins exhibited enzymatic activities <italic>in vitro</italic>. The analysis of other chimeras such as KdpD-UspC or KdpD-UspA demonstrates that sensing/signaling was not prevented because of the replacement of the domain <italic>per se</italic>, but that the blockage of the sensor was specifically due to the insertion of UspF or UspG. These data suggest that the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain is important for KdpD/KdpE sensing and/or signaling. We have previously shown that the N-terminal domain of KdpD interacts with the C-terminal region of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Kuhn and coworkers claimed that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of KdpD is sufficient to function as a K<sup>+ </sup>sensor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Indeed, several truncated KdpD derivatives respond to K<sup>+ </sup>limitation. However in all known examples, these proteins are unable to repress <italic>kdpFABC </italic>at higher external K<sup>+ </sup>concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These data reveal that the N-terminal domain is required for full functionality. Using a comparative analysis of the net surface charges between KdpD-Usp, UspC, UspF, and UspG, we gained new insight on how all these results fit together. In contrast to the highly positively charged surface of the <italic>E. coli </italic>KdpD-Usp domain, UspF and UspG are characterized by a predominantly negatively charged surface. Furthermore, proteins of the UspFG subfamily can be modified by adenylation and phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], which could further enhance the negatively charged surface <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, we propose that alterations in the electrostatic interaction between the large N- and C-terminal domains in KdpD are involved in the activation of the signaling cascade, specifically by autophosphorylation. A previous model suggested that the positioning of the N- and C-terminal domains are critical and probably change upon stimulus perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It was proposed that the sensor switches from an "OFF" state to an "ON" state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The "ON" state was thought to be achieved by a movement of the two domains towards each other. The charge distribution described here, as well as the activation potential of a sensor that lacks either the N- or C-terminal domain suggests a revision of the former model. The extension of the fourth transmembrane domain located in the C-terminal region of KdpD is characterized by a cluster of positively charged amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. As the positively charged Usp domain turns towards the C-terminal domain, the protein switches into an open "ON" position by electrostatic repulsion of the positively charged amino acids in the N- and C-terminal domains allowing KdpD/KdpE signaling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Replacement of the KdpD-Usp domain by the negatively charged UspF and UspG might force the "OFF" state of KdpD due to electrostatic attraction of the N- and C-terminal domains to each other (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). A possible explanation why KdpD-UspF and KdpD-UspG are fully active <italic>in vitro </italic>but block <italic>kdpFABC </italic>expression <italic>in vivo </italic>might be that the stabilization of the KdpE-DNA complex by KdpD is prevented in the "OFF" state. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the separated N-terminal domain (KdpD/1-395) permanently stabilizes the interaction between phosphorylated KdpE and the corresponding DNA-binding site and therefore promotes a constitutive <italic>kdpFABC </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Model of KdpD activation</bold>. KdpD exists in two states, an "OFF" and an "ON" state. Upon stimulus perception, the positively charged surface of the Usp domain within the N-terminal region (yellow) faces the positively charged region (R503-R511) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] in the C-terminal region of KdpD. Thus, electrostatic repulsions between N- and C-terminal domains force the protein into the "open" position. This in turn releases the N-terminal domain, forming a stable complex with KdpE~P and the DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] initiating <italic>kdpFABC </italic>expression. Replacement of the KdpD-Usp domain with UspF or UspG results in inversion of the surface net charges. The negative net surface charge of these two proteins forces electrostatic attraction between the N- and the C-terminal regions, leaving KdpD in the "OFF" state under all conditions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2180-9-133-8"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Usp domain within KdpD is important for proper KdpD/KdpE signaling. Alterations within this domain can completely prevent the response towards K<sup>+ </sup>limitation as well as salt stress. The KdpD-Usp domain surface contains numerous positively charged amino acids. Electrostatic repulsion and attraction between the N-terminal and C-terminal domain are supposed to be important for KdpD (de)activation. Therefore, the KdpD-Usp domain not only functions as a binding surface for the native scaffold UspC, but also seems to be crucial for internal KdpD signaling, shifting the protein from an "OFF" into an "ON" state.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>[&#x003b3;<sup>32</sup>-P]ATP and NAP-5 gel filtration columns were purchased from Amersham GE Healthcare.
