We found that blood vessels in SCCs did not express E-selectin, and tumors contained few cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, the cell type thought to provide cutaneous immunosurveillance. Tumors treated with the Toll-like receptor (TLR)7 agonist imiquimod before excision showed induction of E-selectin on tumor vessels, recruitment of CLA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, and histological evidence of tumor regression. SCCs treated in vitro with imiquimod also expressed vascular E-selectin. Approximately 50% of the T cells infiltrating untreated SCCs were FOXP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory T (T reg) cells. Imiquimod-treated tumors contained a decreased percentage of T reg cells, and these cells produced less FOXP3, interleukin (IL)-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;. Treatment of T reg cells in vitro with imiquimod inhibited their suppressive activity and reduced FOXP3, CD39, CD73, IL-10, and TGF-&#x003b2; by indirect mechanisms. In vivo and in vitro treatment with imiquimod also induced IL-6 production by effector T cells. In summary, we find that SCCs evade the immune response at least in part by down-regulating vascular E-selectin and recruiting T reg cells. TLR7 agonists neutralized both of these strategies, supporting their use in SCCs and other tumors with similar immune defects.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: CCL, CC chemokine ligand; CLA, cutaneous lymphocyte antigen; hpf, high power field; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; PDC, plasmacytoid DC; SCC, squamous cell carcinoma; TLR, Toll-like receptor; T reg, regulatory T.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>More than 100,000 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the skin are diagnosed each year in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Nonmelanoma skin cancer, of which SCC is the second most frequent type, is the fifth most costly cancer, accounting for 4.5% of all Medicare cancer costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). The premalignant precursors to SCC, actinic keratoses, are the third most frequent reason in the United States for consulting a dermatologist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). More than 5.2 million physician visits are made each year for the treatment of actinic keratoses at a cost of more than 900 million dollars annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>).</p><p>Solid organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive medications frequently develop multiple and aggressive SCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). These individuals have a 65&#x02013;250-fold increased risk of SCCs, nearly 10% of these tumors metastasize, and the majority of these patients die as a result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). The development of SCCs in transplant recipients is linked to the use of medications that suppress T cell activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). T cell function therefore appears critical to the immunological control of SCCs. We present our findings that SCCs from both healthy and immunocompromised individuals evade the immune response, at least in part, by down-regulation of vascular E-selectin, exclusion of skin-homing memory T cells, and recruitment of regulatory T (T reg) cells.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>SCCs are infiltrated by diverse noncutaneous central memory T cells</title><p>SCCs of the skin commonly have associated T cell infiltrates, but the clinical persistence of the cancer suggests that these T cells are unable to destroy the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). We isolated T cells from human invasive SCCs and compared them with T cells from normal human skin, the population thought to provide immunosurveillance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>).

Skin resident T cells express the skin addressins cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) and CCR4, which bind to E-selectin and CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 22 on skin endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). T cells from SCCs did not express CLA and CCR4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and instead expressed <sc>l</sc>-selectin and CCR7, markers of central memory T cells that are normally found only in the blood or lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Studies of cryosections confirmed that T cells from SCCs lack the skin addressin CLA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). T cells from SCCs developing in transplant recipients also lacked CLA and CCR4 expression (not depicted). Few SCC T cells were Th2 biased as demonstrated by the lack of two independent markers for Th2 bias, ST2L and the &#x003b3;-IFN receptor &#x003b2; chain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).

In contrast, T cells from normal human skin expressed high levels of the skin-homing addressins CLA and CCR4 and most lacked CCR7/L-selectin coexpression. Similar results were observed in three additional SCC samples. (B) Confirmation that T cells infiltrating SCCs lack CLA expression. Frozen sections of invasive SCCs were stained for CD3 (red) and CLA (green).

To study this further, we examined the effect of imiquimod on T cells isolated from human skin. When imiquimod was added to explant cultures for 1 wk before T cell isolation, expression of the FOXP3 protein by T reg cells was significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). FOXP3 protein expression by T reg cells correlates with their ability to suppress T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).

Lastly, we found that CD39 and CD73 were preferentially expressed by FOXP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells versus FOXP3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> effector T cells, and that treatment in vitro with imiquimod reduced the expression of both CD39 and CD73 on T reg cells (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071190/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071190/DC1</ext-link>). Treatment of purified skin T cells with imiquimod did not affect T reg cell surface marker expression or cytokine production, arguing for an indirect mechanism of effect. In summary, we find that imiquimod decreases T reg cell FOXP3, CD39, and cytokine production and that this effect is dependent on the presence of other cells resident in skin.</p></sec><sec><title>SCCs are infiltrated by immature and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs</title><p>We have found that two important effects of imiquimod, the induction of vascular E-selectin and immunomodulation of T reg and effector T cells, appear to occur via indirect mechanisms. Human dermis contains macrophages and dermal DCs, and SCCs also contain PDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>); these cell types have been reported to respond directly to imiquimod. We analyzed SCCs by immunostaining and found that these tumors contain large numbers of CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>, DC). However, most DCs were immature, as demonstrated by their lack of DC-LAMP and CD83 expression. In contrast, imiquimod-treated SCCs contained mature DCs expressing both CD83 and DC-LAMP, consistent with reports that imiquimod induces maturation of DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Additionally, a population of cells expressing high levels of iNOS was present in untreated but not imiquimod-treated SCCs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>). These cells co-stained weakly for CD11c, but were negative for CD34 (not depicted), suggesting that they represent DCs as opposed to myeloid-derived suppressor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>SCCs contain immature and iNOS<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs.</bold> Cryosections of untreated and imiquimod-treated SCCs were immunostained for the DC marker CD11c and markers of DC maturation CD83 (A) and DC-LAMP (B).

To evaluate this, we analyzed the TCR repertoire of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells isolated from untreated and imiquimod-treated tumors using flow cytometry for TCR V&#x003b2; families (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).

Normal human skin contains 1 million memory T cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, and there are nearly twice as many T cells resident in normal skin than are present in the entire circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). This suggests that immune surveillance of the skin is a high priority for the immune system. The susceptibility of individuals on T cell&#x02013;immunosuppressant medications to SCCs suggests that T cells may play a role in controlling these tumors. We were intrigued by the fact that SCCs are heavily infiltrated by T cells that nonetheless fail to control tumor growth. We find that SCCs from both healthy and immunocompromised individuals exclude skin-homing memory T cells, and instead recruit a population of T reg cells normally restricted to the blood and lymph nodes.</p><p>Effector memory T cells preferentially migrate through the peripheral tissue in which they first encountered antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). This tissue-specific migration ensures that tissues are populated by T cells specific for pathogens likely to be encountered again in that tissue. Such T cells can migrate preferentially because they express addressins that bind to specific counterreceptors on the endothelium of a particular tissue. For example, CLA on skin-homing T cells binds to E-selectin expressed on cutaneous postcapillary venules, supporting the entry of T cells into the skin under both normal and inflamed conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). SCC-specific T cells should express CLA because they first encounter antigen within the skin-draining lymph nodes. We have found that SCCs do not express E-selectin on tumor vessels and are not infiltrated by CLA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> skin-homing T cells. The tumor therefore excludes the population of skin-homing memory T cells expected to contain tumor-specific T cells. We observed a lack of vascular E-selectin and exclusion of CLA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from SCCs arising in both normal and immunosuppressed individuals, suggesting that aberrant T cell homing occurs in tumors from both clinical groups.</p><p>Impaired T cell homing also occurs in other types of human cancer. Reduced expression of adhesion molecules on blood vessels has been described in human breast, gastric, and lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>). Melanoma metastases express low levels of the addressins E-selectin, P-selectin, and ICAM-1, and this is associated with low numbers of T cells within the metastatic tumor nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). Because of its readily accessible location, cutaneous SCC is a model cancer in which to study the defective T cell homing that may underlie poor immune responses to several human cancers. Additional studies of the nature of endothelial cells within SCCs will be critical to understanding how these tumors regulate the expression of vascular addressins.</p><p>T reg cells can suppress the activation, cytokine production, and proliferation of other T cells, and they are crucial to the development and maintenance of self-tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). We have found that up to 50% of the T cells infiltrating cutaneous SCCs from both normal and immunosuppressed individuals are FOXP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells. These cells form a dense infiltrate surrounding tumor nests and are well positioned to impair the responses of effector T cells that gain access to the tumor. T reg cells from SCCs lack CLA and CCR4 and are therefore distinct from the T reg cells that populate normal skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Instead, T reg cells from SCCs coexpress <sc>l</sc>-selectin and CCR7. This phenotype is similar to that of central memory T cells, a type of cell found normally only in the blood or lymph nodes. We observed no local proliferation of T reg cells in tumors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>), and thus recruitment from the blood may be the primary mechanism for enrichment of these cells in tumors. T reg cells are recruited to ovarian carcinoma by the interaction of tumor CCL22 with CCR4 on T reg cells, and recruitment of T reg cells to Hodgkin lymphomas also involves CCR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). However, CCR4 is highly expressed by T cells that provide immunosurveillance of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), and recruitment of this subset would likely be detrimental to tumor survival. In fact, we see no expression of CCR4 on the T reg cells infiltrating SCCs, suggesting another addressin must be responsible for recruiting these and other central memory T cells into tumors. Preliminary studies in our laboratory have shown that SCC vessels do not express peripheral node addressin, a group of <sc>l</sc>-selectin ligands that recruit memory and naive <sc>l</sc>-selectin&#x02013;expressing T cells into lymph nodes, nor do they express the CCR7 ligands CCL19 and CCL21 (unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). This is consistent with the lack of CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> naive T cells in tumors. Ongoing studies in our laboratory are focused on identifying the vascular ligands expressed by SCC tumor vessels that support the recruitment of central memory T cells.</p><p>Imiquimod is a topical immune response modifier that is effective in the treatment of basal cell carcinomas, SCCs, and SCC precursor lesions actinic keratoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Imiquimod induces tumor regression via both immunological and nonimmunological mechanisms by activating TLR7 and TLR8 and binding to adenosine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). Imiquimod stimulates blood mononuclear cells to produce a variety of inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-&#x003b1;, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, IL-12, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). Clinical response to topical imiquimod has been associated with the migration of PDCs into the skin and subsequent cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>). It has been suggested that SCCs may be infiltrated by Th2-biased T cells, and that clearance of these tumors after imiquimod therapy might be a result of a shift from Th2- to Th1-biased immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>). However, we found very few Th2-biased T cells in SCCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Thus, lack of tumor destruction is not likely a result of Th-2 bias among tumor-infiltrating T cells.</p><p>Our results show that treatment of SCC with imiquimod is associated with induction of E-selectin on tumor vessels, infiltration by CLA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> skin-homing CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cytotoxic T cells, and histological evidence of tumor regression. In vitro treatment of SCCs with imiquimod induced E-selectin on tumor vessels, suggesting that this medication may act to restore normal T cell homing, allowing CLA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> skin-homing T cells access to the tumor, where they can initiate tumor destruction. We have found that SCC blood vessels and dermal microvascular endothelial cells express TLR7 and TLR8, but do not respond directly to imiquimod. Vascular responses to imiquimod therefore require the presence of APCs or other imiquimod-responsive cell types. To respond directly to TLR7/8 agonists, a cell must take up and deliver agonists to the endosomal compartment where TLR7/8 are located, and endosomes must subsequently undergo acidification and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>). Thus, human endothelial cells may not respond directly to TLR7/8 agonists because they are nonphagocytic or lack endosomal maturation.</p><p>In addition to its effect on E-selectin expression, imiquimod treatment of SCC results in a fivefold reduction in the percentage of tumor-infiltrating FOXP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells. Treated tumors contain vastly increased numbers of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, in essence diluting out tumor T reg cells. In a mouse model of sarcoma, it was the relative percentage of FOXP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cells that distinguished progressively growing tumors from those that spontaneously regressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>). Thus, the dilution of tumor T reg cells by recruitment or local expansion of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells may tip the balance toward immunological destruction.</p><p>We hypothesized that imiquimod may inhibit tumor-associated T reg cells, given that TLR8 ligation was recently shown to block the suppressive ability of T reg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Indeed, we found that treatment of T reg cells with imiquimod in vitro blocked their ability to suppress T cell proliferation without reducing viability. Imiquimod treatment decreased the expression of FOXP3 and production of the cytokines IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; in T reg cells isolated from human skin. CD39 and CD73 have been recently implicated in contact-dependent suppression by T reg cells in mice; we found that both CD39 and CD73 were preferentially expressed by T reg cells and that expression was down-regulated after treatment with imiquimod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). These effects were observed if imiquimod was added to the skin explant cultures before T cell isolation, but direct treatment of purified skin T cells had no effect, suggesting an indirect mechanism mediated by another cell type present in skin. Candidate responsive cells in skin include PDCs, macrophages, and keratinocytes, each of which has been shown to respond directly to imiquimod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). T reg cells isolated from SCCs treated in vivo with imiquimod also had decreased IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; production, confirming that the effects we see in vitro are also present in vivo.</p><p>In addition to the effect on T reg cells, imiquimod induced the production of IL-6 by effector T cells, albeit by an indirect mechanism. To our knowledge, imiquimod-stimulated IL-6 production by T cells has not been reported previously. IL-6 production by murine T cells renders them resistant to suppression by T reg cells, and early reports suggest a similar effect occurs in human psoriatic T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">63</xref>). Thus, TLR agonists such as imiquimod both decrease the suppressive activity of T reg cells and increase the resistance of effector cells to suppression. Again, this effect was indirect and required the presence of other cells in skin. Over 50% of effector T cells isolated from imiquimod-treated SCCs produced IL-6, compared with 10% in an untreated tumor, confirming the in vivo relevance of this finding. Studies to identify the imiquimod-responsive cells in skin and the signals that mediated endothelial and T cell responses to imiquimod are ongoing in our laboratory.</p><p>The indirect nature of imiquimod's effects on endothelial and T cells highlights the critical role of innate immune cells such as DCs in tumor responses. We found large numbers of immature DCs in untreated SCCs, whereas mature DCs were evident only after imiquimod treatment. Immature DCs within tumors can prevent proper antigen presentation and can induce the formation of T reg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>). We also observed a population of iNOS-expressing DCs in untreated, but not treated, SCCs. Nitric oxide (NO) impairs the ability of human endothelial cells to express E-selectin in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>). Exogenously produced NO down-regulates the expression of MAdCAM-1 on gut vessels, decreases lymphocyte rolling, and has been proposed as a possible therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>). We are currently investigating the possibility that NO production suppresses E-selectin expression on tumor vessels.</p><p>We have evidence for three novel mechanisms of action for imiquimod that may initiate and sustain the immunological destruction of SCC. First, imiquimod up-regulates E-selectin on tumor vessels. This E-selectin expression is associated with an influx of CLA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cytotoxic T cells into the tumor, thereby delivering potentially tumor-reactive T cells to the cancer while at the same time diluting out tumor T reg cells. Second, imiquimod inhibits the suppressive activity of T reg cells, decreasing the levels of FOXP3 protein and surface molecules associated with contact inhibition, as well as reducing the production of immunosuppressive cytokines. Lastly, imiquimod induces the production of IL-6 by effector T cells that may render them resistant to suppression by T reg cells.</p><p>Impaired T cell homing and recruitment of regulatory T cells are features of many human cancers. We find that the TLR7 agonist imiquimod neutralizes both of these defenses, supporting the use of this medication in SCCs and in other tumors that use similar strategies to evade the immune response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>SCC samples.</title><p>Tumor samples consisted of curetted tumor removed before taking the first Mohs section during Mohs micrographic excision of biopsy-proven SCCs.

Sections were incubated with primary antibody for 30 min, and then rinsed three times in PBS/1% BSA for 5 min. If necessary, secondary antibody was added (1:100 dilution) for 30 min, followed by three rinses. Sections were stained with 0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml Hoechst stain for 2 min, rinsed briefly in PBS/1% BSA, and then mounted using Prolong anti-fade mounting medium (Invitrogen) and examined immediately by immunofluorescence microscopy.

RNA was isolated from second passage cultures. For comparison, identical studies were performed on T cell&#x02013;depleted PBMCs, isolated from peripheral blood by Ficoll density centrifugation followed by T cell depletion using the pan&#x02013;T cells isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech) and AutoMACS instrument (Miltenyi Biotech). For RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, cells were placed in RNALater RNA-stabilizing reagent (QIAGEN) and frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for later use. Frozen cells were then lysed and homogenized, and total RNA was extracted using QIAGEN RNeasy mini kits as specified by the manufacturer. Avian RT first-strand kits (Sigma-Aldrich) were used to synthesize cDNA from total RNA. The concentration of total RNA was determined at the optical density at 260 nm (OD<sub>260</sub>), and discrepancies in the amount of total RNA extracted were corrected by loading the same amount and concentration of RNA for cDNA synthesis. The purity of cDNA was determined by the OD<sub>260</sub>/OD<sub>280</sub> ratio. For primer design, nucleotide sequences were determined from PubMed (National Center for Biomedical Information), and the primers were custom designed using primer3 software. Primer pairs were as follows: TLR7, 5&#x02032;-TGGAAATTGCCCTCGTTGTT-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GTCAGCGCATCAAAAGCATT-3&#x02032;; TLR8, 5&#x02032;-CTTCGATACCTAAACCTCTCTAGCAC-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-AAGATCCAGCACCTTCAGATGA-3&#x02032;. Real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed using the iCycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with SYBR Green kits (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and mRNA quantification by the standard curve method, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">69</xref>). In brief, for each transcript analyzed, a standard curve with predetermined concentrations and serial diluted respective PCR amplification products from 0.1 to 0.00001 ng was constructed. This approach allows the standards to be amplified in the same way as the template cDNA in the unknown samples because the product sequence and size are identical. Levels of Cyclophilin A mRNA served as an internal control to normalize samples for variations in sample volume loading, presence of inhibitors, and nucleic acid recovery during extraction and cDNA synthesis procedures. The normalized initial concentration of each transcript in every sample was converted to the initial copy number by using the following formula: Amount (copies/&#x003bc;l) &#x0003d; 6 &#x000d7; 1,023 (copies/mole) &#x000d7; concentration (grams/microliter)/molecular mass (grams/mole), where the mean molecular weight of double-stranded DNA equals the number of base pairs &#x000d7; 660 Daltons/base pair. All analyses were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>In vitro treatment of endothelial cells with imiquimod.</title><p>Human endothelial cells (Lonza Group) from two different donors were expanded with EGM-2 BulletKit growth media (Lonza Group). Cells were cultured on RepCell temperature-responsive plates (CellSeed). 3 &#x003bc;M imiquimod or 10 ng/ml TNF-&#x003b1; was added for indicated lengths of time, either alone or in combination with APC. APCs were isolated from human blood by ficoll density centrifugation and depletion of T cells using the Pan-T isolation kit, followed by MACS separation (Miltenyi Biotech). 4.5 million APCs were added to each well of a 6-well plate (CellSeed), and the combined culture was maintained in EGM-2 medium. APCs cultured in EGM-2 endothelial media became activated, produced inflammatory cytokines, and induced endothelial cell E-selectin in the presence or absence of imiquimod. On the day of FACS analysis, plates were cooled to room temperature to promote spontaneous release of endothelial cells. Released cells were stained with directly conjugated antibodies to CD31 and E-selectin (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by flow cytometry. For experiments with SCC13, SCC13 cells (provided by J.
