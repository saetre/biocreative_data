Using embryonic stem cells and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, we show that calreticulin modulates adipogenesis. We find that calreticulin-deficient cells show increased potency for adipogenesis when compared with wild-type or calreticulin-overexpressing cells. In the highly adipogenic <italic>crt</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, the ER lumenal calcium concentration was reduced. Increasing the ER lumenal calcium concentration led to a decrease in adipogenesis. In calreticulin-deficient cells, the calmodulin&#x02013;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) pathway was up-regulated, and inhibition of CaMKII reduced adipogenesis. Calreticulin inhibits adipogenesis via a negative feedback mechanism whereby the expression of calreticulin is initially up-regulated by peroxisome proliferator&#x02013;activated receptor &#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;). This abundance of calreticulin subsequently negatively regulates the expression of PPAR&#x003b3;, lipoprotein lipase, CCAAT enhancer&#x02013;binding protein &#x003b1;, and aP2. Thus, calreticulin appears to function as a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent molecular switch that regulates commitment to adipocyte differentiation by preventing the expression and transcriptional activation of critical proadipogenic transcription factors.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>E.

The development of obesity is marked by both an increase in adipocyte size and number as a consequence of differentiation of the stem cells or preadipocytes into mature adipocytes (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gesta et al., 2007</xref>). Spontaneous differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells into adipocytes in culture is a rare event; thus, for ES cells to commit toward the adipocyte lineage, it is necessary to pretreat cells with retinoic acid (RA), a ligand of the nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor (RXR), during the first phase of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dani et al., 1997</xref>). RXR in response to RA heterodimerizes with peroxisome proliferator&#x02013;activated receptor (PPAR), resulting in activation of genes involved in terminal differentiation and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gregoire et al., 1998</xref>). PPAR&#x003b3;2, CCAAT enhancer&#x02013;binding protein &#x003b1; (C/EBP&#x003b1;), and aP2 are crucial for the development of adipose cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosen et al., 2000</xref>). The process of adipogenesis may also be influenced by different extrinsic factor and intracellular signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosen and MacDougald, 2006</xref>), yet very little is known about the role of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis in adipogenesis. Increased Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels lead to inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, which is accompanied by the decrease or, in some cases, the loss of PPAR&#x003b3;2, C/EBP&#x003b1;, and aP2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jensen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Serlachius and Andersson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarco/ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase, inhibits adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ntambi and Takova, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shi et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting a role for ER stores and ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding proteins in the modulation of adipogenesis.</p><p>Calreticulin is a major Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-buffering protein in the lumen of the ER, which also acts as a molecular chaperone and modulator of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedard et al., 2005</xref>). The two major functions of calreticulin, chaperoning and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> buffering, are confined to specific protein domains. The N&#x0002b;P domain of calreticulin forms a folding module, and the acidic C-terminal C domain binds and buffers Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> with high capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baksh and Michalak, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref>). Calreticulin deficiency is embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mesaeli et al., 1999</xref>), and calreticulin-deficient cells have a reduced capacity for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> storage within the ER and impaired agonist-stimulated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release from ER stores, whereas cells overexpressing calreticulin have higher levels of lumenal ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and a larger pool of releasable Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakamura et al., 2001</xref>). Calreticulin's impact on protein folding and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis have been implicated in several signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedard et al., 2005</xref>), thus affecting gene expression and, consequently, the behavior of individual cells and cell communities. In this study, we show that calreticulin may act as a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent molecular switch that negatively regulates commitment to adipocyte differentiation by preventing the expression and transcriptional activation of critical proadipogenic transcription factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Calreticulin deficiency promotes adipogenesis</title><p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> shows that the adipogenic potential of ES cells, as measured by oil red O staining at differentiation day 20 (D20), was &#x0223c;30-fold higher in the absence of calreticulin. The number of adipocyte colonies in calreticulin-deficient embryoid bodies (EBs) was approximately ninefold higher than that in the calreticulin-containing EBs at D20 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). This was irrespective of whether the calreticulin gene was removed by homologous recombination (G45<italic>crt</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells) or by Cre recombinase&#x02013;mediated excision (L7<italic>crt</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells; Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712078/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712078/DC1</ext-link>). Adipogenesis in ES cells was RA and insulin dependent and required an initial 3-d exposure to RA followed by insulin treatment (unpublished data). Microscopically, by Nile red staining, lipid droplets in the wild-type (WT) adipocytes were indistinguishable from those in calreticulin-deficient cells (Fig. S1 B), indicating that the gross morphology of lipid stores was not affected in the absence of calreticulin. Nile red is a red-emitting fluorescent lysochrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenspan et al., 1985</xref>) that can be used as a fluorescent alternative to oil red O lipid visualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fowler and Greenspan, 1985</xref>).

Relative protein levels were determined by normalizing the calreticulin, PPAR&#x003b3;2, and C/EBP&#x003b1; to GAPDH, and aP2 mRNA levels were normalized with the housekeeping gene L32.

The abundance of PPAR&#x003b3;2 and C/EBP&#x003b1; adipogenesis markers was markedly increased at D20 in G45<italic>crt<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and L7<italic>crt<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells compared with WT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). The aP2 mRNA levels were undetectable in extracts from the WT and L7 cells, whereas they were high at D20 in extracts from calreticulin-deficient cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). It should be stressed that in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> as well as in subsequent figures, adipogenic markers in calreticulin-containing cells are barely discernible. This is caused by a large disparity in the markers' abundance between calreticulin-deficient and calreticulin-containing cells, which makes it difficult to visualize all of them when equally loaded. Modulation of the expression of calreticulin also impacted adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, a commonly used model for adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Otto and Lane, 2005</xref>). Increased expression of calreticulin in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes inhibited their adipogenesis, as indicated by oil red O staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). In agreement with ES cell results, molecular markers of adipogenesis (lipoprotein lipase, aP2, PPAR&#x003b3;2, C/EBP&#x003b1;, and C/EBP&#x003b2;) were all down-regulated in 3T3-L1 cells overexpressing calreticulin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p><p>Upon induction of adipogenesis with RA, the abundance of calreticulin increased dramatically in the WT ES cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), whereas the abundance of PPAR&#x003b3;2 and C/EBP&#x003b1; remained persistently low (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). In contrast, in calreticulin-deficient (G45<italic>crt</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) cells after induction of adipogenesis with RA, PPAR&#x003b3;2 and C/EBP&#x003b1; levels steadily increased over 20 d of differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). Similar to the WT ES cells, the 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells overexpressing calreticulin showed an increase in calreticulin abundance and reduced adipogenic potential upon RA treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D and E</xref>). We concluded that the increased expression of calreticulin plays a negative regulatory role during adipogenesis.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Calreticulin, PPAR&#x003b3;2, and C/EBP&#x003b1; levels increase over the 20-d differentiation time line, whereas overexpression of calreticulin inhibits adipogenesis.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) Calreticulin (CRT), PPAR&#x003b3;2, and C/EBP&#x003b1; expression was examined in WT and G45<italic>crt</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells by Western blotting over 20 d of adipocyte differentiation as described in Materials and methods.

Thus, we next examined whether calreticulin-dependent changes in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis might be responsible for modulation of adipogenesis. We used BAPTA-AM, a membrane-permeable Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> chelator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsien, 1980</xref>), to lower cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>Cyto</sub>) as well as ionomycin, a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ionophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergling et al., 1998</xref>), to increase [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>Cyto</sub>. Treatment of cells with BAPTA from 20 min to 2 h produced exactly the same results (unpublished data), which implies that BAPTA was not secreted from the cells. BAPTA-AM&#x02013;treated WT and L7 cells showed a dramatic increase in oil red O staining, indicating that chelation of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> promoted adipogenesis in these cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>).

We next wanted to determine whether there was a functional relationship between calreticulin and the PPAR&#x003b3; transcriptional complex. Upon RA-dependent induction of adipogenesis, RXR and PPAR&#x003b3; form a transcriptionally active complex. The calreticulin promoter contains two PPAR&#x003b3;-binding sites termed peroxisome proliferator responsive elements (PPREs); one is found at &#x02212;1,944 bp (designated PPRE1), and the other is found at &#x02212;590 bp (designated PPRE2; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>), suggesting that the PPAR&#x003b3; transcription factor may regulate the calreticulin gene.

Two promoter deletion constructs (pLC1 and pLC2) and two promoter constructs, one containing a mutation of PPRE1 (pLC0mt1) and the other containing a mutation of PPRE2 (pLC0mt2), were used to identify PPRE sites activated by PPAR&#x003b3; on the calreticulin promoter.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was also performed to determine whether there was a direct interaction between the calreticulin promoter and PPAR&#x003b3;.

The absence of calreticulin sways ES cell differentiation toward the adipocyte lineage. This choice of fate is reversed to the WT phenotype by overexpression of calreticulin or by the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-buffering domain of calreticulin but not by expression of the chaperoning domain of the protein. These effects of calreticulin are likely mediated through its Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory function. In comparison to WT cells, calreticulin-deficient ES cells have reduced ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> storage capacity, resulting in reduced ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release upon stimulation. Expression of full-length calreticulin or the calreticulin Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-buffering domain in ES cells or 3T3-L1 cells increases ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> content and reduces the commitment of these cells to adipogenesis. In WT cells, chelating cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] enhances adipogenesis, and, conversely, increasing cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] inhibits adipogenesis. These Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> effects may negatively affect Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent transcriptional pathways that are required for adipogenesis. Calreticulin exerts its Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> effects within the first 3 d of differentiation, as manipulation of intracellular [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] at later stages of differentiation (i.e., D7 or D9) did not alter the respective adipogenic potential of ES cells (unpublished data). This is consistent with what has been done to elicit calcium-dependent effects during ES cell differentiation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al. (2002)</xref>, who used 100 nm ionomycin at D4, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grey et al. (2005)</xref>, who used 100 nm ionomycin at D6.

Moreover, as calreticulin levels were increasing during the first 3 d of differentiation, PPAR&#x003b3;2 and C/EBP&#x003b1; levels were decreasing, implying that the effects of calreticulin fall within the commitment and/or initial stages of adipogenesis. We conclude that calreticulin may act as a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent molecular switch that negatively regulates commitment to adipocyte differentiation by down-regulating the expression and transcriptional activation of critical proadipogenic transcription factors.</p><sec><title>Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-handling module of calreticulin inhibits adipogenesis</title><p>An important finding of this study is that calreticulin, at least in part, exerts its effects on adipogenesis via its role as a modulator of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis. Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> has previously been shown to affect adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jensen et al., 2004</xref>). For example, 3T3-L1 cells exposed to elevated external Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels accumulated little or no cytoplasmic lipids and showed the diminished expression of PPAR&#x003b3;2, C/EBP&#x003b1;, and aP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jensen et al., 2004</xref>). Increasing cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> levels by thapsigargin also inhibited early stages of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shi et al., 2000</xref>), all pointing out the importance of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> on adipogenesis. Indeed, we show here that an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration leads to a decrease in adipocyte differentiation. Conversely, decreasing intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations promotes adipogenesis of calreticulin-deficient ES cells. The relationship between calreticulin expression, intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration, and adipogenesis implies that calreticulin exerts its effects on adipogenesis via its Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostatic function. However, the formal proof comes from experiments in which functional modules of calreticulin were expressed in calreticulin-deficient ES cells. Upon expression of calreticulin's Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-buffering P&#x0002b;C domain, adipogenesis was halted, whereas expression of the N&#x0002b;P domain had no effect on the progression of adipogenesis.</p><p>Our findings that calreticulin affects the commitment to adipocyte differentiation are in line with reports that calreticulin-dependent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling also affects several aspects of the differentiation of cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grey et al., 2005</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Puceat and Jaconi, 2005</xref>) and human myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, diminished intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> stores attenuate cardiomyogenesis but promote adipogenesis and differentiation of myeloid cells. Combined, these findings imply that calreticulin and ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> must play important roles in a variety of differentiation pathways. Moreover, our data regarding timing of the [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] manipulations indicate that in adipogenesis, as in cardiomyogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2002</xref>), there is a calreticulin-regulated calcium-sensitive step referred to as a checkpoint by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al.

The CaMKII pathway is involved in C/EBP&#x003b1; regulation and, thus, indirectly in PPAR regulation. CaMKII activates CREB, which, in turn, activates C/EBP&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fajas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). CREB plays a role in adipogenesis, and, indeed, expression of dominant-negative CREB blocks adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reusch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klemm et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reusch and Klemm, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fox et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vankoningsloo et al., 2006</xref>). CaMKII is also involved in the activation of PPAR&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paez-Pereda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2007</xref>), indicating that the CaMKII pathway may be critical during adipogenesis. Once C/EBP&#x003b1; is expressed, PPAR&#x003b3; and C/EBP&#x003b1; regulate each other, thereby promoting adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosen, 2005</xref>). Here, we show that increased levels of threonine-phosphorylated CaMKII in calreticulin-deficient cells correlate with their increased adipogenesis, and inhibition of CaMKII attenuates adipogenesis in these cells. In calreticulin-deficient cells, in addition to increased CaMKII activity, calmodulin and CREB are also up-regulated, thus explaining the elevated adipogenesis in these cells.</p><p>Given that [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> is lower in calreticulin-deficient cells, the question arises as to how CaMKII activity could be increased in these cells. In calreticulin-deficient cells, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation, including that of c-Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Papp et al., 2007</xref>), is higher than in WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fadel et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Szabo et al., 2007</xref>). Activated c-Src phosphorylates calmodulin on tyrosine 99, thereby increasing the affinity of calmodulin for CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Ghany et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benaim and Villalobo, 2002</xref>). This phosphorylation event is inhibited by high Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukami et al., 1986</xref>). Tyrosine-phosphorylated calmodulin effectively activates CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corti et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, after initial activation, CaMKII becomes autophosphorylated, remaining active even though its activators are removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meyer et al., 1992</xref>). Therefore, CaMKII may remain active and promote adipogenesis in calreticulin-deficient cells even under reduced intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration.</p><p>We have found that endogenous calcineurin activity was significantly higher in calreticulin-expressing cells that have reduced adipogenic potential compared with the calreticulin-deficient cells that are highly adipogenic. This is in agreement with previous studies on calcineurin-dependent inhibition of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neal and Clipstone, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kennell and MacDougald, 2005</xref>). Thus, we propose that although the calcineurin pathway inhibits adipogenesis, the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-independent CaMKII pathway might be responsible for the promotion of adipogenesis in the absence of calreticulin observed here.</p></sec><sec><title>Calreticulin modulates PPAR&#x003b3; activity through a negative feedback mechanism</title><p>PPAR&#x003b3;2 and C/EBP&#x003b1; are crucial transcription factors during adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosen, 2005</xref>); however, although PPAR&#x003b3;2 is necessary for adipogenesis to take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosen et al., 2000</xref>), C/EBP has a more accessory role during this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosen et al., 2002</xref>). We showed here that PPAR&#x003b3;2 and C/EBP&#x003b1; are down-regulated in cells overexpressing calreticulin. Therefore, calreticulin may act as a transcriptional regulator of PPAR, whereby it inhibits the binding of PPAR/RXR to PPRE in the promoter region of the target genes, thus inhibiting transcription activation by peroxisome proliferators and by fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burns et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dedhar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winrow et al., 1995</xref>). Here, we show that the initial process that precedes the effects of calreticulin on the activity of the PPAR&#x003b3;&#x02013;RXR complex involves PPAR&#x003b3; transcriptional activation of the calreticulin gene. PPAR&#x003b3; is a potent transcriptional activator of the calreticulin gene as a result of its direct interaction with the calreticulin promoter. Thus, PPAR&#x003b3; can up-regulate calreticulin, and, conversely, calreticulin can inhibit its activity. We also found an inverse relationship between calreticulin and PPAR&#x003b3;2 expression upon induction of adipogenesis with RA. RA induces the expression of calreticulin but reduces the expression of PPAR&#x003b3;2. This supports the notion of a hierarchical process in which transcriptional activation of the calreticulin gene by PPAR&#x003b3; is the early event followed by calreticulin modulation of PPAR&#x003b3; transcriptional activity. These data provide evidence for a previously unrecognized negative feedback loop whereby PPAR&#x003b3; regulates the expression of calreticulin, and calreticulin modulates PPAR&#x003b3;2 activity and expression. This is likely one important mechanism whereby calreticulin and ER Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis regulate adipogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, for the first time, we show an essential role for organellar Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in adipogenic regulation. The presence of calreticulin inhibits adipogenesis through its effects on Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis, causing the indirect regulation of crucial pathways affecting adipogenesis, such as the calcineurin and CaMKII pathways. Although the CaMKII pathway is important for adipogenic differentiation, the calcineurin pathway may be involved in other choices of fate of ES cells. Finally, we show that the expression of calreticulin is tightly regulated during adipogenesis, and any modification of this expression influences adipogenesis such that aberrant calreticulin expression may lead to a variety of cellular pathologies, including obesity and diabetes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and adipocyte differentiation</title><p>G45 <italic>crt<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> ES cells and the WT ES cell line (CGR8) were derived from J1 129/Sv mice.

Supernatants were precleared with protein A&#x02013;Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. Immunoprecipitation was performed with mouse anti-HA antibodies at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. DNA was purified and analyzed by PCR using the following primers: PPRE site 1, forward primer 5&#x02032;-TGTGTCTGAAGACAGCTACAGTG-3&#x02032; and reverse primer 5&#x02032;-GCAGCAGGAGAAAAGAAGAGAG-3&#x02032;; PPRE site 2, forward primer 5&#x02032;-CTCTATGGCCTGAACAACTGTG-3&#x02032; and reverse primer 5&#x02032;-TGGTCAGAGGGAAGAAGTAAGG-3&#x02032;</p></sec><sec><title>Calcineurin activity assay</title><p>Calcineurin activity assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fruman et al., 1992</xref>). In brief, a peptide corresponding to the regulatory domain of protein kinase A (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the substrate in an in vitro dephosphorylation assay (RII peptide). 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells were lysed in 50 ml hypotonic lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors. 20 ml of lysate was added to 5 mM &#x003b3;-[<sup>32</sup>P]&#x02013;labeled RII peptide. The reaction was performed for 20 min at 30&#x000b0;C in the presence of 0.5 mM okadaic acid with a total reaction volume of 60 ml. The released phosphate reported the activity of calcineurin and was expressed in picomoles of phosphate released per milligrams of total protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence and Nile red staining</title><p>Cells on coverslips were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. After washing (three times for 5 min) in PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in buffer containing 100 mM Pipes, pH 6.9, 1 mM EGTA, and 4% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol 8000 for 2 min, washed three times for 5 min in PBS, and incubated with goat polyclonal anti-PPAR&#x003b3;2 antibody (diluted 1:50 in PBS; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing three times for 5 min in PBS, the cells were incubated with the secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. The secondary antibody was FITC-conjugated donkey anti&#x02013;goat IgG(H&#x0002b;L) diluted 1:50 in PBS. The cells were then incubated with 0.2 mM ribonuclease A (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at room temperature to digest RNA and washed in PBS (three times for 5 min) followed by incubation with 1 &#x003bc;l/ml propidium iodide in PBS for 30 min to identify nuclei. For Nile red staining, the dye stock solution of 0.5 mg/ml in acetone was diluted in a glycerol/PBS mixture (0.05 ml of Nile red stock solution in 1 ml of 3:1 glycerol/PBS). Cells were fixed and permeabilized as for immunofluorescence and incubated with Nile red working solution for 10 min. After the final wash (three times for 5 min in PBS), the slides were mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (to prevent photobleaching; Dako). A confocal fluorescence microscope (MRC 600; Bio-Rad Laboratories) equipped with a 60/1.40 plan Apochromatic oil immersion objective (Nikon) and a krypton/argon laser was used for fluorescence imaging at room temperature. COMOS software (Bio-Rad Laboratories) was used for image acquisition.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Differences between mean values for different treatments were calculated using analysis of variance or two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test (where applicable) and were considered to be significant at P &#x0003c; 0.05 and P &#x0003c; 0.01.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows genomic configuration of the calreticulin gene.
