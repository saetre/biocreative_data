Endocrine therapies targeting the estrogen receptor are effective in breast cancer, but their success is limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>With the goal of gaining mechanistic insights into estrogen action and endocrine resistance, we classified estrogen-regulated genes by function, and determined the relationship between functionally-related genesets and the response to tamoxifen in breast cancer patients. Estrogen-responsive genes were identified by transcript profiling of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Pathway analysis based on functional annotation of these estrogen-regulated genes identified gene signatures with known or predicted roles in cell cycle control, cell growth (i.e. ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis), cell death/survival signaling and transcriptional regulation. Since inducible expression of c-Myc in antiestrogen-arrested cells can recapitulate many of the effects of estrogen on molecular endpoints related to cell cycle progression, the estrogen-regulated genes that were also targets of c-Myc were identified using cells inducibly expressing c-Myc. Selected genes classified as estrogen and c-Myc targets displayed similar levels of regulation by estrogen and c-Myc and were not estrogen-regulated in the presence of siMyc. Genes regulated by c-Myc accounted for 50&#x00025; of all acutely estrogen-regulated genes but comprised 85&#x00025; (110/129 genes) in the cell growth signature. siRNA-mediated inhibition of c-Myc induction impaired estrogen regulation of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis, consistent with the prediction that estrogen regulates cell growth principally via c-Myc. The &#x02018;cell cycle&#x02019;, &#x02018;cell growth&#x02019; and &#x02018;cell death&#x02019; gene signatures each identified patients with an attenuated response in a cohort of 246 tamoxifen-treated patients. In multivariate analysis the cell death signature was predictive independent of the cell cycle and cell growth signatures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These functionally-based gene signatures can stratify patients treated with tamoxifen into groups with differing outcome, and potentially identify distinct mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Among several advances that have contributed to the decreased mortality from breast cancer observed in the past decade, the routine use of adjuvant endocrine therapies directed at the estrogen-estrogen receptor (ER) pathway is a major contributor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Dellapasqua1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-StrasserWeippl1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, targeting the estrogen receptor pathway is a validated, effective, biologically-based therapy for breast cancer. However, the overall success of this therapeutic approach is limited by both intrinsic and acquired resistance. A significant proportion of patients with ER-positive tumors do not have sustained objective responses, and many who do initially respond subsequently relapse due to the acquisition of endocrine resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Ali1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Nicholson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Prospective identification of patients who are not good candidates for adjuvant endocrine therapy would substantially facilitate clinical decision-making. To address this need, several gene expression signatures that cosegregate with poor outcome in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer have been derived using gene expression profiling, prospectively-selected candidate genes or differentially-expressed estrogen-regulated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Loi1">&#x0005b;reviewed in 10&#x0005d;</xref>. A gene expression grade index (GGI) developed as a molecular correlate of histological grade also cosegregates with poor response to tamoxifen therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Loi2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. There is little overlap between the genes contained within these signatures, other than the frequent inclusion of genes involved in cell proliferation, and thus although potentially clinically useful, they offer limited insight into the molecular basis of endocrine resistance.</p><p>The biochemical and molecular basis of antiestrogen (tamoxifen) resistance has been the subject of intense investigation. Aberrations in ER expression and function, alterations in coactivator and corepressor expression, ligand-independent activation of ER via growth factor-mediated phosphorylation events, a switch from estrogen-driven cell-proliferation to EGFR/erbB2-driven proliferation and the overexpression of various signaling molecules, particularly the mitogen-activated protein kinases and various isoforms of protein kinase C, have all been implicated in endocrine resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Ali1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Nicholson1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with the idea that deregulation of estrogen target genes, particularly those that mediate cell proliferation and survival, is another potential mechanism of endocrine resistance, overexpression of the estrogen-targeted cell cycle regulatory molecules c-Myc and cyclin D1, which occurs at high frequency in the clinical setting, has been associated with altered sensitivity to endocrine therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Butt1">&#x0005b;reviewed in Ref. 12&#x0005d;</xref>. Inducible expression of these genes can over-ride antiestrogen-induced growth arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Prall1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and overexpression can modulate sensitivity to clinically-relevant antiestrogens in <italic>in vitro</italic> models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Butt1">&#x0005b;reviewed in Ref. 12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Since estrogen is a multifunctional hormone, we reasoned that the approach of seeking to identify a minimal gene set associated with adverse outcome in tamoxifen-treated patients and the binary nature of many of the resulting classifications might obscure some of the complexity of the underlying biology.

To this end, a series of clonal MCF-7 cell lines was developed that inducibly express c-Myc or c-Zip (a deletion mutant of c-Myc that lacks the N-terminal transactivation domains). Representative clones that had 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) and antiestrogen responses matched to those of the parental MCF-7 cells were chosen for further experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g001">Fig. 1A&#x00026;B</xref>). Zinc treatment resulted in increased c-Myc or c-Zip expression within 3 h, similar to the timing of E<sub>2</sub> induction of c-Myc (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Induction of c-Myc led to re-initiation of cell cycle progression and regulation of molecular endpoints that mimicked the effects of E<sub>2</sub>, but induction of c-Zip was ineffective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

We therefore selected a timepoint within the window of estrogen-dependent cell cycle progression, 6 h after estrogen treatment, and compared the gene expression profile generated after estrogen treatment with that following zinc induction of c-Myc or c-Zip. Initially, genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated following E<sub>2</sub> treatment compared with vehicle-treated cells were identified (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;799 genes, represented by 939 probesets, adjusted p&#x0003c;0.01 i.e. false discovery rate 1&#x00025;).

After 6 h E<sub>2</sub> or Zn treatment, cells were harvested and transcript profiling undertaken using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide microarrays. After normalisation and correction for multiple hypothesis testing, probesets that were significantly regulated in the same direction by estrogen or c-Myc (but not by c-Zip) were identified (adjusted <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01).

Those in the &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> and Myc&#x02019; category formed a cluster which was largely distinct from the cluster designated &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> not Myc&#x02019;. At the zinc concentration used for the microarray experiment, c-Myc expression after zinc induction was higher than after estrogen treatment, and consequently genes in the &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> and Myc&#x02019; category were more strongly regulated by c-Myc than by estrogen. The &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> not Myc&#x02019; cluster included the most highly-regulated probes and had an average relative expression of 0.97 after c-Myc induction. In contrast, the distribution of downregulated probes in the &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> not Myc&#x02019; category essentially overlapped with that of the probes in the &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> and Myc&#x02019; category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Databases of estrogen-responsive genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Tang1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and c-Myc targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Zeller1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> were used to give an indication of the proportion of the genes in each category that had been previously identified as either estrogen- or c-Myc-regulated. Almost 40&#x00025; of the probes from the &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> not Myc&#x02019; category that increased in expression were previously-documented estrogen targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), significantly more than the corresponding &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> and Myc&#x02019; probes (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9.86&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>, Fisher's exact test). A similarly high proportion of the probes in the &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> and Myc&#x02019; category that increased in expression were present in the Myc target gene database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), significantly more than in the &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> not Myc&#x02019; category (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.64&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup>), suggesting that this analysis identified many <italic>bona fide</italic> c-Myc targets that have not been previously described as estrogen targets. The presence of known c-Myc targets in the &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> not Myc&#x02019; categories might result, in part, from misclassification, but likely also reflects cell-type specificity in the response to c-Myc induction. For example, <italic>CCND1</italic> (cyclin D1), which is among the genes in the &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> not Myc&#x02019; category, is present in the c-Myc target gene database but does not increase after c-Myc induction in this experimental model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Prall1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p><p>If a c-Myc-dependent pathway is an integral part of the response to estrogen, the changes in expression of targets in the &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> and Myc&#x02019; category after estrogen treatment or zinc induction would be expected to be of similar magnitude, provided similar levels of c-Myc were achieved. To test this prediction, we adjusted the concentration of zinc so that the induction of c-Myc mRNA was similar to that after estrogen treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), and examined the expression of selected genes from the &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> and Myc&#x02019; category. The 5 genes examined all either increased (<italic>HSU79274, HSPC 111, DKC1, MKI67IP</italic>), or decreased (<italic>CDKN1A</italic>, encoding the CDK inhibitor p21<sup>WAF1/Cip1</sup>) in expression to a similar degree after E<sub>2</sub> treatment or zinc induction of c-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g002">Fig. 2B&#x02013;F</xref>). As a further test of the conclusion that these genes are estrogen regulated via an estrogen-mediated increase in c-Myc expression, MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were stimulated with E<sub>2</sub> in the presence of siRNAs directed at c-Myc (siMyc). The most effective of the siRNAs tested, siMyc-17, reduced the estrogen induction of c-Myc protein and mRNA at 6&#x02013;9 h from &#x0223c;5-fold to a statistically non-significant level of &#x0003c;2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g004">Fig. 4A&#x00026;B</xref> and data not shown). In the presence of siMyc, none of the genes from the &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> and Myc&#x02019; category tested (<italic>HSU79274, DKC1, MKI67IP</italic>), displayed significant induction after E<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g004">Fig. 4C&#x02013;E</xref>). In contrast two genes from the &#x02018;E<sub>2</sub> not Myc&#x02019; category, <italic>GREB1</italic> and <italic>CCND1</italic> (encoding cyclin D1), were both significantly induced by E<sub>2</sub> in either the presence or absence of siMyc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g004">Fig. 4F&#x00026;G</xref>), despite evidence that <italic>CCND1</italic> is a Myc target in other systems. More detailed examination of the regulation of <italic>HSPC 111</italic> showed that its induction by estrogen required ongoing protein synthesis, did not occur in the presence of siMyc, and was accompanied by recruitment of c-Myc to the <italic>HSPC 111</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Butt2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

The annotation of the &#x02018;cell cycle&#x02019; signature revealed a highly significant overrepresentation of genes involved in: DNA replication and DNA metabolism, e.g. several MCMs, PCNA, RFC2 and RFC4; cell cycle control, e.g. <italic>CCND1</italic> and <italic>CCNE2</italic>, encoding cyclins D1 and E2, respectively, and <italic>CDKN1A,</italic> the gene encoding p21<sup>Waf1/Cip1</sup>, which forms a central node in this network; and cancer, including breast cancer. The &#x02018;cell death&#x02019; signature was annotated as containing genes involved in cell death, apoptosis and survival. Cancer was also over-represented in this network. Interestingly, for this signature the functional annotations within cancer included invasion and migration as well as cell death and general oncogenic processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002987.s003">Table S3</xref>), and cell movement was significantly overrepresented overall. The &#x02018;transcriptional regulation&#x02019; signature included a number of nuclear receptor coregulators, and many of the genes have documented functional interactions with the estrogen receptor (<italic>ESR1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). The annotation of this network identified transcription and cancer as significantly over-represented, as was development of the mammary alveolus, albeit with a small number of genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002987.s003">Table S3</xref>).</p><p>The gene ontology classifications of estrogen-regulated genes and the processes represented by the Ingenuity networks displayed many overlapping categories. However, several processes linked by their importance in cell growth, i.e. the increase in cell mass that accompanies progress through the cell cycle, were amongst those most significantly over-represented in the gene ontology (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002987-t001">Table 1</xref>) but were not well-represented in the Ingenuity networks, i.e. rRNA processing, ribosome biogenesis and protein biosynthesis. This was likely because much of the current understanding of these processes is based on studies in model systems other than mammalian cells. We therefore extended our analysis by predicting likely interactions using the Human Interactome Map (HiMAP), which builds networks based on known protein-protein interactions in human cells and on predictions from interactions in model organisms including yeast, co-ordinate expression in a panel of human tissue samples, shared biological function and conserved protein-protein interaction domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Rhodes1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. A gene signature for &#x02018;cell growth&#x02019; was compiled from an initial small subnetwork identified by Ingenuity, together with genes that were in relevant gene ontology categories or encoded proteins that proteomic analysis has assigned to the nucleolus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Andersen1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Hinsby1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, and estrogen-regulated genes that were predicted by HiMAP to have direct connections to these genes. The network generated by HiMAP from this list of genes was redrawn using Ingenuity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>) and contained three major clusters that were largely composed of predicted, rather than known, interactions. Using the gene ontology classifications, data from proteomic analysis of the human ribosome biogenesis pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Hinsby1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> and annotation of the final network using Ingenuity, these clusters were identified as genes involved in protein synthesis or RNA post-transcriptional modification, particularly splicing, and components of the 90S pre-ribosomal complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002987.s002">Tables S2</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002987.s003">S3</xref>), consistent with the HiMAP prediction of functionally relevant interactions between these genes.</p><p>To gain potential insights into the role of c-Myc in estrogen-responsive biological processes, we determined what fraction of the genes in each signature was regulated by c-Myc in our experimental model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002987.s002">Table S2</xref>). In total the &#x02018;cell cycle&#x02019; gene signature contained 60 genes, of which 27 (45&#x00025;) were regulated by both estrogen and c-Myc. Similarly, of the &#x02018;transcriptional regulation&#x02019; signature 12 of 31 genes (39&#x00025;) were regulated by c-Myc. The proportion of genes in these two networks regulated by estrogen and c-Myc was comparable with the 50&#x00025; overall proportion (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.42 and 0.20, respectively, Fisher's exact test). However, genes regulated by both estrogen and c-Myc comprised only one-third of the total genes in the &#x02018;cell death&#x02019; network (19/55, i.e. 35&#x00025;), significantly different from the overall proportion (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.017). Conversely, the &#x02018;cell growth&#x02019; gene signature contained significantly more genes regulated by c-Myc (102/123, 83&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5.5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>). These data suggest that the degree to which estrogen regulation of cell cycle, cell growth and cell death is secondary to the induction of c-Myc varies significantly.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Role of c-Myc induction in estrogen stimulation of cell cycle progression and cell growth</title><p>Cell growth is necessary but not sufficient for S phase entry and the two processes are closely co-ordinated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-White1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Our pathway analysis indicated that estrogen may regulate cell growth principally via c-Myc. To test this prediction, we examined whether estrogen regulated cell growth in this model system. The first rate-limiting step in ribosome biogenesis is transcription of the 45S rRNA precursor, which is subsequently processed to yield rRNAs that are integral to the ribosomal subunits. The 5&#x02032; externally transcribed spacer (5&#x02032;ETS) of the 45S rRNA began to increase in abundance 6&#x02013;8 h after estrogen treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>), significantly preceding the initiation of DNA synthesis, which was first apparent after 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Similarly, total protein synthesis measured by &#x0005b;<sup>35</sup>S&#x0005d;-methionine incorporation was increased by 6&#x02013;9 h after estrogen treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). These endpoints were then measured in antiestrogen-arrested MCF-7 human breast cancer cells stimulated with E<sub>2</sub> in the presence ofsiMyc-17, which reduced the induction of c-Myc protein to less than 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Under these conditions, the increase in 5&#x02032;ETS levels was inhibited, as was estrogen induction of total protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>). Thus, estrogen activates ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in a c-Myc-dependent manner, as predicted by our pathway analysis.</p><fig id="pone-0002987-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002987.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Effect of RNAi-mediated knockdown of c-Myc on cell growth after estrogen treatment.</title><p>A, B: MCF-7 cells were growth arrested with 10 nM ICI 182780 for 48 h then treated with either 100 nM E<sub>2</sub> or vehicle (ethanol) (A) Abundance of the 5&#x02032;ETS of the 45S rRNA transcript was measured using qRT-PCR.

When the &#x02018;cell growth&#x02019; signature was subdivided into components representing RNA processing, ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis, each was individually prognostic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002987-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). Because the &#x02018;cell death&#x02019; signature contained some genes that also had roles in processes that might be expected to affect metastasis, i.e. cell migration and invasion, we assessed the prognostic ability of genes with a &#x02018;cell movement&#x02019; annotation compared with the remainder of the signature. The &#x02018;cell movement&#x02019; subgroup was predictive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002987-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). However, although for the remainder of the &#x02018;cell death&#x02019; signature the high risk and low risk groups diverged, this was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002987-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>).</p><p>The question of whether these signatures identified distinct groups of patients is important in relation to both their potential clinical utility and a better understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. There were strong correlations between the cell cycle and cell growth signatures (r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.653, p&#x0003c;0.01), but weaker associations between cell cycle and cell death (r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.326, p&#x0003c;0.01), or cell growth and cell death (r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.385, p&#x0003c;0.01). Consistent with the idea that the cell death signature might identify a distinct subset of patients, the discordance between classification on the basis of the cell cycle or cell death signatures was 42&#x00025;, compared with 27&#x00025; between the cell cycle and cell growth signatures. Furthermore, patients classified as low risk based on the &#x02018;cell death&#x02019; signature, but not those classified as high risk on this basis, could be separated into groups of differing outcome on the basis of the &#x02018;cell cycle&#x02019; signature (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.015 and 0.67, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002987-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>).

However, understanding the mechanisms underlying the physiological effects of this important hormone and how their deregulation impacts on sensitivity to therapies directed at the ER remains a significant challenge.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Role of c-Myc in estrogen action</title><p>By analysis based on functional annotation of acutely estrogen-regulated genes we have identified gene signatures that encompass four different aspects of estrogen action, and contain different proportions of c-Myc-responsive genes: cell cycle control, cell growth, cell death and transcriptional regulation. The proportion of human protein-coding genes that is c-Myc-responsive is estimated at 10&#x02013;15&#x00025; and many non-coding RNAs are also regulated by c-Myc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Adhikary1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, c-Myc and ER&#x003b1; binding sites co-localise near the transcription start site of a subset of estrogen-responsive genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Cheng1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Nonetheless, the observation that as many as half of estrogen-responsive genes are also c-Myc-responsive is striking and unexpected, and argues strongly for a critical role for c-Myc in estrogen action. This was revealed by our focus on the acute effects of E<sub>2</sub> and use of an experimental model designed to maximise sensitivity to the ability of E<sub>2</sub> to promote the G<sub>1</sub>-S phase transition, in contrast with previous analyses which have often been undertaken over longer timeframes or in experimental models with less sensitivity to effects on proliferation. The different contributions of c-Myc-responsive genes to the different estrogen-responsive signatures indicates that the role of c-Myc may be specific to some processes, rather than global.</p><p>The &#x02018;cell cycle&#x02019; network presented here integrates upstream cell cycle regulatory molecules with those more directly involved in DNA replication i.e. PCNA, Cdc6, and the MCMs. Recent evidence that c-Myc is associated with the pre-replication complex suggests one means by which estrogen could regulate DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-DominguezSola1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

Had this not already been known, our analysis would have suggested p21<sup>Waf1/Cip1</sup> as a strong candidate for further investigation, highlighting the ability of these functional pathways to provide mechanistic insights and suggesting that some of the hubs in other networks merit further investigation as mediators of estrogen action.</p><p>Like the &#x02018;cell cycle&#x02019; signature, the &#x02018;transcriptional regulation&#x02019; signature contained approximately equal proportions of c-Myc-regulated genes and genes unresponsive to c-Myc activation. Prominent in the &#x02018;transcriptional regulation&#x02019; network are a number of nuclear receptor coregulators (the coactivators NCOA1/SRC-1/RIP160, NCOA2/SRC-2/GRIP1, NCOA3/AIB1/SRC-3, NCOA7, ARNT, ARNT2 and the corepressor NRIP1/RP140), which play a central role in transcriptional activation by members of the nuclear receptor superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Lonard1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> and which were regulated in a manner consistent with the well-known ligand-activated downregulation of estrogen receptor signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Saceda1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, NCOA1, ARNT and ARNT2 and one of two probsets for NCOA3 were also significantly downregulated by c-Myc, suggesting that c-Myc-mediated repression may also contribute to this response.</p><p>Estrogen regulates both RNA and protein synthesis, an important physiological response that was the focus of much early work on estrogen action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Hamilton1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the molecular mechanisms for estrogen effects on cell growth remain largely unexplored. We show here that almost all of the acutely estrogen-regulated genes with roles in cell growth are also c-Myc targets, and that estrogen activation of rRNA synthesis and protein synthesis depends on c-Myc. The idea that estrogen regulates cell growth via c-Myc is supported by evidence that estrogen induction of c-Myc in the rodent uterus is not prevented by progesterone, which inhibits DNA synthesis but not growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Kirkland1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, and the known role of c-Myc in regulating cell growth in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-White1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Oskarsson1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Like the &#x02018;cell cycle&#x02019; network, the &#x02018;cell death&#x02019; network contains both effectors and upstream regulators.

The &#x02018;cell death&#x02019; signature also contains components of survival signaling pathways, e.g. receptor tyrosine kinases (IGF1R and Ret) and their effectors (IRS1, Jak1, Jak2) that are increased in response to estrogen treatment. The implications of transcriptional regulation of these signaling pathways has been much less well-studied than their regulation by protein-protein interactions and phosphorylation, but a co-ordinate increase in expression is likely to result in enhanced survival signaling. Estrogen suppression of apoptosis resulting from growth factor deprivation is c-Myc dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Rodrik1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> but genes regulated by c-Myc were under-represented in the &#x02018;cell death&#x02019; signature.

Whether the signatures identified here are specifically predictive of response to tamoxifen or might also be associated with poor response to other therapies remains to be determined. However, in contrast with previous analyses in breast cancer, we have distinguished cell cycle/cell growth, and cell survival signatures that are independent predictors of outcome in tamoxifen-treated patients.</p><p>A recent analysis of &#x02018;molecular concepts&#x02019; associated with progression of prostate cancer identified increased protein synthesis and enrichment at chromosome 8q, which includes <italic>MYC</italic> (8q24), as features distinguishing the precursor lesion prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) from benign epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Tomlins1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

In our analysis c-Myc-responsive genes predominated in the &#x02018;cell growth&#x02019; signature, which contains many of the most strongly c-Myc-regulated genes. The &#x02018;cell growth&#x02019; signature may therefore be a surrogate measure of deregulated c-Myc expression that identifies a subset of proliferative, endocrine-resistant breast cancers with distinct biology.</p><p>The poor outcome associated with the &#x02018;cell growth&#x02019; signature may reflect a specific resistance to endocrine therapies associated with deregulation of c-Myc. However, the &#x02018;wound signature&#x02019;, which is induced by co-ordinate amplification of <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>CSN5/JAB1/COPS5</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Adler1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, is predictive of a poor outcome in a cohort of patients with ER-positive cancers who were more commonly treated with chemotherapy than endocrine therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Fan1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that deregulation of c-Myc may result in resistance to multiple therapies.</p><p>The well-established role of estrogen in promoting cell survival suggests that increased apoptosis might be associated with a better clinical response to endocrine therapies. However, clinical studies addressing this question have often revealed conflicting data, perhaps because of inherent difficulties in accurately monitoring the dynamics of apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Butt3">&#x0005b;reviewed in 46&#x0005d;</xref>.

Consequently the likely effect of the observed changes in expression within the &#x02018;cell death&#x02019; signature is not clear. The dual role of a subset of genes within the signature in regulating invasion and motility provides another mechanism whereby their deregulation may impair response to endocrine therapies. For example, Bcl-2, which has functional interactions with many other genes within the signature, has been implicated in estrogen regulation of invasion downstream of RelB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Wang1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In summary, the main findings of this work are the predominance of c-Myc as a target of estrogen action, its specific role as a mediator of estrogen effects on cell growth, and the ability of functionally-based gene signatures to stratify patients treated with tamoxifen into groups with differing outcome, potentially identifying distinct mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance. This provides an opportunity to identify new therapeutic options for endocrine-resistant breast cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid construction and transfection</title><p>The plasmids p&#x00394;MT and p&#x00394;MT-Myc, which contain a metal-inducible metallothionein promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Daly1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> have been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Prall1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. p&#x00394;MT-c-Zip was constructed using the mouse c-Zip cDNA subcloned from KS c-Zip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002987-Mukherjee2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.

The log-rank <italic>P</italic> value for the Kaplan-Meier curve was generated after 500 permutations. To determine the predictive accuracy of each of the functional gene signatures compared with the clinical prognostic variables alone, two models were created for each signature&#x02014;one with clinical covariates only and one with the clinical covariates and the gene signature. The cross-validated Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank statistics for these models were generated after 500 permutations and the <italic>P</italic> value measures whether the expression data significantly adds to predictive accuracy compared with the clinical factors alone. This approach is preferable to a multivariate model which only compares prognostic effects and can be unstable due to multi-colinearity between variables in the model and random fluctuations in the data. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software package (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL) version 13.0. Each gene signature and tumor grade (1 vs. 2 vs. 3) were treated as continuous variables, while tumor size (&#x02264;2 cm vs. &#x0003e;2 cm), patient age (&#x02264;50 vs. &#x0003e;50 yrs) and nodal
