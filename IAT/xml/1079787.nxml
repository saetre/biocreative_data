The yeast protein Trf4p has been implicated in a quality control pathway that leads to the polyadenylation and subsequent exosome-mediated degradation of hypomethylated initiator tRNA<sup>Met</sup> (tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup>). Here we show that Trf4p is the catalytic subunit of a new poly(A) polymerase complex that contains Air1p or Air2p as potential RNA-binding subunits, as well as the putative RNA helicase Mtr4p. Comparison of native tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> with its in vitro transcribed unmodified counterpart revealed that the unmodified RNA was preferentially polyadenylated by affinity-purified Trf4 complex from yeast, as well as by complexes reconstituted from recombinant components. These results and additional experiments with other tRNA substrates suggested that the Trf4 complex can discriminate between native tRNAs and molecules that are incorrectly folded. Moreover, the polyadenylation activity of the Trf4 complex stimulated the degradation of unmodified tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> by nuclear exosome fractions in vitro. Degradation was most efficient when coupled to the polyadenylation activity of the Trf4 complex, indicating that the poly(A) tails serve as signals for the recruitment of the exosome. This polyadenylation-mediated RNA surveillance resembles the role of polyadenylation in bacterial RNA turnover.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A new molecular surveillance mechanism is uncovered in eukaryotes, in which incorrectly folded tRNAs are polyadenylated and then targeted for degradation</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The addition of a tract of poly(A) to the 3&#x02032; ends of most eukaryotic messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) is an important step in their processing.

Additional results from experiments with unmodified and native tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> and a mutant tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> believed to fold aberrantly, suggest that the Trf4 complex discriminates between correctly and incorrectly folded tRNAs. We also show that the degradation of unmodified tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> by nuclear exosome fractions is dependent on the polyadenylation activity of the Trf4 complex and is stimulated by the putative RNA helicase Mtr4p, which also copurifies with the Trf4 complex. Efficient digestion requires simultaneous polyadenylation by the Trf4 complex, suggesting that the poly(A) tails serve to activate the exosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trf4p is a Poly(A) Polymerase</title><p>Sequence alignments have indicated that Trf4p and Trf5p share several characteristic features with canonical poly(A) polymerases: a catalytic domain at the N-terminus with three conserved aspartate residues, a conserved strand loop motif as found in other template-independent polyribonucleotide polymerases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;, and a central domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The activity of the Trf4 complex was completely abolished when two of the three highly conserved aspartate residues at positions 236 and 238 in the predicted catalytic domain of Trf4p were mutated to alanines (DADA-TAP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes 8&#x02013;10). The loss of activity was due to the mutations and not to the instability of the mutant protein because both proteins were expressed at similar levels (data not shown). The reaction catalyzed by Trf4-TAP required ATP, and no activity was detected in the presence of GTP, CTP, or UTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 6&#x02013;9). In a quantitative assay with oligo(A)<sub>15</sub> as primer (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b34">34</xref>&#x0005d;; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), the specific activity of the Trf4 complex was 5.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> pmol/mg/min. This was similar to the specific activity (5.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> pmol/mg/min) of recombinant Pap1p measured in parallel. Moreover, incorporation of adenosine monophosphate was strictly dependent on a single-stranded RNA primer (data not shown). These results identified Trf4p as the catalytic component responsible for the polyadenylation activity associated with the purified Trf4 complex.

The Air1-TAP complex contained lower amounts of Trf4p than the other complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). This was reflected by a lower polyadenylation activity of Air1-TAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Because Trf5p was not found in the Trf4p-TAP complex, we also purified a TAP-tagged version of Trf5p.

It was therefore concluded that in vitro transcribed tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> could adopt an editing-competent tertiary structure in the absence of modifications. We thus employed unmodified wild-type tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, the &#x00394;U13 mutant, and native tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> as substrates for the Trf4 complex. Most of the mutated tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> was polyadenylated, whereas only little activity was observed with the unmodified wild-type tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> and none with native tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Taken together, these results suggest that correctly folded tRNAs are poor substrates for the Trf4 complex, whereas aberrantly folded RNAs are efficiently polyadenylated.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Trf4p Is a Bipartite Poly(A) Polymerase That Can Be Reconstituted from Recombinant Components</title><p>In order to test which of the proteins identified in the Trf4 complex are required for PAP activity, we aimed to reconstitute the activity from recombinant proteins. Because the recombinant Trf4 protein was insoluble when expressed in <italic>E. coli,</italic> a baculovirus expression system was used to isolate Trf4p from insect cells (Trf4-bac). The affinity-purified Trf4-bac alone showed no poladenylation activity on unmodified tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 5&#x02013;7). However, polyadenylation was obtained by combining Trf4-bac with either recombinant Air1p or Air2p or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 8&#x02013;16). In these assays, 20 ng of Trf4-bac was mixed with 0.5, 3, or 15 ng of recombinant Air1p (Air1) and/or recombinant Air2p (Air2). The simultaneous addition of both Air1p and Air2p proteins led to the formation of longer poly(A) tails than in reactions containing a single Air protein. This was most likely due to the higher protein concentration in the presence of both proteins. The resulting activities were similar to that of Trf4p-TAP isolated from yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g005">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 2&#x02013;4). Moreover, the activity of the reconstituted complex was specific for unmodified tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> because no significant activity was seen with native tRNA as a substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). In a control experiment, the recombinant mutant Trf4p (DADA-bac) containing the same amino acid changes as the double aspartate mutant described above had no polyadenylation activity on either tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup>, even in the presence of recombinant Air1p and Air2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g005">5</xref>D, lanes 2&#x02013;7).

The fraction of nuclear exosome was prepared by affinity purification of the TAP-tagged Rrp6 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>), an exonuclease exclusively associated with the nuclear and not the cytoplasmic form of the exosome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d;. First, we tested the effect of partially purified Rrp6p-TAP on unmodified tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>C). The Rrp6p-TAP complex showed weak exonuclease activity on this RNA, as indicated by the generation of digestion intermediates and mononucleotide degradation products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>C, lanes 2&#x02013;5). This low activity depended on the presence of ATP in the assay (compare lanes 2&#x02013;5 with 6&#x02013;9). Most gel lanes showed a labeled band of about 15 nucleotides. We assumed that these molecules resulted from spontaneous cleavage of a small portion of the RNA.</p><p>The effect of the Trf4 complex on the activity of the exosome was examined in coupled exosome/polyadenylation assays. Unmodified tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> was pre-incubated with Rrp6-TAP for 30 min. By the end of this time period, a very low amount of degradation products had appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, lane 2). Addition of Trf4-TAP resulted in a transient appearance of molecules with short poly(A) tails after 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, lane 3). The extended molecules decreased after this time and had essentially disappeared after 60 min. The decrease of full-length and elongated tRNAs was accompanied by the formation of short degradation products, the majority of which were dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, lanes 3&#x02013;6). Because the RNA substrate was labeled at its 5&#x02032; end, the accumulation of dinucleotides indicated that the degradation activity occurred in the 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; direction. This is typical for the nucleases of the exosome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b41">41</xref>&#x0005d;. The direction of digestion was further confirmed with 3&#x02032; end labeled polyadenylated tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> as substrate. Incubation with Rrp6-TAP resulted in the rapid production of labeled mononucleotides and the concomitant disappearance of the precursors without any detectable intermediates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg003">Figure S3</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;6). In a control experiment where only buffer was added to Rrp6-TAP fractions, no polyadenylation and no significant degradation of tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, lanes 11&#x02013;14). The possibility that the low amount of degradation observed in the buffer control could be caused by contaminating Trf4-TAP or by copurifying Mtr4p was tested by Western blotting. We could detect no Trf4p and only traces of Mtr4p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). Stimulation of the exosome by the Trf4-TAP complex required the latter's polyadenylation activity because no short degradation products accumulated after the addition of DADA-TAP complexes to Rrp6-TAP eluates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, lanes 7&#x02013;10). Very similar results were obtained by first polyadenylating tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> with Trf4-TAP and adding Rrp6-TAP in a second step. Almost all the RNA was processed to low molecular weight degradation products within 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 3&#x02013;6). The experiment showed that adding longer poly(A) tails to the tRNA prior to starting the coupled reaction did not change the kinetics of the subsequent degradation. In a control experiment, assay buffer was added instead of the exosome fraction. In this case Trf4-TAP continued to elongate the poly(A) tails, which reached an average length of 60&#x02013;70 nucleotides after 90 min and essentially no degradation was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 7&#x02013;10). The kinetics of the coupled reactions suggested a processive mode of digestion because only low amounts of partially degraded RNA molecules were generated during the time course.</p><p>We then examined the influence of the putative RNA helicase Mtr4p that copurified with the Trf4 complex on the efficiency of digestion by the exosome. We had found previously that the interaction between Trf4p-TAP and Mtr4p could be disrupted by washing the affinity columns with 1 M NaCl prior to elution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg004">Figure S4</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). Most likely, the Mtr4p-depleted Trf4-TAP still contained the Air proteins because the fractions retained full PAP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, lanes 7&#x02013;10). In addition, the interaction of the Air proteins with Trf4p was stable upon high-salt treatment of TAP-tagged Air1 or Air2 complexes (data not shown). We used salt-washed eluates of Trf4p lacking Mtr4p to pre-adenylate the tRNA substrate and for subsequent coupled polyadenylation/exosome assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). Addition of the Rrp6 complexes resulted in the complete removal of the poly(A) tails with time, but the body of the tRNA was not degraded and no significant amounts of small digestion products appeared (compare lanes 3&#x02013;6 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g006">Figure 6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g006">6</xref>C). As in the previous experiment, the poly(A) tails continued to grow in the absence of the exosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, lanes 7&#x02013;10). These results indicate that Mtr4p is required for the degradation of the tRNA body and support the idea that Mtr4p might function as an RNA helicase to remove the highly ordered tRNA structure.</p><p>To test whether the presence of a poly(A) tail is sufficient to mediate tRNA degradation we carried out uncoupled exosome assays with pre-adenylated tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup>. Incubation of such poly(A)-tRNA with Rrp6-TAP resulted in removal of the poly(A) tails only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g007">Figure 7</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;5). Complete degradation required the combined action of Rrp6-TAP and Trf4-TAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g007">Figure 7</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;9). The combination of Rrp6-TAP and mutant Trf4 complex (DADA-TAP) generated only small amounts of dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g007">Figure 7</xref>, lanes 10&#x02013;13). This likely reflected a mild stimulation of the exosome by Mtr4p present in DADA-TAP, as detected by Western blotting (data not shown). This experiment showed that the addition of a poly(A) tail is not sufficient for complete degradation of tRNA by Rrp6 complex in the absence of Trf4-PAP activity. As in the previous experiments, Trf4-TAP alone had no nuclease activity above background and elongated the pre-adenylated tRNA during the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g007">Figure 7</xref>, lanes 14&#x02013;17).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Trf4p Is the Catalytic Subunit of a New Heteromeric Yeast Poly(A) Polymerase</title><p>Athough a number of new eukaryotic poly(A) polymerases have been discovered in recent years, the functions of most of them are still unknown. Here we describe the properties of Trf4p, the second poly(A) polymerase of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content>.

However, in contrast to the complex multiprotein machinery processing pre-mRNAs associated with canonical yeast Pap1p, Trf4p is part of a small complex in vivo and is capable of polyadenylating tRNAs, products of RNA polymerase III. Lastly, the poly(A) tails made by the Trf4 complex primarily serve to initiate RNA degradation.</p><p>The minimal active Trf4-PAP consists of the catalytic subunit Trf4p and either Air1p or Air2p. This minimal complex interacts with Mtr4p, which functionally and physically connects the Trf4-PAP to the nuclear exosome. Although we have identified the Trf4p as the catalytic subunit of the Trf4 complex, the protein is inactive by itself. Polyadenylation activity could be reconstituted by combining recombinant Trf4p and Air1p or Air2p. The Air proteins contain five tandemly arranged zinc knuckles of the CCHC type. Zinc knuckle motifs have been implicated in RNA binding based on mutational and structural studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b44">44</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore suggest that Air1p and Air2p are RNA-binding subunits of the Trf4 complex. This would explain why the addition of recombinant Air1p or Air2p confers activity to the Trf4p subunit, which lacks a recognizable RNA-binding domain. Such a bipartite composition resembles the heterodimeric cytoplasmic PAP of <italic>C. elegans,</italic> in which the GLD-2 protein carries the catalytic activity and GLD-3 is believed to contribute the RNA-binding function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, except for an extremely inefficient extension of an oligo(A)<sub>15</sub> primer, no other RNA substrate has been identified until now. Because Trf5p did not copurify with Trf4-TAP, it is likely that it is assembled into a separate complex.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>The Trf4 Complex May Recognize Structural Features of Misfolded tRNAs</title><p>We have shown that the Trf4 complex exclusively polyadenylates unmodified and not native tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup>. This raised the question of how the Trf4 complex could distinguish between the two otherwise identical RNAs. Residue m<sup>1</sup>A58 has been proposed to be particularly important for specifying a tertiary substructure unique to initiator tRNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b46">46</xref>&#x0005d;. The methylation on a Watson&#x02013;Crick site forces m<sup>1</sup>A58 to form a symmetric Hoogsteen pair with A54, which promotes the extrusion of A59 and A60 of the loop by stacking with the last base pair of the T-stem (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030189-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). This conformation of the T-loop induces the specific interactions between the D- and T-loops that are necessary to stabilize the tRNA's tertiary structure &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b46">46</xref>&#x0005d;. This may explain why tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> is particularly sensitive to the absence of the methyl group on residue A58 compared to other tRNAs containing m<sup>1</sup>A58 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b46">46</xref>&#x0005d;. The lack of this methyl group presumably results in a change of the overall shape of the tRNA and a less compact conformation of the T- and D-hairpins. Exposed stem-loops of the hypomethylated tRNA could serve as recognition elements for the Trf4 complex. This model predicts that the Trf4 complex monitors structural features and not the modification state of the tRNAs. Aberrant folding of the tRNA is recognized and leads to the selective activation of the polyadenylation reaction. This idea is further supported by our results obtained with alanine tRNAs. These tRNAs are thought to fold correctly without the need for modifications &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b39">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Accordingly, both unmodified and native wild-type tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> were poor substrates for the Trf4 complex. In contrast, the &#x00394;U13 mutant was polyadenylated very efficiently, presumably because of its altered tertiary structure.</p><p>While finding this model attractive, we realize that experimental proof will require much further work. Probing the structural features of the different forms of tRNAs by chemical and enzymatic methods may help to elucidate the mechanism of RNA recognition. Ultimate proof should be obtained by determining the structure of RNA&#x02013;protein complexes. The reconstituted recombinant Trf4 complexes showed the same preference for unmodified tRNA substrates as found with Trf4p-TAP from yeast. It is surprising that the substrate preference for unmodified tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> could be provided either by Air1p or by Air2p. We assume that Trf4p can form two different complexes containing Air1p or Air2p as alternative subunits. The prediction that the Air proteins are the RNA-binding subunits of Trf4-PAP implies that they not only contribute the RNA-binding functions but also the differential substrate recognition. Future analysis of the RNA-binding properties and the kinetic parameters of the Trf4-catalyzed reaction should help to confirm this prediction and elucidate the mechanism of substrate recognition.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>The Trf4 Complex Stimulates the Nuclear Exosome In Vitro</title><p>We have shown that the polyadenylation activity of the Trf4 complex stimulates the activity of the exosome on unmodified tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> in vitro. In agreement with previous work &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b41">41</xref>&#x0005d;, the nuclear exosome complex purified from yeast had very low activity on its own. It has been proposed that the activation of the exosome requires additional factors (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d;). Because Trf4 complexes contain Mtr4p, it is reasonable to assume that this protein mediates the stimulation by attracting the exosome to the tRNA-bound Trf4 complex. As shown here, Mtr4p is needed for the exosome to digest through the structured regions of the tRNA substrates. However, Mtr4p alone (data not shown) or provided by the complex of mutant DADA-TAP was not sufficient to promote tRNA degradation<italic>.</italic> Instead, we demonstrated that the activation of the exosome completely depended on both the polyadenylation activity of the Trf4 complex as well as on the presence of Mtr4p. Moreover, the last experiment implied that complete degradation of the RNA needs the cooperative activity of both the Trf4 and the Rrp6 complexes. This interplay may involve continuous cycles of poly(A) addition and removal before the exosome moves into the structured parts of the tRNA substrates.</p><p>The mechanism of the degradation of unmodified yeast tRNA in vitro described above and the model proposed by Kadaba and coworkers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b25">25</xref>&#x0005d; is similar to the quality control mechanism disposing of aberrant tRNAs and the pathways of mRNA turnover in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b47">47</xref>&#x0005d;. In eubacteria, tRNA surveillance also depends on polyadenylation and on subsequent degradation by 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; exonucleases, components of the degradosome. Furthermore, many of the eukaryotic exosome components are related to the enzymes of the bacterial degradosome (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b49">49</xref>&#x0005d;). We speculate that the prokaryotic paradigm of PAP-mediated RNA turnover represents the ancient role of polyadenylation and that the stabilization function of poly(A) tails evolved as a consequence of the compartmentalization during the evolution of eukaryotic cells. The fact that Trf4-PAP-mediated polyadenylation resembles the system operating in prokaryotes and that homologs of Trf4p can be identified in all eukaryotic lineages (S. V., unpublished data) implies that the two polyadenylation pathways operate simultaneously in extant eukaryotes.</p><p>Moreover, it has been shown that under certain conditions exosome-processed precursors to many mRNAs and stable RNAs accumulate as polyadenylated molecules &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030189-b50">50</xref>&#x0005d;. It has been suggested that this polyadenylation requires the canonical nuclear Pap1p; even so, the reactions occur independent of the pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation machinery.
