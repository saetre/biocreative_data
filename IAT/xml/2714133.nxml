Neurotrophins (nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and the neurotrophins NT-3 and NT-4) constitute a family of growth factors essential for the development, proliferation, differentiation, and survival of neuronal as well as various non-neuronal cells. Neurotrophins bind to their specific high-affinity receptors tyrosine kinase (trk) A (NGF), trkB (BDNF, NT-4), and trkC (NT-3), and to one low-affinity receptor p75 (or NGFRp75) that binds to all ligands. This p75 receptor is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In particular, the NGF-trkA/p75 axis arouses increasing interest due to its role in chronic inflammatory arthritis in which a pathogenic function of this system has been postulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Using immunohistochemistry, we previously performed a detailed analysis on the synovial expression of neurotrophins showing convincingly high levels of both the trkA and the p75 NGF receptors in peripheral synovitis of patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). Their expression correlated with signs of inflammation and was modulated by effective treatment with anti-TNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, apart from BDNF we were unable to demonstrate the presence of the ligands at the protein level. Accordingly, this study was designed to assess the expression of NGF and all other known neurotrophic ligands (BDNF, NT-3, NT-4), as well as their receptors (trkA, NGFRp75, trkB, trkC), in order to provide evidence that all actors of this system are present and actively upregulated in the inflamed synovial compartment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Synovial fluid (SF) samples were collected from nine patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria and from 16 patients with SpA fulfilling the European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group classification criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Also, seven patients with osteoarthritis (OA) served as non-inflammatory controls. All patients had active synovitis of the knee.

The ST data were compared with each other. PCR data were obtained as cycle threshold (Ct) values. The Ct value is defined as the cycle with a fluorescence intensity significantly above the background fluorescence but within the exponential phase of the amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The mean of two Ct measurements of one sample was calculated for both the given target gene and the G3PDH gene. Delta Ct was determined as the mean of the duplicate Ct values for the target gene subtracted by the mean of the duplicate Ct values for the G3PDH gene. For each target gene, delta Ct measurements were performed separately for both the SF samples and the healthy PBMC. The delta delta Ct method represents the difference between the two cell types for a given target gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

SFMC were harvested from the interphase and washed twice at 1000 g and 300 g, respectively. The cells were finally resuspended in PBS/BSA and stained for surface markers (CD3 PerCP, clone SK7; CD14 FITC, Leu-M3; CD56 APC, NCAM 16.2; all from Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) for 20 minutes. After two washes with PBS/BSA (300 g/three minutes) the cells were fixed for 10 minutes at room temperature in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then washed once and resuspended in saponin buffer (PBS supplemented with 5 mM HEPES and 0.1% saponin) in order to perforate the cell membranes. Subsequently, aliquots were stained with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against NGF (biotinylated anti-human &#x003b2;-NGF, catalogue number BAF256; R&#x00026;D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Unspecific binding of the mAb via Fc-receptors was discriminated by adding human IgG solution (Octagam; Octapharma, Langenfeld, Germany).

Concomitant staining of cell surface markers and intracellular NGF revealed the presence of NGF in T lymphocytes (CD3+) and monocytes (CD14+). In contrast, B lymphocytes (CD19+) and nearly all natural killer cells (CD16+) were NGF negative in patients as well as in healthy controls. In both the SpA and the RA group, percentages of NGF expressing T lymphocytes and monocytes were considerably higher as compared with healthy controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). As we did notice clear mRNA expression for NGF not only in SF but also in ST, we additionally investigated the production of NGF by FLS. <italic>In vitro </italic>cultured FLS from RA as well as SpA did not secrete detectable levels of NGF, even upon stimulation with various proinflammatory cytokines (data not shown).

Focusing on the NGF/trkA-p75 axis in our own and other work, we could previously demonstrate high trkA and p75 NGF receptor expression at the protein level in the inflamed ST in peripheral SpA synovitis. This expression was correlated with inflammatory disease activity and was downregulated by TNF-blocking treatment indicating that their expression is not constitutive but actively modulated in inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the high-affinity receptors trkB and trkC as well as the ligands NGF, NT-3, and NT-4 were expressed in the minority of patients or not detectable by immunohistochemistry.</p><p>In order to investigate the NGF/trkA-p75 axis as well as all other neurotrophic ligands and receptors at the transcript level, we used quantitative real-time RT-PCR to determine their expression in a larger panel of SpA and RA patients with active peripheral synovitis of the knee. Our data confirm the high expression of both the trkA and p75 NGF receptors at the transcript level in the synovial compartment of SpA and RA patients. Of note, we now provide evidence that the NGF ligand is also expressed in the SF and tissue biopsy samples of peripheral synovitis indicating that this system is active in chronic inflammatory arthritis. However, we need to state, that the high NGF transcript expression is in contrast to our previous ELISA data in SF samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This discrepancy between mRNA and protein expression has been reported earlier in studies on brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Reasons for this phenomenon might involve post-transcriptional modifications of NGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We also can not exclude technical reasons such as the NGF antibody used for the previous quantitative immunoassay.</p><p>The cellular source of NGF in humans has been investigated in several studies. Under unstimulated conditions, NGF is produced mainly by CD4+ T and B lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Under inflammatory conditions such as allergy and arthritis, NGF can be produced, stored, and released by eosinophils, mast cells, lymphocytes, and synovial fibroblasts, as well as monocytes and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Using intracellular FACS analysis, we could demonstrate the presence of the NGF protein in the two inflammatory arthritis groups on both CD3+ and CD14+ cells, that is, T lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages, which are known to be involved in the major pathways of both SpA and RA. However, ST-derived FLS do not seem to produce NGF as measured by ELISA. This finding might indicate the mere pro-inflammatory potential of NGF as opposed to factors released by fibroblasts, which are predominantly involved in structural damage. On the other hand, we can not definitely rule out the production of NGF by FLS. One explanation would be, that FLS loose their ability to produce NGF when cultured over three passages <italic>in vitro</italic>. Another explanation would be that NGF is produced but not secreted, at least not in large amounts. Nevertheless, FLS are most likely one of the targets of NGF.</p><p>To date, the functional role of neurotrophins in inflammatory joint disorders is unclear. A pathogenic role for the NGF/trkA-p75 axis and other neurotrophins has been postulated for airway inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], atopic dermatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In inflammatory syndromes, NGF has been attributed to upregulating TNF-alpha, promoting the differentiation of B cells to plasma cells, enhancing chemotaxis and production of superoxide by neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. NGF is also involved in humoral immune responses by acting as an autocrine survival factor maintaining the viability of memory B-cells and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. NGF and its receptors have also tissue remodeling capacities exerting a strong fibrotic stimulus on skin and lung fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Upon binding to trkA, NGF induces its auto-phosphorylation and subsequently the activation of both phospholipase PLC&#x003b3; and protein kinase C, which in turn activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway involving the c-jun N-terminal, the p38, and the extracellular-regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) all of which have been identified in arthritis as well. Interestingly, the wnt proteins, which have been described as regulating neurotrophin expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], have recently also been found to play a pathogenic role in spondyloarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, NGF has been identified as a proangiogenic factor, another significant pathogenic pathway in chronic inflammatory arthritis such as SpA and RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, this comprehensive analysis demonstrates the expression of the pleiotropic NGF and its two receptors in peripheral synovitis of SpA and RA. The knowledge of neurotrophin expression on cells from the inflamed synovial compartment in arthritis patients adds to the potential evaluation of pathogenic mechanisms and the development of new therapeutic strategies (e.g. the pharmacological blockade of the NGF receptor and their signaling pathway by using receptor antagonists). Our findings prompt further functional as well as clinical studies on the role of neurotrophins and their therapeutic potential in arthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BDNF: brain-derived growth factor; BSA: bovine serum albumin; Ct: cycle threshold; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FACS: fluorescence-activated cell sorter; FCS: fetal calf serum; FLS: fibroblast-like synoviocytes; G3PDH: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; mAb: monoclonal antibody; NGF: nerve growth factor; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; NT: neurotrophin; OA: osteoarthritis; PBMC: peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; RT-PCR: reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; SD: standard deviation; SpA: spondyloarthritis; SF: synovial fluid; SFMC: synovial fluid mononuclear cells; ST: synovial tissue; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; trk: tyrosine kinase.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CB performed the RT-PCR experiments, the analysis of the data, and drafted the manuscript.
