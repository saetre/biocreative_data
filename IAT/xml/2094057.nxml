Additionally, this complex forms part of a nuclear surveillance network where it acts to degrade any aberrantly processed mRNAs in the nucleus. The exosome complex has been implicated in the biogenesis pathway of general messenger RNAs through its interaction with the 3&#x02032;-end processing machinery. During the cell cycle, yeast histone mRNAs accumulate in the S-phase and are rapidly degraded as cells enter the G2-phase. To determine if the exosome contributes to the cyclic turnover of yeast histone mRNAs, we examined the pattern of accumulation of &#x02018;HTB1&#x02019; mRNA during the cell cycle in a deletion strain of &#x02018;RRP6&#x02019;, a component of the nuclear exosome. Our results show that cells lacking Rrp6p continue to accumulate HTB1 mRNA as the cell cycle proceeds. This continued accumulation appears to result from a delay in exit from S-phase in <italic>rrp6</italic> cells. The accumulation of HTB1 mRNA in <italic>rrp6</italic> cells is influenced by the interaction of the nuclear exosome with the 3&#x02032;-end processing machinery although there is no evidence for differential regulation of histone mRNA 3&#x02032;-end processing during the yeast cell cycle.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Histones are a highly conserved group of DNA-binding proteins required for the condensation of DNA in the eukaryotic nucleus. Coordinated regulation is required to ensure stoichiometric <italic>de nov</italic>o production of the core histones in a time frame within the cell cycle coincident with DNA replication. The majority of histones are therefore regulated in a cell cycle manner and are termed replication-dependent histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). During S-phase of the cell cycle there is an accumulation of histone mRNAs, which are then rapidly degraded upon entry into G2. Regulation of histone mRNA levels results from control of histone gene transcription, mRNA 3&#x02032;-end formation and mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>).</p><p>In higher eukaryotes, replication-dependent histone mRNAs are non-polyadenylated and the formation of the 3&#x02032;-ends of the mRNAs contributes to their accumulation during the S-phase of the cell cycle. The 3&#x02032;-ends of the mRNAs are defined by a highly conserved stem-loop (S-L) structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and a loosely defined purine-rich element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) that lie immediately upstream and downstream of the 3&#x02032;-end cleavage sites, respectively. A number of proteins including a stem-loop-binding protein (SLBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and a 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonuclease (h3&#x02032;exo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) interact with the S-L structure while the U7 snRNP interacts with the downstream element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Communication between the S-L and the downstream element is mediated by a zinc-finger protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that components of the general mRNA 3&#x02032;-end cleavage and polyadenylation machinery are also required for metazoan histone mRNA 3&#x02032;-end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The latter finding provides the first indication that common molecular machinery is involved in the processing of both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated mRNAs.</p><p>Histone mRNA biogenesis is also cell cycle regulated in lower eukaryotes, such as fungi and protozoans, however, here the 3&#x02032;-ends of histone mRNAs are polyadenylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Both transcription and post-transcription events contribute to the accumulation of histone mRNAs in S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Currently, little is known regarding the contribution of the individual steps in mRNA biogenesis towards the cell cycle accumulation pattern of histone mRNAs in lower eukaryotes. In a previous study, we have identified a purine-rich region, termed the distal downstream element (DDE), which lies &#x0223c;100 nt downstream of the 3&#x02032;-end cleavage sites for the H2B-encoding mRNA, HTB1. Using a cell cycle-regulated chimera gene, neo-HTB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), which contains the 3&#x02032; UTR, 3&#x02032;-end cleavage sites and downstream sequences of the HTB1 gene fused to an open reading frame of a neomycin phosphotransferase gene, we showed that mutations in the DDE appear to prevent the cell cycle-dependent degradation of neo-HTB1, leading to its accumulation in G2-phase of the cell cycle. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The location of the DDE suggested that aberrant transcription termination might contribute to this effect although it is not clear how this could lead to transcript accumulation during the cell cycle.</p><p>It has been known for sometime that the process of mRNA 3&#x02032;-end cleavage and polyadenylation is tightly coupled to transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23 B24">20&#x02013;24</xref>). Mutations in signal sequences on the primary transcript that control 3&#x02032;-end cleavage and polyadenylation can reduce transcription termination efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Conversely, null mutations in genes coding for certain cleavage/polyadenylation factors including the components of cleavage factor IA (CFIA), Rna14p, Rna15p and Pcf11p, result in the disruption of both 3&#x02032;-end processing and transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) leading to the accumulation of unprocessed read-through transcripts. These unprocessed transcripts are substrates for the nuclear exosome, a multi-subunit complex of 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), which rapidly degrades the transcripts in a process referred to as nuclear surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Surprisingly, if the nuclear exosome component Rrp6p is deleted in a strain that also has inactive Rna14p or Rna15p, functional mRNAs can be produced from unprocessed &#x02018;read-through&#x02019; transcripts by a &#x02018;chewing back mechanism&#x02019; mediated by the core exosome, followed by polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). This observation has led to suggestions that this redundant function of the nuclear exosome may play a physiological role in regulating the abundance of specific mRNAs under certain conditions. There is evidence to show that the nuclear exosome component Rrp6 is required for the degradation of normal mRNAs that are retained in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and for the autoregulation of specific mRNAs such as Nab2 and Nrd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its role in nuclear surveillance, the nuclear exosome is required for the processing of many stable and unstable RNAs in the nucleus such as rRNAs, snoRNAs and snRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Processing and/or degradation of these pre-RNAs requires an initial polyadenylation of the substrates, mediated by a complex consisting of the PolyA polymerases Trf4 and Trf5, the putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase, Mtr4p/Dob1p and zinc knuckle-binding proteins, Air1/2p, referred to as TRAMP. The polyadenylated substrates are subsequently degraded by the nuclear exosome. Recently, Reis and Campbell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) have shown that loss of Trf4/5p or Rrp6p results in elevated levels of histone mRNAs in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> suggesting that this may be a preferred pathway for histone mRNA degradation.</p><p>To further explore the links between 3&#x02032;-end processing, transcription termination and the nuclear exosome in regulating histone mRNAs levels, we have examined the role of a number of RNA processing factors and the unique component of the nuclear exosome, Rrp6p, in the biogenesis of histone mRNAs. Our results show that the components of CFIA, Rna14p, Rna15p and Pcf11p are required for the 3&#x02032;-end cleavage and proper termination of HTB1 mRNA and in the <italic>rna14</italic>/&#x025b5;<italic>rrp6</italic> double mutant, steady-state levels of functional polyadenylated HTB1 mRNA are restored to near wild-type levels. Furthermore, in the absence of Rrp6p (&#x025b5;<italic>rrp6</italic>), the normal pattern of HTB1 mRNA accumulation in the S-phase is disrupted. Flow cytometry analysis indicates that deletion of <italic>rrp6</italic> leads to a prolonged S-phase and this leads to HTB1 mRNA accumulation. The continued accumulation of HTB1 mRNA in <italic>rrp6</italic> cells is influenced by the interaction of the nuclear exosome with the 3&#x02032;-end processing machinery. We propose a model to explain the role of the nuclear exosome in the cell cycle regulation of histone mRNAs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

The reduction in steady-state levels of mRNAs is consistent with the known phenotype of CFIA mutants and reflects the rapid turnover of unprocessed transcripts by the nuclear exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).

The neo-HTB1 transcripts produced in the <italic>rrp6</italic> and <italic>rna14</italic>/<italic>rrp</italic> strains are exported and can produce a functional neomycin phosphotransferase protein as observed by the growth on G418 plates, while under the same conditions, no functional protein is produced in <italic>rna14</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C).

This reflects the general instability of neo-HTB1 in a number of WT strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> at temperatures greater than 30&#x000b0;C (Canavan,R., unpublished data).

Specifically, we previously observed that levels of neo-HTB1 mRNA were reduced in asynchronous cells in the mutant pSAC20 while its accumulation pattern during the cell cycle is altered in mutant pSAC21 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A for mutated bases). The steady-state levels of neo-HTB1 were unchanged in the mutant pSAC15 in asynchronous cells (Campbell and Bond, unpublished data). <italic>In vitro</italic> transcription run off studies revealed that the DDE lies in the region where transcription termination occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). This led us to speculate that the DDE region may influence the steady-state levels of neo-HTB1 mRNA through its interaction with the 3&#x02032;-end processing machinery. To examine this possibility, the levels of the mutant neo-HTB1 mRNAs transcribed from the mutants pSAC20, pSAC21 and pSAC15 were examined in the single mutants <italic>rna14</italic>-3 and <italic>&#x00394;</italic><italic>rrp6</italic> and in the double mutant <italic>rna14-3</italic>/&#x00394;<italic>rrp6</italic>.

In higher eukaryotes, the fluctuations in the steady-state levels of histone mRNAs during the cell cycle is mainly controlled by post-transcriptional events, specifically by mRNA 3&#x02032;-end processing mediated by the interaction of unique protein factors with the conserved S-L structure at the 3&#x02032;-end of the non-polyadenylated histone mRNAs and by the U7snRNP. Bioinformatic analysis of the yeast genome has not identified homologues of the SLBP nor the 3&#x02032; hExo both of which interact with the 3&#x02032;-end of histone mRNAs in higher eukaryotes, nor have homologues of the U7 snRNP been identified (Bond,U., unpublished data). Since yeast histone mRNAs are polyadenylated but are cell cycle regulated, it appears that an alternative regulatory mechanism must have evolved to control the accumulation of histone mRNAs in the S-phase of the cell and their subsequent turnover in the G2-phase. Previous studies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have indicated that transcriptional regulation plays a major role in the accumulation patterns histone mRNAs during the cell cycle. Specifically, the transcriptional repressors Hir1p and Hir2p act coordinately to repress transcription in the G1-phase and through their ability to recruit components of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, activate expression in S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Additionally, post-transcriptional events appear to contribute to the cell cycle regulation as chimera genes containing the 3&#x02032; untranslated region of the HTB1 gene can confer cell cycle periodicity to a neomycin phosphotransferase mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The 5&#x02032; untranslated region appears to play a lesser role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>In this article, we have explored the mechanisms controlling histone mRNA 3&#x02032;-end formation and cell cycle regulation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Our analysis using the neo-HTB1 chimeric mRNA in CFIA mutants indicate that the 3&#x02032;-ends of HTB1 mRNA are generated for the most part through the general 3&#x02032;-end processing machinery. The steady-state levels of the neo-HTB1 mRNA transcripts are significantly reduced in the temperature-sensitive mutant <italic>rna14</italic>. Mutations in RNA15 (<italic>rna15-2</italic>), had a lesser impact on neo-HTB1 mRNA levels. This same phenotype was observed with a second mutant allele <italic>rna15-1</italic> (data not shown). The reduced effect of <italic>rna15</italic> mutants on HTB1 mRNA levels most likely reflects the fact that, in our hands, these temperature-sensitive mutants are not completely inactivated following heat treatment of the cells at 37&#x000b0;C: while cell growth is significanly reduced at this temperature, some growth is observed suggesting that these mutants only partially inactivate 3&#x02032;-end processing. It is interesting to note that the differential effect of <italic>rna14</italic> and <italic>rna15</italic> mutants on the steady-state level of the neo-HTB1 transcripts was not noted in the analysis of other mRNA transcripts such as the Act1 or Cyc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), although in this study the cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 h as opposed to the 1 h treatment used here. This may suggest that histone mRNAs show a lesser requirement for the Rna15p component of CF1A for 3&#x02032;-end processing.</p><p>The neo-HTB1 primary transcripts are inherently unstable when 3&#x02032;-end processing is inhibited, unlike actin mRNA transcripts which persist under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Deletion of <italic>RRP6</italic> in CFIA mutant backgrounds not only restores the levels of neo-HTB1 mRNA but also generates correctly sized transcripts representing fully processed mRNA. This RNA is exported from the nucleus and can be translated to produce functional proteins. Thus, even under conditions where 3&#x02032;-end processing is inhibited, mature functional transcripts can be generated. Others have also observed similar &#x02018;processing&#x02019; of read-through transcripts of a number of mRNAs in an <italic>rna14</italic>/<italic>&#x00394;</italic><italic>rrp6</italic> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). It was postulated that these processed transcripts result from a trimming back of the read-through transcripts to the correct 3&#x02032;-end by the 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonucleases of the core exosome and subsequent polyadenylation by Poly A Polymerase. An alternative hypothesis is that a sub-optimal 3&#x02032;-end processing machine can now cleave and polyadenylate the unprocessed transcripts, which have been stabilized through a lack of action of Rrp6p. In either case, it appears that such redundant mechanisms exist to ensure that the production of key transcripts are generated despite adverse conditions. While the precise mechanism is not clearly understood, the data presented here verifies that Rrp6p appears to play a role in the biogenesis of histone mRNAs through its interaction with the 3&#x02032;-end processing machinery.</p><p>Our results also show that the steady-state levels of neo-HTB1 mRNA appear to be influenced by the DDE sequence, which lies in the region of transcription termination of the HTB1 gene, specifically under conditions when 3&#x02032;-end processing is inhibited or when RRP6 is deleted. Point mutations in the DDE region appears to reduce the stability of neo-HTB1 transcripts when the 3&#x02032;-end processing is inhibited and conversely transcripts are more stable when RRP6 is deleted. This inverse relationship in mRNA stability in the two mutant backgrounds suggests that mutations in the DDE region of the HTB1 gene may alter the substrate specificity of the exosome thus allowing the mutant transcripts to escape degradation by the exosome or that some level of competition for binding to the DDE may occur between the 3&#x02032;-end processing machinery and the nuclear exosome. The stability of the WT and DDE mutants can be influenced by the physiological conditions of the cell, particularly by cell density (our unpublished data). It is known that the 3&#x02032;-end processing machinery communicates with RNA Polymerase II as it reaches the transcription termination site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). It is possible that the DDE may act as a gateway for various 3&#x02032;-end processing factors to access the transcription complex, thus establishing communication to effect transcription termination and subsequent processing.</p><p>The observation that the deletion of RRP6 alters the pattern of HTB1 transcript accumulation during the cell cycle provides an insight into a possible mechanism of histone mRNA regulation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Quantification of HTB1 transcripts during the cell cycle by densitometry analysis of northern blots and quantitative real-time RT-PCR, indicates that while HTB1 mRNA levels appear to accumulate similarly in WT and &#x00394;<italic>rrp6</italic> cells, thereafter, the levels decrease to baseline very quickly in the WT cells but in the &#x00394;<italic>rrp6</italic> cells, HTB1 levels while decreasing slightly, persist throughout the remainder of the cell cycle. In fact, examination of HTB1 transcript levels in <italic>rna14</italic>/&#x00394;<italic>rrp6</italic> at 22&#x000b0;C showed continued accumulation up to 4 h after alpha factor release, while in WT cells, levels return to baseline after 2 h The prolonged accumulation of HTB1 transcripts in &#x00394;<italic>rrp6</italic> cells appears to be exacerbated by inactivation of 3&#x02032;-end processing as HTB1 transcripts accumulate for an even longer time in the double mutant <italic>rna14</italic>/&#x00394;<italic>rrp6</italic> at the non-permissive temperature.</p><p>Flow cytometry analysis of synchronized cells reveals that the prolonged accumulation of HTB1 in <italic>rrp6</italic> cells appears to result from a delay in exit of cells from S-phase or entry into M-phase. The reason for this delay in <italic>rrp6</italic> cells is currently unclear. Since RRP6 encodes for a 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonuclease, it is possible that Rrp6p is required for the decay of HTB1 mRNA at the end of S-phase and in the absence of this trigger, progression into M-phase is delayed. Alternatively, Rrp6p may regulate the levels of other mRNAs that encode for cell cycle checkpoint proteins. Interestingly, Gill <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) have shown that accumulation of CLB2 mRNA, which encodes for B-cyclin, accounts for the exit from mitosis defect observed in RNase mitochondrial RNA processing (RNase MRP) mutants. The CLB2 mRNA was found to be a substrate for the RNase MRP endoribonuclease. Cleavage in the 5&#x02032; UTR region of CLB2 occurs at the end of mitosis, removing the 5&#x02032; cap and allows subsequent degradation by the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; exonuclease Xrn1p. Thus, regulation of check point mRNAs at the level of mRNA stability may be a common theme in cell cycle regulation.</p><p>Recently Reis and Campbell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) have identified a role for the nuclear poly (A) polymerases TRF4 and TRF5 complex in the regulation of bulk histone mRNA levels in yeast cells. Trf4/5p, together with Air1p, Air2p and Mtr4p, form the TRAMP complex, which has a specific function in the processing and/or degradation of rRNAs, snoRNAs and snRNAs. The TRAMP complex appears to &#x02018;tag&#x02019; its substrates for processing and/or degradation by the nuclear exosome by adding a short polyA tail onto the 3&#x02032;-end of these RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Histone mRNA levels are elevated in Trf4/5 double mutants and likewise in strains bearing a deletion of <italic>RRP6</italic>, the HHF2 core histone transcript level was at least twice as much of the wild-type level. The level of HHF2 mRNA appears to come down at the end of S-phase but appears to have increased 4-fold in the subsequent S-phase. This is reminiscent of the suboptimal HTB1 transcript degradation we observed here. Taken together, the data provide clear proof for a role for the nuclear exosome in the regulation of histone mRNAs in yeast cells.</p><p>How might the nuclear exosome regulate histone mRNA levels during the cell cycle? Much of our understanding of how the nuclear exosome recognizes its intended targets comes from the analysis of its known substrates. First, the nuclear exosome is required for the 3&#x02032;-end processing and transcription termination of snoRNAs and is recruited to the transcription termination sites via the RNA-binding proteins Nab3 and Nrd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38 B39 B40 B41 B42 B43">38&#x02013;43</xref>). Secondly, microarray analysis has revealed a small group of mRNAs whose steady-state levels are altered by deletion of RRP6. These include the autoregulated mRNAs Nrd1 and Nab2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Thirdly, as shown previously and above, 3&#x02032;-end unprocessed read-through transcripts are substrates for the nuclear exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). A common theme among these exosome targets is the requirement for Nrd1/Nab3-binding sites. From the accumulated data, the model emerging is one in which the exosome complex is recruited to its substrate via its specific association with the RNA-binding protein Nrd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Substrates are then degraded in a 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; direction unless they encounter any additional Nrd1 recognition sites upstream which would block the progress of the exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p><p>This model can also explain the &#x02018;processing&#x02019; and subsequent polyadenylation of read-through unprocessed neo-HTB1 transcripts seen in <italic>rna14</italic>/<italic>&#x00394;</italic><italic>rrp6</italic> strains. It is likely that this processing to a specific location reflects the presence of an Nrd1-binding site, which prevents further degradation by the exosome. In the presence of Rrp6p, complete degradation of the transcripts is observed suggesting that Rrp6p may add processivity to the core exosome or alternatively may prevent binding of Nrd1 to the transcript. It has been suggested that Nrd1 and the exosome may play a &#x02018;back-up&#x02019; role in biogenesis of some mRNAs to ensure the production of mature mRNAs under certain conditions such as when the 3&#x02032;-end processing machinery is inactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). This suggests that the 3&#x02032;-end processing machinery and the nuclear exosome may compete for the same pre-mRNA substrate and that physiological conditions in the cell will dictate the outcome of the competition. Extending this model, the data presented here suggests that HTB1 primary transcripts are recognized by the 3&#x02032;-end processing machinery and the nuclear exosome in S-phase facilitating proper processing of the transcript. However, in G2-phase, the nuclear exosome interaction is favoured over the 3&#x02032;-end processing machinery leading to an increase in the mRNA turnover. Whether this alteration in substrate specificity is due to changes in Nrd1 binding or alterations in 3&#x02032;-end processing is currently unclear. However, our results showing that 3&#x02032;-end processing is not differentially regulated during the cell cycle leads us to favour the former mechanism over the latter.</p><p>Thus, Rrp6 may contribute to histone mRNA biogenesis through its role in the nuclear surveillance pathway or through its interactions with the nuclear export pathways where it ensures that only correctly processed and functional mRNA can leave the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Alternatively, histone mRNAs may be retained in the nucleus in G2-phase thus evoking degradation of the transcripts by the DRN pathway (degradation of mRNA in the nucleus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Rrp6p, along with nuclear cap-binding protein Cbc1p, has shown to be required for this pathway, which degrades mRNAs that are retained in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). It is interesting to note that the mammalian orthologue of RRP6, PM/Scl-100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), associates with the cytoplasmic exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Currently the role of the cytoplasmic mRNA degradation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>) in the regulation of histone mRNAs has not been explored.</p><p>Finally, our finding that the nuclear exosome component Rrp6p contributes to the correct cell cycle accumulation pattern of HTB1 mRNA, acting in conjunction with transcriptional controls to contribute to the steady-state levels of histone mRNAs, provides further options to investigate the mechanisms controlling the regulation of histone mRNA during the yeast cell cycle.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We wish to thank T.C.
