Both cell-autonomous and systemic mechanisms have been implicated as clock outputs; however, the relative importance and interplay between these mechanisms are poorly understood. The cell cycle represents a highly conserved regulatory target of the circadian timing system. Previously, we have demonstrated that in zebrafish, the circadian clock has the capacity to generate daily rhythms of S phase by a cell-autonomous mechanism in vitro. Here, by studying a panel of zebrafish mutants, we reveal that the pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis also plays an essential role in establishing these rhythms in the whole animal. Mutants with a reduction or a complete absence of corticotrope pituitary cells show attenuated cell-proliferation rhythms, whereas expression of circadian clock genes is not affected. We show that the corticotrope deficiency is associated with reduced cortisol levels, implicating glucocorticoids as a component of a systemic signaling pathway required for circadian cell cycle rhythmicity. Strikingly, high-amplitude rhythms can be rescued by exposing mutant larvae to a tonic concentration of a glucocorticoid agonist. Our work suggests that cell-autonomous clock mechanisms are not sufficient to establish circadian cell cycle rhythms at the whole-animal level. Instead, they act in concert with a systemic signaling environment of which glucocorticoids are an essential part.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>To guarantee normal growth and to avoid tumor formation, the timing of cell division must be under strict control. Remarkably, cells, from bacteria to man, often divide only at certain times of day, suggesting the influence of internal biological clocks. A central pacemaker structure in the brain controls diurnal rhythms of behavior and hormone release. However, biological clocks are also encountered in almost every cell type (so-called &#x0201c;peripheral&#x0201d; clocks), in which they regulate daily changes in cell biology, including cell division. Very little is known to date about how the two clock systems interact. Here, by examining zebrafish strains with defects in hormone production, we find that peripheral clocks require the steroid hormone cortisol to generate daily rhythms of cell proliferation. Interestingly, the daily changes in cortisol levels observed in normal zebrafish are not required to achieve this control; treating the cortisol-deficient strains with constant levels of a drug that mimics the effects of cortisol restores normal cell-division rhythms. Thus, it appears that internal cell timers cooperate with hormonal signals to regulate the timing of cell division.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>To establish circadian cell cycle rhythms, cell-autonomous clock mechanisms act in concert with a systemic signaling environment of which glucocorticoids are an essential part.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Dickmeis T, Lahiri K, Nica G, Vallone D, Santoriello C, et al.

These daily rhythms are generated by endogenous clocks or pacemakers, and persist under constant conditions with a period length of approximately 24 h (hence, they are termed circadian). In vertebrates, cell-autonomous circadian clocks are present in most cell types, and are termed peripheral clocks. In addition, a limited number of specialized central pacemakers such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d; appear to play a key role in coordinating the function of peripheral clocks. Although it is known that ocular photoreception synchronizes the SCN pacemaker with the environment, the identity of the pathways that subsequently transmit timing information to the peripheral clocks remains elusive. Current models implicate multiple humoral signals that result indirectly from the SCN circadian control of systemic function, such as feeding behavior &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Both cell-autonomous and systemic regulatory mechanisms have been implicated in clock output pathways that relay timing information from the clock to physiological systems. Circadian E box enhancers represent key regulatory elements within the core transcription&#x02013;translation feedback loop of the vertebrate clock. These promoter elements direct circadian rhythms of transcription of clock genes by acting as binding sites for the clock components CLOCK and BMAL1. Circadian E boxes are also encountered in the promoters of many non-clock genes (so-called clock-controlled genes, e.g., see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;). Via such target genes and their downstream effectors, peripheral circadian clock components directly regulate many aspects of cell physiology, such as membrane trafficking, detoxification, nutrient metabolism, and the cell cycle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The central SCN pacemaker, in contrast, has been documented to influence systemic functions ranging from locomotor activity rhythms and the sleep&#x02013;wake cycle to endocrine activity. Thus, the circulating levels of many hormones are under circadian control and so exert their effects only during specific times of day. A major unexplored issue is the relative contribution of cell-autonomous and systemic factors in directing circadian clock outputs. Do certain clock outputs rely solely upon direct peripheral clock regulation, or do they require input from systemic factors, acting either upstream or downstream of the peripheral clocks? Are other outputs driven solely by circadian oscillations of systemic signals?</p><p>A particularly interesting clock output is the timing of cell proliferation. Daily rhythms of cell division are conserved across huge evolutionary distances, from cyanobacteria to humans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. This property has been proposed as a strategy for minimizing the ultraviolet damaging effects of sunlight during critical steps of the cell proliferation. In vertebrates, circadian gating of certain cell cycle steps also occurs in cell lines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, clock components have been implicated in controlling the transcription of cell cycle regulatory genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. These observations imply that the circadian clock may regulate cell cycle progression via cell-autonomous mechanisms. However, given that systemic factors such as hormones are well-known regulators of cell proliferation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, one important question is whether cell-autonomous regulatory mechanisms are sufficient to direct circadian cell cycle rhythms at the whole-animal level.</p><p>The zebrafish represents a valuable model for exploring the vertebrate circadian clock and its regulation of cell cycle timing. Robust daily S-phase rhythms are observed in larvae raised under light&#x02013;dark (LD) cycles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. The persistence of these rhythms following transfer of the larvae to constant darkness (DD) conditions demonstrates that they are under control of the circadian clock. Furthermore, consistent with other clock outputs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, exposure to a LD cycle is essential for the establishment of these rhythms because they are absent in larvae raised in DD. Circadian rhythms of S phase, albeit with lower amplitude, are also observed in zebrafish primary cell lines, implicating cell-autonomous regulation by peripheral clock mechanisms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, peripheral clocks in this species can be entrained by direct exposure to LD cycles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. However, zebrafish also possess central pacemakers: a structural counterpart of the SCN and a photosensitive pineal complex where nighttime synthesis of the hormone melatonin is directed by an endogenous clock &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b017">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Extensive panels of zebrafish mutants that show specific developmental defects in a range of organ systems have been assembled, thanks to large-scale screening efforts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. These animals represent potentially powerful tools to dissect the functional contribution of specific organs and tissues to the generation of clock outputs at the whole-animal level. Here, by studying a set of blind mutants, we have demonstrated that ocular photoreception is not required to establish circadian cell cycle rhythms during early larval development. In contrast, a severe attenuation of cell cycle rhythms is observed in mutants that exhibit a reduction or absence of the corticotrope cell lineage in the pituitary gland. Importantly, high-amplitude circadian cell cycle rhythms can be rescued by exposing corticotrope-deficient larvae to tonic concentrations of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist dexamethasone. Our work reveals the contribution of systemic factors to establishing circadian cell cycle rhythms at the whole-animal level.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ocular Photoreception Is Not Required for Zebrafish Circadian Cell Cycle Rhythms</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that exposure to a LD cycle is a prerequisite for circadian cell cycle rhythms to be established during early larval development. Whereas zebrafish peripheral clocks are directly light entrainable in vitro, light input through the eyes also plays an important role in entraining the circadian timing system in most vertebrates. We therefore asked whether ocular photoreception might contribute to establishing circadian cell cycle regulation in the zebrafish. We examined cell cycle rhythms in a set of functionally blind mutants using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation as a marker for the S phase of the cell cycle. <italic>lakritz/ath5 (lak)</italic> mutants, which carry a null mutation in a basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factor gene, the <italic>atonal homologue 5,</italic> lack the retinal ganglion cell layer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. These cells relay light information from the inner retina to the brain. Furthermore, in mammals, the retinal ganglion cells themselves function as a circadian photoreceptor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. These mutants are thus particularly well suited for examining the role of ocular photoreception in clock outputs. Mutant and wild-type siblings were raised under a LD regime, and BrdU incorporation was tested at four time points on the sixth day post-fertilization (dpf), before feeding starts. BrdU incorporation rhythms in the <italic>lak</italic> mutant larvae are indistinguishable from their wild-type siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050078-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) and thus not affected by the absence of ocular light input.

Surprisingly, however, the strong <italic>rx3</italic> mutant larvae show a severe attenuation of the circadian S-phase rhythm compared with their wild-type siblings (amplitude reduced from 4.0-fold to 2.3-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050078-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050078-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Since both <italic>lak</italic> and weak <italic>rx3</italic> mutants are blind, we conclude that the attenuated S-phase rhythm of the strong <italic>rx3</italic> mutant is functionally unrelated to its blindness.

In conclusion, tonically activating glucocorticoid signaling during the early days of development can rescue the circadian cell cycle rhythms in cortisol deficient larvae.</p><p>Our previous work has shown that the diurnal cell cycle rhythms of zebrafish larvae are under control of the circadian clock, because these rhythms persist upon transfer into constant darkness &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

We first tested the hypothesis that the circadian clock might regulate expression levels of the glucocorticoid receptor gene <italic>(GR)</italic> and thereby confer a circadian rhythm of sensitivity to the receptor ligand. Such a mechanism would enable even tonic levels of the ligand to activate GR signaling pathways with a circadian rhythm. Furthermore, recent reports have highlighted that many members of the nuclear receptor superfamily show circadian cycling of transcript levels &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. We thus prepared a time course of total RNA and protein extracts from wild-type sibling larvae during one LD cycle. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis failed to detect any significant change in GR mRNA levels during the course of the LD cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050078-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Consistently, levels of an 82-kDa immunoreactive protein corresponding to the zebrafish GR also did not cycle as determined by Western blotting analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050078-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).

Lack of cortisol during development and larval growth might generally alter larval physiology and thereby also indirectly affect cell cycle rhythms. Rescue of high-amplitude cell cycle rhythms in <italic>rx3</italic> mutant larvae by continuous exposure to dexamethasone from early development onwards could act via rescuing developmental defects as well as by affecting cells more directly. In order to address this point, we systematically tested the effect of reducing the duration of exposure to dexamethasone on cell cycle rhythms. We supplemented the medium with dexamethasone at progressively later stages before harvesting on day 6 of larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050078-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and unpublished data). Addition of dexamethasone as late as the night before sampling (day 5) still resulted in a significant increase in cell cycle amplitude.

We have previously implicated a contribution of directly light-entrainable peripheral clocks in the cell-autonomous control of circadian rhythms of S phase. Here, by studying panels of zebrafish mutants affecting development of the eye and hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary axis, we have been able to define the regulatory contribution of these structures to establishing circadian cell cycle rhythms. This study illustrates the power of using complementary sets of zebrafish mutants in the genetic dissection of physiological pathways in vivo.</p><p>We have shown that ocular photoreception is dispensable for establishing this clock output function, potentially reinforcing the notion that cell-autonomous light sensing plays a key role in cell cycle entrainment in the zebrafish. However, in common with most lower vertebrates, zebrafish possess additional extraocular specialized photoreceptor tissues: the pineal complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d; and also the so-called deep brain photoreceptors that line the third ventricle of the diencephalon &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. Since no zebrafish mutants are available to date that specifically lack these photoreceptors, it is problematic to assess their contribution. We used an alternative pharmacological approach to interfere with the melatonin signal, the major output of the pineal gland, and thereby tested whether photoreception through the pineal complex might affect cell cycle rhythms. Because treatment of larvae with the melatonin receptor antagonist luzindole did not change circadian cell cycle rhythms, pineal light reception is not strictly required for the timing of circadian cell cycle progression. However, it is still conceivable that light input from the pineal conveyed via neuronal pathways may contribute to the timing of the cell cycle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b053">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;. Also, one type of dedicated photoreceptor might be able to substitute for lack of input from the other types, leading to functional redundancy of inputs from, e.g., the eye and the pineal complex. Finally, the direct peripheral light reception alone might also be sufficient to time this clock output in the context of the whole animal. Ultimately, mutant zebrafish that lack all specialized photoreceptor cells will be required to assess the relative contribution of directly light-sensing peripheral clocks to entraining the circadian cell cycle.</p><p>By studying pituitary mutants with overlapping cell-lineage defects, and by our demonstration that pituitary corticotropes are severely reduced in strong allele <italic>rx3</italic> mutant larvae, we have implicated this pituitary cell lineage in the establishment of circadian cell cycle rhythms. Furthermore, levels of cortisol in strong <italic>rx3</italic> mutants are reduced and, importantly, a GR agonist rescues the circadian cell cycle defects in both strong <italic>rx3</italic> and pituitary mutants. These findings point to glucocorticoids as a requirement for high-amplitude cell cycle rhythms.</p><p>Previously, glucocorticoids have been implicated in the entrainment of peripheral circadian clocks in mammals. Injection of dexamethasone into mice can reset the phase of peripheral oscillators &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. However, mice lacking the GR show normal clock gene expression rhythms in the liver &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, here we observe normal circadian clock gene cycling in the strong <italic>rx3</italic> mutant larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050078-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), despite their low levels of cortisol. Consistently, also in the <italic>aal</italic> mutants, <italic>per4</italic> exhibits normal circadian rhythms of expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050078-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Finally, zebrafish cells grown in cortisol-depleted medium still show normal clock expression under a LD cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050078-sg005">Figure S5</xref>B, see below). Thus, glucocorticoid signaling is not an absolute requirement for the regulation of the peripheral pacemakers themselves. Our data directly implicate glucocorticoids in the regulation of clock output.</p><p>Glucocorticoids are well known to influence cell proliferation, both in vitro and in vivo. For example, dexamethasone can stimulate myoblast proliferation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d; and enhance the mitogenic response of fibroblasts to epidermal growth factor (EGF) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas it inhibits cell division in a lymphosarcoma cell line &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, at the whole-animal level, corticosteroids have been reported to affect the capacity of the liver to regenerate after hepatectomy in rats &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. Our results indicate that part of the effect of corticosteroids on cell proliferation might be brought about by cooperation with circadian clock output pathways.</p><p>At which level of organization might this interaction occur? Given the wealth of physiological targets of glucocorticoids, they might function through indirect, systemic pathways. For example, in zebrafish larvae, they might be involved in the maturation of organ systems and their physiological functions during development. However, our finding that dexamethasone treatment starting 10 h before sampling still rescues cell cycle rhythms in <italic>rx3</italic> mutants makes a long-term effect on development unlikely. Nevertheless, other indirect systemic pathways might act within this time frame. For example, glucocorticoids could stimulate the release of mitogens from neighboring tissues or influence the release of other hormones (e.g., see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b061">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;). Alternatively, they might act directly at the level of the proliferating cells themselves. We tested a potential cell-autonomous role for glucocorticoids in circadian cell cycle rhythms by examining zebrafish cell cultures grown in charcoal-treated (and thereby steroid-depleted) medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050078-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). Whereas circadian clock gene expression is normal in these cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050078-sg005">Figure S5</xref>B), circadian cell cycle rhythms are severely attenuated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050078-sg005">Figure S5</xref>A), thus mimicking the situation in cortisol-deficient larvae. However, in this cell culture system, treatment with dexamethasone does not rescue the attenuation (unpublished data). One explanation for this result could be that glucocorticoids might need to act synergistically with other substances that are also depleted from the medium by charcoal treatment. Taken together, although there are some hints for a direct cell-autonomous action of glucocorticoids on circadian cell cycle rhythms, more indirect systemic effects certainly cannot be excluded. Indeed, given the multifaceted actions of glucocorticoids, confinement of their effects on cell cycle progression to a single level would be rather surprising. In the animal, glucocorticoids might help to create a systemic signaling environment, within which they could also exert more direct effects.</p><p>What is the relative importance of systemic and peripheral circadian clock mechanisms in glucocorticoid-mediated circadian cell cycle regulation? Circadian rhythms of circulating glucocorticoids have long been recognized as a clock output in various vertebrates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. However, here we show that the role played by glucocorticoids in circadian cell cycle rhythms does not necessarily involve conveying timing information via changes in circulating levels. Rather, a constant glucocorticoid signal can rescue rhythms of cell cycle in cortisol-deficient mutant larvae. In the animal, the timing information might stem from another cycling systemic signal, or it might be provided by peripheral circadian clocks. Circadian changes in glucocorticoid levels might then reinforce the peripheral timing information in cell cycle control, or they might be required for other physiological functions.</p><p>How can a constant glucocorticoid signal lead to a rhythmic output? We propose a working model in which a certain level of glucocorticoid signaling may be permissive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050078-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, green arrow) for peripheral circadian clock regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050078-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, red arrow). Alternatively, the clock could gate responsiveness to the glucocorticoid signal, which would then act to regulate cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050078-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, blue arrow). In either scenario, in corticotrope-deficient mutants, GR signaling is attenuated, and then peripheral clock input alone would be insufficient to generate full cell cycle rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050078-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Furthermore, in the rescue experiments, tonic dexamethasone treatment activates GR signaling and would restore cell cycle rhythms in the mutants with timing information being provided by the peripheral circadian clock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050078-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). In this model, cycling cortisol levels are not required for, but they might reinforce cell cycle rhythmicity.</p><p>An attractive mechanism for gating responsiveness to glucocorticoids would involve circadian clock regulation of expression of the GR itself. Expression of many nuclear receptor transcripts is under circadian clock control in different peripheral tissues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. However, here we show that the levels of the GR transcript as well as the protein are not subject to significant day&#x02013;night variation. Thus, a simple scenario in which transcription of the <italic>GR</italic> gene is a regulatory target of peripheral clock components, e.g., via E box elements, appears unlikely. One can speculate that if indeed the receptor is under clock control, then this may occur at the post-translational level. Alternatively, circadian clock control might operate at various levels on other elements of the glucocorticoid signaling pathway, perhaps downstream of the receptor itself &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Glucocorticoids can increase the amplitude of cell cycle rhythms in strong <italic>rx3</italic> mutants even when they are delivered the night before assaying BrdU incorporation. Specifically, they have to be present at least before ZT17, or 16 h before the peak of BrdU incorporation at ZT9 is reached. Adding dexamethasone at ZT21 (12 h before the expected peak) is not sufficient. This might reflect either a minimum time needed to exert downstream effects on the cell cycle, or a requirement for the presence of glucocorticoids at a certain time of day. Interestingly, the last time point with rescue capability coincides with the natural peak in cortisol levels in wild-type larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050078-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Experiments involving a precisely controlled temporal activation and inactivation of the glucocorticoid signaling pathway will be needed to decide between these possibilities.</p><p>In summary, our results call for a re-evaluation of existing models that account for control of circadian cell cycle timing purely via the direct regulation of gene expression by peripheral clock components. We reveal a requirement for endocrine regulation involving glucocorticoids that operates downstream of the clock mechanism itself. It is tempting to speculate that many other clock outputs may involve similar contributions from cell-autonomous and systemic control elements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fish care, RNase protection assay, BrdU labeling, and dexamethasone treatment.</title><p>Fish were raised and bred according to standard procedures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050078-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;.

In target cells, cortisol activates GR signaling (green arrow) that may be permissive for the peripheral clock regulation of cell cycle. In addition, cycling cortisol levels may confer circadian rhythms of GR signaling that potentially reinforce cell cycle rhythmicity. The red arrow indicates the peripheral circadian clock control of cell cycle, and the blue arrow symbolizes the potential gating of GR signaling by the peripheral pacemaker. Cooperation between the peripheral clock mechanism and the GR signaling pathway generates a circadian rhythm of cell cycle.</p><p>(B) In corticotrope-deficient mutants, circulating cortisol levels are significantly reduced. In the absence of normal GR signaling, peripheral clock input is not sufficient to generate cell cycle rhythms. Dashed arrows indicate attenuated pathways.</p><p>(C) Cell cycle rhythms are rescued in corticotrope-deficient mutants by tonic dexamethasone (DEX) treatment. Thus timing information is provided by peripheral circadian clocks and is not reliant on cycling cortisol levels.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050078.g006"/></fig></sec><fn-group><fn id="n103" fn-type="present-address"><p>&#x000a4; Current address: Istituto Firc di Oncologia Molecolare, Milan, Italy</p></fn><fn id="ack3" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests.</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn id="ack1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> TD and NSF conceived and designed the experiments.
