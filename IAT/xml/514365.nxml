The <italic>MAGE</italic>-encoded antigens recognized by T cells are highly tumor-specific targets for T cell-oriented cancer immunotherapy. The function of MAGE-A1 is currently unknown. To analyze it, we attempted to identify protein partners of MAGE-A1. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we detected an interaction between MAGE-A1 and Ski Interacting Protein (SKIP). SKIP is a transcriptional regulator that connects DNA-binding proteins to proteins that either activate or repress transcription. We show that MAGE-A1 inhibits the activity of a SKIP-interacting transactivator, namely the intracellular part of Notch1. Deletion analysis indicated that this inhibition requires the binding of MAGE-A1 to SKIP. Moreover, MAGE-A1 was found to actively repress transcription by binding and recruiting histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). Our results indicate that by binding to SKIP and by recruiting HDACs, MAGE-A1 can act as a potent transcriptional repressor. MAGE-A1 could therefore participate in the setting of specific gene expression patterns for tumor cell growth or spermatogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The gene <italic>MAGE-A1</italic> was identified because it encodes a human melanoma antigen recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c1">1</xref>). It belongs to a family of 12 genes, the <italic>MAGE-A</italic> cluster located on the X chromosome in region q28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c2">2</xref>). The <italic>MAGE-A</italic> genes are expressed in tumors of various histological types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c4">4</xref>), but they are silent in normal adult tissues except in male germ-line cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c7">7</xref>).</p><p>A search for the gene responsible for the sex-reversal phenotype led to the identification of a second cluster of <italic>MAGE</italic> genes, <italic>MAGE-B</italic>, located in Xp21.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c11">11</xref>). A third cluster, <italic>MAGE-C</italic>, was identified and located in Xq26&#x02013;27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c12">12</xref>). The expression pattern of the <italic>MAGE-B</italic> and <italic>C</italic> genes is similar to that of the <italic>MAGE-A</italic> genes.</p><p>In contrast to the <italic>MAGE-A</italic>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic> genes, two genes constituting a distantly related fourth cluster, <italic>MAGE-D</italic>, were found to be expressed in many normal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c14">14</xref>). Additional <italic>MAGE</italic> genes families with such a ubiquitous expression pattern, <italic>MAGE-E</italic> to <italic>L</italic>, were identified through database screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c15">15</xref>).</p><p>By comparing the sequences of all the MAGE proteins, we identified a stretch of &#x0223c;200 amino acids which was named the &#x02018;MAGE conserved domain&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c15">15</xref>). The rest of the protein sequences vary widely from one family to another.</p><p>The function of protein MAGE-D1 has been partially elucidated. The rat protein NRAGE (neurotrophin receptor-interacting MAGE homolog), the ortholog of human MAGE-D1 and mouse Dlxin-1, was found to bind to the cytosolic domain of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c16">16</xref>). Upon binding, NRAGE prevents the formation of a complex between p75NTR and tyrosine kinase receptor TrkA. This retards cell cycle progression and initiates an apoptotic cascade leading to neuronal cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c17">17</xref>). In agreement with these data, NRAGE and p75NTR are co-expressed in a region of the developing nervous system where p75NTR mediates developmental apoptosis. In addition, NRAGE was found recently to induce apoptosis through interaction with the axon guidance receptor, UNC5H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c18">18</xref>). On the other hand, Dlxin-1, the murine ortholog of NRAGE, exerts a function in the nucleus: it acts as a transcriptional activator of Dlx5, a homeodomain protein of the Dlx family that plays a critical role in skeletal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c19">19</xref>). This transcriptional function may be regulated by the tyrosine kinase receptor, Ror2 since this receptor appeared capable of sequestering Dlxin-1 at the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c20">20</xref>).</p><p>Computer search of the Protein Sequence Database revealed that MAGE proteins display a weak similarity with necdin because it also contains a &#x02018;MAGE conserved domain&#x02019;. The murine necdin gene (<italic>Ndn</italic>) is highly expressed in post-mitotic neurons in the brain stem and hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c22">22</xref>). Mice deficient in necdin show early postnatal lethality due to respiratory distress and hypotonia, as observed in Prader&#x02013;Willi syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c25">25</xref>). Necdin seems to act as a neuron-specific post-mitotic growth suppressor, functionally similar to the retinoblastoma suppressor protein, Rb. Ectopic expression of <italic>Ndn</italic> suppresses proliferation of NIH&#x0002f;3T3 fibroblasts and colony formation of SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c27">27</xref>). Necdin interacts with the E2F1 and p53 transcription factors, repressing their transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c28">28</xref>). Furthermore, necdin associates with the p75 neurotrophin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c29">29</xref>). These observations suggest that necdin induces cell cycle arrest and controls neuronal apoptosis through interactions with E2F1 and p75NTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c30">30</xref>).</p><p>The functions of the MAGE-A group of proteins, which are present only in tumor and germ-line cells, are largely unknown. MAGE-A4 has been identified as binding to gankyrin, an abundant protein in hepatocellular carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c31">31</xref>). This protein has been reported to associate with Rb and to compete with p16 for binding to cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4, increasing both the phosphorylation and degradation of Rb. MAGE-A4 was shown to suppress both anchorage-independent growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumor formation of gankyrin-expressing cells in nude mice. Interaction with gankyrin was not observed for proteins MAGE-A1, MAGE-A2 and MAGE-A12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c31">31</xref>).</p><p>The subcellular localization of MAGE-A proteins seems to vary from one member of the family to another. MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A3 were reported to be located in the cytosol of melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c34">34</xref>). MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A4 have been detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c7">7</xref>). MAGE-A10 and MAGE-A11 have been shown to be located predominantly in the nucleus of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c36">36</xref>). MAGE-A proteins may exert different functions according to their subcellular localizations. To gain insight into MAGE-A functions, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify protein partners of MAGE-A1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><sec><title>Yeast expression plasmids</title><p>Plasmids pGBT9 and pAS2-1 encoding the Gal4(1&#x02013;147) DNA-binding domain, pACT2 and pGAD424 encoding the Gal4(768&#x02013;881) activation domain, pTD1 encoding SV40 large T antigen (84&#x02013;708) and pVA3 encoding mouse p53 (72&#x02013;390) were purchased from Clontech.

Transformed His<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CG-1945 cells were selected onto medium lacking histidine (&#x02212;His). In our conditions, 5 mM 3-aminotriazole (3-AT), a chemical inhibitor of imidazoleglycerolphosphate dehydratase (<italic>HIS3</italic>) which restores histidine auxotrophy, was always required in the &#x02212;His medium.

The bait was protein MAGE-A1 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4bd). It was obtained by cloning the full-length ORF of <italic>MAGE-A1</italic> into vector pAS2-1, which produces a high level of fusion protein. The preys, fused with the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain (Gal4ad), were produced from a human testis cDNA library prepared in vector pACT2. The first round of screening was conducted in yeast strain CG-1945 which contains reporter gene <italic>HIS3</italic> controlled by Gal4, using medium deficient in histidine. Since Gal4bd&#x0002f;MAGE-A1 exerted a certain degree of transactivation on its own, selection occurred in the presence of 5 mM 3-aminotriazole to increase histidine dependence. Under these conditions, no colonies were observed with pAS2&#x0002f;MAGE-A1 alone. From approximately 7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> yeast transformants, nine His<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> colonies were recovered.</p><p>For the second round of screening, pACT2 plasmids were isolated from the His<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> colonies and tested for their ability to encode proteins interacting with Gal4bd&#x0002f;MAGE-A1 produced by vector pGBT9 at a much lower level than by vector pAS2-1. This screening used a yeast strain in which gene <italic>LacZ</italic> is controlled by Gal4. One plasmid was repeatedly positive. Interaction was conserved when the testis&#x0002f;Gal4ad and Gal4bd&#x0002f;MAGE-A1 associations were switched.

A comparison of MAGE-A1<sub>1&#x02013;295</sub> (amino acids 1&#x02013;295) and the complete MAGE-A1<sub>1&#x02013;309</sub> indicated that the negatively charged region composed of the 14 C-terminal residues of MAGE-A1 is required for SKIP interaction. The ability of MAGE-A1 to autonomously stimulate the reporter gene was lost when amino acids 279&#x02013;295 were deleted.</p></sec><sec><title>MAGE-A1 interacts with SKIP in mammalian cells</title><p>To verify the interaction observed in yeast, we used a co-immunoprecipitation approach in mammalian cells. To this end, the simian COS-7 cells were cotransfected with vectors expressing MAGE-A1 and SKIP. The latter was tagged with an influenza HA epitope. Immunoprecipitations were carried out on cell extracts with an anti-MAGE-A1 antiserum, followed by western blotting using an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f2">2</xref>, MAGE-A1 interacted specifically with SKIP.</p><p>Using constructs producing truncated forms of MAGE-A1, we found that MAGE-A1<sub>99&#x02013;309</sub> also coprecipitated with HA&#x02013;SKIP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f3">3</xref>A, <italic>lane 7</italic>), whereas MAGE-A1<sub>1&#x02013;279</sub> and MAGE-A1<sub>99&#x02013;279</sub> did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f3">3</xref>A, <italic>lanes 5</italic> and <italic>9</italic>). These results indicated that the C-terminal region of MAGE-A1 was required for the interaction with SKIP in mammalian cells as well as in yeast.</p></sec><sec><title>MAGE-A1 counteracts Notch1-IC-mediated transactivation</title><p>Having shown the association of MAGE-A1 with SKIP, we wished to assess its functional consequences. SKIP has been described to be involved in the Notch1 signaling pathway. Notch1 is a transmembrane receptor that mediates intercellular communications and directs cell fate decisions during development. Ligand binding to Notch1 induces an intramembrane proteolytic cleavage that releases the intracellular domain of the receptor, Notch1-IC, which then enters the nucleus and regulates the expression of a number of genes. One of the DNA-binding proteins that interact with Notch1-IC is the C-promoter binding factor 1 (CBF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c45">45</xref>). In the absence of Notch1-IC, CBF1 inhibits transcription by binding SKIP and the SMRT&#x02013;corepressor complex which contains HDACs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f4">4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c37">37</xref>). Repression is relieved by the presence of Notch1-IC, which binds to SKIP and CBF1, displaces the repression complex and activates transcription by recruiting histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and also coactivators such as Mastermind (Mam), which stabilizes the complex of Notch1-IC and CBF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c47">47</xref>).</p><p>We examined whether MAGE-A1 could interfere with the SKIP-dependent transcriptional activity of Notch1-IC. Transient transfection into HeLa cells of a plasmid encoding a Gal4bd&#x0002f;SKIP fusion protein together with a <italic>CAT</italic> reporter gene containing Gal4 DNA-binding sites near its promoter, led to transcriptional repression of the low level of expression observed with the reporter gene alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f5">5</xref>A). As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c37">37</xref>), when Gal4bd&#x0002f;SKIP was cotransfected with Notch1-IC, a considerable increase in transcription was observed, whereas in the absence of Gal4bd&#x0002f;SKIP, the effect of Notch1-IC was negligible. Finally, when we cotransfected MAGE-A1 together with Gal4bd&#x0002f;SKIP and Notch1-IC, this led to significant transcriptional repression. Increasing the amount of Notch1-IC with a constant amount of MAGE-A1 gradually increased the expression of the <italic>CAT</italic> reporter, but even at the highest dose of transfected Notch1-IC plasmid, repression by MAGE-A1 remained efficient (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f5">5</xref>A).</p><p>Conversely, MAGE-A1 repressed transcription of the reporter activated by Gal4bd&#x0002f;SKIP and Notch1-IC in a dose-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f5">5</xref>B). This was not due to an autonomous non-specific repressor activity of MAGE-A1, as we did not observe a dose-dependent repression when the same promoter was activated by Gal4bd fused to the activation domain of HNF-6 in the presence of increasing amounts of MAGE-A1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f5">5</xref>C).</p><p>To determine the cellular localization of the exogenous MAGE-A1, cell fractionation experiments were performed on transfected HeLa cells. These experiments revealed that cytosolic expression of MAGE-A1 was predominant, but that a significant fraction of MAGE-A1 was present in the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f5">5</xref>D). We could not detect Notch1-IC on these immunoblots. This was not unexpected since Notch1-IC is known to be instable and to act at very low nuclear concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c48">48</xref>). However, in COS cells transfected in exactly the same conditions as the HeLa cells of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f5">5</xref>B, we found that transfected <italic>Notch1-IC</italic> was expressed and that the levels of Notch1-IC did not decrease when the amounts of MAGE-A1 in the cell increased (data not shown).</p><p>To determine the region of MAGE-A1 that is required for the inhibition of Notch1-IC-mediated transactivation, we tested deleted forms of MAGE-A1 in the reporter assay. MAGE-A1<sub>99&#x02013;309</sub> reduced Notch1-IC transactivation by a factor of about 30, whereas MAGE-A1<sub>1&#x02013;279</sub> or MAGE-A1<sub>99&#x02013;279</sub> had no significant effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f5">5</xref>E). As the MAGE-A1 C-terminus mediates the binding to SKIP (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f3">3</xref>), this suggests that the repression of Notch1-IC transactivation requires an interaction between SKIP and MAGE-A1.</p><p>As reported previously, Gal4bd&#x0002f;SKIP repression is likely to be due to recruitment of the SMRT&#x02013;HDAC repressor complex whereas Notch1-IC upregulation is caused by Notch1-IC competition with the SMRT&#x02013;corepressor complex and recruitment of coactivators (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f6">6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c49">49</xref>). Our experiments indicate that, by binding to SKIP MAGE-A1 inhibits Notch1-IC transactivation. MAGE-A1 could achieve this inhibitory effect either by displacing Notch1-IC from SKIP or by masking Notch1 sites which bind transcriptional coactivators while leaving Notch1-IC attached to SKIP. A third possibility would be that, after binding to SKIP MAGE-A1 functions as an active repressor.</p></sec><sec><title>MAGE-A1 recruits deacetylase HDAC1</title><p>We investigated whether MAGE-A1 had the ability to repress transcription upon binding autonomously to the promoter. To this end, we transiently transfected cells with a Gal4bd&#x0002f;MAGE-A1 construct together with a luciferase reporter gene driven by a tk promoter preceded by four Gal4 DNA-binding sites. MAGE-A1 inhibited transcription in a dose-dependent manner when linked to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f7">7</xref>A). This suggests that MAGE-A1 can autonomously repress transcription.</p><p>Active repression of transcription can be mediated through recruitment of HDAC, resulting in nucleosome remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c50">50</xref>). To test whether MAGE-A1 may repress transcription through HDAC, we incubated cells expressing Gal4bd&#x0002f;MAGE-A1 with the HDAC inhibitor, TSA. This resulted in a significant relieve of MAGE-A1-mediated transcriptional repression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f7">7</xref>B).</p><p>We, therefore, examined whether MAGE-A1 could associate with HDAC1 and&#x0002f;or HDAC4 that belong to Class I and Class II HDAC, respectively. To this end, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down experiments using a MBP&#x02013;MAGE-A1 fusion protein produced in <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> translated <sup>35</sup>S-labelled HDAC1 and HDAC4. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f7">7</xref>C, MBP&#x02013;MAGE-A1 bound specifically to full-length HDAC1 (lane 3) whereas MBP alone did not (lane 2). No binding was observed with HDAC4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f7">7</xref>C).</p><p>We then examined whether the association between MAGE-A1 and HDAC1 could occur <italic>in vivo</italic>, in COS cells that were transiently transfected with HDAC1 and MAGE-A1 expression plasmids. MAGE-A1 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-MAGE-A1 goat serum. Co-immunoprecipitated HDAC1 was detected by western blotting using an anti-HDAC1 antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f7">7</xref>D, lane 3). No HDAC1 was detected when a goat preimmune serum was used to immunoprecipitate the lysate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f7">7</xref>D, lane 2).</p><p>Finally, we tested the functional relevance of the interaction between MAGE-A1 and HDAC1 by using transient transfection of a reporter gene containing Gal4 DNA-binding sites and a construct expressing a Gal4bd&#x0002f;MAGE-A1 fusion protein. In this assay, we used a limiting amount of Gal4bd-MAGE-A1 that moderately repressed luciferase activity. Cotransfection of Gal4bd&#x0002f;MAGE-A1 with HDAC1 synergistically enhanced transcriptional repression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f7">7</xref>E), indicating a co-operative effect of MAGE-A1 and HDAC1. Taken together, these experiments strongly suggest that MAGE-A1 can actively repress transcription through the recruitment of HDAC1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our results indicate that MAGE-A1 interacts with transcriptional regulator SKIP, through its C-terminal part. In line with these results, we observed that MAGE-A4, the only other MAGE in which this region is conserved, also binds to SKIP, whereas MAGE-A10 and MAGE-D2, which display different C-terminal parts, do not bind to SKIP in the yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown).</p><p>SKIP intervenes in signaling pathways involving vitamin D, retinoic acid, estrogens, glucocorticoids, Notch1-IC and TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c52">52</xref>). It can have either an activator or repressor role in transcription because it is an adaptor protein that connects DNA-binding proteins such as Smad3, the vitamin D receptor, CBF1 or MyoD, to proteins that activate or repress transcription. For example, the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC), which has a HAT activity, forms a ternary complex with SKIP and the liganded vitamin D receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c53">53</xref>). Ski, the protein that was used as bait to fish SKIP, similarly binds to the DNA-binding protein Smad and recruits a repression complex including HDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c54">54</xref>).</p><p>Another repression complex was shown to bind to SKIP and CBF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c37">37</xref>). In the presence of Notch1-IC, the repression complex is detached from SKIP and recruitment of an activation complex including HATs is facilitated by SKIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c47">47</xref>). In our experimental system, MAGE-A1 counteracted the transcriptional activation mediated by Notch1-IC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f6">6</xref>). A possible explanation of this effect is that MAGE-A1 functions as a passive repressor dissociating Notch1-IC from SKIP, thereby preventing the recruitment of the transcriptional activation complex. However, the observation that the repressive effect of MAGE-A1 was not relieved by increasing the amount of transfected Notch1-IC plasmid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f5">5</xref>A) suggests that MAGE-A1 and Notch1-IC did not compete to bind to SKIP. Another possible mechanism of passive repression could be that, upon binding to SKIP, MAGE-A1 masked the activation domain of Notch1-IC. Such a mechanism of passive repression was reported for the MAGE-related protein, necdin, which binds to the transactivation domain of E2F1 and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c28">28</xref>). MAGE-A1 is not involved in this pathway, as we found that it does not interact with E2F1 or p53 in the yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown).</p><p>We investigated whether MAGE-A1 could actively repress transcription. Active repression could be exerted by interfering with the assembly of the basal transcription complex near the transcription-initiation site, by disrupting the interaction between DNA-bound transcription activators and the transcription machinery or by recruiting corepressors, such as HDAC. We observed that MAGE-A1 binds and recruits HDAC1, which modifies chromatin, but may also target non-histone proteins involved in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c38">38</xref>). Recruitment of HDAC by MAGE-A1 could be sufficient to inhibit Notch1-IC transactivation, but we cannot exclude that, in our experimental setting, MAGE-A1 also inhibited transcription by destabilizing the binding of transcriptional coactivators to Notch1-IC.</p><p>Such a combination of passive and active repression mechanisms was previously demonstrated for retinoblastoma protein, Rb. It binds to the activation domain of transcription factor E2F1, preventing it to interact with the CBP coactivator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c56">56</xref>). In addition, Rb recruits HDAC and actively represses the E2F-regulated promoters of genes required for the S phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c57">57</xref>).</p><p>Since MAGE-A1 acts as a transcriptional regulator, a fraction of the MAGE-A1 protein produced in mammalian cells must reach the nucleus. In transfected HeLa cells, we observed that MAGE-A1 was not exclusively localized in the cytosol, but that a significant fraction of it was present in the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh735f5">5</xref>D). Some reports described that MAGE-A1 was located only in the cytosol of melanoma cells and spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c58">58</xref>), but another report described that MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A4 proteins are located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c7">7</xref>). MAGE-A1 may be located predominantly in the cytoplasm and may translocate to the nucleus upon appropriate stimulation of the cell.</p><p>Experiments performed in our experimental system clearly indicated that, upon binding to SKIP, MAGE-A1 exerted a potent transcriptional repression. Since SKIP is involved in several signaling pathways, repression by MAGE-A1 bound to SKIP may influence gene expression from many different promoters. As the testis is the only healthy adult organ where human <italic>MAGE-A</italic> and murine <italic>Mage-a</italic> genes are expressed, proteins encoded by these genes may play a role in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c59">59</xref>). It is therefore possible that, by binding to SKIP and by inhibiting Notch1-IC transactivation, MAGE-A1 participates in cell fate choices during spermatogenesis. However, we were not able to demonstrate that MAGE-A1 could repress the expression of an endogenous Notch1-IC target gene (data not shown). This may be because MAGE-A1, in contrast to Notch1-IC or SMRT, does not bind to the activator CBF1 but binds only to SKIP, a protein that could not be absolutely required for Notch1-IC signal transduction. The possibility that MAGE-A1 regulates the expression of genes involved in spermatogenesis through other signaling pathways remains to be investigated. On the other hand, MAGE-A1 is expressed in tumor cells of different histological types. Altered HAT and&#x0002f;or HDAC activities have been observed in many cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh735c60">60</xref>). By recruiting HDAC1 to genes that remain to be identified, MAGE-A1 may contribute to these alterations and favor tumor cell growth.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh735f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Interaction between deleted forms of MAGE-A1 and SKIP in the yeast two-hybrid system.

The amount of transfected DNA was kept constant to 500 ng by adding DNA of a vector producing Gal4bd. Whole cell extracts were used in luciferase assays. The basal activity of the reporter in the presence of Gal4bd is normalized to a value of 100%. Transfection efficiencies were normalized using &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity.

Cells were then harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. The basal activity of the reporter is normalized to a value of 100%. Transfection efficiencies were normalized using &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity. The results of a representative experiment done in duplicate are shown. In the absence of synergy, the expected value for the relative luciferase activity is 46%, which corresponds to the product of the activity measured in the presence of MAGE-A1 alone (60%) &#x000d7; the activity measured in the presence of HDAC1 alone (76%).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkh735f7"/></fig><table-wrap id="gkh735tb1"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title><italic>In vivo</italic> interaction of MAGE proteins with SKIP</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1" width="85%"><colgroup><col/><col/><col align="right"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr valign="top"><th valign="top">Ga14bd fusions</th><th valign="top">Ga14ad fusions</th><th align="right" valign="top">&#x003b2;-Gal activity</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">MAGE-A1</td><td valign="top">&#x02014;</td><td align="right" valign="top">8.8</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">&#x02014;</td><td valign="top">SKIP</td><td align="right" valign="top">0.8</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">MAGE-A1</td><td valign="top">SKIP</td><td align="right" valign="top">52.1</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">p53</td><td valign="top">SV40 T</td><td align="right" valign="top">123.6</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Yeast PJ69-4A cells were transformed with vectors expressing Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4bd) and Gal4 activation domain (Gal4ad) fusion proteins. &#x003b2;-Galactosidase activity was quantified using liquid cultures.
