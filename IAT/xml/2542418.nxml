To address this problem, we performed a mutant screen to identify genes essential for the formation of adult skeletal structures of the zebrafish. Here, we describe the phenotypic and molecular characterization of a set of mutants showing loss of adult structures of the dermal skeleton, such as the rays of the fins and the scales, as well as the pharyngeal teeth. The mutations represent adult-viable, loss of function alleles in the <italic>ectodysplasin</italic> (<italic>eda</italic>) and <italic>ectodysplasin receptor</italic> (<italic>edar</italic>) genes. These genes are frequently mutated in the human hereditary disease hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED; OMIM 224900, 305100) that affects the development of integumentary appendages such as hair and teeth. We find mutations in zebrafish <italic>edar</italic> that affect similar residues as mutated in human cases of HED and show similar phenotypic consequences. <italic>eda</italic> and <italic>edar</italic> are not required for early zebrafish development, but are rather specific for the development of adult skeletal and dental structures. We find that the defects of the fins and scales are due to the role of Eda signaling in organizing epidermal cells into discrete signaling centers of the scale epidermal placode and fin fold. Our genetic analysis demonstrates dose-sensitive and organ-specific response to alteration in levels of Eda signaling. In addition, we show substantial buffering of the effect of loss of <italic>edar</italic> function in different genetic backgrounds, suggesting canalization of this developmental system. We uncover a previously unknown role of Eda signaling in teleosts and show conservation of the developmental mechanisms involved in the formation and variation of both integumentary appendages and limbs. Lastly, our findings point to the utility of adult genetic screens in the zebrafish in identifying essential developmental processes involved in human disease and in morphological evolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>A major goal of the study of developmental genetics is to understand the genes and developmental mechanisms underlying the formation of organismal complexity and diversity. Here, we focus on genes controlling postembryonic development and describe mutations in genes of the ectodysplasin (Eda) pathway in regulating the formation of the scales, skull, fins, and teeth. Mutations in genes of this signaling pathway are common in humans with defects in ectodermal structures such as hair, glands, and teeth. We show that the similar phenotypes of loss of Eda signaling in fish and human are due to a conserved early developmental stage in the development of mammalian hair and fish scales; subsequent development of these two structures diverge. Our findings show that the Eda signaling pathway has an ancestral role in regulating the developmental interactions involved in patterning and growth of the dermal skeleton of fish. Recent work has shown that these genes are associated with morphological variation between humans and evolution within fish populations, suggesting that alteration in the function of these genes permits viable morphological change. Our data support the value of forward genetic studies on postembryonic development to reveal the genetic and developmental basis of both human disease and morphological evolution.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The genetic and developmental basis of the formation of organismal shape and form is a long-standing question in biology. The analysis of mutations has been essential in identifying the genes and regulatory networks underlying development. However, while the genetic basis of embryonic development has been extensively studied by systematic mutagenesis screens, we know little of the genes involved in the development of adult morphology. Yet, it is the heritable variation in adult form that natural selection primarily acts on during evolution. In order to understand the basis of variation, we need to know more about the genetic control of the development of adult form: which genes are involved, what are their function, and when are they required in development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Richardson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Stern1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. To identify genes important for development of adult structures, we initiated a large-scale mutagenesis screen in zebrafish and scored for mutants affected in the shape and pattern of adult structures. We isolated only adult viable mutants, therefore we selected for genes that have an increased probability to be involved in morphological change during evolution. Identification of zebrafish genes homologous to human genes associated with disease that arise during postnatal development into adulthood is also likely in this screen.</p><p>We focused on mutants that exhibit defects in the dermal skeleton of the adult zebrafish. The dermal skeleton encompasses the external form of the adult fish. The most prominent dermal skeletal elements are the dermocranium of the skull and lateral bones of the opercular series, the scales, and the fin rays (or lepidotrichia). Additionally, the teeth and gill rakers (bones that support the gills in teleosts) are elements of the dermal skeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Sire1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Huysseune1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike the ossification process that occurs during endochondrial bone development in which organic matrix is deposited by osteoblasts over a chondrogenic scaffold, dermal skeletal elements originate as direct mineralization of a collagenous matrix deposited by dermal fibroblasts. This process occurs in close association with the epidermis. The initiation and patterning of dermal elements are thought to be similar to epidermal appendages (e.g. hairs and feathers) and is controlled by reciprocal signaling between an epithelium and mesenchyme (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Coulombre1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Sil1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>). Importantly, in zebrafish, as in most teleosts, the majority of dermal skeletal elements are not formed during larval development, rather through juvenile metamorphosis and development of the adult pattern. Those that begin to form in late larval development such as the teeth and gill rakers, do not fully attain their shape and pattern until juvenile metamorphosis.</p><p>Variations in the shape of dermal skeletal elements of the fins, scales, cranium, and teeth play a significant role in adaptations of fish populations to new environments (e.g. dermal plate development and stickleback radiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Bell1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>). Additionally, integumentary appendages, such as hair and feathers, have been essential and defining traits of vertebrate classes. Early vertebrates, the conodonts, ostracoderms and placoderms, possessed a pronounced dermal skeleton, often in the absence of an ossified axial skeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Donoghue1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Through vertebrate evolution from fish to tetrapods, dermal structures such as lateral bones of the opercular series, scales, dermal plates and fin rays were either reduced or lost. This evolutionary transition was paralleled with the elaboration of the cartilaginous endoskeleton of the limbs and the evolution of specialized keratinized appendages of the integument such as epidermal scales, feathers and hairs. In contrast, the diversity of form in extant bony fishes involves modification in size, shape and number of the scales/dermal plates, fin rays, cranial dermal bones and teeth.</p><p>Here, we describe a collection of mutants that have shared defects in the formation of the dermal skeletal elements of the skull, fins, scales and teeth of the adult zebrafish. The mutations disrupt the genes <italic>ectodysplasin</italic> (<italic>eda)</italic> and <italic>edar</italic> encoding the <italic>eda</italic> receptor. In mammals the EDA signaling pathway is involved in hair and teeth formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Mikkola1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and mutations affecting this pathway cause the human hereditary disease hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED). Loss of Eda signaling in the zebrafish causes a spectrum of phenotypes corresponding to those described for HED in humans, and therefore the zebrafish mutants may serve as a genetic model of this disease. We describe the requirement of Eda signaling in the zebrafish epidermis for the formation of a structure resembling an epidermal placode seen in the early development of other vertebrate integumentary appendages. The mutations also result in defects of skeletal elements unique to fish and suggest an ancestral role of Eda signaling in the formation and patterning of the dermal skeleton. Lastly, whereas loss of function of Eda signaling causes a severe phenotype, the expressivity of dominant alleles is sensitive to background modifiers that buffer the phenotypic consequences of loss of Eda signaling. Additionally, we find that the response to reduction of Eda signaling is dose sensitive and organ specific. We suggest that such alleles may provide a basis for morphological variation in evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>finless</italic> and <italic>Nackt</italic> Mutants Exhibit Defects in the Development of the Dermal Skeleton</title><p>In a mutagenesis screen for mutations affecting adult zebrafish structures, we identified three mutants that showed nearly identical defects in the formation of scales, lepidotrichia, and shape of the skull of homozygous fish.

The correlated effect in these zebrafish structures is due to a developmental role of Eda signaling in organizing epithelial cells into signaling centers. In the case of scale development, Eda signaling is necessary for the basal epidermal cells to form a functional placode. Epidermal placodes are involved in the formation of integumentary appendages of other vertebrates such as hair, glands, feathers and teeth. These structures have been shown to act as signaling centers to orchestrate appendage development. We speculate that a primary function of Eda signaling in scale development is to promote cell-cell adhesion within the placode and that the coordinated signaling of the placode induces fibroblast assembly in the underlying dermis, an early step in scale formation.</p><p>Schmidt-Ullrich et al. documents the formation of the hair placode and outline a stage series of placode formation in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-SchmidtUllrich1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

This stage closely resembles the stage of scale placode formation that is affected in <italic>fls</italic> shown here. In agreement with our findings, Schmidt-Ullrich et al. further note a reduction of cell-to-cell adhesion within the placode and find increased apoptosis in the absence of Edar function. This suggests that there is a conserved developmental role of Edar between dermal scales of fish and mammalian hairs. During normal hair development, the hair placode invaginates to form the hair bulb. By contrast, the post-placodal events of scale formation in fish do not involve morphogenetic changes of the epidermis, rather the accumulation of mesenchymal cells subjacent to the epidermal placodal cells to form the scale pocket. Thus, Eda signaling in mammals and teleosts is conserved in the early phases of placode formation in controlling the functional continuity and signaling of the epidermal placode to orchestrate appendage formation. However, the downstream interpretation of the epithelial-mesenchymal signaling differs beyond this point leading to altered morphogenetic responses and histological differentiation to form diverse appendages such as scales and hair.</p><p>In the fin, Eda signaling directs late stages of fin development such as the formation and growth of the dermal rays. The effect of loss of <italic>edar</italic> function on fin development uncovers an intrinsic developmental polarity of the late developing fish fin.

This reduction in the amount of <italic>edar</italic> transcripts cause defects in scale and tooth development, however fins are normal. <italic>fang/te370f</italic>, in which the <italic>fang</italic> allele is in <italic>trans</italic> to a presumed null, further reduces the relative levels of wild type <italic>edar</italic> transcripts leading to further reduction of both teeth as well as fin lepidotrichia. Similar dose sensitive responses to levels of EDA signaling are seen in tooth development of the mouse regulating the number and shape of teeth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Tucker2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Kangas1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. There are several reports of hypodontia in humans resulting from altered EDA function that do not show other phenotypes such as hypothrichosis or nail defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Li1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Tarpey1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Given our findings, it is likely that these particular alleles are hypomorphic and this is sufficient to explain the differential organ sensitivity to levels of EDA signaling during development. These data indicate that control of the level of Eda signaling in post-embryonic development is an essential component for the determination of the number and form of many different organ systems of the adult.</p><p>Supporting this finding, we observed significant modification of expressivity of <italic>fls</italic><sup>dt3Tpl</sup> in different genetic backgrounds indicating the existence of genetic modifiers of Eda signaling. This sensitivity of Eda signaling to genetic modifiers occurs in other teleost fish as well. In our analysis of the medaka <italic>rs-3/edar</italic> mutant, we find a high degree of variability in the extent of scale formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000206.s004">Figure S4</xref>) suggesting the existence of background modifiers of Edar function in this species. Additionally, evidence from the stickleback, <italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>, suggests that genetic variance at the <italic>eda</italic> locus underlies differences in the extent of dermal plate formation in diverged populations of this species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Colosimo1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. A quantitative trait analysis (QTL) of lateral plate formation in a low-plated form of the stickleback indicates a significant modification of the reduced plate phenotype (<italic>eda</italic> locus) with modifying effects within and between loci affecting plate number and size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Piechel1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Colosimo2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, recent evidence also shows a significant association between the <italic>edar</italic> locus and dermal plate number in sticklebacks in addition to the predominant <italic>eda</italic> locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Knecht1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus variation at these gene loci may act in concert to regulate number of dermal plates/scales.</p><p>Thus, while loss of Eda signaling can lead to severe phenotypes, the phenotypic consequences of variation in Eda signaling are graded and canalization of Eda signaling is prevalent. Therefore, buffering of the phenotypic outcome that results from defective Eda signaling could be a common mechanism that permits viable and diverse phenotypes. These viable phenotypic variations then could serve as a basis for selection. The lack of a coding change at the <italic>eda</italic> locus in sticklebacks that is associated with the loss of dermal plates has lead to the argument that, in this case, evolution of this trait is due to changes at <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements controlling <italic>eda</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Colosimo1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Our findings on the dose and organ specific sensitivity of Eda signaling in different structures of the zebrafish argues that evolution of this trait could result from a regulation of absolute levels of expression.</p><p>Interestingly, recent analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency in human populations supports the role of Eda signaling in causing phenotypic variation. Analysis of SNP variation between diverse human populations shows evidence of selection of the <italic>EDAR</italic> locus in East Asian and American populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Kimura1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Williamson1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. A defined allelic variant of <italic>EDAR</italic> within these populations leads to a coding change in the death domain of EDAR and is a candidate allele for altered gene function that could have lead to the region being fixed in these populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Sabeti1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. There is evidence from association data that this allele is associated with thick hair in these populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Fujimoto1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, however the full extent of phenotypes that are affected in these populations that are related to EDA signaling has not been analyzed. It is interesting to note that recent work has identified this allele of <italic>EDAR</italic> as having an enhanced effect on Eda signaling in mouse models containing the altered human residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Mou2">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Given that variation in the number and shape of integumentary derivatives of the dermal skeleton are a common morphological change in teleost evolution <italic>e.g.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Stock1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, it will be important to further investigate the prevalence and type of genetic changes in Eda signaling genes in cases of natural variation of these adult characters.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Mutagenesis and Allele Designation</title><p>Zebrafish mutagenesis was performed following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000206-Pelegri1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref> with 5 treatments of 3.3&#x02013;3.5 mM ethylnitrosourea.
