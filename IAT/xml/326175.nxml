BMV RNA4 is 876 b long including a 5' noncoding region of nine nucleotides and a 3' noncoding region of 300 nucleotides. CCMV RNA 4 is 824 b long, including a 5' noncoding region of 10 nucleotides and a 3' noncoding region of 244 nucleotides. The encoded coat proteins are similar in length (188 amino acids for BMV and 189 amino acids for CCMV) and display about 70% homology in their amino acid sequences. Length difference between the two RNAs is due mostly to a single deletion, in CCMV with respect to BMV, of about 57 b immediately following the coding region. Allowing for this deletion the RNAs are indicate that mutations leading to divergence were constrained in the coding region primarily by the requirement of maintaining a favorable coat protein structure and in the 3' noncoding region primarily by the requirement of maintaining a favorable RNA spatial configuration.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00371-0250.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="703"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00371-0251.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="704"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00371-0252.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="705"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00371-0253.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="706"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00371-0254.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="707"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00371-0255.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="708"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00371-0256.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="709"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00371-0257.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="710"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00371-0258.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="711"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00371-0259.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="712"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00371-0260.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="713"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
