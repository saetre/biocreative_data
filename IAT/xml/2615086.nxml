Their F-BAR domains bind and curve membranes, whereas other domains, typically SH3 domains, are expected to provide cytoskeletal links. We tested this prevailing model of functional division in the founding member of the family, Cdc15, which is essential for cytokinesis in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, and in the related PCH protein, Imp2. We find that the distinct functions of Imp2 and Cdc15 are SH3 domain independent. However, the Cdc15 and Imp2 SH3 domains share an essential role in recruiting proteins to the contractile ring, including Pxl1 and Fic1. Together, Pxl1 and Fic1, a previously uncharacterized C2 domain protein, add structural integrity to the contractile ring and prevent it from fragmenting during division. Our data indicate that the F-BAR proteins Cdc15 and Imp2 contribute to a single biological process with both distinct and overlapping functions.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: MBP, maltose-binding protein; MS, mass spectrometry; PCH, <italic>S. pombe cdc15</italic> homology; TAP, tandem affinity purification; TEV, tobacco etch virus; YE, yeast extract.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>For cytokinesis to occur, an actomyosin ring composed of a wide variety of conserved proteins must form and associate with the plasma membrane as an anchored yet dynamic lattice (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glotzer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wolfe and Gould, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr and Gruneberg, 2007</xref>). Not only must the cytokinetic ring be associated firmly with the membrane upon ring formation, but rearrangements in both protein composition and membrane curvature drive ring constriction and ultimately abscission. Although great progress has been made in identifying the protein composition of the contractile ring, the interactions between proteins and between specific proteins and the plasma membrane are still being elucidated.</p><p><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is an ideal model system in which to study the assembly and dynamics of the cytokinetic ring. Indeed, genetic screens revealed key players, including Mid1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sohrmann et al., 1996</xref>), which binds to the plasma membrane and directs medial placement of the ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Celton-Morizur et al., 2004</xref>). Other conserved proteins also participate in the first steps of ring assembly, including the heavy and light chains of nonmuscle myosin II, actin, an IQGAP (Rng2), tropomyosin, profilin, a formin, and two proteins with a membrane-binding F-BAR domain, Cdc15 and Imp2 (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wolfe and Gould, 2005</xref>). Several of these components organize into cortical nodes directed by Mid1 before contractile ring formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2006</xref>), and models for the first steps of ring assembly have been formulated focusing on the coalesce of the nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vavylonis et al., 2008</xref>) or, alternatively, proceeding through a leading cable of filamentous actin emanating from a spotlike concentration of formin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arai and Mabuchi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamasaki et al., 2007</xref>). However, many questions remain regarding how these first components organize the nascent ring, anchor the ring to the membrane, and recruit dozens of additional proteins as mitosis proceeds. Furthermore, the reorganization inherent in contractile ring constriction and abscission has not been determined either in terms of protein&#x02013;protein or protein&#x02013;membrane interactions. Because a global proteome localization study indicated that &#x0003e;200 proteins localize to the site of division at some stage during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsuyama et al., 2006</xref>), the complexity of the process has only begun to be unraveled.</p><p>Cdc15 is one of the first proteins observed at the incipient ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2003</xref>). It is the founding member of the <italic>S. pombe cdc15</italic> homology (PCH) family of proteins, which are typified by the conserved domain architecture of an N-terminal F-BAR domain and usually a C-terminal SH3 domain (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lippincott and Li, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chitu and Stanley, 2007</xref>). Although Cdc15 plays an essential role in cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fankhauser et al., 1995</xref>), other PCH family members play diverse roles not only in cytokinesis but also in endocytosis, motility, and neural morphogenesis. Because most described PCH proteins bind and curve the cell membrane through their F-BAR domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Itoh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsujita et al., 2006</xref>) and recruit protein-binding partners through SH3 domains (see table in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chitu and Stanley, 2007</xref>), it is reasonable to predict that PCH proteins achieve scaffolding functions through a division of labor between the two domains. However, we previously found that Cdc15 interacts with two key elements regulating the medial filamentous actin cytoskeleton, formin Cdc12 and type I myosin Myo1, through its F-BAR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carnahan and Gould, 2003</xref>), leaving the role of its SH3 domain unclear. Another PCH family member in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, Imp2, also localizes to the contractile ring and functions in cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demeter and Sazer, 1998</xref>). With no binding partners identified for Imp2, it is unclear whether the roles played by Cdc15 and Imp2 overlap in any way.</p><p>In this study, we examine how the SH3 domains of Cdc15 and Imp2 contribute to contractile ring assembly. Surprisingly, the endogenous Cdc15<sub>&#x00394;SH3</sub> truncation fulfills the essential role of Cdc15, and <italic>imp2<sub>&#x00394;SH3</sub></italic> causes no detectable phenotype on its own. Still, truncation of the Cdc15 SH3 domain results in significant cytokinetic defects. We identified two binding partners for the Cdc15 SH3 domain, Pxl1 and a novel C2 domain protein, Fic1. We also exposed a functional redundancy between the SH3 domains of Cdc15 and the PCH family member Imp2 in recruitment of contractile ring components and an additional cooperation between proteins such as Fic1 and Pxl1 recruited by these SH3 domains. The shared function of the Cdc15 and Imp2 SH3 domains is essential for cytokinesis. Consistent with this functional redundancy, replacement of the Cdc15 SH3 domain with that of Imp2 rescues most of the cytokinetic defects of <italic>cdc15<sub>&#x00394;SH3</sub></italic>. Our data indicate that the overlapping function accomplished by the SH3 domains of Imp2 and Cdc15 in contractile ring stabilization is separate from their distinct SH3-independent functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The SH3 domain of Cdc15 plays a nonessential role in cytokinesis</title><p>Preliminary data suggested that the Cdc15 SH3 domain was not essential for Cdc15 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carnahan and Gould, 2003</xref>), but to confirm this observation, we constructed a truncation of <italic>cdc15<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> at its endogenous locus.

Additionally, &#x0003e;10% of cells displayed multiple defects. These defects were similarly severe when the truncated protein was tagged with a variety of epitopes and in cells expressing a more precise truncation of the SH3 domain at amino acid 869 (<italic>cdc15<sub>&#x00394;SH3869</sub></italic>; Fig. S1, A and B).

Cdc15-GFP is detected at cell tips during interphase and at the contractile ring during mitosis first in nodes and cables, which later coalesce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carnahan and Gould, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2006</xref>).

However, Cdc15<sub>&#x00394;SH3</sub>-GFP and Cdc15<sub>&#x00394;SH3869</sub>-GFP rings appeared less well organized than full-length Cdc15-GFP during constriction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref> and Fig. S1 C).</p><p>To examine contractile rings in <italic>cdc15<sub>&#x00394;SH3</sub></italic> cells directly, we imaged the regulatory light chain for type II myosin, Rlc1-GFP. Many Rlc1-GFP rings appeared fragmented or frayed in <italic>cdc15<sub>&#x00394;SH3</sub></italic> cells, especially once constriction had begun, which is similar to Cdc15<sub>&#x00394;SH3</sub>-GFP rings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

Kymographs from these videos revealed that rings constricted unsteadily in the mutant background relative to wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>).

The partial redundancy in function revealed in this study might be an explanation for why siRNA screens in human and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> cells have yet to identify F-BAR proteins as important players in the cell division process in those organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Echard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eggert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kittler et al., 2007</xref>). Functional redundancy in the cell division process might be expected, as a robustly constructed and well-tethered contractile ring would decrease the likelihood of errors during cytokinesis.</p><p>What proteins are recruited through the Cdc15 and Imp2 SH3 domains? We have identified two here, Pxl1 and Fic1, but there are most likely others. Biochemical purification of Cdc15 SH3 domain&#x02013;interacting proteins identified a dozen candidates that contain multiple PXXP motifs and localize to the contractile ring and/or cell tips (unpublished data). Some nonoverlapping partners might also exist based on our findings that Imp2 (but not Cdc15) can be pulled from lysates by recombinant ubiquitin, presumably through its SH3 domain (Fig. S2 D), that a small percentage (2.3%) of <italic>cdc15-imp2SH3</italic> fusion&#x02013;expressing cells still show cytokinetic defects, and that Fic1 binds the two SH3 domains with somewhat different affinities. On this note, it will be informative to compare the overall binding specificities of these two SH3 domains even though the SH3 domain of Imp2 seems largely capable of replacing that of Cdc15. Clearly, the next step in expanding our understanding of how a mature contractile ring is constructed is to characterize other binding partners for the Cdc15 SH3 domain, to determine whether each of these proteins binds to Imp2, and also to investigate whether other domains within the SH3-interacting proteins provide additional protein-tethering and/or membrane-binding capabilities.</p><p>What roles do SH3-binding proteins play at the contractile ring? Consistent with previous work emphasizing a role for Cdc15 in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wachtler et al., 2006</xref>), loss of just the Cdc15 SH3 domain results in cells taking longer to undergo constriction and abscission. This late role for the SH3 domain of Cdc15 suggests that some of its binding partners might play roles in ring remodeling or vesicle trafficking. Fic1 might contribute to contractile ring stability by reinforcing interaction between the ring and membrane through its C2 domain; this model is supported by evidence that the <italic>fic1</italic> homologue in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, <italic>cts1</italic>, binds phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fox et al., 2003</xref>). If the Fic1 C2 domain binds membranes, this would mean that Cdc15 and Imp2 bind the plasma membrane directly through their N-terminal F-BAR domains and indirectly through their SH3 domains. We note that a significant fraction of Cdc15 is immobile in the ring as determined by FRAP analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clifford et al., 2008</xref>) and that this property of Cdc15 is compromised with the loss of the SH3 domain. Higher order redundancy of membrane tethering at the contractile ring might secure the ring, especially when forces increase during constriction. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Inn1 tethers the contractile ring to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanchez-Diaz et al., 2008</xref>), and this tethering may be accomplished through the F-BAR protein Hof1 as a result of their interaction in yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ito et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tong et al., 2002</xref>). Unlike Fic1, Inn1 plays an essential role in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cytokinesis. One possibility for differences in the relative requirements for <italic>fic1</italic> and <italic>INN1</italic> might be that the actomyosin ring is connected to the cell cortex by many more proteins in <italic>S. pombe</italic> than in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Fic1 shares some similarity to human MCTP1/2 (26% and 27%, respectively) and TOLLIP1; although these proteins have no described role in cytokinesis, it is intriguing to think that they (and/or another of the 343 C2 domain&#x02013;containing human proteins) might be acting orthologously to Fic1, Inn1, and Cts1. Also, although no clear paralogue of Fic1 exists in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, 5 of its 15 C2 domain&#x02013;containing proteins localize to the contractile ring or septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsuyama et al., 2006</xref>), raising the possibility that they might act in concert with Fic1 during <italic>S. pombe</italic> cytokinesis.</p><p>The N-terminus of Pxl1 has been shown previously to target it to the contractile ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pinar et al., 2008</xref>). This is consistent with our findings that the N terminus of Pxl1 binds the SH3 domain of Cdc15 and that Pxl1 requires SH3 domains to localize. Paxillins are large scaffolding proteins important for recruiting other adaptors and enzymes to focal adhesions (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schaller, 2001</xref>), and, therefore, it is likely that once Pxl1 has been recruited through SH3 domain interactions, it complexes with yet other proteins to anchor and extend the contractile ring. Interestingly, paxillin was recently found to be essential for mammalian cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shafikhani et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>When are SH3 domain&#x02013;interacting proteins recruited by Cdc15 and Imp2? Imp2 localizes to the contractile ring before anaphase onset but does not localize to nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demeter and Sazer, 1998</xref>; unpublished data), suggesting that its recruitment to the contractile ring occurs after that of Cdc15. Likewise, neither Pxl1 nor Fic1 localizes to nodes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ge and Balasubramanian, 2008</xref>), indicating that SH3 domain binding partners are not recruited concomitantly with Cdc15. We note that although <italic>cdc15<sub>&#x00394;SH3</sub> imp2<sub>&#x00394;SH3</sub></italic> cells form nascent contractile rings, rings were not observed in any <italic>cdc15<sub>&#x00394;SH3</sub> imp2<sub>&#x00394;SH3</sub></italic> cells beginning to septate. We speculate that when forces on the ring increase at the onset of constriction and when scaffolding protein Mid1 leaves the contractile ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sohrmann et al., 1996</xref>), the integration of additional proteins might be especially important to prevent ring collapse. What regulates the timing of recruitment of these proteins? Given that Cdc15, Imp2, Fic1, and Pxl1 are all phosphoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fankhauser et al., 1995</xref>; unpublished data), we suspect that phosphoregulation is involved. Also, among the many proteins recruited to the site of cell division are other modifiers of protein function, including ubiquitinating and deubiquitinating enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hermand et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsuyama et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, in addition to exposing the shared role of the SH3 domains of Cdc15 and Imp2, we have shown that Cdc15<sub>&#x00394;SH3</sub> can perform the essential function of Cdc15; our previous observation that Cdc12 and Myo1 are recruited by the F-BAR domain of Cdc15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carnahan and Gould, 2003</xref>) might be key to its essential role in contractile ring assembly. It is noteworthy that Imp2 cannot compensate for this essential role, even when overproduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demeter and Sazer, 1998</xref>). Imp2<sub>&#x00394;SH3</sub> also fulfilled the major cytokinetic role of Imp2, suggesting that its key function in cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demeter and Sazer, 1998</xref>) is also performed by another domain. Based on the presence of F-BAR domains, one common function of the Cdc15 and Imp2 N termini is likely to be inducing or maintaining membrane curvature. That two PCH family members contribute to cytokinesis with a common SH3 domain function raises the question of whether their F-BAR domains cause similar or distinct membrane curvatures. If the curvatures generated by the two F-BAR domains differ, perhaps it is important to balance their presence temporally to achieve membrane remodeling events key to successful cytokinesis.</p><p>In light of the unexpected functional overlap between the SH3 domains of Cdc15 and Imp2 as well as the distinction in function between their F-BAR and SH3 domains, it will be interesting to consider for other PCH family proteins (a) to what extent SH3 domains are required for endogenous functions, (b) to what extent SH3 domains of proteins in this family act redundantly, and (c) whether F-BAR domains are involved in additional protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Because some family members such as FCHO1/2 and PSTPIP2 and alternatively spliced versions of Cip4 lack SH3 domains entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dombrosky-Ferlan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katoh and Katoh, 2004</xref>), it would not be surprising to find that many PCH proteins engage in protein&#x02013;protein interactions mediated by their F-BAR domains or else the gulf of protein sequence between F-BAR and SH3 domains, the function of which is undefined in any family member. The shared essential function of the SH3 domains of Cdc15 and Imp2 shown in this study, combined with the observation that many PCH family members in higher eukaryotes bind the same proteins through their SH3 domains (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chitu and Stanley, 2007</xref>) suggest a degree of cooperation between PCH family members as a whole that might be necessary for the completion of a variety of biological processes that involve membrane curvature remodeling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains, media, and genetic methods</title><p>Strains (Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806044/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806044/DC1</ext-link>) were grown in yeast extract (YE) media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moreno et al., 1991</xref>) except for the large-scale purification, which was grown in 2 liters of 4&#x000d7; YE media. <italic>nda3</italic>-km311 cells were grown at 32&#x000b0;C and arrested at 17&#x000b0;C for 7 h. <italic>cdc15</italic>, <italic>fic1</italic>, <italic>imp2</italic>, and <italic>bzz1</italic> were tagged endogenously at the 3&#x02032; termini with GFP, CFP, YFP, TAP, FLAG<sub>3</sub>, HA<sub>3</sub>, mCherry, or linker-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sandblad et al., 2006</xref>) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bahler et al., 1998</xref>).
