Surfactant protein A (SP-A) contributes positively to pulmonary host defenses against a variety of bacteria, viruses, and fungi in part by promoting the recognition and phagocytosis of these pathogens by alveolar macrophages. In the present study we investigated the role of SP-A as a mediator of host defense against the pulmonary pathogen, <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. Previous studies have shown that SP-A binds to acapsular and minimally encapsulated strains of <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays we confirmed that SP-A does not directly bind to a fully encapsulated strain of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (H99). However, we observed that when <italic>C. neoformans</italic> was incubated in bronchoalveolar fluid, SP-A binding was detected, suggesting that another alveolar host factor may enable SP-A binding. Indeed, we discovered that SP-A binds encapsulated <italic>C. neoformans</italic> via a previously unknown IgG dependent mechanism. The consequence of this interaction was the inhibition of IgG-mediated phagocytosis of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> by alveolar macrophages. Therefore, to assess the contribution of SP-A to the pulmonary host defenses we compared <italic>in vivo</italic> infections using SP-A null mice (<italic>SP-A-/-</italic>) and wild-type mice in an intranasal infection model. We found that the immune response assessed by cellular counts, TNF&#x003b1; cytokine production, and fungal burden in lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids during early stages of infection were equivalent. Furthermore, the survival outcome of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> infection was equivalent in <italic>SP-A-/-</italic> and wild-type mice. Our results suggest that unlike a variety of bacteria, viruses, and other fungi, progression of disease with an inhalational challenge of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> does not appear to be negatively or positively affected by SP-A mediated mechanisms of pulmonary host defense.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is an environmentally ubiquitous fungal pathogen that is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised hosts. In humans, a pulmonary infection occurs following inhalation of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> cells. The identity of the infectious propagule remains unknown but is presumed to be either small, poorly encapsulated, desiccated yeasts or basidiospores. Hematogenous dissemination of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> from the lungs to the central nervous system can result in cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, a life-threatening complication that requires aggressive chemotherapeutic intervention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001370-Mitchell1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In healthy hosts, initiation of an innate and adaptive cellular immune response limits the severity of the infection to an asymptomatic and often self-resolving pulmonary infection in most cases.

The rationale for studying an encapsulated fully virulent strain was two-fold. First, acapsular strains of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> are uniformly avirulent, not clinically relevant and thus would not be suitable for investigating the role of SP-A as a mediator of host defense. Second, if a desiccated yeast form or basidiospore of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> were inhaled, rapid rehydration of capsule occurs in airway structures and the capsular structure is expected to be a major factor in the initial host-pathogen pulmonary interaction. We, therefore, initiated our study by first investigating the direct binding of SP-A to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (H99). Using <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays we confirmed that SP-A does not directly bind to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> but, we did discover an IgG dependent mechanism that does enable SP-A binding to <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. <italic>SP-A-/-</italic> mice and a murine cryptococcosis inhalation infection model were then used to investigate the role of SP-A in host defense against <italic>C. neoformans</italic>.

It is possible that the absence of SP-A binding to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> is also due to charge repulsion. Since the concentrations of SP-A used in our <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays were comparable or even higher than those thought to exist in the lungs of healthy individuals under physiological conditions (1 to 2 &#x000b5;g/ml) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001370-Walenkamp1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, it is unlikely that the binding deficiency was simply due to limited availability of SP-A.</p><p>This is the first report that has demonstrated IgG dependent binding of SP-A to a microorganism. Several lines of evidence suggest that this occurs via a mechanism in which IgG first binds to <italic>C. neoformans</italic> capsule and then SP-A binds to bound IgG. First, we showed that SP-A binding was not inhibited by EDTA, demonstrating that the SP-A carbohydrate recognition domain was not required. This ruled out the possibility of SP-A binding to carbohydrate ligands that may have been exposed as a result of anti-GXM IgG binding. Second, SP-A binding inhibited the IgG dependent phagocytosis of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> yeast by alveolar macrophages. This observation suggested that SP-A binding functionally interfered with IgG binging to the Fc&#x003b3; receptor on the cell surface of alveolar macrophages, which is required for phagocytosis in the case of <italic>C. neoformans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001370-Mitchell1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Third, a recent study in our laboratory showed that SP-A can bind directly to the Fc portion of IgG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001370-Lin1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Since SP-A was used at physiologically relevant concentrations for these studies, our results suggest that this interaction could occur under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions.</p><p>SP-A mediated mechanisms of host defense provide protection against several pathogenic fungi. For example, SP-A enhances the phagocytosis and killing of <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> conidia by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001370-Madan1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, administration of SP-A to mice with invasive aspergillosis rescued them from death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001370-Kishor1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies with <italic>SP-A-/-</italic> mice have shown that SP-A deficiency results in increased susceptibility to infection by <italic>P. jiroveci</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001370-Atochina1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>H. capsulatum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001370-McCormack2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this is not the case for <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. The end points analyzed in our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies clearly demonstrated an equivalent progression and outcome of disease in <italic>SP-A-/-</italic> and wild-type mice.</p><p>Another mechanism by which SP-A can mediate host defense is via direct modulation of alveolar macrophage function. SP-A can reduce reactive oxygen intermediate production by alveolar macrophages via the down regulation of NADPH oxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001370-Crowther1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, alveolar macrophages in <italic>SP-A-/-</italic> mice would be expected to produce increased levels of reactive oxygen species as compared to wild-type mice. This up regulation of reactive oxygen species however would not be expected to have a significant effect on <italic>C. neoformans</italic> colonization of the lungs since <italic>C. neoformans</italic> possesses a highly robust antioxidant defense system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001370-Giles1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001370-Giles3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and the absence or presence of SP-A had no impact on yeast growth, host immune cell recruitment or cytokine production.
