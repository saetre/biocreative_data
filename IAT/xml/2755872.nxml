We explored activation of neuronal &#x003b1;7 and mammalian muscle AChRs by morantel and oxantel. Our results revealed a novel action of morantel as a high efficacy and more potent agonist than ACh of &#x003b1;7 receptors. The EC<sub>50</sub> for activation by morantel of both &#x003b1;7 and &#x003b1;7-5HT<sub>3A</sub> receptors is 7-fold lower than that determined for ACh. The minimum morantel concentration required to activate &#x003b1;7-5HT<sub>3A</sub> channels is 6-fold lower than that of ACh, and activation episodes are more prolonged than in the presence of ACh. By contrast, oxantel is a weak agonist of &#x003b1;7 and &#x003b1;7-5HT<sub>3A</sub>, and both drugs are very low efficacy agonists of muscle AChRs. The replacement of Gln<sup>57</sup> in &#x003b1;7 by glycine, which is found in the equivalent position of the muscle AChR, decreases the efficacy for activation and turns morantel into a partial agonist. The reverse mutation in the muscle AChR (&#x003f5;G57Q) increases 7-fold the efficacy of morantel. The mutations do not affect activation by ACh or oxantel, indicating that this position is selective for morantel. <italic>In silico</italic> studies show that the tetrahydropyrimidinyl group, common to both drugs, is close to Trp<sup>149</sup> of the principal face of the binding site, whereas the other cyclic group is proximal to Gln<sup>57</sup> of the complementary face in morantel but not in oxantel. Thus, position 57 at the complementary face is a key determinant of the high selectivity of morantel for &#x003b1;7. These results provide new information for further progress in drug design.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>3</sup></xref> members of the Cys-loop receptor superfamily, are of fundamental importance in synaptic transmission throughout the nervous system in both vertebrates and invertebrates. They are implicated in a wide range of important pathologies and are targets of clinically relevant drugs. AChRs are pentameric proteins composed of highly homologous subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Subunits are classified as either &#x003b1;, which contain a disulfide bridge formed by two adjacent cysteine residues important for acetylcholine (ACh) binding, or non-&#x003b1; subunits, which lack this motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>AChRs assemble from five identical &#x003b1; subunits, forming homomeric receptors, such as neuronal &#x003b1;7 receptors, or from different &#x003b1; and non-&#x003b1; subunits, forming heteromeric receptors, such as the muscle AChR. Human adult muscle AChRs are composed of two &#x003b1;1, one &#x003b2;, one &#x003f5;, and one &#x003b4; subunits. The five homologous subunits are arranged as barrel staves around a central ion-conducting pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Approximately half of each subunit is extracellular with the remainder comprising transmembrane domains M1&#x02013;M4 and a large cytoplasmic domain spanning M3 and M4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The neurotransmitter binding sites are formed within the extracellular domain at interfaces between subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). One of the sides, called the principal face, is formed by three discontinuous loops of the &#x003b1; subunit, whereas the complementary face is formed by three discontinuous &#x003b2;-strands of the adjacent subunit. Key residues of the principal face are grouped in regions called loop A (Trp<sup>86</sup> and Tyr<sup>93</sup>), loop B (Trp<sup>149</sup> and Gly<sup>153</sup>), and loop C (Tyr<sup>190</sup>, Cys<sup>192</sup>, Cys<sup>193</sup>, and Tyr<sup>198</sup>). The complementary face is formed by residues from &#x003b1;7 or &#x003b4; or &#x003f5; subunits in the adult muscle AChR. At this face of the muscle AChR, residues are clustered in loop D (Trp<sup>55</sup>), E (Leu<sup>109</sup>, Tyr<sup>111</sup>, Tyr<sup>117</sup>, and Leu<sup>119</sup>), and F (Asp<sup>174</sup> and Glu<sup>176</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Residues of the principal face are highly conserved between &#x003b1;7 and &#x003b1;1 subunits, whereas less conservation is found in residues located at the complementary face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>The anthelmintic agents levamisole, pyrantel, oxantel, and morantel are full agonists of nematode muscle AChRs, and exert their therapeutic actions by producing muscle paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). By contrast, levamisole and pyrantel have been shown to be low efficacy agonists of mammalian muscle AChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). A few lines of experimental evidence suggest that these compounds also interact with some types of neuronal AChRs, but instead of acting as agonists, they act as modulators. Morantel and levamisole have been shown to allosterically potentiate responses of &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;2 and &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;4 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus, the actions of anthelmintic agents seem to be strongly dependent on the AChR subtype. Therefore, these compounds are useful tools for the identification of determinants of drug selectivity, which, in turn, is required for rational design of novel and more specific drugs.</p><p>We have here determined that, similarly to pyrantel and levamisole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), morantel and oxantel are low efficacy agonists of mammalian muscle AChRs. However, whereas oxantel is also a weak agonist of &#x003b1;7, morantel is more potent than ACh. By site-directed mutagenesis we determined that position 57, located at the complementary face of the binding site, is involved in the differential selectivity of morantel for &#x003b1;7 and mammalian muscle AChR.</p><p>Neuronal &#x003b1;7 receptors may be involved in a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders that lead to cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Given that its deficit is associated with cognitive impairment in these diseases, enhancement of its activity has recently emerged as a physiological and effective therapeutic strategy. Therefore, the characterization of the novel action of morantel as a potent agonist of &#x003b1;7 together with the identification of the structural basis of this high selectivity become of importance as they provide new information for further progress in drug design.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Site-directed Mutagenesis and Expression of &#x003b1;7, Muscle AChR, and &#x003b1;7-5HT<sub>3A</sub> Receptors</title><p>Mutant subunits were constructed using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Strategene, Inc.) and were confirmed by sequencing.

Thus, although oxantel and morantel are both tetrahydropyrimidines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), we here determined that their actions at &#x003b1;7 receptors are very different.</p><p>The molecular structures of morantel and oxantel have in common the 1-methyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine group and differ in the other ring, which is a 3-methyl-2-thienyl group in morantel and 3-hydroxy-phenyl in oxantel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). We have previously shown that pyrantel, an analog of morantel that lacks the methyl group on the thiophene ring, is also a full agonist of &#x003b1;7-5HT<sub>3A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Interestingly, the EC<sub>50</sub> of pyrantel at the chimeric receptor is about 2-fold higher than that of morantel. The comparison of the structure-function relationships suggests that the additional methyl group in the thienyl ring in morantel increases the potency of the compound as an agonist.</p><p>In contrast to their actions at &#x003b1;7 receptors, morantel and oxantel act as low efficacy agonists of mammalian muscle AChRs. We have previously shown that pyrantel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) and levamisole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) are also very weak agonists of this AChR type. Thus, all anthelmintic compounds characterized so far are weak agonists of mammalian muscle AChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). On the other hand, most of these drugs act as full agonists of nematode muscle levamisole-sensitive AChRs, which is the basis for their therapeutic anthelmintic actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Thus, understanding the determinants of selectivity of these drugs for AChR subtypes will also help to develop novel anthelmintic drugs.</p><p>Our study reveals that the residue at position 57 located in the complementary side of the binding pocket is a key site that determines the action of morantel at &#x003b1;7 AChRs. This position is differentially conserved among subunits. It is glycine in all mammalian &#x003f5; subunits, glutamic or aspartic acid in &#x003b4; subunits, and glutamine in all &#x003b1;7 subunits. If the glutamine residue in &#x003b1;7 is replaced by glycine the efficacy for activation by morantel decreases, and if the reverse mutation is performed in the &#x003f5; subunit (&#x003f5;G57Q), the efficacy of morantel to activate muscle AChRs increases significantly. Although the results show that this position is an important determinant of selectivity, additional residues may be involved because the effects are not fully reversed by the mutations. We have previously shown that mutations at two residues of loop E (Asn<sup>111</sup> and Gln<sup>117</sup>) affect similarly activation by pyrantel and ACh of &#x003b1;7-5HT<sub>3A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Thus, these residues seem not to be determinants of selectivity for morantel, which agrees with orientation 1 for morantel. It is possible that the effects of mutations at loop E on activation may not be due to a direct interaction between the agonists and the receptor. The docking models will provide further information to identify additional determinants of morantel selectivity.</p><p>No changes were observed when the equivalent residue was mutated in the &#x003b4; subunit (&#x003b4;D57Q). This result reveals that the drug binds differentially to both interfaces and that the strong activation is mediated mainly by the &#x003b1;-&#x003f5; interface. It is also possible that morantel does not bind to the &#x003b1;-&#x003f5; interface except in the presence of the &#x003f5;G57Q mutation. In this scenario, the brief openings would correspond to openings of single-liganded receptors, and by allowing binding of morantel to the second interface, the mutation would lead to more prolonged openings arising from biliganded receptors.</p><p>We also determined that position 57 is not involved in ACh or oxantel activation. However, it is involved in pyrantel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), and in the sensitivity of &#x003b1;7 to neonicotinoid insecticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Therefore, this residue appears to function as a determinant of selectivity for a broader spectrum of drugs. Because morantel enhances &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), it would be interesting to test if position 57 is involved in this effect.</p><p>Cation-&#x003c0; interactions have been shown to be important in ACh binding and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Aromatic amino acids at the agonist binding site provide a region of negative electrostatic potential for agonists with positive charge. By docking morantel and oxantel into the extracellular domain of &#x003b1;7 we determined that the methyl-tetrahydropyrimidinyl ring (present in both anthelmintic drugs) is located near Trp<sup>149</sup> of loop B in the principal face, with which it could form a cation-&#x003c0; interaction. Previous studies revealed that &#x003b1;Trp<sup>149</sup> forms such an interaction with the quaternary ammonium group of ACh in the bound state of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), as does nicotine with Trp<sup>149</sup> of loop B in brain receptors and AChBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Our functional data support an orientation of morantel in the &#x0201c;horizontal&#x0201d; position (orientation 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), where the methyl-thienyl group has the potential to interact with Gln<sup>57</sup> (&#x0003c;3 &#x000c5;), and oxantel in the &#x0201c;vertical&#x0201d; position (orientation 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>), where the hydroxy-phenyl group is located at a considerable distance from Gln<sup>57</sup> (&#x0003e;6 &#x000c5;). Further studies, ideally high resolution structures, are needed to confirm these molecular locations, but the considerable differences in orientations of these two similar molecules in the binding site can explain the significant differences in efficacy.</p><p>In conclusion, we have determined that morantel is a potent agonist of &#x003b1;7 and have identified a Gln residue at position 57 as a determinant for morantel selectivity among AChR subtypes. This information provides new insights for molecular modeling and drug screening, which, in turn, will contribute to the development of novel and more selective drugs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported in part by grants from the Universidad Nacional del Sur, Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnolog&#x000ed;ca, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient&#x000ed;ficas y T&#x000e9;cnicas, Loreal-United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, Fundaci&#x000f3;n F.
