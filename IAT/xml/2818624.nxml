Pax6 has been identified as an essential regulator for the development of the central nervous system (CNS), eyes, nose, pancreas and pituitary gland, mostly through study of the phenotypes of several mouse and rat lines that possess either a spontaneous or an artificial mutation in their <italic>Pax6 </italic>gene. Although <italic>Pax6 </italic>heterozygous mutant mice/rats with a semi-dominant mutation are known as <italic>Small eye </italic>(<italic>Sey</italic>) mutants and can be bred, their homozygous mutant embryos die soon after birth and exhibit severe phenotypes such as a lack of eyes and nose as well as brain malformation. One of the rat <italic>Small eye </italic>strains, <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>, has a spontaneous single-base insertion in the coding region of <italic>Pax6 </italic>that creates an abnormal stop codon downstream of the PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, in Western blot analysis using an antibody against the PD of Pax6, truncated Pax6 protein was not detected in homozygous (<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>) embryos, although we detected truncated Pax6 protein in E10.5 <italic>Sey/Sey </italic>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>embryos are suitable models for analyzing the role of the Pax6 transcription factor.</p><p>In the development of the mammalian brain, Pax6 is expressed in specific spatiotemporal patterns. Pax6 is expressed in proliferating neuroepithelial cells immediately prior to the onset of neurogenesis on embryonic day 10 (E10) in rats (which corresponds to E8 in mice) and is localized to the forebrain, hindbrain and spinal cord. Pax6 regulates a variety of developmental events, including the patterning of the forebrain, hindbrain and spinal cord as well as subsequent neuronal specification, formation of neural circuits and neuronal migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, Pax6 is involved in neurogenesis, i.e., the proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells and production of neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and also in the differentiation of astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The multiple functions of Pax6 are very likely exerted through the activation of its various downstream target genes.</p><p>We previously used DNA microarray analysis to demonstrate that the brain-type fatty acid binding protein (<italic>Fabp7</italic>) gene is markedly down-regulated in both the forebrain and the hindbrain of E12.5 <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>rats (which correspond to E10.5 mice) and is required for the maintenance of proliferating neural stem cells in the developing rat cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Three other DNA microarray studies comparing the developing telencephalon of the <italic>Pax6 </italic>mutant mouse with that of the wild-type (WT) identified other Pax6 downstream genes such as <italic>mEvf1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], <italic>Ctnnd2 </italic>(<italic>&#x003b4;-catenin</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], <italic>Starb2</italic>, <italic>Nfia</italic>, <italic>AP-2&#x003b3;</italic>, <italic>NeuroD6</italic>, <italic>Ngn2</italic>, <italic>Tbr2</italic>, <italic>Bhlhb5 </italic>and the retinoic acid (RA) signaling molecule <italic>Rlbp1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Recently, Pax6 target genes were identified in the developing mouse neocortex using ChIP-chip analysis in combination with transcriptome analyses, revealing Pax6-regulated transcriptional networks in the E12.5 mouse cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Compared with these telencephalon data, less information exists on downstream genes of Pax6 in the hindbrain, although Pax6 is crucial in the development of hindbrain motor neurons, the cerebellum and the precerebellar nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome profiles of E11.5 <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>and WT rats to comprehensively identify downstream genes of Pax6 in the early stage of hindbrain development. We were able to select genes with significantly different expression using quadruplicate microarray data processed via two comparative analyses; we then confirmed the fold changes using quantitative RT-PCR. Gene ontology analyses revealed that a number of the differentially expressed genes encode signaling molecules as well as transcription factors related to development. Detailed analyses of the expression patterns of these downstream genes, including <italic>Dbx1</italic>, <italic>Unc5h1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp26b1</italic>, as well as several hindbrain-specific markers unexpectedly revealed anteroposterior patterning defects in the <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>hindbrain that may be related to altered expression of Cyp26b1, a retinoic acid (RA)-metabolizing enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Comprehensive transcriptome analyses in E11.5 <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>and WT rat hindbrains</title><p>We performed the microarray experiments using GeneChip Rat Expression Set 230 (RAE230A and RAE230B), which contains about 30,000 probe sets that are expected to cover almost all genes. The two methods of comprehensive transcriptome analyses are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. Four sets of <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>and WT 'target' samples were prepared from mRNA independently extracted from 40 hindbrains of E11.5 embryos and were subjected to comparison analyses using Microarray Suite (MAS). In parallel, raw data derived from eight absolute analyses per sub-chip by MAS were exported to GeneSpring, normalized, averaged and compared. Ideally, each of the two fold-change values from both procedures should match.</p><p>All genes on the arrays were plotted on a logarithmic scale in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> according to their normalized signal intensities in the hindbrain of E11.5 WT (horizontal axis) and <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>(vertical axis) rat embryos using GeneSpring. Up- and down-regulated genes are indicated in red and green, respectively. The use of four replicates greatly improved erratic patterns in areas of low signal intensity, in which data were widely spread in each of these analyses (data not shown). We did not exclude genes with the MAS-absent (A) flag from subsequent analyses because some of the genes judged to be absent (A) in all samples, such as <italic>Ncam1</italic>, are known to have a low expression level and/or a restricted expression pattern in the E11.5 hindbrain. For accurate selection of differentially expressed genes, we performed <italic>t</italic>-tests using the cross-gene error model for all genes instead of using the fold change threshold. The 1,421 selected genes with <italic>p</italic>-values less than 0.05 consisted of 737 up-regulated and 684 down-regulated genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). The up- and down-regulated genes that had relatively smaller (&#x0003c; 2-fold) changes (within the blue lines in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>) passed the <italic>t</italic>-test at middle and higher signal intensities (&#x0003e; 0.3 in both WT and <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>), but were discarded at the lower signal intensity (&#x0003c; 0.3 in either WT or <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>). Thus, this strategy enabled us to identify up- and down-regulated genes regardless of expression levels and fold changes.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Scatter plots of gene expression levels in the hindbrain of E11.5 <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>and WT rat embryos</bold>.

GO annotations were collected for the 1,421 selected genes, and 144, 160 and 160 genes were assigned one or more GO terms: cellular component (CC), molecular function (MF), and biological process (BP), respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Downstream molecules corresponding to most of the EST probe sets were neither annotated nor included in the analyses. Because the GO terms provided by the GO consortium are based on a hierarchical clustering, we chose the most suitable GO term for each gene in order to simply sort them into the GO categories shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Categorization by the GO term CC revealed that 75/144 (52%) genes encoded membrane components (green in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Regarding the MF term, 41/160 (26%) and 12/160 (7.5%) genes coded for molecules related to signal transducer (green in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and channel (orange in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) activities, respectively. Genes (26/32, 81%) sorted into the "signal transduction" category of the BP term (green in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) overlapped with the genes categorized as signal transducer and channel activities of the MF term. These results suggest that many downstream molecules of Pax6 that are located in or near the membrane function as signal transducers (e.g., <italic>Htr4</italic>, <italic>Gabrr2</italic>, <italic>Gna15 </italic>and <italic>Fgf9</italic>) that regulate various signaling cascades. Similarly, 23/144 (16%) of the gene products were found to localize in the nucleus (red in the CC, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), and 21/160 (13%) genes encoded transcription factors or DNA binding molecules (purple in the MF, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). As expected, 15/21 (71%) of these transcription factors or DNA binding molecules were classified in the "development" category of the BP term (e.g., <italic>Nkx6-1</italic>, <italic>Ascl1</italic>, <italic>Neurog1 </italic>and <italic>Klf5</italic>, red in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Thus, the GO analyses demonstrated that Pax6 is involved in various signaling pathways where it regulates the expression of many receptors, receptor binding molecules, transporters and transcription factors.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Gene ontology (GO) analyses of the genes that were differentially expressed between <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>and WT rat hindbrains at E11.5</bold>.

After collecting four pools of 40 hindbrains dissected from E11.5 rat embryos of each genotype, we prepared four sets of cDNA pools for comparative microarray analyses. The advantages of our "pooled method" are: (1) the minimization of individual differences in embryonic stage, size and gene expression level and (2) the isolation of a sufficient amount of RNA for microarray analyses without unnatural amplification, even from small embryos. We believe that this "pooled method," although laborious, significantly improves the acquisition of reliable microarray data. Furthermore, comparison analyses of quadruplicate samples using two computational methods allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes that have relatively small fold changes, such as <italic>Camk2n1</italic>, <italic>Hes5 </italic>and <italic>Ctnnd2 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, C</xref>), or low expression levels, such as <italic>Gdf11 </italic>and <italic>Cxcl5 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Confidence, as shown by color strength in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, indicates that the selected genes with a relatively lower fold change were also considered reliably identified in our microarray analyses.</p><p>We have succeeded in minimizing false positive/negative candidates for differentially expressed genes, especially with respect to down-regulated genes. All down-regulated genes showed a similar trend in two comparative microarray analyses and Q-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Only two of 40 tested genes exhibited expression levels in Q-PCR that were inconsistent with their signal intensities from the microarray analyses. We could not perform Q-PCR for the three genes whose signal intensities were less than 1.0. These five genes were up-regulated in the microarray analyses. One reason for this difference is that we designed primers for Q-PCR based on full-length mRNA sequences or Ensembl/N-SCAN/Genscan prediction and not on the same EST sequences used for the probe sets. Transcription of EST domains and full-length mRNA as well as amputation/digestion of mRNA after transcription might be differentially regulated. The other reason for this difference might be the developmental stage of our samples. We used E11.5 rat hindbrains (which correspond to E9.5 in the mouse) in order to look for downstream genes that are directly regulated by Pax6. This stage occurs only 24 h after the onset of Pax6 expression. Therefore, down-regulated expression in <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>is reproducible whereas up-regulated expression, which may be indirect, is not. Reflecting on previous results from the microarray analyses of <italic>Sey/Sey </italic>mice, Duparc et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] analyzed E9.5 <italic>Pax6</italic><sup><italic>LacZ/LacZ </italic></sup>mouse forebrain and showed far fewer up-regulated genes as compared with down-regulated genes in a scatter plot. Other profiling analyses, in which embryos at later stages were used, have reported a larger number of up-regulated genes in <italic>Sey/Sey </italic>mouse telencephalon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This finding might be attributable to the indirect regulation of an increasing number of genes by signal pathway molecules and/or transcription factors that are downstream of Pax6 at later stages of development, after the initiation of Pax6 expression. In our analyses using E11.5 <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>hindbrain, we obtained a slightly larger number of up-regulated genes (737) as compared with down-regulated genes (684), although the number of up-regulated genes with high signal intensities (68, 9.2%) was smaller than that of down-regulated genes (194, 28%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This result also implies the delicacy of the molecular networks that lie downstream of Pax6 because the onset of Pax6 expression in the hindbrain occurs slightly earlier than in the forebrain.</p><p>During the course of our study, we identified multiple probe sets on the RAE230 array that recognized different sequences of the same genes and exhibited widely different signal intensities; these included the probe sets for <italic>Fabp7</italic>, <italic>Unc5h1</italic>, <italic>Cyp26b1</italic>, <italic>Camk2n1</italic>, <italic>Hes5 </italic>and <italic>Ctnnd2 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The variability in signal intensity among multiple probe sets may be due to (1) splicing variants, (2) different gene names and (3) ESTs that had not been integrated into the corresponding mRNA within the rat UniGene database, which was used for designing the probe sets. We used poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA, not total RNA, as a template, which might have resulted in a discrepancy in the signal intensities of different probes that were designed to recognize 3' or 5' sites of relatively long genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Downstream factors of Pax6 clarified by GO analyses</title><p>We performed GO analyses to elucidate the overall features of the molecules downstream of Pax6. The GO analyses shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> revealed that various signaling molecules were located downstream of Pax6.

These results agree with our list of candidate genes that might be regulated by Pax6 in the E11.5 rat hindbrain; such agreement is quite reasonable considering that Ngn2 is reported to be directly induced by Pax6 and to repress Mash1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Downstream genes previously reported in <italic>Pax6 </italic>mutants</title><p>We previously reported that the development of cranial motor neurons in the <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>hindbrain is abnormal; two somatic motor nerve types--the abducent (VI) and hypoglossal (XII) motor neurons--are missing when Pax6 function is lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] owing to the abnormal formation of progenitor domains for these ventral motor neurons along the dorsoventral axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Furthermore, <italic>Unc5h1 </italic>expression was detected in the dorsal part of r7 and in the spinal cord (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D, E</xref>), where <italic>Pax6 </italic>was not detected at E11.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>); however, Pax6 was expressed at an earlier stage in WT and <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/+ (data not shown). In the hindbrain of <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>, almost no expression of <italic>Unc5h1 </italic>was revealed by WISH (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>). From these results, we suspect that expression of <italic>Unc5h1 </italic>is regulated by Pax6 prior to E11.5. In the cerebellum of the <italic>Pax6 </italic>homozygous mutant mouse, <italic>Unc5h3 </italic>expression is completely absent in the external granule cell layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These findings may suggest a common regulation of expression of duplicated <italic>Unc5 </italic>family genes by Pax6.</p><p>Another Pax6 downstream candidate is Cyp26b1, an RA catabolic enzyme. A lack of Cyp26b1 results in the dispersion of the RA signal in the developing limb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. RA is thought to act as a diffusible morphogen that patterns the hindbrain along the anteroposterior axis, and degradation of RA by Cyp26s is a major determinant of spatiotemporally specific RA signaling (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]). RA also alters the migration patterns of cranial neural crest cells in the rat embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We found that <italic>Cyp26b1 </italic>expression was specifically abolished in r5 and r6 in the <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>hindbrain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I, L</xref>). These two rhombomeres express the <italic>kreisler </italic>gene, which encodes the MafB transcription factor, a protein with a critical role in caudal hindbrain patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Maf partners with Pax6 for synergistic transcriptional activation of several <italic>crystallin </italic>and <italic>glucagon </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Therefore, the expression of <italic>Cyp26b1 </italic>in r5 and r6 is assumed to be regulated by Pax6 together with MafB.</p><p>Although knockout mice lacking Cyp26b1 function show no major defects in the hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], two reports describe the contribution of Cyp26b1 to hindbrain development in zebrafish; Hernandez et al. found that injection of a <italic>cyp26b1 </italic>antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) into <italic>cyp26a1 </italic>mutants caused expansion of r4 and an anterior shift of the r6/7 boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Additionally, Reijntjes et al. showed, by preventing the splicing of the <italic>cyp26b1 </italic>transcript in WT embryos using another <italic>cyp26b1 </italic>MO, a reduced rhombomere size and defects in craniofacial structures at later stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In detailed analyses of rhombomeres using a <italic>Krox20 </italic>probe, we observed that the r5 region was broadened anteroposteriorly to some extent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F, L</xref>). This result represents a novel finding that anterior-posterior patterning of the hindbrain is altered in the <italic>Pax6 </italic>mutant. Consistent with this result, we found a slight up-regulation of <italic>Krox20 </italic>(1.63- and 1.31-fold change with two probe sets, but it should be noted that <italic>p </italic>&#x0003e; 0.05).</p><p>Recently, the <italic>Hoxd4 </italic>gene was reported to be a direct target of <italic>Pax6. Hoxd4 </italic>expression in r7 and the spinal cord is reduced to some extent in the <italic>Pax6 </italic>mutant mouse embryo, and double knock-down of <italic>pax6a </italic>and <italic>pax6b </italic>with MOs resulted in malformed rhombomere boundaries and an anteriorized <italic>hoxd4a </italic>expression border in the zebrafish embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In our microarray analyses, <italic>Hoxd4 </italic>showed slight down-regulation with statistical significance (1.37-fold; <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05), although its expression level was quite high, even in the <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>hindbrain (normalized intensity 3.332 vs. 4.581 in WT). Therefore, we consider that a loss of Pax6 function affects the anteroposterior patterning of r5 by <italic>Cyp26b1 </italic>down-regulation rather than by regulation of <italic>Hoxd4 </italic>gene expression.</p><p>The anteroposterior defect that we observed in the <italic>Pax6 </italic>mutant hindbrain was very mild as compared with that of phenotypes induced by excess RA (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]). It would be interesting to determine how mildly elevated levels of RA signaling affect rhombomere formation and subsequent neural function.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We identified <italic>Unc5h1 </italic>and <italic>Cyp26b1 </italic>as novel downstream genes of Pax6 in the early development of the hindbrain. In addition, the broadening of the r5 region in <italic>Pax6 </italic>mutant embryos raises the possibility that Pax6 regulates the anterior-posterior patterning of the hindbrain via activation of the RA-metabolizing enzyme Cyp26b1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>The procedures for preparing rat <italic>Small eye </italic>(<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>) mutant and normal Sprague-Dawley (WT) embryos and for genotyping by mutation-specific PCR with genomic DNA extracted from each yolk sac have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. All experimental procedures described in this study were approved by the Committee for Animal Experimentation of the Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray analysis</title><p>Microarray analyses were performed using the GeneChip Rat Expression Arrays RAE230A and 230B (Affymetrix), which contain 31,042 probe sets that were designed from sequences in the UniGene database (NCBI, Build 99). The probe sets on RAE230A consist of the sequences from 4,699 full-length cDNAs, 700 non-ESTs and 10,467 ESTs. All 15,176 probe sets on RAE230B were derived from EST sequences.</p><p>Total RNA was prepared using TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen) from 40 hindbrains dissected from E11.5 <italic>Pax6 </italic>homozygous mutant (<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>) or WT rat embryos. Poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA was isolated with the Oligotex-dT30 &#x0003c;Super&#x0003e; mRNA Purification kit (TaKaRa). The RNA quality and concentration were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and NanoDrop spectrometry (NanoDrop Technologies). The following method for the preparation of target cRNAs is similar to that in our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. mRNA (2 &#x003bc;g) and a T7-linked oligo(dT) primer were used to generate first-strand cDNA with the SuperScript Choice System (Invitrogen). After second-strand synthesis, double-stranded cDNAs were purified via phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. <italic>In vitro </italic>transcription of the cDNA pools was performed using a BioArray HighYield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo) in the presence of biotinylated UTP and CTP, resulting in approximately 100-fold amplification of biotin-labeled cRNAs. The cRNAs were purified using RNeasy Mini Spin Columns (QIAGEN) and fragmented at 94&#x000b0;C for 35 min in fragmentation buffer (30 mM magnesium acetate, 100 mM potassium acetate and 40 mM Tris-acetate, pH 8.1). The resultant target cRNA fragments (20 &#x003bc;g) were mixed with spike controls, divided into two sub-chips (RAE230A and RAE230B Arrays), and hybridized with the oligonucleotide probes on the GeneChip at 45&#x000b0;C for 16 h according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After washing and streptavidin-phycoerythrin staining steps, fluorescence signals were enhanced with a biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibody using the Affymetrix fluidics station (EukGE-WS2 protocol) and detected with the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner. Array images were assessed by eye to confirm scanner alignment and the absence of significant bubbles or scratches on the chip surface. Experiments using 40 hindbrains were repeated four times in each genotype, i.e., four pools of 40 hindbrains per genotype were used for preparing four 'target' cRNA pools per genotype, and each of the cRNA pools was hybridized to one RAE230 array.</p><p>Using Microarray Suite (MAS) 5 (Affymetrix), we performed absolute analyses for each chip to obtain raw signal intensity data as well as present (P), absent (A) and marginal (M) flags. In the MAS expression reports, 3'/5' ratios for <italic>GAPDH </italic>and &#x003b2;-<italic>actin </italic>were confirmed to be within acceptable limits (1.69 &#x000b1; 0.69 and 1.73 &#x000b1; 1.01), and <italic>BioB </italic>spike controls were found to be present on all of the chips, with <italic>BioC</italic>, <italic>BioDN </italic>and <italic>CreX </italic>also present in increasing intensity. In addition, four independent sets of comparison analyses were performed using MAS to obtain four signal log<sub>2 </sub>ratios of <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>to WT per gene. n was calculated as the average of the four signal log<sub>2 </sub>ratios, and 2<sup>n </sup>corresponds to the fold change value of the gene.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis by GeneSpring software</title><p>In further analyses, all raw signal data were exported from MAS .CHP files and imported to GeneSpring 7 software (Agilent). The raw data were transformed to set measurements of less than 0.01 to 0.01 in order to display all of the data on a logarithmic scale. In order to fit the gene expression levels from the 230A and 230B arrays, data were normalized against positive control genes and genes common to both 230A and 230B. They were then used in the following expression data analyses. The "fold change" value is the ratio of the average normalized signal intensity of <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>to that of WT for up-regulated genes (<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>&#x0003e; WT). In the case of down-regulated genes (<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>&#x0003c; WT), the fold change is the negative inverse ratio. Comparative analyses were performed using two confidence filters. First, the data for all genes were normalized per gene for the WT samples. Genes (737) with a <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>p</italic>-value from 0 to 0.05 were selected under the condition that the cross-gene error model was active, but none of the multiple testing corrections was used. For the normalization per gene for the <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>samples, 688 genes passed similar filtering conditions. The genes from the individual filter steps were combined to generate a list of 1,421 genes. No significant change was detected for <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Shh </italic>or <italic>Pax3</italic>, which are expressed in the E11.5 hindbrain but not expected to be regulated by Pax6. In the scatter plots, the dots are colored to reflect the expression levels of the <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>samples normalized per gene for the WT samples, with color density indicating reliability. Because the GeneChip RAE 230 gene titles that were provided by Affymetrix were sometimes incorrect, the master gene table for RAE 230 was updated using GeneSpider, which automatically submitted each gene to three databases: Entrez Gene, GenBank and UniGene. If required, gene annotation was manually submitted to multiple databases including UCSC Genome Browser, NetAffx Analysis Center, RefSeq and LocusLink using Gene Inspector. The GO terms titled "GO cellular component", "GO molecular function" and "GO biological process" were used for GO analyses and are listed in the three columns of the updated master gene table for RAE230.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative PCR</title><p>Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using a LightCycler (Roche), FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche) and the same double-stranded cDNA templates that were used in the microarray analyses. Primer sequences for <italic>Fabp7 </italic>were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Other primer sets were designed to amplify about 100 to 150 bp cDNA fragments (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>) and were synthesized by Nihon Gene Research Laboratories Inc. The level of expression of each mRNA was normalized against that of <italic>GAPDH</italic>, which was amplified as an internal standard from the same cDNA pool. To ascertain whether the correct cDNAs were amplified, the size of the PCR products was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis, and then the sequences were verified by direct sequencing of the amplified fragments using the ABI310 at the Biomedical Research Core of Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In situ </italic>hybridization and immunostaining</title><p>WISH as well as double staining with digoxigenin (DIG)- and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled RNA probes were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To standardize expression levels, WT, <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/+ and <italic>rSey</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>rSey</italic><sup>2 </sup>samples were processed simultaneously. Each cDNA template for the DIG- and FITC-labeled RNA probes was amplified by RT-PCR with the following oligonucleotide primers: <italic>Unc5h1</italic>, 5'-TGCCTGCACACCGCTTCTTG-3' and 5'-GTGGGTGTCGTGTAGGCAGT-3'; <italic>Cyp26b1</italic>, 5'-ATGCTCTTTGAGGGCTTGGAGTTG-3' and 5'-CTACACCGTAGCACTCAACATGGC-3'; <italic>Hoxb1</italic>, 5'-CCGGACCTTCGACTGGATG-3' and 5'-GGTCGGAGGCCTCTCCAGC-3'; <italic>Krox20</italic>, 5'-GAGGCCCCTTTGATCAGATG-3' and 5'-GGAGAGTAGAGGTGGTCCAG-3'. The cDNAs were inserted into the <italic>EcoRV </italic>site of the pBluescript II SK(-) vector (Stratagene). The mouse <italic>EphA4 </italic>cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Y. Hara. The templates for rat <italic>Pax6 </italic>Region B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], rat <italic>Fabp7 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], rat <italic>Dbx1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and mouse <italic>RAR</italic>&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] were described previously. Hindbrains were dissected from the stained embryos, cut along the dorsal midline, placed on a glass slide in an "open-book" configuration and flattened by mounting cover slips. Whole mount immunostaining was essentially performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. AD2.38, a monoclonal antibody raised against the PD of Pax6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], was a gift from Dr. V. van Heyningen. A horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (CHEMICON) was used as the secondary antibody. HRP was visualized by the addition of its substrates, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB; Dojindo), which resulted in a brownish coloration. We confirmed the expression patterns by performing these experiments at least three times.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KN-T designed and performed the microarray experiments, data analyses, immunostaining and WISH.
