The role of the Fas-FasL system has been best characterized in the immune system. Interactions between Fas and FasL are functionally involved in tissue-specific regulation of various immune processes. For example, FasL expression has been detected in immune-privileged tissues, such as the eye and testis, which are protected from destructive immune responses by inducing apoptosis of infiltrating Fas-bearing immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In this way FasL expression in some tissues contributes to their immune-privileged status.</p><p>Endothelial cells express Fas but are normally resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. On the other hand, recent studies have shown that endothelial cells express FasL constitutively and therefore regulate leukocyte extravasation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Administration of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF&#x003b1; down-regulates FasL expression on endothelial cells and promotes inflammation, whereas over-expression of FasL on the endothelium attenuates leukocyte extravasation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. FasL over-expression on the endothelium of arteries also inhibits intimal hyperplasia and ischemia-reperfusion injury in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Thus, up-regulation of FasL expression on the endothelium may contribute to anti-inflammatory reactions by reducing leukocyte transmigration in tissue.</p><p>Oxidants are potential mediators involved in the regulation of FasL expression. Oxidants are highly reactive compounds generated during normal metabolism as well as in various pathological states, such as inflammation, ischemia/reperfusion injury, hyperoxia, and radiation injury. Previous studies have shown that increased oxidative stress induces FasL expression by T-lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], microglial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suggesting that oxidative stress is involved in the FasL-mediated apoptotic mechanism of Fas-bearing target cells. However, little information exists about the role of oxidative stress in FasL expression by endothelial cells. Since endothelial cells are targets of the oxidative stress generated by inflammatory cells, endothelial cells themselves, and exogenous pro-oxidants, such as hyperoxia and cigarette smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], we investigated whether oxidative stress up-regulates FasL expression in endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of the cigarette smoke extracts (CSE)</title><p>Aqueous CS extracts (CSE) were prepared by the method described previously, with a modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Immediately before use, mainstream smoke was generated with one cigarette (Peace<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Japan Tobacco Inc.) by drawing consecutive puffs into a 20-ml plastic syringe with a stopcock connected through one port to a glass vessel containing 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). A 20-ml puff drawn over 1 second was obtained at 10-second intervals. Each puff was held for 3 seconds and bubbled through the PBS for 5 seconds. One cigarette yielded an average of 45 puffs by this procedure. The aqueous CSE was diluted in culture medium before use, and the CSE solutions were prepared by the same person (M.S.) by exactly the same method, and they were used within 5 minutes after preparation.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA).

Increased exposure of the endothelium to oxidants is involved in many pathological states, such as inflammation, ischemia/reperfusion, and atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is one of the most important oxidants derived from leukocytes and endothelial cells. It exerts a toxic effect on susceptible cells at high concentrations, but alters cell functions at low concentrations by modulating signal transduction pathways in certain cells, including endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Cigarette smoke is an important source of oxidants, including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and is thought to be a significant risk factor for chronic endothelial damage leading to atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our results suggest that low oxidant levels induce over-expression of FasL on the endothelium, which prevents inflammatory cell infiltration in tissue. This notion is consistent with our results showing that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-exposed endothelial cells have increased ability to induce apoptosis in neutrophils bearing the Fas receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Thus, FasL expression induced by oxidative stress may function to control inflammatory responses by reducing leukocyte extravasation.</p><p>Our results corroborate those of previous studies examining the effect of oxidative stress on membrane FasL expression in different types of cells, including T-lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], microglial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, the mechanism of FasL expression induced by oxidative stress is unclear. A previous report documented an association between oxidative stress-induced FasL expression and NF-&#x003ba;B activation, although the functional role of NF-&#x003ba;B has not been fully demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Another possible mechanism of oxidative stress-induced FasL expression is tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling molecules, because tyrosine kinase-dependent signals, such as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Jun-N-terminal kinase, have been implicated in FasL expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This possibility is supported by our preliminary experiments showing that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced FasL expression in endothelial cells is enhanced by vanadate, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but reduced by genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (unpublished data).</p><p>Our results show that exposing HUVECs to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>also increases the production of soluble FasL. Although the conversion of membranous FasL to its soluble form reduces its pro-apoptotic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], soluble Fas ligand retains its capacity to interact with Fas, and serum concentrations of soluble FasL are related to the development of vascular diseases. For example, a recent study has shown that patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia or carotid atherosclerosis have decreased serum FasL levels, suggesting endothelial dysfunction that may allow leukocyte infiltration of the vessel wall and lead to atherosclerotic plaque formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In this context, the oxidative stress-induced increase in endothelial soluble FasL production observed in this study may contribute to maintaining homeostasis of the systemic vasculature.</p><p>Oxidative stress has been shown to alter various aspects of endothelial functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], for example, by increasing endothelial adhesiveness to neutrophils via signaling pathways dependent on activation of protein kinase C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], production of platelet-activating factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, oxidative stress is generally thought to promote endothelial injury by enhancing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. In this sense, the endothelial FasL expression in response to oxidative stress demonstrated in this study may play a critical role in preventing endothelial injury by inducing apoptosis of adhering leukocytes.</p><p>We found that the addition of catalase only reduced CSE-induced FasL expression by HUVECs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Thus, an oxidative mechanism mediated by species other than H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>or non-oxidative mechanisms may also be involved in the increase in FasL expression by HUVECs after CSE exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Alternatively, CSE may have inhibited catalase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of our study show that oxidative stress induced by nontoxic concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and CSE increase FasL expression in endothelial cells. This effect may contribute to reductions in leukocyte-mediated inflammation and tissue damage.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SM and KA carried out all of the experiments reported in this manuscript.
