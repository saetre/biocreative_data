If implantation occurs, stromal cells differentiate into decidual cells and near the end of pregnancy, a second wave of apoptosis occurs. This process called decidual regression, is tightly regulated as is it crucial for successful pregnancy. We have previously shown that TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3 are expressed in the endometrium during decidual basalis regression, but although we had demonstrated that TGF- beta1 was involved in the regulation of apoptosis in decidual cells, the ability of TGF- beta2 and TGF-beta3 isoforms to trigger apoptotic mechanisms in these cells remains unknown. Moreover, we hypothesized that the TGF-betas were also present and regulated in the non-pregnant endometrium during the estrous cycle. The aim of the present study was to determine and compare the specific effect of each TGF-&#x003b2; isoform in the regulation of apoptosis in sensitized endometrial stromal cells in vitro, and to investigate the regulation of TGF-beta isoforms in the endometrium during the estrous cycle in vivo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Rats with regular estrous cycle (4 days) were killed at different days of estrous cycle (diestrus, proestrus, estrus and metestrus). Pseudopregnancy was induced with sex steroids in ovariectomized rats and rats were killed at different days (days 1&#x02013;9). Uteri were collected and either fixed for immunohistochemical staining (IHC) or processed for RT-PCR and Western analyses. For the in vitro part of the study, rats were ovariectomized and decidualization was induced using sex steroids. Endometrial stromal decidual cells were purified, cultured and treated with different concentrations of TGF-beta isoforms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our results showed that all three TGF-beta isoforms are present, but are localized differently in the endometrium during the estrous cycle and their expression is regulated differently during pseudopregnancy. In cultured stromal cells, we found that TGF-beta3 isoform induced Smad2 phosphorylation, indicating that the Smad pathway is activated by TGF-beta3 in these cells. Furthermore, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3 induced a dose-dependant increase of apoptosis in cultured stromal cells, as demonstrated by Hoechst nuclear staining. Noteworthy, TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3 reduced the level of the anti-apoptotic XIAP protein, as well as the level of phosphorylated/active Akt, a well known survival protein, in a dose-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Those results suggest that TGF-beta might play an important role in the remodelling endometrium during the estrous cycle and in the regulation of apoptosis in rat decidual cells, in which inhibition of Akt survival pathway might be an important mechanism involved in the regulation of apoptosis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>During the pre-implantation period, the uterine endometrium undergoes morphological and histological changes including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis to provide the best environment for embryo implantation. Sex steroids, estrogen and progesterone, are responsible for these changes during the estrous cycle. Estrogen stimulate cell proliferation whereas progesterone inhibits it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Luminal and glandular epithelium as well as stromal cells proliferate and degenerate in response to cyclic changes in serum steroids hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In absence of embryonic factors, endometrial cells undergo apoptosis or programmed cell death. However, when embryo implantation occurs, many changes begin in the endometrium in which stromal cells proliferate in response to estrogen and progesterone to form the decidual cells, a process called decidualization. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Near the end of the pregnancy, on day 14, decidual cells regress by apoptosis, a phenomenon called decidual regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Our group and others have shown apoptosis in the luminal epithelium at estrus in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] during the estrous cycle; apoptosis was also found in stromal cells at diestrus in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. We have previously shown that Akt, an important kinase involved in the control of endometrial cell proliferation, was decreased at estrus and was accompanied by an increase in apoptosis in luminal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Studies have shown that apoptosis is increased in the rat endometrium during the decidual regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although changes in uterine endometrium are regulated by steroids hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], they are also regulated by growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;).</p><p>Transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; was originally identified by its ability to induce a transformed phenotype in normal rat kidney fibroblasts in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2;s are now known to be multifunctional proteins involved in many biological processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation, tissue remodelling, angiogenesis, immunoregulation and regulation of extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. They are also inhibitors of cellular growth in many cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It has been shown that they induce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and it might be through the caspases pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Three TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms are found in mammalians and their molecular weights are slightly different: TGF-&#x003b2;1 (15 kDa), TGF-&#x003b2;2 (12.5 kDa) and TGF-&#x003b2;3 (12 kDa). They share 80% sequence homology and genes encoding these isoforms are located on different chromosomes (chromosomes 19, 1 and 14 for TGF-&#x003b2;1, TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; are produced in an inactive form which is activated by proteolytic cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Bioactive TGF-&#x003b2; signals through transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors to phosphorylate Smads proteins, the TGF-&#x003b2; intracellular effectors. Once activated, these proteins translocate to the nucleus, bind to DNA binding proteins and activate transcription of target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Loss of TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated growth inhibition contributes to the development and progression of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The high degree of conservation of these isoforms among species and through evolution suggests an important regulation function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Indeed, it has been shown that all three TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms are differently expressed during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], in porcine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and bovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] conceptus-maternal interface and in the mouse uterus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Moreover, we have shown in our laboratory that TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms efficiently inhibit cellular proliferation in human endometrial carcinoma cell lines and that TGF-&#x003b2;3 increases invasiveness of endometrial carcinoma cells through PI 3-K upregulation of XIAP and protein kinase C induction of MMP-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Chegini <italic>et al </italic>showed by immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) that TGF-&#x003b2;1, TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 are expressed in the rat estrous cycle, but in a context of induced endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Studies have also shown that apoptosis is increased during the decidual regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TGF-&#x003b2;2 mRNA are expressed in mouse uterus during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TGF-&#x003b2;2 have been shown to induce apoptosis in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and rat cultured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] endometrial stromal cells. The role of TGF-&#x003b2;3 in the process of decidual cell death has never been described before. Recently, we showed that TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms are differently localized and regulated in endometrial cells of pregnant rats during implantation and decidual regression, and that TGF-&#x003b2;1 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis in cultured decidual cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Although the expression of TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms have been described in uterus of pregnant rats, their expression during the estrous cycle and their effect on decidual cell regression remain to be explored.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate and characterize the expression of all three TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms in the rat uterus during the estrous cycle and to determine <italic>in vitro </italic>the specific effect of TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 on the regulation of survival of decidual cells. The current study is the first to show the expression and localization of all three TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms in the normal rat uterus and to provide evidence for the regulation of TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 by sex steroids using an artificially induced pseudopregnant rat model. Additionally, this study shows for the first time the regulation of Akt phosphorylation and XIAP expression in the process of decidual cell death induced by TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>TGF-&#x003b2;1 (sc-146, lot # F262, 200 &#x003bc;g/ml), TGF-&#x003b2;2 (sc-90, lot # B202, 200 &#x003bc;g/ml) and TGF-&#x003b2;3 (sc-82, lot # A222, 200 &#x003bc;g/ml) polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

Further manipulations were performed in a sterile environment. The uterine horns were transferred into a sterile petri containing HBSS, slit longitudinally and immerse in trypsin type I solution (0.3%) (Roche Diagnostics, QC, Canada) in HBSS and agitated for 60 minutes at room temperature. Uterine horns were then vortexed at maximum for 5 sec and supernatant containing epithelial cells was discarded. Uterine horns were washed three times with 2.5 ml of HBSS and immersed in a HBSS solution containing trypsin type I (0.03%), DNAse I (0.016%) and collagenase type II (0.064%) for 15 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C in a water bath.

Rat &#x003b2;-actin mRNA was amplified using sense primer 5'-GAGGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTCTGTCAGGTC-3' and antisense primer 5'-CAACTGGAACGACATGGAGAAGATCTGGCA-3'. Each reaction mixture (final volume 50:1) contains RT template or negative control (5:1), MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(50 mM), primers (10 &#x003bc;M), and Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/&#x003bc;l). The PCR cycling conditions (35 cycles except for &#x003b2;-actin 25 cycles) chosen were 30 sec at 94&#x000b0;C, 30 sec at 58&#x000b0;C (TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TGF-&#x003b2;2) and 55&#x000b0;C (TGF-&#x003b2;3) and 30 sec (TGF-&#x003b2;1) and 1 min (TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3) at 72&#x000b0;C, followed by a 5 min extension at 72&#x000b0;C. Reaction products were analyzed on 1.0% agarose gels. Bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Densitometrical analyses were performed (mRNA of interest and &#x003b2;-actin) using the GelDoc 2000 and the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Optimizations for all set of primers were performed prior analyses. All PCR reactions were analysed during the linear amplification phase.

The aim of this study was to investigate and characterize the expression of TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms in the rat endometrium throughout the estrous cycle and during pseudopregnancy and to determine the specific effect of TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 <italic>in vitro </italic>on rat endometrial decidual cell fate. The present results revealed that TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms are differently regulated during the estrous cycle and pseudopregnancy and they mediate apoptosis of decidual cells.</p><p>During the estrous cycle, the uterine endometrial cells undergo proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in response to the steroids hormones, estrogen and progesterone, to create a suitable environment for blastocyst implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Moreover, a complex, precise, and highly interactive array of biological communication pathways involving the action of steroids in concert with local growth factors and cytokines is required to orchestrate the controlled growth and differentiation of the endometrial cells in the uterus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms are known to be implicated in diverse physiological processes and they regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Since all of these events take place in the endometrium during the estrous cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms must be an important growth factor involved during the reproductive cycle. We have thus characterized the expression of TGF-&#x003b2; in the endometrium of cycling rats. Our results show that the three mammalian TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms are present during all stage of the estrous cycle, which is consistent with a previous study that showed, using immunohistochemical analysis that TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms are expressed in rat endometrium during the cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It is known that apoptosis is present in rat endometrium during the estrous cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and that TGF-&#x003b2; induce apoptosis in rat endometrial stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the present study, TGF-&#x003b2;1 expression tended to be increased during proestrus even though no significant difference was observed and it was localized only in stromal cells suggesting a role for this isoform in the remodelling of stromal tissue. Additionally, we have demonstrated that TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 expression was increased during diestrus, which is in accordance with the results of Chegini et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and they were localized in both epithelial and stromal cells suggesting that these two isoforms might be necessary to induce apoptosis in stromal cells during diestrus stage. This result is in accordance with a previous study showing that apoptosis was increased in stromal cells during diestrus in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, we and other have previously shown the presence of apoptosis in rat uterine epithelial cells at estrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], but we found no increase in TGF-&#x003b2; levels during estrus suggesting that TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 might be involved in cellular processes other than apoptosis in rat epithelial endometrial cells during the estrous cycle. Alternatively, downstream components of TGF-&#x003b2; receptor could be differently regulated in distinct cells of the same tissue resulting in increased sensitivity to TGF-&#x003b2; induced apoptosis in rat stromal endometrial cells during diestrus.</p><p>The high levels of TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 at diestrus are correlated with elevated levels of serum progesterone at this time. Indeed, Dharma et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] showed in the uterine endometrium of the mouse that serum progesterone levels were high during metestrus, the day before diestrus. Moreover, studies showed that estrogen induces uterine epithelial cell proliferation and estrogen withdrawal results in cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], which might suggests that epithelial cell apoptosis in the uterine endometrium is regulated by estrogen while stromal cell apoptosis might be regulated by progesterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Since some evidence suggests that steroid action stimulates the local production of growth factors and their receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and that growth factors have been implicated in mediating the action of steroid hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], TGF-&#x003b2; might play a similar role in the induction of progesterone-mediated apoptosis during the estrous cycle. A recent study showed that Smad2, a component of the TGF-&#x003b2; intracellular signaling pathway, was highly expressed in the luminal and glandular epithelium at diestrus and proestrus while it was decreased at estrus and metestrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] suggesting that TGF-&#x003b2; might play an important role through Smad2 in tissue remodelling in the cycling rat endometrium.</p><p>Other roles than apoptosis induction can be suggested for TGF-&#x003b2; during the estrous cycle. It has been shown that TGF-&#x003b2; is a potent chemoattractant for macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], suggesting a role for this growth factor in the elimination of dead cells before the next cycle (the next ovulation) and in wound repair. Furthermore, it has been shown that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), an important class of proteases involved in endometrial remodelling, was present in the rat endometrium during the estrous cycle; the presence of MMP-3, MMP-9 and MMP-13 (primary source of collagenase activity first associated with uterine involution) has been demonstrated in the stromal cells of non-pregnant rat endometrium, while epithelial cell-specific MMP-7 (first MMP protein linked to matrix remodelling in the rodent uterus) has also been demonstrated in the non-pregnant rat uterus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. A previous study showed that MMP-7 mRNA levels were dependant on the estrous cycle and it was 3 to 4 fold higher at estrus and diestrus compared to metestrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Both TGF-&#x003b2; and MMPs are recognized to have an action on tissue remodelling, and TGF-&#x003b2; might act through the regulation of MMP activity. In fact, it has been shown that TGF-&#x003b2; plays an important role in the regulation of MMP production in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. However, little is known about the interaction between TGF-&#x003b2; and matrix metalloproteinase in the remodelling uterus in cycling rats and further investigations have to be carried out.</p><p>During early pregnancy, uterine endometrium is alternatively remodelled by sex steroid and growth factors to allow embryo implantation and then decidual regression near the end of pregnancy. Apoptosis has been shown to occur during these two important processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Several growth factors are produced and secreted by both conceptus and maternal uterine tissues in embryo-endometrial interactions during implantation and decidual regression. We have previously demonstrated that TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms are present and expressed differently in the rat endometrium during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Since the induction of TGF-&#x003b1; gene expression has been shown to be independent of the conceptus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], we hypothesized that it might be similar for TGF-&#x003b2;. Using the rat pseudopregnancy model, which involves pregnancy-like remodelling of the endometrium following exposure to steroid hormones, we showed that TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms are differently expressed and regulated in rat endometrial cells during pseudopregnancy in a pattern similar to pregnant uterus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Notably, we have demonstrated that TGF-&#x003b2;1 was present in all days of pseudopregnancy but its expression was increased on day 5, day at which embryo implantation normally occurs, and was maximal on day 9 in a similar pattern as compared to normal pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], strengthening our hypothesis that TGF-&#x003b2;1 might be involved in the regulation of apoptosis during embryo implantation and decidual regression, without the need for signals from the embryo. TGF-&#x003b2;2 levels were shown to be elevated only on day 9 of pseudopregnancy, and TGF-&#x003b2;3 has not been detected during pseudopregnancy, similarly to what was observed during normal pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], confirming that this isoform does not play a crucial role during early pregnancy. This result is also supported by a previous work demonstrating that TGF-&#x003b2;3 was absent during early pregnancy in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Altogether, our results indicate that TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms expression is independent of the conceptus (embryonic factors) and it might be regulated by steroid hormones. Moreover, this differential expression of TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms in the uterus suggests distinctive functions of these growth factors during early pregnancy.</p><p>Our results also show that apoptosis is induced during pseudopregnancy. We have demonstrated that cleaved caspase-3, a well known executioner of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], was present in endometrium days 5 to 9 of pseudopregnancy. Its levels were increased in a similar pattern than what was observed during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] from day 5, day at which embryo implantation occurs, to day 9 of pseudopregnancy, indicating that the caspases pathway activation might be an important mechanism of cell death involved in implantation and decidual regression.</p><p>Akt kinase is a key regulator of cell fate in numerous cell types, including endometrial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; since TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathway component Smad3 can directly interact with Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], we hypothesized that a crosstalk between TGF-&#x003b2; and PI3-K/Akt signalling pathways could occur in decidual cells which could dictate cell fate during pregnancy. It is already known that TGF-&#x003b2;1 induce apoptosis in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] endometrial stromal cells, and we have demonstrated in a previous work that TGF-&#x003b2;1 regulates the activity of PI3-K/Akt pathway, inducing a decrease of Akt phosphorylation through a mechanism involving Smad2 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The present study shows that, similar to TGF-&#x003b2;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], TGF-&#x003b2;3 induces the phosphorylation/activation of Smad2 and decreases Akt phosphorylation/activation in a dose-dependant manner, and that TGF-&#x003b2;2 also decreases Akt phosphorylation, although likely in a Smad2-independent fashion. It is possible that upon binding to its ligand TGF-&#x003b2;2, TGF-&#x003b2; receptor signals through Smad3 rather than Smad2. Indeed, recent studies showed that Akt interacts directly with Smad3 to regulate the sensitivity to TGF-&#x003b2;-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], and we hypothesize that TGF-&#x003b2;2 might decrease P-Akt levels through Smad3 activation in rat decidual cells. Moreover, the reduction of Akt phosphorylation in response to TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 suggest that inhibition of Akt activity might be an important mechanism by which these TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms induce apoptosis in rat decidual cells.</p><p>Recent studies have shown the important interaction between Akt and XIAP, a well known inhibitor of caspases. It was shown that Akt phosphorylation is regulated by XIAP in human ovarian epithelial cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] and in rat granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] and that phosphorylated Akt is affected by the presence of cIAP-1 in endometrial cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. More recently, we have shown that XIAP is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten, a negative regulator of Akt) and that degradation of PTEN through the proteasome lead to the activation/phosphorylation of Akt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. We have also previously shown that TGF-&#x003b2;1 reduced XIAP protein levels in rat decidual cells, suggesting the presence of a functional link between these two proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Here, we show that, in response to TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3, XIAP levels are decreased in a dose-dependant manner. Studies have shown that XIAP can act as a cofactor in the TGF-&#x003b2; signalling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Downregulation of the anti-apoptotic factor XIAP is accompanied by a modest but significant induction of apoptosis in rat decidual cells exposed to TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3, suggesting that XIAP can inhibit apoptotic mechanisms in rat decidual cells.</p><p>A study showed that TGF-&#x003b2;1 and TGF-&#x003b2;2 treatments on cultured stromal cells induce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In this paper, we show that TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 have no effect on the expression of CDC-47, a proliferation cell marker, suggesting that these isoforms do not modulate cell proliferation of endometrial decidual cells although they weakly induce cell death in a dose-dependant manner as demonstrated by Hoechst nuclear staining. This is a surprising observation, since increased cell death is usually accompanied by a decrease in cellular proliferation marker levels. It is possible that other proliferation markers different than CDC47 would be more relevant to decidual cells, such as the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Moreover, the weak increase of apoptosis observed with Hoechst staining might be accompanied by other types of cell death such as autophagy, mitotic catastrophe or senescence. Indeed, TGF-&#x003b2; has been showed to induce senescence phenotype or to have a cytostatic action (cell cycle arrest) on mammalian tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].</p><p>Further investigation is thus needed to better understand the interaction between TGF-&#x003b2;s and PI3-K/Akt pathway and to determine how other factors that might be involved in the regulation of TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated apoptosis of decidual cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, these results show that the three TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms are expressed and differently localized in the epithelial and stromal cells during the estrous cycle, and that they are differently regulated during pseudopregnancy in a steroid hormone-dependent manner. Moreover, this study shows that TGF-&#x003b2; signalling plays an important role in the remodelling of rat endometrium by modulating the activity of PI 3-K/Akt survival pathway, down-regulating the anti-apoptotic XIAP levels and inducing apoptosis in decidual cells. Future experiments will aim at better characterize the underlying mechanisms such as the possible interaction between TGF-&#x003b2;2 and Smad proteins in the TGF-&#x003b2;-mediated apoptosis and the mechanism by which TGF-&#x003b2; and Smads transducer proteins interact with PI 3-K/PTEN/Akt survival pathway to induce apoptosis. Additional investigations will allow us to determine the presence of other type of programmed cell death such as autophagy, senescence and mitotic catastrophe and how they are involved in the rat endometrial decidual cell death.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PLC performed the experiments and drafted the manuscript.
