Here, we demonstrate that AECII activates alveolar macrophages (AM) functions, such as phagocytosis using a conditioned medium from AECII infected by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. AECII-derived chemokine MCP-1, a monocyte chemoattractant protein, was identified as a main factor in enhancing AM function. We proposed that the enhanced immune potency of AECII may play a critical role in alleviation of bacterial propagation and pneumonia. The ability of phagocytosis and superoxide release by AM was reduced by MCP-1 neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, MCP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed an increased bacterial burden under PAO1 and PAK infection vs. wt littermates. AM from MCP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also demonstrated less superoxide and impaired phagocytosis over the controls. In addition, AECII conditioned medium increased the host defense of airway in MCP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice through the activation of AM function. Mechanistically, we found that Lyn mediated NF&#x003ba;B activation led to increased gene expression and secretion of MCP-1. Consequently Lyn<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had reduced MCP-1 secretion and resulted in a decrease in superoxide and phagocytosis by AM. Collectively, our data indicate that AECII may serve as an immune booster for fighting bacterial infections, particularly in severe immunocompromised conditions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alveolar type II epithelial cells (AECII) maintain alveolar integrity by forming the alveolar barrier, producing surfactants and repairing injured type I epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Fehrenbach1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, several reports indicate that AECII may be an integral part of the lung innate immunity, acting to intensify the function of dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Thorley1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and alveolar macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Sato1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. AECII may also perform other important functions such as cytokine secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Amano1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, antigen presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Lo1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and enhancement of macrophage phagocytosis through surfactant proteins such as SP-D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Restrepo1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the role of AECII in infection immunity and underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Understanding the additional immunological role of AECII is important because professional immune cells such as alveolar macrophages (AM) in some cases rarely succeed in eradicating pathogens on their own. This is the case with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, an opportunistic gram-negative bacterium accounting for 10.1&#x00025; of nosocomial infections. Clinical reports have shown that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infects about 97.5&#x00025; of Cystic Fibrosis children at age of 3 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Burns1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection is a main clinical problem in various immunodeficiency conditions such as HIV, severe burns, and cancers. This bacterium exhibits resistance to conventional antibiotics through a variety of virulence factors and there are no effective vaccines, making it difficult to eradicate once it colonizes the respiratory tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-LeVine1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Mariencheck1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated that AECII cells can stimulate AM immunity in the lung of either mice or rats to boost the host defense against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Amano1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The caveats are that the studies have focused on whole animals to identify the cell types responsible for secreting chemokines by co-localization techniques. Also, the specific cell type involved in the immune activity has not been clearly defined. Although the main chemotactic factor released from AECII is likely to be MCP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Amano1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, it is hard to prove <italic>in vivo</italic> whether AECII are the actual secreting cells. Also, the specific role of MCP-1 derived from AECII is less clear. A recent study suggested that isolated human AECII may secrete chemokines such as MCP-1 at higher amounts than AM primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Thorley2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the specific immune response by characteristically defined AECII to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection remains to be determined. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism governing AECII mediated host immunity and regulatory factors involved in secretion of MCP-1 are not clearly established. Thus, it is necessary to investigate and fully establish the immune role of AECII.</p><p>To determine the immunological function of AECII, we chose to investigate if AECII have a role in activating AM in response to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection. We used our primary cell culture models as well as mouse models including knockout mice to identify the signaling proteins that may regulate AM function and by identifying the cytokine products derived from AECII. We have shown here the importance of MCP-1 secreted by AECII in the activation of AM. Using MCP-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we also confirmed that MCP-1 has a crucial activity in increasing AM functionality through enhancing phagocytosis, increasing superoxide production, balancing inflammatory response and thereby optimizing host defense. In addition, we delineated the mechanism that regulates MCP-1 secretion in AECII, in which we found that Lyn, a critical Src family member, can increase MCP-1 secretion by activating the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Our objective was to test whether AECII in a culture system can boost the immune function of AM. Through co-culturing macrophages with lung epithelial cells, macrophages were significantly activated, demonstrating multiple functional activities including enhanced migration and actin reorganization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004891.s001">Figure S1A, B</xref>). To investigate whether secreted (soluble) substances are major mediators, we collected a conditioned medium from primary mouse AECII following PAO1 infection for 1 h and added to primary AM culture. After 24 h, AM activity was detected by three measurements: migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004891-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004891-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and superoxide production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004891-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Our data indicates that the three AM function parameters were significantly increased by the AECII conditioned medium compared to the control medium from AECII without infection (<italic>P&#x0003c;0.05</italic>, Student's <italic>t</italic> test). The activated AM also showed more significant morphological changes with membrane projections such as lamellipodia and filopodia by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004891-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, we demonstrated apparent morphology alterations by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004891-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Although we found that AECII have a role in activating AM, it is possible that AM themselves can be activated by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which enhances the function of resting AM through an autocrine loop. Thus, we evaluated whether the activated AM can bolster immunity by stimulating other na&#x000ef;ve AM. We co-incubated resting AM with a conditioned medium that was derived from AM following <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> time course infection. As expected, we have found that the AECII conditioned medium indeed showed greater increases in AM migration and superoxide production compared to the AM-conditioned medium, particularly at earlier times (6 h, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004891.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). However, AM also secreted comparable MCP-1 possibly through autocrine activation at 24 h.</p><fig id="pone-0004891-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004891.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Conditioned medium from AECII by PAO1 infection activated AM (12 h).</title><p>(A) Increase of AM migration as determined by chemotaxic chamber methods (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Material and Methods</xref>).

The results are representative of three experiments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004891.g001"/></fig><p>To investigate how AECII can activate AM, we studied the possible involvement of various cytokines and chemokines. Thus we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment with isolated primary mouse AECII to measure cytokines in the conditioned medium of AECII infected by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which showed a significant increase in MCP-1, IL-1&#x003b2;, MIP-2&#x003b1;, and TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004891-g002">Figure 2A, B</xref>). We also showed that MCP-1 can transmit cellular signals to AM (4), and may be a dominant cytokine in cultured AECII cells. The secretion of MCP-1 is time dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004891-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Also, we detected increased expression of MCP-1 and CCR2 (MCP-1 receptor) expression on AECII cells by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004891-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). We further confirmed that the MCP-1-secreting cells expressed SP-C (a marker of AECII) by co-localization with confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004891-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Similar results showing cytokine secretion by AECII were also found in murine lung type II cell line MLE-12 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Das1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004891.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). We then infected mice to investigate MCP-1 secretion in response to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection in <italic>&#x0201c;in vivo&#x0201d;</italic> conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Kannan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. C57BL6 mice (8 weeks female, 5 mice per group) were infected with PAO1 intranasally, and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 18 h post infection. MCP-1 level was found to be increased as measured by immunohistochemistry in lung tissue, and PAO1 infected mice showed a significant increase in MCP-1 compared to uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004891-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). Furthermore, the MCP-1 expression was demonstrated on AECII cells of human lung tissues from CF patients with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004891-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that MCP-1 actually participated in host defense in infected humans. We showed that lipid rafts in AECII are reorganized into aggregates (platforms for cell signaling) following acute infection by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Kannan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, which is consistent with several studies regarding <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> or other microorganisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Kowalski1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Zaas1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has type three secretion system (T3SS) exoenzymes ExoS, ExoT, ExoU and ExoY, among which ExoS and ExoT are similar in the sequence and function for ADP ribosyltransferase and GTPase-activation protein activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Hauser1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The raft aggregates are differentially induced by various T3SS mutants or a pili deficient mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Kannan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Since there were some rafts outside the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we further quantified raft aggregates using Image J software and showed that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection induced strong raft aggregates, which were also associated with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004891-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). In addition, controls without infection did not show raft aggregates, thus the aggregates of lipid rafts may be a specific response to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Next, we used various inhibitors to define the raft pathway in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> adhesion and internalization into AECII. Among the various inhibitors we have tested, we found that the lipid raft inhibitor (m&#x003b2;CD), Lyn tyrosine kinase inhibitor (PP2), Akt inhibitor, and NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor effectively blocked adhesion and internalization of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, whereas the ceramide inhibitor (blocking sphingolipid pathway) only reduced internalization without affecting adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004891-g002">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004891-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004891.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). This data suggests that ceramide and cholesterol may differentially impact <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> adhesion and internalization. To further dissect the mechanism, we intranasally instilled cholesterol chelator m&#x003b2;CD into mouse lungs and found a reduction in bacterial internalization and MCP-1 secretion was also partially hindered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004891-g002">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004891-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004891.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>MCP-1 from AECII was a major regulator by PAO1 infection.</title><p>(A) Increase of various proinflammatory factors at 24 h following stimulation with the conditioned medium from AECII infected by PAO1.

Our studies use both isolated AECII mouse cells and animals (including knockout mice) and demonstrate that the chemokine MCP-1 can up-regulate the innate immunity of AM. Innate immunity of the respiratory system in normal individuals is sufficient to prevent <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection, but is unable to eradicate the bacteria in immunodeficient individuals, resulting in recurrent infection or acute dissemination. Activating the immunological functions of AECII may lend much-needed help in fighting microorganisms such as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The results from our studies demonstrate that MCP-1 production was dramatically increased after infection of AECII. Further, we have shown that direct application of synthetic MCP-1 peptide also boosts AM functions, albeit in a less potent way compared to induction by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-infected medium. In addition, the instillation of MCP-1-neutralizing antibodies into mouse lungs blocks cytokine secretion and induces more severe pneumonia, indicating a critical functional role of this particular chemokine. The foremost function of these secreted factors is to recruit AM and boost their microbicidal activity.

We also showed that the Lyn mediated regulation of MCP-1 secretion may be through the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, which is a key transcriptional factor for inducing gene expression of many immune molecules including MCP-1.

Mechanistically, we identified a potential Lyn regulation site via H4 hyperacetylation at location K16 (unpublished). Additionally, we found that these responses may involve bacterial components including pili and ExoS. This is interesting because ExoS may be an important component of exoenzymes, responsible for intoxicating host defense mechanisms for bacterial benefit. In fact, pili as the surface structure of the bacterium may directly target lipid rafts to impact host signaling (not published). Also, reduction of MCP-1 production was seen when cells were challenged with a pili-deficient strain but increased MCP-1 secretion was noticed using the pili-corrected strain. Finally, our study also demonstrates that although dead bacteria or their partial products (LPS and supernatant) may have effects on igniting host defense, it is the live bacterium that stirred the strongest inflammatory response.</p><p>Whether or not AM are crucial for mitigating <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection has been controversial. Our study has reaffirmed that AM are an important entity for exerting immune defense during acute <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection. Our data indicates that activated AM are essential for phagocytosis of invading bacteria and scavenging dead bodies of neutrophils, evidenced by greater neutrophil penetration and pro-inflammatory cytokine response in Lyn<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. The increased superoxide in AECII-activated AM can be utilized to kill the engulfed bacteria, particularly important during high doses of bacterial infection. Our results indicate that AM alone may be less effective, while cytokines or chemokines derived from AECII or other unidentified mechanisms may give AM an added power that is required for clearance of invading microorganisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004891-g007">Figure 7</xref>). However, the effects of AECII immune roles may impact other cell types such as neutrophils and lymphocytes, which may be interesting directions for future studies.</p><p>The Lyn axis maintains a fine balance involving several Src members or signaling proteins.

Phagocytosis of the bacterium is dependent on many virulence factors as well as the host mediators. One of the major virulent effects of T3SS is disruption of cortical actin in phagocytic cells. We have reported earlier that a similar mechanism also exists in alveolar epithelium. Our recent study showed that T3SS is also involved in the phagocytosis of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> into AM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004891-Kannan2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> releases these toxins directly into the host cytoplasm.
