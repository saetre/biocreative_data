The cellular distribution of CATS and CATX was, however, considerably different.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The cellular distribution and the spatio-temporal development of the altered expression of CATS and CATX suggest that these proteins are important players in the spinal mechanisms involved in chronic pain induction and maintenance.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Neuropathic pain is one type of chronic pain and originates by definition from a lesion of the nervous system (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). It is a devastating and difficult to manage disease mainly because the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Indeed, several types of cells and highly complex interactions of multiple pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). In this context work on animal models has emphasized the important contribution of differences in protein expression to neuropathic pain induction and maintenance (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). Within this cocktail proteases are receiving growing interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] because of their enormous destructive potential and the irreversibility of their action (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]).</p><p>In our study we focus on a distinct group of proteases, the cathepsins (CAT), which are cysteine proteases mainly localized in lysosomes/peroxisomes but are also found in extralysosomal sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. There are 11 human members (cathepsins B, C, F, H, K, L, O, S, V, W and X) and in mouse 8 additional members (cathepsins 1, 2, 3, 6, J, M, Q and R) in this group of enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. They play a vital role in normal cellular protein metabolism such as the regulation of key protein kinases and phosphatases, and the induction of specific cytoskeletal rearrangements, which may account for their involvement in intracellular signaling, vesicular trafficking, and structural stabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Hence, it is not suprising that CAT are implicated in the manifestation of a number of diseases, including cancer, arthritis, Morbus Parkinson, Morbus Alzheimer and age-dependent inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Recent studies suggest that the activation or breakdown of the endosomal/lysosomal proteolytic system might also be involved in pain pathophysiology. Thus, in different chronic animal pain models an upregulation of some members (S, B, H, L, D) of the CAT family along the ascending nociceptive pathway has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and CATS has even been implicated in neuropathic hyperalgesia and allodynia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>With these strong implications for a role of CAT in neuropathic pain pathogenesis in mind we decided to study the spatiotemporal expression pattern of two of these proteases, the CATS and the more recently identified CATX, during the phases of pain induction and maintenance in a rat neuropathic pain model, the transection of the 5<sup>th </sup>lumbar spinal nerve. CATS is a well-described cathepsin originally identified from lymph nodes and spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and is well known for its crucial function in the control of antigen presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. CATX, on the other hand, has only recently been localized in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and its expression pattern in pathological situations implies a role in degenerative processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cellular and spatiotemporal expression of CATS and CATX in normal and L5T spinal cord</title><p>In unlesioned adult rats CATS- and CATX-immunoreactivities were found in cells of both grey and white matters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) throughout the entire length of the spinal cord. Most CATS-immunopositive cells were of small size and distributed uniformely (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, C, E, F</xref>). While CATS-immunopositive neurons were rare, CATX-immunoreactivity was found in nearly all neurons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, D, H</xref>) and only in few small cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, J</xref>). The immunoreactivities were associated with spherical granules within the cytoplasm of cells, sparing the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E, D, H</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>CATS- and CATX-immunohistochemistry in normal rat spinal cord</bold>.

Within these regions, the number of small CATS- as well as CATX-immunopositive cells increased substantially (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Moreover, we found a numerical increase in CATS-immunopositive neurons, while the number of CATX-immunopositive neurons was constant. Interestingly, numerous small CATS as well as CATX-immunopositive cells engulfed large motoneurons in the ventral horn (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G, I</xref>). Within the following days the ipsilateral increase in immunopositive cells in the fasciculus gracilis spread caudocranially to the upper SC segments and reached the gracile nucleus at 1 w after injury (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2L, N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

Therefore, we first analyzed the protein levels of CATX and CATS in the spinal cord of sham versus L5T animals at 8 d after injury, a time point when the increase in immunoreactivities in the spinal cord was at its maximum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>Western blot analysis (n = 5 per group) revealed the proforms of CATS (37 kD) and CATX (34 kD), as the most prominent bands, while the prepro- and mature forms were below the detection level. The proforms of both enzymes were detected in all segments analyzed (L, lumbar; T, thoracic; C, cervical) of the adult rat spinal cord (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The L5 nerve transsection produced an upregulation in all SC segments for CATS as well as CATX (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The strongest increase in protein content was found in the T segment for both enzymes (CATS 63.6%; CATX 87.4%), while the increase in the L and C-segments was substantial (34&#x02013;61.5%) but lower than in the T segment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Moreover, our Western blot analysis showed that in all SC segments the level of CATX is more than twice as high as the level of CATS. These results were confirmed in a second experiment with 4 animals per group (see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Upregulation of cathepsin protein levels and activities after L5T</bold>. <bold>A: </bold>Western blot analysis of CATX and CATS proform expression in the spinal cord of L5T (n = 5) and sham operated animals (n = 5) at 8 d after injury.

Recent research has uncovered that peripheral nerve injury triggers cascades of systemic, cellular and molecular changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Moreover, there is ample evidence that these dynamic changes contribute to prolonged abnormal pain sensations. In the current study we analysed the participation of two cysteine proteases, the CATS and CATX, in the molecular processes underlying the induction and maintenance of neuropathic pain. Our results clearly show that immediately after surgery, concurrent to the onset of mechanical allodynia, both proteases, CATS and CATX, are upregulated in the spinal cord. Moreover, the upregulation of CATX protein was accompanied by a substantial increase in activity. In contrast to the increase in the proform level that of the CATX activity was highly significant. This apparent contradiction might be explained by either an increase of the active form of CATX, that is still below the detection level of the Western Blot, or a concomitant regulation of endogenous cathepsin inhibitors, the cystatins or thyropins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In fact there is recent evidence in favor of the idea that the cathepsin inhibitors are also regulated during persistent pain states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>Both, CATS and CATX, are widely expressed in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and have been implicated in several neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and age-related inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Recently, CATS has also been implicated in neuropathic hyperalgesia and allodynia. Using the gene chip technology CATS mRNA was found to be upregulated in the ipsilateral L4 and L5 DRG in the PSL and CCI model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], while in the SNL or L5T model, CATS mRNA expression was regulated in the DRG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and in the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Extending the latter results, we were able to detect the regulation of CATS protein levels and added a new cathepsin, CATX, to the list of regulated proteases in pain pathology.</p><p>Our immunohistochemical analysis, following the temporal development of neuropathic pain, supports the view that the upregulation of CATS and CATX expression is dynamic and proceeds along the fasciculus gracilis up to the medulla oblongata. Immediately (1 d) after transection CATS and CATX expressions increase. For both proteins this increase is restricted to the fasciculus gracilis, the dorsal horn and the layer IX in the ventral horn in the lumbar segment. As early as 2 d after injury the upregulation in the fasciculus gracilis spread cranially and reached the gracile nucleus at 1 w after injury. At that time point this nucleus exhibited morphological signs of degeneration. We never found cathepsin upregulation on the contralateral side of the lesion or in sham operated animals. This characteristic spatio-temporal pattern suggests that the upregulation of CATS/X expression accompanies the degenerative process of the transected axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Whether the cathepsins contribute to the mechanism of degeneration and are causally involved in the pain processing or whether the differential expression is an epiphenomenon is difficult to answer on the basis of the data provided here. However, there is recent evidence that CATS is directly involved in the pain process by modulating the cytokine response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Cathepsins display rather diverse physiological actions. CATS for instance is well recognized for its crucial function in the control of antigen presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and its role in the degradation of the extracellular matrix. In contrast to CATS, little is known about the physiological function of CATX. But the high expression of CATX in antigen-presenting monocytes/macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], its upregulation in the gastric mucosa of patients with <italic>Helicobacter pylori </italic>gastritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and in the plasma of patients with multiple trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] as well as its involvement in the production of bradykinin potentiating peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] also imply a role in inflammatory processes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest a strong regulation of both, CATS and CATX, in the spinal cord of an animal model of neuropathic pain.

The mean withdrawal threshold for both hind paws was taken from a set of three applications, not less than 2 min apart.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue preparation</title><p>For immunoblotting, spinal cord and brain tissues were homogenized in triple detergent lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) using a Teflon/glass homogenizer at 4&#x000b0;C. Homogenized samples were kept on ice for 30 min und subsequently centrifuged for 10 min in a precooled centrifuge at 12,000 g. The supernatant was collected and subsequently diluted 1:1 in 2&#x000d7; Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Protein determination was performed by the method of Neuhoff and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>For immunohistochemistry, animals were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB). The brain, the spinal cord and the ipsi- and contralateral nerves L4&#x02013;L6 were excised and postfixed for 24 h in the perfusion fixative. Spinal cords were subdivided into the spinal cord segments according to the numbers of the related spinal nerves and all segments and the L5 (ipsi- and contralateral) nerves were embedded in paraffin. Serial, transversal 18-&#x003bc;m-thick sections were cut throughout all spinal cord segments, the hindbrain and the peripheral nerves. Sections were mounted on Superfrost slides (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany).</p><p>For CATX activity assays, the tissues were thawed separately on ice and homogenized in 7-fold volume (w/v) of 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaOAc, 4 mM EDTA-Na<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 5.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. All procedures were carried out at 4&#x000b0;C. After incubating the samples for 60 min on ice, they were centrifuged (60 min at 13,000 g) for elimination of debris. Supernatants were stored in aliquots at -80&#x000b0;C until further use.

Incubation with the primary antibodies goat anti-mouse CATX (1:500; R&#x00026;D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) or goat anti-human CATS (1:200; R&#x00026;D Systems) was conducted in blocking buffer overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The next day blots were incubated in HRP-coupled anti-goat (1:50,000 in 1.5% milk powder in TBS-Tween; Amersham Biosci., M&#x000fc;nchen, Germany) at RT for 1.5 h, followed by detection with the ECL-Plus system (Amersham Biosci.).</p><p>To control protein loading, the blots were incubated with mouse anti-chick &#x003b1;-tubulin (1:400,000; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) followed by HRP-coupled anti-mouse (1:50,000 in 1.5% milk powder in TBS-Tween; Amersham Biosci.) and the ECL-Plus system as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Primary antibodies were used to document CATS and CATX and to identify the cathepsin-expressing cells. We used the following antibodies: goat anti-rat CATS (anti-CATS; 1:100&#x02013;200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, USA suitable for detection of prepro-, pro- and mature form of CATS); goat anti-mouse CATX (anti-CATX; 1:100&#x02013;200; R&#x00026;D systems, Abingdon, UK; suitable for detection of prepro-, pro- and mature form of CATX), the microglia/macrophage marker mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-PT66; 1:1000; Sigma), the astrocyte marker mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (anti-GFAP; 1:2500&#x02013;5000; Chemicon, Hampshire UK) and the macrophage marker mouse anti-rat CD68 (anti-ED1; 1:5000; Serotec, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>Stainings</title><p>Single immunohistochemical stainings were performed on deparaffinized sections after antigen retrieval (5 min cooking in 0.01 M citrate buffer pH 6.0, for all primary antibodies except ED1). Following the first antiserum incubations, sections were treated by the corresponding biotinylated secondary antibody (Axxora, L&#x000f6;rrach, Germany), and the ABC reagent (Axxora). Peroxidase reaction was carried out with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine as the chromogene and intensified with silver-gold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Specificity of the stainings was either confirmed by omitting primary antibodies or by preabsorption with a five-fold (by weight) excess of specific blocking peptides for 2 h at RT (for anti-CATS and anti-CATX) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>).</p><p>Immunofluorescence double IHC was performed on deparaffinized sections after antigen retrieval.

CATX activity was measured in 25 mM CH<sub>3</sub>COONa/1 mM EDTA/5 mM DTT (pH 3.5) with 10 &#x003bc;M MCA-R-P-P-G-F-S-A-F-K(Dnp)-OH (R&#x00026;D Systems) as substrate. In parallel assays, the specific CATB inhibitor CA-074 (1 &#x003bc;M, Bachem, Weil am Rhein, Germany; Ki = 2 nM for purified rat CATB and 40&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;M for CATH and CATL; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]) and the non-specific cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 (5 &#x003bc;M, Sigma) were added in order to distinguish between CATB activity and the entire cysteine protease activity. A clear determination of CATB activity is essential as CATB is also able to hydrolyze the substrate at these conditions. Activity of other proteases being able to cleave MCA-R-P-P-G-F-S-A-F-K(Dnp)-OH, like CATL and ECE-1, was undetectable (data not shown). Assays were performed at RT in black 96 multiwell plates (Falcon) in a total volume of 50 &#x003bc;l. Prior starting the assay by addition of substrate, the enzyme solutions were pre-incubated for 5 min with the different inhibitors or diluent at RT. After a 30 min incubation time the assays were stopped by the addition of 50 &#x003bc;l stop solution (100 mM CH<sub>2</sub>ClCOOH, 70 mM CH<sub>3</sub>COOH, 30 mM CH<sub>3</sub>COONa, pH 4.3) and measured at 340/430 nm, according to the procedures described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The activities of the proteases were calculated on the basis of relative fluorescent units. The total cathepsin activity was assessed by taking the difference between non-inhibited and E-64 inhibited samples. CATB activity corresponded to the part of the response that could be inhibited by CA-074. The difference between the fluorescence measured in the presence of the CATB inhibitor and the fluorescence measured in the presence of E-64 was attributed to CATX activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Animals included in the present study fulfilled the following behavioral and anatomical criteria: (i) strong mechanical allodynia measured by the aesthesiometer and defined as an ipsilateral threshold difference between pre- and post-surgery of at least 5 g (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>) and a DiffScore (contralateral threshold minus ipsilateral threshold) of a minimum of 5 g (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>) and (ii) persistent L5 transsection (short survival times) and/or infiltration of L5 by numerous ED1-immunopositive macrophages (long survival times) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C, D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Behavior and histopathology after L5 transection</bold>. <bold>A, B: </bold>Time course of neuropathic mechanical allodynia in the ipsilateral hind paw expressed as ipsilateral threshold (A) and Diffscore (B, difference between contralateral and ipsilateral withdrawal threshold) in L5T and sham operated animals.
