We have investigated the significance of the particle surface reactivity of respirable quartz dust in relation to the <italic>in vivo </italic>generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and the associated induction of oxidative stress responses in the lung. Therefore, rats were intratracheally instilled with 2 mg quartz (DQ12) or quartz whose surface was modified by either polyvinylpyridine-N-oxide (PVNO) or aluminium lactate (AL). Seven days after instillation, the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was analysed for markers of inflammation (total/differential cell counts), levels of pulmonary oxidants (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, nitrite), antioxidant status (trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity), as well as for markers of lung tissue damage, e.g. total protein, lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase. Lung homogenates as well as sections were investigated regarding the induction of the oxidative DNA-lesion/oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) using HPLC/ECD analysis and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Homogenates and sections were also investigated for the expression of the bifunctional apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox factor-1 (APE/Ref-1) by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Significantly increased levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and nitrite were observed in rats treated with non-coated quartz, when compared to rats that were treated with either saline or the surface-modified quartz preparations. In the BALF, there was a strong correlation between the number of macrophages and ROS, as well as total cells and RNS. Although enhanced oxidant generation in non-coated DQ12-treated rats was paralleled with an increased total antioxidant capacity in the BALF, these animals also showed significantly enhanced lung tissue damage. Remarkably however, elevated ROS levels were not associated with an increase in 8-OHdG, whereas the lung tissue expression of APE/Ref-1 protein was clearly up-regulated. The present data provide further <italic>in vivo </italic>evidence for the crucial role of particle surface properties in quartz dust-induced ROS/RNS generation by recruited inflammatory phagocytes. Our results also demonstrate that quartz dust can fail to show steady-state enhanced oxidative DNA damage in the respiratory tract, in conditions were it elicits a marked and persistent inflammation with associated generation of ROS/RNS, and indicate that this may relate to compensatory induction of APE/Ref-1 mediated base excision repair.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Worldwide, millions of people are occupationally exposed to crystalline silica (e.g. quartz) dust. Chronic exposure to quartz can lead to a variety of pulmonary diseases, including silicosis and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Notably however, studies on quartz-induced carcinogenicity have revealed that the quartz hazard is a variable entity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], as carcinogenic outcomes seem to be inconsistent and show a rather large variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Indeed, the toxicity of quartz is highly variable and has been demonstrated to largely depend on the reactivity of its particle surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Currently, there is a large body of experimental evidence showing that modification of the particle surface by either grinding or coating with PVNO or aluminium salts modifies quartz-induced cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, inflammogenicity and fibrogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>It is now generally accepted that excessive and persistent formation of ROS and RNS plays a major role in quartz-induced silicosis and carcinogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. During quartz exposure, ROS may be generated via two major routes: either from the quartz particles themselves, or indirectly, from the oxidative burst of pulmonary inflammatory cells (i.e. neutrophils and macrophages) that invade the lung upon exposure to quartz. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that the surface characteristics of quartz are involved in both of these pathways, since surface-modification significantly impacts on the generation of ROS by quartz particles in an acellular environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], as well as on the induction and persistence of pulmonary inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It has been also demonstrated that such quartz-surface modifications directly modify the release of ROS from neutrophils and macrophages upon <italic>in vitro </italic>treatment with quartz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Notably however, current evidence for a role of the reactive particle surface on the actual generation of ROS <italic>in vivo </italic>and the oxidative stress response in lung tissue are merely associative.</p><p>In the context of the inflammation-mediated carcinogenic effects of quartz, it should be noted that ROS are on the one hand known to activate redox-sensitive signal transduction cascades, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF&#x003ba;B) and activator protein (AP-1), which are involved in activation of genes controlling inflammation, proliferation and/or apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. On the other hand, quartz-mediated formation of ROS is considered to drive oxidative DNA damage and associated mutagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The importance of inflammation-mediated ROS for quartz mutagenesis was initially provided by Driscoll and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Using a complementary <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>ex vivo/in vitro </italic>approach, they showed (a) that quartz particles are mutagenic to rat lung epithelial cells <italic>in vivo </italic>in association with a persistent pulmonary inflammation, and (b) that BAL cells obtained from such quartz-treated rats are mutagenic to rat lung epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. In concordance with these observations, quartz has been shown to induce the premutagenic oxidative DNA adduct 8-OHdG in rat lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In an <italic>in vitro </italic>co-incubation model we could then demonstrate that the induction of 8-OHdG in lung epithelial cells by neutrophils can be blocked by antioxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>To cope with exogenous DNA damage, e.g. as may be induced upon quartz exposure, cells are equipped with multiple DNA repair enzymes. The repair of oxidative DNA lesions such as 8-OHdG, predominantly occurs via the base excision repair (BER) pathway. As such, altered expression of BER enzymes has been proposed as a sensitive marker of the induction of oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Among these repair proteins, the expression of the bifunctional protein APE/Ref-1 represents a highly interesting candidate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The protein APE/Ref-1 consists of two functionally independent domains, the highly conserved C-terminus, involved in both the short-patch and long-path pathways of BER, and the completely unconserved N-terminus, which exerts the control of several redox-sensitive transcription factors including NF&#x003ba;B and AP-1. Previously, <italic>in vitro </italic>studies have shown that asbestos fibres enhance APE/Ref-1 expression in mesothelial cells as well as in alveolar macrophages, which has been linked to its role in oxidative DNA damage repair and ROS-mediated regulation of redox-sensitive transcription pathways, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. So far, however, the role of quartz-elicited ROS generation on APE/Ref-1 expression <italic>in vivo </italic>has not been elucidated.</p><p>The aim of our present study was to investigate whether inhibition of the surface reactivity of quartz particles modulates inflammation-mediated generation of ROS and RNS in the rat lung <italic>in vivo</italic>, and whether this impacts on pulmonary toxicity and more specifically, on the expression of the lung tissue sensors of oxidative stress/DNA damage 8-OHdG and APE/Ref-1. Therefore, BAL as well as lung tissue from rat lungs were analysed for pulmonary toxicity, inflammation, ROS/RNS generation and induction of 8-OHdG and APE/Ref-1, seven days after a single instillation with native quartz or quartz from which the surface was coated with either PVNO or AL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>2-2'-azinobis-(-3 ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), ethidium bromide, L-glutamine, Ham's F12 medium, Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), HEPES buffer, fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin/streptavidin solution, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), were all obtained from Sigma (Germany).

Briefly, DQ12 was coated for 5.5 hours in a 5 mg/ml suspension in a 1% dilution of either PVNO or AL, dissolved in distilled deionised sterile water. Non-coated DQ12 was suspended in water without any further additions. After repetitive washings in sterile water, the particles were finally resuspended in sterile water at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in sterile glass tubes, and allowed to dry under a laminar flow chamber. All quartz processing was performed under sterile conditions, and a single batch of non-coated and coated quartz was prepared and used for the whole study to avoid possible variable coating efficiency. Atomic absorption spectrometry and spectrophotometry revealed coating efficiencies of respectively 11 &#x003bc;g PVNO/mg quartz and 1.6 &#x003bc;g aluminium/mg quartz, and transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the coating procedures did not cause changes in particle size distribution or aggregation of the DQ12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. For intratracheal (i.t.) instillation, the dried quartz preparations were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS (without Mg<sup>++ </sup>and Ca<sup>++</sup>) and sonicated in a water bath (Sonorex TK52; 60 Watt, 35 kHz, 5 min).</p></sec><sec><title>Quartz instillation and bronchoalveolar lavage</title><p>Specific pathogen free female Wistar rats were used for the study (Janvier, Le Genest St. Isle, France). The animals were housed and maintained in an accredited on-site testing facility, according to the guidelines of the Society for Laboratory Animals Science (GV-SOLAS). Food and water were available <italic>ad libitum</italic>. When weighing 200&#x02013;250 g (8 weeks old), animals were anaesthetised with isoflurane and i.t. instillation was performed using a laryngoscope. From the non-coated or coated quartz suspensions (5 mg/ml in PBS) 400 &#x003bc;l were instilled giving a final dose of 2 mg per rat (n = 5 per treatment and endpoint). Control rats were instilled with only PBS. Separate control animals received 22 &#x003bc;g PVNO or 35 &#x003bc;g AL (in PBS), amounts calculated from the coating efficiency of both substances, to assess possible direct effects of coating materials. After 7 days, animals were sacrificed by a single i.p. injection of Na-pentobarbital and subsequent exsanguination via the abdominal aorta. The lung was cannulated via the trachea and BAL was performed <italic>in situ </italic>by infusing the lungs with 5 ml aliquots of PBS. The BALF was drained passively by gravity and the procedure was repeated four times, giving a total BAL volume of 20 ml. Total cell number in the BAL was analysed using a hemocytometer chamber (Neubauer) and viability was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. BAL-cell differential was determined on cytospin preparations stained with May-Gr&#x000fc;nwald/Giemsa (MGG). The BALF was centrifuged twice (300 g to collect cells, followed by 1000 g to obtain BALF), and the cell-free supernatant was analysed for lung injury parameters, e.g. total protein, LDH and AP, as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO).</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of cytotoxic and inflammogenic bronchoalveolar lavage parameters</title><p>Total protein was analysed according to the method described by Lowry. LDH and AP were assayed using diagnostic kits from Merck (Germany). MPO activity in the BALF was assayed according to the method originally described by Klebanoff et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Briefly, 200 &#x003bc;l of cell-free BALF was mixed with 800 &#x003bc;l MPO assay solution, containing 107.6 ml H<sub>2</sub>O, 12 ml 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, 0.192 ml Guaiacol, 0.4 ml 0.1 M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The generation of tetra-guaiacol was measured spectrophotometrically (Beckman) at 470 nm and the change of optical density per minute was calculated from the initial rate.

Values were expressed as the ratio of 8-OHdG to deoxyguanosine (dG).</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Lung tissue was removed from the animals, chopped into small pieces, aliquots were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. For preparation of whole protein, lung tissue was homogenised within lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in PBS) containing freshly added protease inhibitors. Homogenate-lysis buffer-mix was incubated for 30 min on ice and spun at 15.000 g for 20 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Protein concentrations were determined by BioRad-Assay (according to the Bradford method). Samples were electrophorezed at equal protein concentrations (10 &#x003bc;g) in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Non-specific protein binding was blocked with 5% dried milk powder and 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS. Detection of the APE/Ref-1 protein was performed using a monoclonal antibody (1:2000) and an anti-mouse-IgG whole protein HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000). Blots were reprobed with an antibody against tubulin (1:5000) and a secondary anti-mouse-IgG whole protein HRP-conjugated antibody (1:5000) for protein normalisation. Band formation was visualised using an ECL-reagent/detection system. Quantification was performed by computer-assisted densitometry scanning using a documentation system (Bio-Rad, Germany) with appropriate software (Gel-doc, Bio-Rad, Germany).

Serial sections of lungs were mounted on different slides and stained either for 8-OHdG or APE/Ref-1. For the detection of both antibodies basically the same method was applied, except for additional steps of RNA digestion and DNA-denaturation for the detection of 8-OHdG. Since both antibodies are monoclonal mouse antibodies, horse serum was used to block unspecific binding. The sections were then incubated with a primary antibody against 8-OHdG (1:100) or against APE/Ref-1 (1:500). Detection was performed by incubation with a secondary biotinylated horse-anti mouse antibody (1:200) followed by the streptavidin-biotin-complex according to the manufacturer's protocol. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as a substrate, and the slides were counter stained with hematoxylin. After washing with distilled water, slides were dehydrated and covered in DePex. For the negative control, control sections were incubated with mouse IgG instead of the primary antibodies at the same IgG concentrations. Slides were analysed using a light microscope (Olympus BX60).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of 8-OHdG and Ref-1 staining following immunohistochemistry</title><p>For quantification of 8-OHdG or APE/Ref-1 five microscopic areas of the left lung lobe of 4 animals per treatment were randomly selected for analysis at an original magnification of &#x000d7; 1000 (oil immersion). Since the staining for 8-OHdG as well as for APE/Ref-1 predominantly occurred within the cell nucleus, in line with the location of the DNA and the action of its repair, all brown (DAB, positive signal) and blue (hematoxylin, negative signal) stained nuclei were counted and expressed as percentage of total cells. In the lungs of the animals that were treated with the non-coated quartz, we observed specific areas with increased an accumulation of inflammatory cells and early indications of tissue remodelling, likely as a result of the non-uniform lung distribution of the quartz-particles after instillation. Therefore, in this treatment group, quantification of each individual section was performed independently for regions with normal lung architecture and focal pathologically altered regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of expression and subcellular localisation of APE/Ref-1 in representative lung cell lines</title><p>In relation to the observed immunohistochemical staining in the lung sections as will be discussed later, APE/Ref-1 protein expression was further evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic>, using Western blotting in the rat cell lines NR8383 and RLE, representing an alveolar macrophage and type II epithelial cell line, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. NR8383 cells were cultured in F12-K Nutrient Mixture/15% FCS/penicillin/streptomycin, and RLE cells were cultured in Ham's 12 Mixture/5% FCS/penicillin/ streptomycin. Both cell lines were grown until near confluence and nuclear as well as cytosolic proteins were then prepared by the method of Staal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Briefly, cells were harvested by gentle scraping and then lysed by incubation on ice in Buffer A (10 mM Hepes, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA containing freshly added protease inhibitors). After 15 min buffer B was added (Buffer A + 10% NP-40), and lysate was centrifuged at 950 g for 10 min. After collection of the supernatant (cytosolic fraction), the pellet containing cell nuclei was resuspended in buffer C (50 mM Hepes, 50 mM KCl, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol containing freshly added protease inhibitors). This nucleic suspension was incubated on ice by agitation for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 18,000 g for 10 min.

Here we report on the effects of surface modification on quartz-induced generation of ROS and RNS in rat lungs in relation to their involvement in the induction of an oxidative stress response (DNA damage, APE/Ref-1 expression) in the lung tissue. Previously, we and others have shown that coating of quartz-particles with PVNO or AL impairs its ability to elicit pulmonary inflammation (i.e. <italic>in vivo</italic>), as well as the generation of ROS by neutrophils or macrophages <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the present study we showed for the first time, that modification of the quartz-surface with PVNO or AL also abrogates <italic>in vivo </italic>formation of ROS and RNS in rat lungs.</p><p>Our current observation that exposure to a pure quartz sample (DQ12) causes increased pulmonary levels of ROS and RNS in rat, is in line with earlier studies by others using Min-U-Sil quartz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Moreover, we found strong relations between total numbers of phagocytes and RNS-levels as well as between total neutrophil numbers and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-levels in the rat lungs in relation to the different particle treatments. Together, these observations contribute to the general opinion on the crucial impact of inflammatory cell-related processes in particle-induced lung diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>For a clear discussion on the role of phagocytes in quartz-related oxidant generation, a distinction between ROS and RNS should be made. With respect to ROS, the present study has focused on the detection of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the relative stable dismutation product of superoxide, which is the initial product of the oxidative burst. It has been established that neutrophils are far more potent superoxide-releasing cells than alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In agreement with this, both PVNO and AL coatings significantly reduced the quartz-induced neutrophil influx as well as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>levels in the BALF, and both parameters were found to be significantly correlated. In contrast to these observations, previously we showed impaired ROS generation from neutrophils upon <italic>in vitro </italic>treatment with PVNO-coated quartz, but not AL-coated quartz, when compared to treatment with native quartz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This contradiction possibly illustrates that direct particle-cell interactions, as mainly studied using <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments, are of a minor relevance in determining neutrophilic ROS release <italic>in vivo</italic>, i.e. within the lung. It also suggests that surface coatings of quartz primarily affect mechanisms regulating the neutrophil influx into the lung, rather than affecting their subsequent activation. The major contribution of neutrophils as a source of pulmonary H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is, however, further illustrated by our current <italic>ex vivo </italic>experiments, showing that the only BAL cells from non-coated quartz-treated rats, characterised by the highest proportion of neutrophils, could be significantly activated by PMA.</p><p>Apart from ROS, RNS are considered to be a major pool of oxidants that contribute to tissue damage during inflammatory processes. The present study has focused on nitrite, as it is a relative stable metabolite of the initial product NO. In our study the positive correlation between total number of macrophages and nitrite failed to reach statistical significance, suggesting the involvement of an additional cellular source of NO in response to silica, such as alveolar type II epithelial cells (35). In general however, alveolar macrophages are known as the major NO-generating cells in the lower lung, and these cells have been shown to produce much more NO than neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The major role of alveolar macrophages in particle-related NO-production is even better illustrated by studies from Huffman and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], who reported that in response to LPS or silica in rats, up to 100% of NOx produced by BAL phagocytes was derived from alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that exposure to quartz results in a clear increase of iNOS mRNA levels in BAL cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Notably, we (data not shown) and others could not detect any <italic>in vitro </italic>generation of nitrite by quartz-exposed macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Thus it is likely to suggest that the reduction of nitrite levels in the lungs of coated-quartz treated animals mainly results from an inhibited macrophage influx into the lung, rather than from a direct inhibitory effect of coated-quartz on the NO-generation by the macrophages. This also suggests that other factors, including pulmonary cell-cell interactions play a crucial role in activation of NO-release by macrophages per se [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This is illustrated by data from Huffman and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], who demonstrated that an interaction between macrophages and recruited neutrophils was a crucial factor in the <italic>in vivo </italic>NO-production upon quartz exposure.</p><p>Oxidative stress is defined as a disturbance in the balance between production of ROS/RNS and antioxidant defence, in favour of the former, which causes potential damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Thus in order to assess oxidative stress in our system, apart from determining ROS/RNS production <italic>in vivo</italic>, we also evaluated the <italic>in vivo </italic>antioxidant protection as well as its possibly resulting damage by BAL analysis of toxicity markers and lung tissue induction of 8-OHdG and APE/Ref-1. Silica exposure has been previously demonstrated to cause increased expression and activity of enzymatic antioxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In the current study, we applied the TEAC assay to evaluate the effects of quartz on the total non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity of the lung. It was shown that the increase in antioxidant capacity in the lung was most pronounced upon exposure to non-coated quartz, although this was predominantly associated with the protein fraction of the BALF. Nevertheless, in spite of this increased antioxidant protection, clear pulmonary toxicity (i.e. increased LDH and AP levels in BALF) was demonstrated, suggesting an imbalance between generation of ROS/RNS and protective antioxidant pathways. The present data also provide a possible explanation for our earlier observations on the effects of native versus coated quartz on the induction of DNA strand breakage and NF&#x003ba;B-pathway activation in rat lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In both processes ROS and RNS are considered as crucial mediators of effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>To evaluate the impact of the observed <italic>in vivo </italic>ROS/RNS generation in relation to the different quartz-preparations that were applied, 8-OHdG induction in lung tissue DNA was analysed. 8-OHdG represents the best investigated oxidative and premutagenic DNA lesion, and accordingly it has been forwarded and used as a marker of oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Previously, we showed that coating of DQ12 with PNVO or AL completely abrogates 8-OHdG induction in human lung epithelial cells <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, using an <italic>in vitro </italic>co-incubation model of activated neutrophils and lung epithelial cells, we also demonstrated 8-OHdG induction in epithelial DNA by neutrophil-generated ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. As such, hypothetically, oxidative DNA damage by quartz in vivo may occur both or either from the surface-reactivity of the quartz particles themselves and/or from phagocyte-derived ROS during inflammation. Importantly however, using two well-established but independent methods (i.e. HPLC/ECD and immunohistochemistry), we did not observe any significant induction of 8-OHdG in our present study by the uncoated, markedly inflammogenic quartz sample. To further complicate this matter, Seiler and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] demonstrated, 21 days after a single i.t. instillation of 1.5 mg DQ12, an increase in 8-OHdG immunoreactivity in the DNA of lung alveolar cells, whereas at 3 days after instillation this increase was not detectable. Yamano and colleagues (1995) in contrast showed relatively rapid-increases in 8-OHdG/dG ratios by HPLC/ECD in lung homogenates of rats following i.t. instillation of 10 mg silica. They observed increased 8-OHdG between 1 and 28 days, although significance was only reached between 1 to 5 days after exposure, but not at 7 or 28 days. Several reasons for the discrepancies among these various studies and our current experiments may be given, including the use of different doses and exposure times, as well as the use of differently "hazardous" species or batches of quartz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In relation to the delayed up-regulation of 8-OHdG as observed by Seiler and co-worker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], it has been suggested that 8-OHdG induction would predominantly occur in proliferating tissue. However, we did observe neither a clear contrast in visual staining intensities of individuals cells nor any difference in the analysed proportion of positively stained cells for 8-OHdG within the focal versus the non-focal regions of individual lung sections of quartz-treated animals, that would support such possibility.</p><p>It has also been suggested that HPLC/ECD analysis may lead to artificial induction of 8-OHdG during the extraction and processing of isolated DNA, which might have lead to increased background levels in control animals and thereby obscuring actual occurring differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, this would not explain for the significant positive findings by Yamano and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] as well as our unexpected effects with the AL-coated, and more specifically the PVNO-coated quartz samples. A possible explanation for these observations might be that, in contrast to the severe inflammation induced by the non-coated quartz, very mild inflammatory responses as observed with the coated samples, fail to up-regulate compensatory feedback mechanisms such as antioxidants and/or oxidative DNA repair actions. At present we are however very cautious about such interpretation, all the more since in our current study the coating-associated effects on 8-OHdG could not be verified by immunohistochemistry.</p><p>The hallmark of our observations with regard to the oxidative DNA damage data in current study, was that despite the occurrence of a marked and persistent inflammation, characterised by a 100-fold increased number of neutrophils and a significant increase in pulmonary ROS/RNS levels, no enhanced steady-state expression of 8-OHdG was found by either method of analysis. We therefore hypothesised that quartz-particles and/or their associated inflammatory effects might have caused a compensatory steady-state induction of BER to prevent exponential increases in oxidative DNA damage during conditions of persistent stress. As such, we decided to evaluate the expression of APE/Ref-1, in view of its established <italic>in vivo </italic>inducibility, its redox-sensitivity, as well as its rather broad action-spectrum in ROS mediated damage repair, compared to other BER proteins such as the 8-OHdG glycosylase Ogg-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. As an additional advantage, investigation of repair enzymes, including APE/Ref-1, has the advantage to being oxidation-artefact-free indices of <italic>in vivo</italic>-induced oxidative DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Our investigations of whole lung homogenate revealed a significant increase in APE/Ref-1 protein expression following instillation of non-coated quartz, but not by the surface-modified quartz samples, in comparison to the control animals. These results were further confirmed by immunohistochemistry, where lung sections from the quartz-treated animals showed increased APE/Ref-1 protein expression in the same lung areas as analysed for 8-OHdG. Subsequent random analysis of the % of positively stained cells showed a significant increase, especially in focal pathologically-altered lung areas. To date, in the field of particle research, the induction of APE/Ref-1 has only been described <italic>in vitro </italic>for asbestos fibres, namely in mesothelial cells and in alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Here we show for the first time that exposure to respirable quartz-dust leads to enhanced expression of APE/Ref-1 in rat lung <italic>in vivo</italic>. With regard to its cell-specificity, intense nuclear staining was observed within alveolar macrophages but also epithelial cells, which are known for their involvement in quartz-induced inflammatory, proliferative, as well as genotoxic effects. In support of these <italic>in vivo </italic>observations, concomitant <italic>in vitro </italic>analysis of APE/Ref-1 expression in NR8383 alveolar macrophages and RLE lung epithelial cells, showed for both cell types a constitutive, predominantly nuclear expression of this protein. Whether the observed <italic>in vivo </italic>effects on APE/Ref-1 expression are driven by possible direct action of the reactive quartz surface or indirectly via action of phagocyte-derived products including ROS or RNS remains to be clarified, and will be a major part of our further <italic>in vitro </italic>investigations. Interestingly in this regard, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>has recently been described to cause nuclear accumulation and <italic>de novo </italic>synthesis of APE/Ref-1 protein in gastric epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], in a process which could be inhibited by antioxidant pre-treatment. On the other hand, quartz particles may also be directly implicated in line with the <italic>in vitro </italic>observations with asbestos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Whereas in the mesothelial cell study, asbestos was reported to enhance both nuclear and mitochondrial APE/Ref-1 expression in relation to its DNA repair actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], in the macrophage studies, the observed asbestos effect were connected to its regulation of redox-sensitive transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Similarly, apart from current indications for its role in oxidative DNA damage repair, also current <italic>in vivo </italic>observations are indicative for a role of APE/Ref-1 in the well-known proliferative and fibrogenic effects of quartz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. First of all, the currently observed immunohistochemical staining patterns for APE/Ref-1 are well in line with our previous work, were we showed that quartz, unlike coated-quartz, causes <italic>in vivo </italic>activation of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway in alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the comparatively stronger nuclear staining of APE/Ref-1 among cells within the focal pathologic lesions compared to non-focal locations as observed 7 days after quartz instillation, also points towards a possible role of this bifunctional protein in quartz-induced proliferation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Accordingly, in our future studies we will further investigate the complex kinetics of APE/Ref-1 expression as a potential hallmark of quartz pathogenesis in relation to its dual involvement, i.e. oxidative DNA damage repair redox-regulation of inflammatory and proliferative signalling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study showed that coating of the reactive particle surface inhibited quartz-induced production of ROS and RNS in the respiratory tract, a process that was closely associated with a reduced level of inflammatory cells. Obviously, since these endpoints were obtained at the persistent stage of inflammation (i.e. seven days following instillation) one should be cautious to extrapolate our results to the acute inflammatory response by quartz. Pulmonary ROS and RNS release is considered as a crucial and unifying factor in the quartz-induced adverse health effects, including fibrogenicity and carcinogenicity. Despite the fact that non-coated quartz caused a significant ROS/RNS generation and lung tissue damage (i.e. LDH, AP), oxidative DNA damage in the form of 8-OHdG was not increased in the lung. Notably however, the same treatment was found to significantly enhance the expression of APE/Ref-1, a BER pathway protein, also involved in the specific repair of 8-OHdG lesions. On the one hand, our data provide further support that DNA repair enzymes, specifically APE/Ref-1, represent more sensitive and less artefact-prone markers of oxidative stress in models of <italic>in vivo </italic>oxidant exposure than oxidative DNA damage markers, e.g. 8-OHdG. On the other hand, our observations suggest that during quartz-elicited pulmonary inflammation and associated oxidant generation, pathways of oxidative DNA damage repair may be up-regulated to prevent and/or to compensate for the induction and persistence of oxidative DNA damage and possibly resulting mutagenesis. To confirm this hypothesis, our current investigations are focusing on evaluation of the expression of other BER-pathway related proteins apart from APE/Ref-1, as well as on the specific analysis of the actual activity of BER-repair.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>2,2'-azinobis-(-3 ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS), 2,2'-azobis-(-2-amidinopropane)HCl (ABAP), Activator protein 1 (AP-1), alkaline phosphatase (AP), aluminium lactate (AL), apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE), base excision repair (BER), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), diaminobenzidine (DAB), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), electron spin resonance (ESR), fetal calf serum (FCS), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD), horseradish peroxidase (HRPO), intraperitoneal (i.p.), intratracheal (i.t.), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), May-Gr&#x000fc;nwald/Giemsa (MGG), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitric oxide (NO), Nuclear factor kappa B (NF&#x003ba;B), phenol red (PRS solution), phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), phosphate buffered saline (PBS), polyvinylpyridine-N-oxide (PVNO), rat lung epithelial cells (RLE), reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), redox effector factor (Ref)-1, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC)</p></sec><sec><title>Declaration of competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CA: General study design and supervision (role of surface coating in quartz pathogenesis), instillation and sectioning, immunohistochemical assays and analysis, preparation of manuscript.</p><p>AK: Study design (investigations of oxidative stress), developed/conducted <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>ex vivo </italic>ROS/RNS assays, preparation of manuscript (equal contributions by CA and AK).</p><p>AB: Sectioning, analysis of toxicity markers in BAL</p><p>DH: Bronchoalveolar lavage and sectioning, analysis of cellular inflammation in BAL.</p><p>PH: Western blotting analyses.</p><p>FvS: Contribution to experimental design cf.
