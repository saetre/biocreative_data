Antioxidant enzymes detoxify ROS, dissipate excess energy and regenerate the electron acceptors NADP<sup>+ </sup>and thioredoxin. As part of the acclimation to unfavourable growth conditions, expression of antioxidant enzymes increases under moderate stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Under severe stress conditions gene expression decreases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, various antioxidant enzymes, such as ascorbate peroxidases (APx) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and peroxiredoxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], are inactivated. Accumulating ROS decrease the photosynthetic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and activate cytosolic defence mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In CuZn-superoxide dismutase (Csd) knock-down lines of Arabidopsis, photooxidative stress alters strongest the expression pattern of chloroplast proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Consistently, in 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (2-CP) antisense lines the imbalance in the chloroplast redox poise induces expression of chloroplast APx and monodehydroascorbate reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. <italic>In planta </italic>analysis of 2CPA promoter regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] demonstrated that nuclear transcription of chloroplast antioxidant enzymes responds to chloroplast signals. The redox state of the plastoquinone pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the redox state of low molecular weight antioxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the acceptor availability at photosystem I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] have been postulated to signal the chloroplast redox poise. Signal transduction through ROS, oxylipins, protochlorophyllides, metabolic coupling by carbohydrates and the redox poise of NAD(P)<sup>+</sup>/NAD(P)H, MAPK cascades and ABA have been indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Presently, signal transduction is under intensive investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. First results demonstrate the signalling function of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-protoporphyrins and the ABA-triggered transcription factor ABI4 in correlation of nuclear gene expression with chloroplast development upon greening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, the precise molecular mechanisms regulating nuclear expression of chloroplast antioxidant enzymes in green tissues in a redox-dependent manner are still elusive.</p><p>Mutants screened for low expression of the nuclear encoded chloroplast 2CPA (<italic>rimb-mutants</italic>) differentiated transcriptional regulation of chloroplast antioxidant enzymes from typical responses to ROS accumulation, such as the induction of lipoxygenase-2 (Lox2), ascorbate peroxidase-2 (Apx2), BAP1 and Fer1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] [Heiber et al., unpublished data]. Many genes for cytosolic antioxidant enzymes, such as Apx2, are gradually induced to very high levels. The expression intensity correlates with the availability of the regulating transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In contrast, expression of most chloroplast antioxidant enzymes is induced up to a certain stress level, but decreased in response to severe oxidative stress conditions, such as application of high concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] [Heiber et al., unpublished data], it is hypothesized that either a plus-minus regulator or interacting antagonistic signalling pathways control gene expression.</p><p>In respect of transcriptional regulation, the 2CPA is one of the best studied genes encoding a chloroplast antioxidant enzyme. Transcription is strongest in young developing tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. On top of the developmental regulation, the transcription intensity correlates with the acceptor availability at photosystem-I (PS-I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which defines the reduction states of NADP<sup>+ </sup>and thioredoxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. <italic>In planta </italic>promoter analysis demonstrated that photosynthetic redox signal is sensed in a distinct promoter region. The target motif is located upstream of the 314 bp core promoter, that correlates 2CPA expression with chloroplast development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Various nuclear encoded chloroplast proteins are co-regulated with 2CPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Piippo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] postulated that the reducing site of PS-I actually is a major signal initiation point in chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling.</p><p>A 216 bp redox-sensitive <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory region has been identified in the 2CPA promoter. It responds to the chloroplast redox signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Since sequence analysis gave no indication for interaction with a known redox-regulated transcription factor, a yeast-one-hybrid screen was performed to identify cis-regulatory proteins. Here isolation and characterization of the transcription factor Rap2.4a is presented. Rap2.4a is redox-sensitive, binds to a CE3-like element in the redox-sensitive promoter region and regulates transcription of 2CPA. Analysis of Rap2.4a-KO lines demonstrated that the transcription factor also impacts on expression of other nuclear encoded chloroplast antioxidant enzymes and protects plants against mild stresses, such as fluctuating environmental light conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Isolation of Rap2.4a</title><p>To identify cis-regulatory proteins involved in transcriptional regulation of 2CPA, a yeast-one-hybrid (Y1H) screen was performed with the 216 bp redox-active 2CPA promoter domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and its flanking regions. The bait element was cloned into the vector pONE-1 upstream of the Gal1,10 minimal promoter and the HIS3-cDNA. The vector was transformed into the yeast strain Y187. Preys were provided by co-transformation of Y187 with a cDNA library derived from an <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>cell suspension culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Strongest interaction with the 2CPA promoter DNA was observed with pAct2-clone1, which encodes a fusion protein of the Gal4-activation domain (AD) and the AP2-type transcription factor Rap2.4a (At1g36060; type Ib-ERF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] spaced by 11 amino acids (AD-Rap2.4a).</p><p>The interaction of the AD-Rap2.4a-fusion protein with the bait was confirmed on media supplemented with 40 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazol (3AT), which is an inhibitor of His-biosynthesis.

Alternative to monitoring the gel shifts by immunodetection of His-tagged proteins, the interaction between the bait element and Rap2.4a was analysed by detection of biotinylated PCR-products using horseradish peroxidise-coupled streptavidin (data not shown). Here, immunodetection of the proteins was chosen as routine method, since both methods showed the interaction of DNA and proteins, but immunodetection of His-tags turned out to be easier and more efficient to apply.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In vitro </italic>characterisation of DNA binding of recombinant Rap2.4a to the redox box of the 2CPA promoter</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>The 2CPA promoter region used in the Y1H-screen was amplified into 5 fragments by PCR (F1 &#x02013; F5).

Rap2.4a contains 3 cysteine residues at the positions 113, 286 and 302, which are located outside of the DNA-binding motif (aa 141 &#x02013; 209) in the N- and C-terminal domains. They are not conserved in the Ib-ERF-subfamily of AP2-family of transcription factors and specific to Rap2.4a (data not shown). By equilibrium-based redox titration the midpoint redox potential of -269 mV was determined for the transition from Rap2.4a monomers to dimers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], who recently grouped 122 AP2-type transcription factors into 12 clades, the isolated transcription factor Rap2.4a is one of eight class-Ib-ERF proteins with conserved AP2-domains, but highly variant N- and C-termini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Two class-Ib-ERFs have so far been partially characterized: Rap2.4b (At1g78080) complements DREBP and blocks ethylene signalling if it is overexpressed in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Rap2.4c (At2g22200) is post-translationally targeted to chloroplasts where it may take over a specific, so far unknown function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of Rap2.4a knock-out lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) demonstrated that Rap2.4a is, unlike Rap2.4b, not fully complemented by homologous and analogous transcription factors. Hence, Rap2.4a has a specific function in plant gene regulation. Expression of several genes was impaired in absence of Rap2.4a (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and Rap2.4a-free (Rap2.4-KO) plants were more susceptible to fluctuating environmental conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>Rap2.4a binding to DNA is redox regulated.

In between, under control and slightly oxidizing conditions, the transcription factor is in its dimeric state (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Since Rap2.4a activated the gene expression under these conditions (Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), it is concluded that dimeric Rap2.4a stimulates promoter acitivity.</p><p>Redox regulation of proteins is often maintained though thiol-disulfide regulation. Within the Rap2.4 family of transcription factors Rap2.4a is characterized by a distinct signature of cysteinyl residues. While one cysteinyl residue, which is conserved in other group members, is missing, the cysteine residue at position 113, 286 and 302 are specific for Rap2.4a. Redox-dependent oligomerization may indicate intermolecular disulfide formation and/or structural changes that foster aggregation in hetero- or homo-complexes and finally inactivation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p><italic>In vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>gene expression analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>; Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) demonstrated that Rap2.4a confers redox responsiveness to the 2CPA promoter by redox-dependent binding and activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In addition, Rap2.4a availability impacts on the expression of various other nuclear encoded chloroplast proteins involved in adaptation of plants to environmental variation. Increased transcript levels of ROS-regulated ZAT10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and stress-induced Rap2.4b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] demonstrate that Rap2.4a function antagonizes activation of secondary signalling cascades which are activated at higher stress thresholds. Because no homologous Rap2.4a binding sites could have been identified in the promoters of co-regulated genes (data not shown), it is assumed that the other antioxidant enzymes are indirectly co-regulated by a so far unknown mechanism. From comparison of Rap2.4a-KO lines with 2CPA antisense lines, cross talk by the availability of 2CPA mRNA or protein can be excluded. It is more likely that Rap2.4a triggers secondary transcription factors, which in turn activate the other nuclear genes for chloroplast antioxidant enzymes.</p><p>The midpoint redox potential of the activating transition from Rap2.4a monomer to dimer is -269 mV at pH 7.0 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). It is more negative than the midpoint potential of glutathione (E<sub>hc </sub>= -230 mV), but less than that of most thioredoxins (-290 to -300 mV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Moderate oxidation of the glutathione pool, such as caused by photosynthetic activity and propagated by thioredoxins and the redox poise of the NAD(P)<sup>+</sup>/NADPH and the glutathione systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], may be sufficient to activate Rap2.4a-dependent gene expression. Stronger redox imbalances would inactivate Rap2.4a by aggregate formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>; Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) and consequently support accumulation of ROS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). While over-expression of Rap2.4a promotes 2CPA expression under control and mildly oxidizing conditions, under reducing conditions it does not impact on 2CPA expression (Tab. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Here, it is shown that the transcription factor Rap2.4a is a redox regulator with redox sensory function. Rap2.4a is involved in the signalling pathway triggering the 2CPA redox box [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which responds to the acceptor availability at photosystem I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The sensitivity of Rap2.4a-KO lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) demonstrates that Rap2.4a regulates tolerance against natural environmental fluctuation via the control of the nuclear expression of the chloroplast antioxidant and photosynthetic systems (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).
