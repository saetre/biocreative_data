This modulation is related with Zfra binding with TRADD, NF-&#x003ba;B, JNK1 and WOX1, as determined by GST pull-down analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, and mapping by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Functionally, transiently overexpressed Zfra sequestered NF-&#x003ba;B (p65), WOX1, p53 and phospho-ERK (extracellular signal-activated kinase) in the cytoplasm, and TNF or UV light could not effectively induce nuclear translocation of these proteins.

This gene is located on a common fragile site ch16q23.3&#x02013;24.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of <italic>WWOX </italic>gene has been found in several types of cancers [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; reviews]. WWOX/FOR/WOX1 possesses two <italic>N</italic>-terminal WW domains (containing conserved tryptophan residues), a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) between the WW domains, and a <italic>C</italic>-terminal short chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) domain. <italic>WWOX </italic>mRNA may undergo alternative splicing, thereby generating at least 8 mRNAs mainly coding for proteins with altered SDR domain sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Several protein isoforms have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Nonetheless, presence of specific protein isoforms in normal and cancerous tissues remains to be established.</p><p>WWOX/FOR/WOX1 is considered as a candidate tumor suppressor and proapoptotic protein, whereas its <italic>in vivo </italic>function is largely unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Under stress conditions, WOX1 undergoes phosphorylation at Tyr33 and may translocate to the mitochondria and nuclei to induce apoptosis in cultured cells and in rat eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Tyr33-phosphorylated or activated WOX1 binds to the proline-rich region and phospho-Ser46 of p53, and both proteins induce apoptosis synergistically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. When WOX1 is functionally suppressed by antisense mRNA, small interfering RNA (siRNA), or dominant negatives, the stability of p53 and its apoptotic function are significantly suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The proapoptotic function of WOX1 is probably associated, in part, with its interaction with p53, p73, JNK1 and other transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>To isolate WOX1-binding proteins using yeast two-hybrid cDNA library screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], we found that WOX1 interacts with a small size 31-amino-acid protein, Zfra (zinc finger-like peptide that regulates apoptosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Zfra belongs to the family of C2H2 type zinc finger proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and has a sequence homology to transcription factor forkhead protein xFKHR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Zinc finger proteins interact with DNA and RNA, which is essential for regulating gene transcription during cell growth and embryogenesis. Damage to the zinc fingers in DNA repair proteins may induce carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Zfra mRNA is expressed in many organs and tissues and most abundant in the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, it is absent in several prostate and breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Zfra participates in the signal pathway of tumor necrosis factor (TNF or TNF-&#x003b1;) [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]; reviews]. Zfra appears to play a dual role in regulating the cytotoxic effects of TNF and Fas ligand (FasL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Zfra either enhances or blocks the apoptotic functions of transiently overexpressed receptor adaptor proteins TRADD (tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain protein) and FADD (Fas-associated death domain-containing protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. TRADD and FADD are recruited to the TNF receptors when cells are stimulated with TNF or Fas ligand (FasL). In response to TNF and UV light, Zfra undergoes self-binding and interacts with JNK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. JNK1 is a downstream effector of the TNF signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The functional mechanism for the action of Zfra remains to be established.</p><p>In this study, we further investigated the underlying mechanisms for the regulatory effect of Zfra on cell death caused by transiently overexpressed death domain proteins, including TRADD, FADD and RIP (receptor-interacting protein). We determined the role of a conserved phosphorylation site at serine 8 in conferring Zfra-induced apoptosis. Also, we examined whether Zfra regulates the activation of transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B and tumor suppressors p53 and WOX1 in response to TNF and UV light, and discussed the biological implications of their interactions both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Transiently overexpressed Zfra induces apoptosis</title><p>We have previously shown that when ectopic Zfra is stably expressed in L929 fibroblasts, these cells resist the cytotoxic effects of TNF and FasL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In contrast, depending upon the concentrations used or the extent of expression, transiently expressed Zfra could either enhance or inhibit the cytotoxic function of overexpressed death domain proteins TRADD and FADD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The underlying mechanism of this regard is unknown.</p><p>To further examine the role of Zfra-mediated death, a panel of adherent cell lines was transfected with an EGFP-tagged Zfra cDNA expression construct by CaPO4. For non-adherent Molt4 T cells, the DNA construct was introduced by electroporation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In controls, cells were transfected with buffer or EGFP vector only. Following 48 hr in culture, Zfra induced death of human cell lines including ovarian ME180, embryonic kidney HEK-293, neuroblastoma SK-N-SH, Molt4 T lymphocytes, and breast MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and murine L929 fibroblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). However, Zfra had no effect on human prostate DU145 and mink lung epithelial Mv1Lu cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Based on our previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], an optimal dose of Zfra, 150 ng/well in 96-well plates, was used to produce ~30&#x02013;40% death of L929 cells. Cells with positive protein expression were approximately 60&#x02013;75%, as determined by fluorescence microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). EGFP-Zfra was present ubiquitously in cell compartments in majority of the tested cells. Interestingly, EGFP-Zfra was mainly present in the cytoplasm in breast MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Zfra induces apoptotic cell death</bold>.

These cells were transfected with an EGFP (vector) or EGFP-Zfra expression vector (150 ng/well in 96-well microtiter plates) or medium (control) by CaPO4, followed by culturing for 48 hr and then staining with crystal violet for determining the extent of death (n = 8; mean &#x000b1; standard deviation; <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, EGFP vector-transfected cells versus EGFP-Zfra-transfected cells except DU145 and Mv1Lu; Student's t tests). Molt4 T cells were transfected with the DNA constructs by electroporation. Data shown in the buffer and vector (EGFP) controls are from testing L929 cells. Similar data were obtained using other cells. The numbers of cells with positive EGFP or EGFP-Zfra protein expression were ~60&#x02013;75%, as determined by fluorescence microscopy.

We have shown that Zfra modulates the apoptotic function of overexpressed TRADD and FADD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Here, we continued to examine whether Zfra affects RIP-mediated cell death. We used ME180, HEK-293 and DU145 cells, and DU145 was resistant to Zfra-mediated death (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These cells were cotransfected with "cytotoxic" doses of cDNA expression constructs of TRADD and/or Zfra (tagged with EGFP) by CaPO4. Similar experiments were performed with Zfra with FADD and RIP. Both Zfra and TRADD induced death of ME180 and HEK-293 cells in an additive manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Nonetheless, Zfra did not increase cell death with FADD or RIP in an additive manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In the Zfra-resistant DU145 cells, Zfra alone did not cause cell death, but increased the cytotoxic function of TRADD, FADD and RIP by approximately 100&#x02013;150% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of Zfra on TRADD, FADD, or RIP-mediated cell death</bold>.

Upon binding with p55 TNF receptor (p55-TNFR), TNF engages in two signaling pathways for either protecting cells from death or committing cells to death. For initiating cell death, p55-TNFR recruits TRADD, FADD and RIP to generate a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12A</xref>). Caspase 8 is then recruited to the DISC and becomes activated, followed by activating downstream caspases to induce apoptosis at both the mitochondrial and nuclear levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F12"><label>Figure 12</label><caption><p><bold>A schematic model of Zfra/WOX1 involvement in TNF signaling</bold>. TNF is able to initiate two counteractive pathways &#x02013; one apoptotic and the other protective. <bold>(A) </bold>In the death pathway, binding of TNF to the cognate p55-TNF receptor (TNFR) results in recruitment of death domain proteins TRADD, FADD and RIP, thus generating the so called death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Caspase 8 and downstream effectors are then activated to induce cell death at the mitochondrial and nuclear levels [16,17]. In this study, we discovered that Zfra physically interacts with TRADD and WOX1, and that WOX1 binds TRADD. Thus, Zfra and WOX1 are likely to be recruited to the DISC. WOX1 enhances TNF cytotoxicity [3], and Zfra counteracts the WOX1 function. Zfra either enhances or inhibits the function of death domain proteins (open arrow). Thus, the ying and yang of cell death depends upon the strength of DISC formation and the counteractive or enhancing force of Zfra. <bold>(B) </bold>In the protective pathway, p55-TNF recruits TRADD, TRAF2 and RIP, followed by activating several downstream adaptors and finally JNK1 and NF-&#x003ba;B. We determined that overexpressed Zfra sequesters p53, WOX1, and NF-&#x003ba;B in the cytoplasm. Thus, Zfra is likely to bind and block the function of these proteins during TNF signaling (see each step marked by a number). In <bold>Step 1</bold>, at the membrane level, Zfra binds TRADD in the presence of TRADD, TRAF2, RIP and WOX1. In <bold>Step 2</bold>, a trimolecular complex of Zfra/JNK1/WOX1 may form when JNK1 is activated by the upstream activated MEK. Zfra binds and counteracts the apoptotic function of JNK1. Also, JNK1 counteracts the apoptotic function of WOX1 [6]. In <bold>Step 3</bold>, MEK activates ERK, and that Zfra may bind and sequester ERK to the cytoplasm. In <bold>Step 4</bold>, phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; by IKK causes degradation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and release of NF-&#x003ba;B for nuclear translocation. Again, Zfra is able to bind and sequester NF-&#x003ba;B in the cytoplasm. In <bold>Step 5 and 6</bold>, TNF induces NF-&#x003ba;B activation, and then NF-&#x003ba;B activates p53 [22]. The non-ankyrin <italic>C</italic>-terminus of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; physically interacts with cytosolic p53 [25]. p53 is functionally associated with WOX1, and both proteins may induce apoptosis synergistically [3,4,6,8].

Zfra either enhances or inhibits the function of death domain proteins. Thus, the driving force for committing cells to death in response to TNF is likely coming from a balanced and counter-balanced work among Zfra, WOX1 and DISC.</p><p>In the TNF-initiated protective pathway, Zfra is shown to interact with TRADD, JNK1 and NF-&#x003ba;B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12B</xref>).

In <bold>Step 2</bold>, a trimolecular complex of Zfra/JNK1/WOX1 may form when JNK1 becomes activated by the upstream activated MEK. Zfra binds and counteracts the apoptotic function of JNK1.

Zfra is inducible under stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We show that at low levels Zfra enhances cell growth, and yet overexpressed Zfra induces cell death. Ectopic Zfra also blocked adherence-independent growth of L929 fibroblasts, suggesting that it may act as a tumor suppressor to block cancer growth and progression. Zfra is most abundant in the spleen, whereas its role in regulating immune cell differentiation and functions is unknown. However, it is reasonable to suggest that Zfra-regulated TNF signaling is likely to play a role in the lymphocyte differentiation. We also determined that absent expression of Zfra is found in several breast and prostate cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], implying that Zfra deficiency may provide a growth advantage for cancer cells. Majority of zinc finger proteins participate in gene transcription and embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Synthetic peptides have been shown promises in therapy to modulate the transcriptional activities of endogenous zinc finger proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Shortening and/or modification of the naturally occurring Zfra may be of therapeutic value in controlling cancer cell growth and death.</p><p>Zfra is distributed ubiquitously in cellular compartments. In response to TNF, a portion of cytosolic Zfra appears to translocate to the cell membrane area and binds TRADD. Death domain/death domain interaction is responsible for TRADD binding with p55-TNFR, FADD and RIP. Whether Zfra binds to the death domain is unknown. Sequence alignment analysis shows a common structural motif in TRADD, JNK1, NF-&#x003ba;B, and the <italic>N</italic>-terminal WW domain and <italic>C</italic>-terminal SDR domain of WOX1. Whether this motif interacts with Zfra remains to be established.</p><p>WWOX/WOX1 is known to interact with p53, p73, JNK1, AP-2&#x003b3;, and ErbB4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], suggesting its role of the regulation of gene transcription. Both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>studies have shown that overexpressed WWOX1/WOX1 suppresses tumor growth in nude mice, and induces apoptosis in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Overexpressed WW and SDR/C domains induce cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Most interestingly, the <italic>C</italic>-terminal tail of WOX1 is needed to work together with SDR in causing cell death. In stark contrast, non-invasive breast and prostate cancers may have upregulated expression of WWOX/WOX1, Tyr33 phosphorylation and WWOXv2/WOX2 (and other family proteins if present) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Downregulation of WOX1 and WOX2 promotes neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting its protective role against neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. FOR (WWOX/WOX1) is shown to protect against the effects of ionizing radiation in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. These observations support a pro-survival role of WOX1 <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In domain/domain mapping by yeast two-hybrid analysis, Zfra was shown to bind the <italic>N</italic>-terminal Tyr33-phosphorylated WW domain of WOX1. Alteration of this phosphorylation site abolishes the binding interaction. Also, it interacts with the <italic>C</italic>-terminal SDR domain of WOX1. Since Zfra is a small peptide, its simultaneous binding to these domains in WOX1 under physiologic and stress conditions is very likely. Our supporting evidence shows that stress stimuli induce phosphorylation of WOX1 at Tyr33 and Zfra at Ser8, and that the Zfra/WOX1 complex co-translocates to the mitochondria to regulate cell death via the mitochondrial pathway (Hsu <italic>et al</italic>., submitted). Also, in this study we found that Zfra enhances the apoptotic activity of SDR domain and the <italic>C</italic>-terminal tail of WOX1.</p><p>Overexpressed Zfra may nullify the apoptotic activities of WOX1 and p53. An apparent mechanism is that overexpressed Zfra sequesters transcriptional factors in the cytoplasm. For example, ectopic Zfra restricts nuclear localization of endogenous WOX1, p53, ERK, and NF-&#x003ba;B (p65), indicating that an upregulated level of Zfra may control the transcriptional system in cells under stress conditions.</p><p>Taken together, we have identified a molecular pathway underlying Zfra regulation of TNF cytotoxic function. Zfra interacts with TRADD and binds downstream NF-&#x003ba;B, p53, JNK1 and WOX1 of the TNF signal pathway, thereby either enhancing or restricting TNF-mediated cell death.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines, antibodies and chemicals</title><p>Majority of our experiments were performed using murine L929 fibroblasts, monkey kidney COS7 fibroblasts and human Molt4 T lymphocytes for ectopic gene expression.
