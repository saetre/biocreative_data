We also undertook an analysis of transcription factor binding sites in our dataset by examining previously-published biological data for Hap4 (in complex with Hap2, 3, 5), Cat8 and Mig1, and used this in combination with verified binding consensus sequences to identify genes likely to be regulated by one or more of these.

In addition, 13% were found to have a binding site for Cat8 and 21% had a binding site for Mig1. Unexpectedly, both the up- and down-regulation of many of the genes in our dataset had a clear glucose dependence in the parent V5 strain that was not present in V5.TM6*P.

Overall, our data support genetic remodelling in V5.TM6*P consistent with a respiratory metabolism which is insensitive to external glucose concentrations.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>We engineered the first respiratory <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>strain, KOY.TM6*P, by integrating the gene encoding a chimeric hexose transporter, Tm6*, into the genome of an <italic>hxt </italic>null yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Subsequently we demonstrated the transferability of this respiratory phenotype to a yeast strain, V5 <italic>hxt1-7</italic>&#x00394;, in which only <italic>HXT1-7 </italic>had been deleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The resulting V5.TM6*P strain produced only minor amounts of ethanol when cultured on external glucose concentrations as high as 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Despite the fact that the glucose flux was reduced to 30% in the V5.TM6*P strain compared with that of its parental V5 strain, the V5.TM6*P strain produced biomass at a specific rate as high as 85% of that produced by the V5 wild-type strain, the yield itself increasing by 50% in the mutant compared to its parental strain.</p><p>Having performed this initial physiological characterization of the V5.TM6*P strain, we wanted to examine more thoroughly the basis of its respiratory phenotype by comparing its transcriptome with that of its wild-type parent strain, V5. This approach has been widely used to obtain a global picture of the cellular responses of yeast to a wide range of physiological changes, including those experienced at the diauxic shift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Recently Ohlmeier and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] demonstrated that major changes at the transcriptional level are not reflected at the protein level. Indeed, focusing on the mitochondrial proteome following a diauxic shift, they showed that the levels of only 18 out of 253 identified proteins had changed (17 increased, and 1 decreased). Among them were proteins involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Sdh1, Sdh2, and Sdh4) and the respiratory chain (Cox4, Cyb2, and Qcr7). This seeming disagreement with their observations of heterogeneous changes in the transcriptome (where more than 4,000 changes were recorded) is also consistent with our own prior data where we showed that the protein patterns obtained from a 2D-PAGE analysis of the two strains (grown under the same conditions used in this study) were not substantially different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. We did note, however, that the levels of the upper-part glycolytic intermediates and ATP did differ between the two strains, and that Cdc19 is present in lower amounts in V5.TM6*P. This discrepancy between proteome and transcriptome regulation has also been observed by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and is also consistent with the fact that there is an acknowledged lack of relationship between the levels of glycolytic proteins and the glycolytic flux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Nonetheless, researchers continue to depend on mRNA as an indicator of cellular state, which is a situation that will continue while methods for the global analysis of protein expression are improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In this respect, Brauer and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] have used transcriptome analysis to examine adjustments and remodelling of the metabolism of glucose-limited yeast cultures. In that study, the authors constructed metabolic models consistent with their cDNA array data. In this work, the V5.TM6*P strain was therefore characterized at the transcriptome level in comparison with the parental V5 strain in order to obtain a more global understanding of any genetic remodelling underlying the physiological differences between them. Both strains were cultured in 50 g/L glucose with six samples being taken at defined points between 38 and 6 g/L glucose for cDNA array analysis in two independent fermentations for each strain. Consequently, we generated a highly redundant dataset (n = 12) where 922 genes were either induced or repressed when comparing V5 and V5.TM6*P under all glucose concentrations. Using <italic>in vivo </italic>studies together with documented binding specificities of three transcription factors known to have a role in the regulation of respiratory genes (the Hap complex, Cat8 and Mig1), it was possible to correlate the up-regulation of all but 18 of the 146 genes induced by a factor &#x02265;2.0 with the presence of one or more of their binding sites. This means that 75% of the transcriptional response of the genes in our dataset could be related to the activities of just three transcription factors, which in turn would account for 88% of the response of the induced set. Finally, we made the unexpected observation that both the induction and repression of many of the genes in our dataset had a clear glucose dependence in the parent V5 strain that was not present in V5.TM6*P. This important result indicates that the relief of glucose repression in the wild-type is already operable at much higher glucose concentrations than is currently widely accepted and that the phenotype of the respiratory strain is glucose insensitive by comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We compared the transcriptional profiles of the V5 and V5.TM6*P strains cultured in 50 g/L glucose, with samples extracted between 38 and 6 g/L residual glucose. We identified 190 genes with adjusted p-values &#x0003c; 0.05 that changed their expression levels either up by a factor of &#x02265;2.0 (146 genes) or down by a factor of &#x02264;0.5 (44 genes) when comparing the two strains at all three sampling points. These genes are presented by functional category of their gene products in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and are discussed below. Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> provides the information in Excel format and also includes other relevant literature data. A further 636 genes changed their expression levels either up by a factor of &#x0003c;2.0 (317 genes) or down by a factor &#x0003e; 0.5 (319 genes) and are presented as part of Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>. The remaining 96 genes were either dubious, Ty-transposable elements, or were detected due to cross-hybridisation, as indicated in the legend to Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.</p><sec><title>The majority of genes that have an altered expression in V5.TM6*P compared with its parental strain also have an altered expression following diauxic shift</title><p>We compared our dataset with three sets of expression data for yeast undergoing a diauxic shift, where the samples had been taken at least 2 hours after the glucose is depleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Of the 190 genes in our dataset that changed their expression levels either up or down by a factor of 2 or more, 154 of these could be identified as changing in the same direction in at least one of these three datasets, with 124 having at least two matches. Only 8 genes (<italic>ERG3</italic>, <italic>RPS27A</italic>, <italic>YHB1</italic>, <italic>TRX1</italic>, <italic>YER188w</italic>, <italic>YKL066w</italic>, <italic>YAR068w </italic>and <italic>Y0L150c</italic>) had changes that were in the opposite direction in at least two of the datasets. This significant overlap between our data set and the data sets of the three previous studies is entirely consistent with the fact that there is a transition from a respiro-fermentative metabolism in V5 to a respiratory metabolism in V5.TM6*P.</p></sec><sec><title>Glycolytic and gluconeogenic genes have substantially altered expression levels in V5.TM6*P</title><p>Four of the most strongly induced genes in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> are the glycolytic genes, <italic>HXK1 </italic>(factor 9.0) and <italic>GLK1 </italic>(3.8), and the gluconeogenic genes, <italic>PCK1 </italic>(6.9) and <italic>FBP1 </italic>(5.3). Indeed, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, the induction in V5.TM6*P of several glycolytic and gluconeogenic genes could be consistent with these cells accommodating for a lack of glucose; the hypothesized mechanism behind the strain's reduced ethanol-producing, respiratory phenotype. The final step in glycolysis which produces pyruvate, is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase. In V5.TM6*P the pyruvate kinase genes, <italic>CDC19 </italic>and <italic>PYK2</italic>, respond in an opposing manner: <italic>CDC19 </italic>is repressed by a factor of 0.4 (consistent with our earlier proteome analysis where Cdc19 is present in lower amounts in V5.TM6*P than V5) while <italic>PYK2 </italic>is induced and is relieved of its glucose-repressed state as a result of the low glucose flux in the respiratory strain. Reduced ethanol production in V5.TM6*P compared to the parental strain is also consistent with the two most strongly repressed genes <italic>PDC1 </italic>(0.2) and <italic>PDC5 </italic>(0.2) encoding the main pyruvate decarboxylases.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>An overview of our dataset in the context of key yeast metabolic pathways</bold>.

Furthermore, <italic>CYB2 </italic>(10.1) and <italic>DLD3 </italic>(0.5), whose gene products are involved in the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, and in the case of <italic>CYB2 </italic>feeding the released electrons into the electron transport chain, are oppositely regulated. Biochemical data and sequence patterns for <italic>YGL157w </italic>(0.3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], <italic>YAL061w </italic>(2.9) and <italic>DSF1 </italic>(9.4, homologous to <sc>D</sc>-mannitol 2-dehydrogenase from <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides) </italic>suggest that these ORFs encode an oxidoreductase, a polyol dehydrogenase and a putative sugar dehydrogenase, respectively, which could be involved in channelling alternative carbon sources into the TCA cycle. The carbon-deficient state of V5.TM6*P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] could also be consistent with the induction of <italic>CRC1 </italic>and <italic>CAT2 </italic>whose gene products are involved in <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-oxidation and carnitine-dependent transport of acetyl-CoA from peroxisomes to mitochondria as a way of using carbon from sources other than glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The induction of <italic>SFC1</italic>, <italic>JEN1</italic>, <italic>FBP1 </italic>and <italic>ATO2 </italic>seen in our study has previously been reported to be a specific identifier of carbon-limited growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>All TCA- and glyoxylate cycle genes have increased expression in V5.TM6*P compared with V5</title><p>The genes encoding the enzymes of the TCA cycle (<italic>CIT1</italic>, <italic>ACO1, IDH1</italic>, <italic>KGD1</italic>, <italic>KGD2</italic>, <italic>LSC2</italic>, <italic>SDH1-4</italic>, <italic>FUM1</italic>, <italic>MDH1</italic>) all have a significant (adjusted p-value &#x0003c; 0.05) increase in expression when comparing V5 and V5.TM6*P. In addition, the gene encoding an isoform of aconitase (<italic>ACO2</italic>) has its expression level reduced by a factor of 0.5. Fermentation is almost completely abolished in the V5.TM6*P strain, and we have previously shown that the TCA cycle has a higher carbon flux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] to harness the electron flow into the respiratory chain and generate a proton gradient using F<sub>0</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase for ATP synthesis (several respiratory chain genes are induced, as discussed below). Interestingly, all genes of the TCA-cycle are induced by greater than a factor of 3.5 except for <italic>CIT1</italic>/<italic>CIT2 </italic>and <italic>KGD1</italic>/<italic>KGD2 </italic>where the factor change is 2.2 &#x02013; 3.5 for each gene of the pair, presumably yielding the same overall transcriptional response. Consistent with this, Ohlmeier and colleagues have shown that Sdh1, 2 and 4 all have increased expression after a diauxic shift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The glyoxylate cycle is anabolic, yielding gluconeogenic precursors, and all its genes (<italic>CIT2</italic>, <italic>ACO1, ICL1 </italic>(induced by a factor of 1.5; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), <italic>MLS1 </italic>and <italic>MDH2</italic>) are induced in V5.TM6*P compared with V5 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This could be consistent with the correspondingly increased biomass yield of the V5.TM6*P strain (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). We note that V5.TM6*P has a lower biomass yield than expected from a totally respiratory phenotype. In chemostat culture under aerobic, fully respiratory conditions, a yield of 0.5 g/g is typical at low dilution rates, whereas the observed low yield in V5.TM6*P has already been published using a range of sugars and concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, numerous experiments on KOY.TM6*P, our original respiratory strain based on CEN.PK2-1C, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] have yielded identical results.

A carbon source deficiency triggers an up-regulation of genes encoding plasma membrane proteins responsible for the import of alternative carbon sources, as already noted: <italic>STL1 </italic>(21.7; glycerol); <italic>JEN1 </italic>(10.2; lactate), <italic>PUT4 </italic>(5.8; proline &#x02013; the main nitrogen source in grape juice) and <italic>MAL31 </italic>(3.1; maltose). A gene associated with nutrient deficiency in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], <italic>YGP1</italic>, is induced by a factor of 2.6, again supporting the notion that V5.TM6*P has undergone a genetic adjustment compared to its parent.</p><p>It seems that V5.TM6*P also has an altered requirement for metal ions in that genes encoding three metal ion channels have altered expression: <italic>CTR3 </italic>(copper transport) is induced by a factor of 3.0, while <italic>ZRT1 </italic>(zinc transport) and <italic>ENB1 </italic>(iron transport) are repressed by a factor of 0.4 &#x02013; 0.5. It is likely that copper import is increased so that copper can be transferred to cytochrome c oxidase, which is the main copper-requiring enzyme in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, with 3 copper ions per complex and a copy number of 5,000&#x02013;12,000 per cell.

It is likely that in V5.TM6*P the repression of <italic>BAP3 </italic>and <italic>GNP1 </italic>is a result of the repression (by a factor 0.65; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>) of <italic>SSY5 </italic>seen on the cDNA array. Interestingly, induction of genes encoding the ammonia transport system in the V5.TM6*P strain (<italic>ATO2</italic>, <italic>MEP1</italic>) could suggest that the strain is experiencing general nutrient limitation.

In order to rationalise these resources, we began by looking for biologically-verified data on transcription factors that might control the repression of the subset of 44 genes of Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. Since only limited information was publicly available, we did not pursue this part of the dataset further. In contrast, for the 146 induced genes in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, our observation of the similarity between the transcriptional changes in the V5 to V5.TM6*P transition and those in the transition from glucose to ethanol growth lead us to analyse the roles of Hap4, Cat8 and Mig1 which have been previously been verified to be crucial to the expression of genes in the diauxic shift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]: Hap4 (in complex with Hap2, 3 and 5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and Cat8 (optionally in complex with Sip4 and Adr1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] are transcriptional activators, whereas Mig1 (optionally with Mig2/3) is a transcriptional repressor that works in concert with Tup1-Cyc8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The Hap complex is comprised of proteins Hap2, 3, 4 and 5, and has separate subunits for DNA binding and transcriptional activation.

The expression of <italic>HAP4 </italic>is repressed by glucose and is responsible for regulation of Hap complex target genes. We began by scrutinising data for a <italic>HAP4 </italic>over-expression strain, in which 246 genes had their expression affected by at least a factor of 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], which is 5.3% of the genome. 56 of these genes were found in our dataset and are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. Only three of these (<italic>GLK1</italic>, <italic>CTR3 </italic>and <italic>ZRT1</italic>) are down-regulated in the <italic>HAP4 </italic>over-expression strain, whereas <italic>GLK1 </italic>and <italic>CTR3 </italic>are induced in the V5.TM6*P strain. Interestingly, a typical Hap complex binding site was not seen in the 500 nucleotide region upstream of the <italic>GLK1, CTR3 </italic>and <italic>ZRT1 </italic>start codon (where the first A in ATG is position 1) while all other genes in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> except <italic>AGX1</italic>, <italic>MNP1 </italic>and <italic>YNK1 </italic>were found to have at least one Hap complex binding site.

We noted that the genes of Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, contained motifs that could be sub-divided into 2 distinct families: <bold>CCAAT</bold>G (which we denoted as a Hap4_1 site) and (G/<bold>C)CAA</bold>(G/<bold>T</bold>)CAA (a Hap4_2 site). The bold sequences are the conserved sequences previously identified in the <italic>HAP4 </italic>over-expression strain study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The genes of Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> were then examined 500 nucleotides upstream and 200 nucleotides downstream from the start codon using WebMOTIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] for these two biologically-relevant sites since it has been previously demonstrated that Hap complex binding sites are statistically over-represented up to 400 nucleotides upstream from the start codon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]: we found that 112/146 (77%) induced genes and 127/190 (67%) of the complete dataset in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> had one or more Hap complex binding site (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Our analysis included presumed binding sites such as CAAATC and CCAAAC which arose from the biologically-verified data on transcription factors (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). For example, <italic>AQY2 </italic>is identified as Hap complex-dependent, and has two CCAAAC sites, but no CCAATNA sites. There are only two other genes that do not contain CCAATNA sites in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, namely <italic>CRC1 </italic>and <italic>ALD6</italic>. In addition it was notable that Hap complex consensus sequences are predominantly found upstream of mitochondrial genes with 84/127 (66%) of such genes having at least a partial mitochondrial location. Furthermore, of the induced genes with a known cellular location and at least two Hap complex binding sites, 69/80 (86%) are localized to the mitochondria. It appears, then, that Hap4 activation is preferentially directed at mitochondrially-related functions especially within the TCA-cycle and respiratory chain, but cytosolic support via the glyoxylate cycle is also potentially regulated by Hap4 activation (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). It was further noted that multiple Hap complex binding sites are associated with induction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). A Fisher's exact test showed that there was a statistically-significant association between the change in gene expression and the number of Hap complex binding sites in the gene (p = 0.00). This supported the fact that genes with two or more Hap complex binding sites are likely to be induced, whereas those with one site may be either induced or repressed.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>(A) The influence of multiple Hap complex sites on the change in gene expression of the genes in Additional file </bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.

For all other genes, the change in expression followed the same trend of up-regulation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). As for the Hap4 analysis, we examined these 20 genes for Cat8 binding sites, and identified a typical Cat8 motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] in 13 of them, nine being of the Cat8-Sip4 type, TCCATTSRTCCGR (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). The remaining six induced genes (<italic>CYB2</italic>, <italic>GUT1</italic>, <italic>GUT2</italic>, <italic>LSC2</italic>, <italic>SUE1 </italic>and <italic>ODC1</italic>) were further scrutinised, and it was apparent that all except <italic>ODC1 </italic>had been identified from immunoprecipitation data for Adr1 alone, consistent with their lack of Cat8-Sip4 motif. The induced genes of Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> were therefore searched from the start codon to 1,500 nucleotides upstream for the generic Cat8 motif, CC------CCG motif giving 54 genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). The non-coding intergenic regions of these genes were then searched using WebMOTIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and <italic>HXK1</italic>, <italic>COX4</italic>, <italic>ODC1</italic>, <italic>OM14</italic>, <italic>OM45 </italic>and <italic>YOR019w </italic>were found to share the consensus sequence GCCSSTSS(W/Y))CMS in common with <italic>IDP2 </italic>and are thus also listed in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>.

However, in the wild-type parent strain (V5) the transcriptome was found to vary with glucose availability according to a least squares fit of the logarithmic array values for RNA extracted at the six different glucose concentrations. This dependence on external glucose concentrations is seen in the V5 strain for 20 genes (including those without functional annotations) with an adjusted p-value &#x0003c; 0.05 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The genes with the strongest dependence on external glucose concentrations were found to be <italic>HXK1</italic>, <italic>RGS2</italic>, <italic>ADH7</italic>, <italic>CHA4 </italic>and <italic>GLK1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The sugar kinases <italic>HXK1 </italic>and <italic>GLK1 </italic>are induced as expected as they have their maximal expression during growth on other carbon sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

In a study by DeRisi and colleagues, batch yeast cultures were harvested for cDNA array analysis at gradually decreasing glucose concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Our examination of the supplementary data provided by the authors showed that as glucose was consumed between 18.7 and 7.5 g/L, three of the genes in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> (<italic>GLK1</italic>, <italic>HXK1</italic>, and <italic>FAL1</italic>) were found in the top 22 genes with a changed expression from that study. Overall, the results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> show that glucose repression is gradually relieved on going from 37 g/L to 9 g/L glucose. Furthermore relief of repression is already apparent at a surprisingly high glucose concentration, in contrast to the assumption that it is typically triggered over a range of low glucose concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], the trigger being very low for some genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Transcript dependence on external glucose concentration for 20 genes in the V5 strain</bold>.

Following this procedure, only a small subset of genes that are highly induced had their factor changes increased substantially, but this did not affect the fact that they remain within the top 30 most induced genes in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>. They are <italic>HXK1 </italic>(9.0 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, 19.3 following re-calculation; the gene contains binding sites for the Hap complex, Cat8 and Mig1); <italic>STL1 </italic>(21.7, 27.5; Hap complex, Cat8); <italic>DSF1 </italic>(9.4, 15.1; Hap complex, Mig1); <italic>CYB2 </italic>(10.1, 13.4; Hap complex, Mig1) and <italic>FBP1 </italic>(5.3, 7.4; Cat8, Mig1). Fourteen of the seventeen genes that were most affected by this recalculation were found to contain a Mig1 binding site. It is therefore possible that Mig1 is also involved in relieving glucose repression in the 10 to 5 g/L range, and not only at the depletion of glucose at the diauxic shift. Overall, we found that the amplitudes of the factor changes varied by only 9.3% in this new calculation compared with the original one, which indicated that the glucose dependence of the V5 strain does not have a major influence on the way we generated the data presented in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The main physiological change in both the diauxic shift and the transition from a respiro-fermentative to a respiratory metabolism is that glycolysis is channelled to support respiration: this occurs upon glucose depletion during the diauxic shift and throughout the growth curve in glucose medium in V5.TM6*P. Although previously-published genomic analyses of yeast's response to the diauxic shift transition have all been sampled under different conditions &#x02013; rich (YPD) medium with 2% glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], minimal defined medium in chemostat cultures at different dilution rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and minimal defined media in batch cultures sampled 4 h after the diauxic shift [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] &#x02013; common themes emerge with changes on going from V5 to V5.TM6*P. Overall 81% of genes which are induced or repressed on going from V5 to V5.TM6*P in our study were found in at least one of these three datasets for the diauxic shift. Furthermore, we also find that for all proteins induced in a study of the diauxic shift by 2D-gel electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the corresponding genes are induced on going from V5 to V5.TM6*P except for the alcohol dehydrogenase, Adh2. There is a hence close agreement between induction of the following genes and the levels of the corresponding proteins: <italic>FBP1</italic>, <italic>ICL1</italic>, <italic>PCK1</italic>, <italic>IDP2</italic>, <italic>MLS1</italic>, <italic>DLD1</italic>, <italic>ALD6</italic>, <italic>SDH1 </italic>and <italic>CIT2</italic>. This strong correlation with previously-published data and our own observed correlation of data for Cdc19 and <italic>CDC19 </italic>supports the phenotypic similarity between the V5 to V5.TM6*P transition and the diauxic shift. It is worth noting that there is no clear correlation of our data in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> with any possible differences in growth rate between the two strains. In a study by Regenberg and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], 180 genes changed in expression by more than a factor of 4 when comparing growth rates. Of these 180, 3% of all genes are found in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> providing no significant overlap in data.</p><p>It is also possible to see parallels between our data set and a study of nitrogen deprivation and stationary phase growth for wild-type yeast by Gasch and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This is supported by the fact that ten of the 15 genes that were found to be strongly induced upon nitrogen deprivation and growth in stationary phase in that study are also induced in the V5 to V5.TM6*P transition. Only two genes, <italic>YGR067c </italic>(likely to encode a transcription factor as it has high partial sequence homology with <italic>MIG3 </italic>and <italic>ADR1 </italic>and it fine-tunes the response to nutrient limitation) and <italic>ECM13</italic>, are not induced in the V5.TM6*P strain, but were highly induced in the Gasch study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] upon nitrogen deprivation and stationary phase growth. In addition, we find that the genes encoding Mep1 and Ato2, which are involved in ammonia transport are also strongly induced in V5.TM6*P in our study. Such an induction is seen in both the diauxic shift studies performed in defined media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], but not in rich medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], suggestive of nutrient limitation. In fact, V5.TM6*P also appears carbon limited, not least as a result of the fact that amongst the most strongly induced genes are <italic>FBP1 </italic>and <italic>PCK1</italic>, which encode gluconeogenic enzymes. <italic>STL1</italic>, <italic>MAL31 </italic>and <italic>SUC2 </italic>(encoding proteins involved in usage and/or transport of alternative carbon sources: glycerol, maltose and sucrose respectively) are induced in V5.TM6*P, also consistent with its low glycolytic flux and suggestive of an adaptation of metabolism ('discontinuous modelling) as seen by Brauer and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and supported by our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Several of these genes including <italic>FBP1 </italic>and <italic>STL1</italic>, as well as <italic>JEN1</italic>, <italic>ODC1, SFC1 </italic>and <italic>ATO2 </italic>have already been identified as being either induced under carbon limitation or being specific indicators of carbon limitation in yeast cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], consistent with our own data.</p><p>The analysis of transcription factor binding sites present in the genes of Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> revealed that 127 genes had Hap complex binding sites, the majority of which encode mitochondrial proteins. Of genes that only had Hap complex binding sites present, thirteen had only one and of these only five were induced leading us to hypothesise that multiple Hap complex binding sites are correlated with induction of the Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Interestingly, in a microarray screen of a <italic>hap1&#x00394; </italic>mutant for Hap1-dependent genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], 7/24 genes that were induced in the <italic>hap1&#x00394; </italic>mutant are also induced in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> (<italic>CYB2</italic>, <italic>MLS1</italic>, <italic>HMX1</italic>, <italic>PUT4</italic>, <italic>STL1</italic>, <italic>HPA2</italic>, <italic>PUT1</italic>), and in each case also have a Hap complex binding site. In addition, 19 genes containing a Cat8 site and 31 genes containing a Mig1 site were predicted, with many of these genes being experimentally-verified in previous <italic>in vivo </italic>studies. Our analysis of the regulation of 88% of the induced genes of our unique respiratory strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) is further supported by a novel computational method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] that predicts the Hap complex and Mig1 control the genes of Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>; Cat8 is not included in that database.</p><p>A quite unexpected result from comparing the transcriptional profiles of V5 with V5.TM6*P is the data set in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, showing genes from the parent strain that are clearly glucose dependent and that the glucose dependence observed begins at concentrations (6 &#x02013; 36 g/L glucose) higher than the range generally regarded as the glucose-repressed region. Strain DBY7286 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], which is unrelated to V5, previously showed a gradual relief of glucose repression starting at 20 g/L glucose for <italic>GLK1</italic>, <italic>HXK1 </italic>and <italic>FAL1</italic>. These results for V5 and DBY7286 suggest that gradual relief is a general <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>phenomenon. Future studies will show whether the gradient of the slope is different for different strains. That such glucose dependence requires an intact glucose uptake system is suggested by the fact that it is not seen in the V5.TM6*P strain: the array signal is not changed significantly for any of the genes in the V5.TM6*P strain at the different glucose concentrations sampled. This implies that in V5.TM6*P, glucose sensing is independent of external glucose concentration. The wild-type yeast, on the other hand, shows an extensive modulation of its expression profile at high glucose concentrations despite the fact that its physiological response is largely unaffected. The insensitivity of the V5.TM6*P strain therefore makes it an extremely valuable biotechnological tool as it can be cultured in a wide range of external glucose concentrations, whilst maintaining the same respiratory phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we have been able to characterize the transcriptome of a unique respiratory yeast strain. We have been able to identify highly complete collections of known genes in the TCA cycle, glyoxylate cycle and respiratory chain that are consistent with a respiratory metabolism. Our results suggest that there has been genetic remodelling predominantly through the activity of Hap4, Cat8 and Mig1, and that the gene expression profile of V5.TM6*P during growth on glucose resembles wild-type <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>cells in the diauxic shift.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains</title><p>The auxotrophic wine yeast strain V5 (<italic>MAT</italic>a <italic>ura3 gal</italic>) and the V5 <italic>hxt1&#x02013;hxt7</italic>&#x00394; mutant strain (<italic>MAT</italic>a <italic>ura3 gal hxt514</italic>&#x00394;::loxP <italic>hxt367</italic>&#x00394;::lox P <italic>hxt2</italic>&#x00394;::loxP) were kindly provided by the Professor Bruno Blondin, Montpellier, France. The construction of V5.TM6*P was previously described by Henricsson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] where the expression cassette from KOY.TM6*P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] was transferred into the genome of the V5 <italic>hxt1&#x02013;hxt7</italic>&#x00394; strain by using the primers PROHXT3 (TCAAATGGCGGTGTAGTTTGAAAAG) and TERHXT7 (TTAAGTGACGGGCGATGAGTAAGAA).

A two-step pre-cultivation was performed on a rotary shaker. First a 10 mL culture was grown for 72 h, and used to inoculate 100 mL medium, which after 30 h at 30&#x000b0;C was inoculated to give a final OD<sub>610 </sub>of 0.05 in a bioreactor (BRO2, Belach Bioteknik AB, Sweden) in a volume of 2.5 L. Polypropylene glycol P2000 was added as antifoam (100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L/L). The cultivation conditions were 30&#x000b0;C, 1,000 rpm, pH 5.0 with an airflow of 1.25 L/min.

After converting to a logarithmic scale, average expression values were computed over spots with the same ORF, and arrays were scale normalized by subtracting the median for each of the 24 arrays. Averages were computed over repeated measurements with the same conditions producing 6 values at different glucose concentrations for each of the V5 (38.4, 35, 25.5, 24.4, 10.5, 7.4 g/L glucose) and V5.TM6*P (36.5, 34.8, 26.3, 25.1, 13.5, 5.6 g/L glucose) strains for each gene. T-tests were then performed, comparing the two strains, using Empirical Bayes robustification of variance estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The T-tests were adjusted for multiple testing using the false discovery rate method (disregarding correlations between genes).

Empirical Bayes robustification and adjustment for multiple testing was included even in this analysis, using the limma tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].
