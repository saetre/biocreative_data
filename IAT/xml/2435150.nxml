The IEP binds to the intron in unspliced precursor RNA, promotes its splicing by stabilizing the catalytically active RNA structure, and remains tightly bound to the excised intron lariat RNA in a ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) that promotes intron mobility. Mobility occurs by a remarkable mechanism in which the intron RNA inserts (reverse splices) directly into a DNA strand and is reverse-transcribed by the IEP, with the primer being either the opposite DNA strand cleaved by the IEP or a nascent strand at a DNA replication fork (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;). By using this reverse splicing mechanism, mobile group II introns insert at high frequency into specific DNA target sites (&#x0201c;retrohoming&#x0201d;) and at low frequency into ectopic sites that resemble the normal homing site (&#x0201c;retrotransposition&#x0201d;) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;.

(EBS and IBS denote exon- and intron-binding site, respectively.)

Further, in a high proportion of the doubly fluorescent cells, the poly(P) and GFP/LtrA fluorescence were either overlapping (94.7&#x00025; and 87.9&#x00025; in the <italic>gppA</italic> and <italic>ppx</italic> disruptants, respectively) or completely colocalized (78.4&#x00025; and 45.5&#x00025; in the <italic>gppA</italic> and <italic>ppx</italic> disruptants, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). This degree of colocalization supports the hypothesis that the altered GFP/LtrA localization is due to the binding of the basic LtrA protein to the negatively charged poly(P). Those cells in which both poly(P) and GFP/LtrA are dispersed but not completely colocalized could reflect that poly(P) associated with LtrA dissociates or is degraded after the protein is dispersed, that some poly(P) bound to LtrA is less than the concentration limit required for fluorescence detection with DAPI, or that the GFP tag is clipped, rendering some proportion of LtrA nonfluorescent.</p><p>After the above findings, we also re-examined the wild-type strain, where 2.8&#x00025; of the cells showed diffuse GFP/LtrA localization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060150-t001">Table 1</xref>, top). Strikingly, even in wild type, where only a small proportion of cells is affected, diffuse GFP/LtrA localization was correlated again with the accumulation and dispersal of poly(P) (88&#x00025; of wild-type cells with diffuse GFP/LtrA showed dispersed poly(P), and 83&#x00025; with dispersed poly(P) showed diffuse GFP/LtrA). The accumulation of poly(P) in a small proportion of wild-type cells is likely due to cell stress, which triggers poly(P) synthesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Collectively, these findings suggest that the more diffuse intracellular localization of GFP/LtrA results from the accumulation of poly(P), which binds to LtrA and delocalizes it away from the cell poles.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>All the Other Disruptants with Diffuse GFP/LtrA Localization Also Accumulate Poly(P)</title><p>The remaining four disruptants (<italic>uhpT</italic>, <italic>wcaK</italic>, <italic>ynbC</italic>, and <italic>zntR</italic>) with more diffuse GFP/LtrA localization do not involve genes that are known to function in poly(P) metabolism. However, the above findings raised the possibility that they might also accumulate poly(P) as a result of cell stress caused by the disruptions. Fluorescence microscopy of DAPI-stained cells revealed that this is in fact the case, with all four of the above disruptants in the HMS174(DE3) genetic background showing an increased proportion of cells with higher and more dispersed poly(P) fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). By contrast, strains having deletions of the same four genes (<italic>uhpT&#x0002a;</italic>, <italic>wcaK&#x0002a;</italic>, <italic>ynbC&#x0002a;</italic>, and <italic>zntR&#x0002a;</italic>) in the Keio genetic background did not accumulate poly(P) and correspondingly did not exhibit altered GFP/LtrA localization patterns (unpublished data). The likely explanation is that their different genetic background makes the Keio strains less prone to cell stress caused by these mutations and/or less prone to accumulate poly(P) in response to cell stress than in the HMS174(DE3) background. In comparison to the <italic>ppx</italic> disruption in the HMS174(DE3) background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g006">Figure 6</xref>), the <italic>ppx</italic>&#x0002a; deletion in the Keio genetic background also showed less detectable poly(P) accumulation (1.0&#x00025; P, 6.0&#x00025; D, 93.0&#x00025; N) and correspondingly had a more muted effect on GFP/LtrA localization (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060150-t001">Table 1</xref>, bottom).

All of the above disruptants show both an increased proportion of cells with more diffuse GFP/LtrA localization and a more uniform genomic distribution of Ll.LtrB-insertion sites, which in the wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> strain are strongly clustered in the <italic>oriC</italic> region. These findings indicate that the intracellular localization of LtrA is a major determinant of Ll.LtrB-insertion-site preference, to our knowledge the first such demonstration for any mobile genetic element. Further analysis showed that the common factor leading to more diffuse GFP/LtrA localization in these and other disruptants is the accumulation of intracellular poly(P) and that disruptants that accumulate poly(P) also show altered intracellular distributions of other basic proteins that are normally pole-localized (CYT-18 and XapR). The latter findings suggest that poly(P) accumulation may be part of a cellular mechanism that leads to relocalization of basic proteins in response to cell stress or entry into stationary phase. From a technical standpoint, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using bacterial cellular arrays for high-throughput screens to identify mutations affecting protein localization or morphology, and they suggest a method for obtaining more uniform group II intron-gene disruption libraries by using mutants that accumulate poly(P).</p><p>The polar localization of LtrA in wild-type cells may facilitate group II intron mobility by increasing access of group II intron RNPs to exposed DNA segments in the <italic>oriC</italic> and <italic>ter</italic> regions of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> chromosome.

Such coordination may be particularly important for group II introns, which can use nascent strands at DNA replication forks to prime reverse transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.

The selection for polar localization may have originated with ancestral group II introns whose IEPs lacked DNA cleavage activity and relied entirely on nascent DNA strands as primers.</p><p>In addition to changing the intracellular localization of LtrA, poly(P) also potentially could affect the genomic distribution of Ll.LtrB-insertion sites by binding basic nucleoid-associated proteins, leading to nucleoid decondensation, as observed in a <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa ppk1</italic> mutant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, Beauregard et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; found that neither LtrA localization nor the distribution of Ll.LtrB-insertion sites is affected significantly by mutations in the nucleotide-associated proteins H-NS, StpA, or MukB, which lead to nucleoid decondensation in different ways. These findings indicate that nucleoid decondensation does not by itself lead to a more uniform distribution of Ll.LtrB-insertion sites as long as LtrA remains pole-localized. It is possible, however, that nucleotide decondensation contributes to the more uniform distribution of insertion sites that we observe when LtrA has been delocalized by poly(P).</p><p>Our results suggest that negatively charged poly(P) delocalizes LtrA and other basic proteins by binding to them directly. A direct binding mechanism is supported by: (i) the colocalization of GFP/LtrA and poly(P) in high proportions of <italic>gppA</italic> and <italic>ppx</italic> disruptant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g006">Figure 6</xref>C); (ii) the finding that poly(P) accumulation affects the polar localization of three basic proteins (LtrA, CYT-18, and XapR) but not the polar localization of the acidic protein IcsA<sub>507&#x02013;620</sub>/GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g008">Figure 8</xref>); and (iii) biochemical experiments showing that poly(P) can bind LtrA to inhibit its RT activity and cause it to migrate toward the opposite pole in a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The binding of poly(P) to LtrA and other basic proteins is presumably nonspecific, but we cannot at this stage exclude a more specific binding component in some cases. In the cell, poly(P) may bind to LtrA and other basic proteins at the poles and relocalize them as it moves through the cell, and/or it may bind to the nascent proteins in other regions, preventing them from becoming pole-localized. The poly(P) that colocalizes with LtrA could be present in specific complexes, akin to volutin granules, which may be passively or actively localized or delocalized.</p><p>In addition to affecting the intracellular localization of LtrA, the binding of poly(P) may directly affect LtrA's biochemical activities in RNA splicing and intron mobility. Precedents for such effects include the findings that poly(P) activates Lon protease degradation of ribosomal proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, may play a role in activating mammalian TOR kinase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, and is required for the lytic growth of phages P1 and fd &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. Our finding that poly(P) inhibits LtrA's RT activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g007">Figure 7</xref>B) may explain why the <italic>ppk</italic> mutant, which has decreased levels of poly(P), shows increased Ll.LtrB mobility frequencies in a chromosomal <italic>lacZ</italic> gene integration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). However, we also find that Ll.LtrB mobility frequencies are increased moderately in <italic>gppA</italic>, <italic>ppx</italic>, and other mutants that accumulate poly(P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g003">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g005">5</xref>B). The latter findings indicate that inhibition of LtrA's RT activity by poly(P) in vivo must be either mild or transient, perhaps due to dissociation or degradation of the bound poly(P) after the protein has been delocalized. A factor that may contribute to the moderately increased Ll.LtrB mobility frequencies in mutants that accumulate poly(P) is that their more uniform intracellular distribution of LtrA makes it easier to target the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene, which is located outside the <italic>oriC</italic> or <italic>ter</italic> chromosomal regions.</p><p>The disruptants that we identified with altered GFP/LtrA localization patterns accumulate poly(P) for different reasons.

All of disruptants, including the <italic>gppA</italic> and <italic>ppx</italic> disruptants, have heterogeneous cellular phenotypes, with an increased proportion of cells showing both poly(P) accumulation and altered GFP/LtrA localization, and the remainder having wild-type localization patterns. This heterogeneity may reflect that only some cells in the population are under sufficient stress to trigger poly(P) accumulation. The wild-type strain shows similar heterogeneity but with only a small proportion of cells showing poly(P) accumulation and altered GFP/LtrA localization. Thus, the disruptions appear to increase the normal propensity for stress-induced poly(P) accumulation, either by increasing the degree of stress or by decreasing the degradation rate of poly(P), making it easier to achieve elevated poly(P) concentrations. We note that the <italic>gppA</italic> disruption causes a more extreme accumulation and dispersal of poly(P) than does the <italic>ppx</italic> disruptant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060150-g006">Figure 6</xref>), possibly reflecting that the <italic>gppA</italic> disruptant not only lacks GPPA, which contributes to poly(P) degradation, but also accumulates pppGpp, which inhibits the remaining exopolyphosphatase PPX &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Like a previous screen for <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> localization factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, our cell array screen did not identify a pole-localized receptor protein whose absence leads to diffuse LtrA localization. It is possible that a specific polar receptor for LtrA does not exist and that LtrA is localized to the poles by default because it is not actively localized elsewhere. Alternatively, the receptor may require essential proteins or be redundant or nonspecific (e.g., acidic phospholipids &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;). Additionally, the intriguing finding that in wild-type <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> poly(P) detected by DAPI staining is found frequently in discrete foci at the poles raises the possibility that poly(P) itself contributes as a receptor for the polar localization of basic proteins under nonstress conditions.

One can imagine that reservoirs of certain enzymes, such as transcription factors or DNA repair enzymes, accumulate at the cellular poles and are mobilized to new sites of action by poly(P) during entry into stationary phase or under stress conditions, as shown here for LtrA. Such relocalization may be particularly advantageous when the cell's biosynthetic capacity is impaired as it is faster and more economical than synthesizing a specific receptor and transport system for each protein. Protein relocalization by binding to poly(P) may have wide physiological consequences, not only in prokaryotes but also in eukaryotes, where poly(P) also exists but has remained enigmatic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions.</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> HMS174(DE3) (F<sup>&#x02013;</sup><italic>recA hsdR rif<sup>R</sup></italic>) (Novagen) was used for LtrA localization and Ll.LtrB intron-integration assays; DH5&#x003b1; was used for cloning; and S17&#x02013;1&#x003bb;<italic>pir</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060150-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d; (obtained from Ram Narayanaswamy and Andy Ellington, University of Texas at Austin) was used for <italic>mariner</italic> transposon mutagenesis.
