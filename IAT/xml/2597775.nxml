In keeping with its role as a pivotal upstream regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway, experimentally-induced deletion of <italic>Pten</italic> in the murine prostate invariably results in neoplasia. However, and unlike humans where prostate tumorigenesis likely evolves over decades, disease progression in the constitutively <italic>Pten</italic> deficient mouse prostate is relatively rapid, culminating in invasive cancer within several weeks post-puberty. Given that the prostate undergoes rapid androgen-dependent growth at puberty, and that <italic>Pten</italic> excisions during this time might be especially tumorigenic, we hypothesized that delaying prostate-specific <italic>Pten</italic> deletions until immediately after puberty might alter the pace of tumorigenesis. To this end we generated mice with a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase transgene enabling temporal control over prostate-specific gene alterations. This line was then interbred with mice carrying floxed <italic>Pten</italic> alleles. Despite evidence of increased Akt/mTOR/S6K axis activity at early time points in <italic>Pten</italic>-deficient epithelial cells, excisions induced in the post-pubertal (6 wk-old) prostate yielded gradual acquisition of a range of lesions. These progressed from pre-malignant changes (nuclear atypia, focal hyperplasia) and low grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) at 16&#x02013;20 wks post-tamoxifen exposure, to overtly malignant lesions by &#x0223c;1 yr of age, characterized by high-grade PIN and microinvasive carcinoma. In contrast, when <italic>Pten</italic> excisions were triggered in the pre-pubertal (2 week-old) prostate, neoplasia evolved over a more abbreviated time-frame, with a spectrum of premalignant lesions, as well as overt PIN and microinvasive carcinoma by 10&#x02013;12 wks post-tamoxifen exposure. These results indicate that the developmental stage at which <italic>Pten</italic> deletions are induced dictates the pace of PIN development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetic alterations in a variety of different oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been associated with human prostate tumorigenesis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Tomlins1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Hughes1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>). Of these, mutations involving the <italic>PTEN</italic> (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) tumor suppressor are amongst the most commonly encountered, with loss of function mutations being reported in &#x0223c;30&#x00025; of primary cancers, and in more than 60&#x00025; of metastases (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Tomlins2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>). Echoing these findings, deletion of <italic>Pten</italic> in the developing murine prostate leads to early onset and rapidly progressive neoplasia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Wang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Majumder1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. PTEN's importance lies primarily in its ability to regulate the levels of membrane PI(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3) generated by the actions of phosphatidylinositol 3&#x02032;-kinase (PI3K) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Hawkins1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>). PTEN dephosphorylates PIP3, yielding PI(4,5)P2, thus PI3K activity (for example, in response to receptor protein tyrosine kinase activation) in Pten-deficient cells results in higher and more sustained levels of PIP3. PIP3-dependent pathways, in turn, regulate various cellular processes, including, rate of protein translation, susceptibility to apoptosis and anoikis, entry into the cell cycle, differentiation, and motility (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Hawkins1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>). Key effectors lying downstream of PIP3 that promote tumorigenesis include such molecules as PDK1, Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), and the two mammalian target of rapamycin-containing complexes, mTOR1 and mTOR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Vanhaesebroeck1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Chow1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in particular often plays a fundamental role in supporting cancer cell metabolism, growth, and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Faivre1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The ability to manipulate the mouse genome has allowed the evaluation of genetic alterations potentially involved in human prostate tumorigenesis, as well as the identification and preclinical validation of molecular targets for potential pharmacological intervention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Carver1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of <italic>PTEN</italic>, loss of the cognate gene in the murine prostate has been shown to trigger rapid onset of disease, with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and invasive adenocarcinomas ensuing within a few weeks of puberty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Wang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Kasper1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Wu1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Kasper2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>). Even taking into account the relatively short lifespan of mice, such a rapid evolution of disease is not reflective of disease progression in humans, that likely takes place over decades as a consequence of an accumulation of genetic changes and where intraepithelial lesions tend only to be observed beyond middle age. Indeed, most cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed in men over the age of 65 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Jemal1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus far there has been a paucity of mouse models of prostate cancer able to clearly delineate the various pathological grades seen in the human disease, from the earliest premalignant changes to overt invasive carcinoma and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-AbateShen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>There has been a need for mouse models that better mimic the slow progression to cancer typical of human prostate tumorigenesis. One of the steps towards attaining this goal has been the development of inducible systems that allow genetic alterations to be confined to the prostatic epithelium of the mature gland, the target tissue involved in the acquisition of genetic alterations over the span of a human lifetime. To this end, we generated a murine line, ARR2PB-CreER(T2), expressing a 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (OHT)-inducible Cre recombinase, Cre-ER(T2), under the control of the ARR2-rat probasin composite promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Luchman1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. This novel system allows temporal control over the timing of gene deletions in the prostatic epithelium.</p><p>Since the prostate epithelium undergoes rapid growth at puberty, we hypothesized that this might account for the rapid progression of disease in mice expressing constitutive Cre-triggered deletions of <italic>Pten</italic>. Supporting this idea, we found that OHT-induced Cre-mediated <italic>Pten</italic> excisions in the gland after puberty led to the very gradual development of a range of premalignant lesions. Over the course of a year these mice went on to develop high-grade PIN lesions as well as invasive carcinoma. The delayed latencies occurred despite evidence of prominent activation of the pro-tumorigenic Akt/mTOR/S6K pathway at all stages of the disease. In support of the hypothesis that the timing of <italic>Pten</italic> loss is an important variable in mouse prostate tumorigenesis, <italic>Pten</italic> excisions triggered in the pre-pubertal prostate accelerated the progression to PIN and microinvasive carcinoma.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Prostate histopathology in OHT-treated <italic>ARR2PBCreER(T2)&#x000d7;Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice</title><p>As <italic>Pten</italic> gene deletions in the prostate have been shown to lead to rapid onset of tumorigenesis, we investigated the effects of delaying <italic>Pten</italic> excisions until after the gland had developed.

However, owing to the lack of cell-type specific deletion in the latter, it has been difficult to attribute the resulting phenotypes solely to a defect within the prostatic epithelium.

In such models, however, tumor progression often occurs at an accelerated pace with progression to adenocarcinomas and invasive carcinomas being evident within a few weeks after puberty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Wang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Kasper1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Wu1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

As such, this appears to be one of the few murine models that replicates the spectrum of grades and stages observed in human prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Kasper2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the age at which invasive tumors are observed in this model would correspond to early adulthood in humans and do not accurately reflect the more protracted developmental time-course of prostate cancer in humans.</p><p>Conditional mutagenesis systems permitting external control over the timing of genetic alterations are attractive as they allow phenotypic analyses of mutations in the context of the mature, or even aged, prostate gland. The inducible transgenic mouse model we previously developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Luchman1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> has allowed us to induce prostate luminal epithelial cell-specific gene excisions in a temporally controlled manner. This is a valuable feature given that genetic and epigenetic alterations accumulated by the mature gland likely play a role in driving progression of prostate cancer in humans. Indeed, we found that <italic>Pten</italic> excisions in prostates of 6 wk-old <italic>ARR2PBCreER(T2)&#x000d7;Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> resulted in a very gradual progression to PIN and invasive carcinoma. Our findings are in agreement with the recently published results of Ratnacaram et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Ratnacaram1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> who showed that the CreER(T2) expressed under the control of the PSA (prostate specific antigen) promoter yielded a similarly slowed pace of disease progression when crossed onto the <italic>Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> background. In our experiments, where we used 10&#x02013;fold less OHT (0.1 mg per day) than Ratnacaram et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Ratnacaram1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> (1 mg per day), to activate CreER(T2) over a one-week period, we obtained a very similar pattern of disease progression stemming from <italic>Pten</italic> deletion in the adult animals. These two sets of results, using two different prostate-specific promoter transgene systems to drive CreER(T2) recombinase expression, support the idea that the developmental stage at which <italic>Pten</italic> is excised can affect the pace of prostate tumorigenesis.</p><p>We have shown that <italic>Pten</italic> deletions, in the mature prostate leads to a wide range of pre-malignant lesions, and as illustrated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003940-g001">Figure 1</xref>, even very early lesions could be resolved. We also obtained immunohistochemical evidence of cell signaling aberrations, consistent with the loss of Pten, and these were discernable early on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003940-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) within isolated populations of epithelial cells. For example, Pten loss was accompanied by increased pS6 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003940-g003">Figure 3B</xref>(iv&#x02013;vi)) even prior to any morphological signs of atypia. Thus, although loss of the Pten tumor suppressor and increased PI3K pathway signaling is a key initiating factor in tumorigenesis, it appears that additional cytogenetic or epigenetic events must occur prior to the development of the PIN lesions as observed at later stages in our mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003940-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, we did not observe progression past high grade PIN lesions until mice had been aged for almost a year post-OHT administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003940-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The nature of the acquired genetic events required to promote tumor progression in our model remain to be elucidated. The application of new genomics and proteomics techniques to our model, with its gradual stepwise development of pathological lesions, could be useful in identifying sequences of alterations of potential relevance to human prostate cancer, and in particular, cancers featuring the loss of PTEN.</p><p>In contrast to the results obtained when <italic>Pten</italic> deletion was triggered by OHT in mice at 6 wks of age, <italic>Pten</italic> excisions induced immediately prior to the onset of puberty led to more rapid pace of disease progression, with PIN lesions already being present at 4&#x02013;6 wks post-OHT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003940-g005">Figure 5</xref>), and high grade PIN lesions and microinvasive carcinoma developing at 10&#x02013;12 wks post-OHT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003940-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This result was striking given that progression past PIN was only seen at 42&#x02013;52 wks post-OHT when <italic>Pten</italic> excisions were triggered at 6 wks of age. For the purposes of comparison, we also established the constitutive <italic>PBCre4&#x000d7;Pten<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> model that progresses rapidly from PIN to adenocarcinoma and metastases. In our colony, disease progression in these mice was modestly delayed (by a few weeks) as compared to what was reported by Wang et al, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Wang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>(<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003940-t003">Table 3</xref>), the <italic>PBCre4&#x000d7;Pten<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice developed invasive carcinomas and adenocarcinomas at a time when the <italic>ARR2PBCreER(T2)&#x000d7;Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice treated with OHT at 2 wks of age, were starting to develop microinvasive carcinomas.

Growth factors and other signals that are able to drive the PI3K pathway may differ between the juvenile and adult glands. For example, fibroblast growth factor 10 expression is prominent in the mesenchyme surrounding the developing prostate but is then switched off once the gland matures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Thomson1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, and suggesting a mechanism whereby Pten deletion in the developing gland might be especially tumorigenic, it was recently shown using an <italic>in vivo</italic> epithelial-stromal reconstitution system that enhanced mesenchymal expression of FGF10 led to the formation of multifocal PIN lesions in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Memarzadeh1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, the loss of <italic>Pten</italic> just prior to puberty, a time when epithelial proliferation is much more prominent that in the mature gland, could mean that more cells are placed at risk of transformation as a result of the chromosomal instability that has been proposed to accompany loss of Pten expression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Salmena1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>While <italic>Pten</italic> excision obviously initiates the progression from hyperplasia to PIN in our mice, lack of Pten by itself, especially in the mature prostate, was not sufficient to generate the more advanced lesions typical of the constitutively active Cre models of <italic>Pten</italic> excision. While this might reflect excision frequencies within the gland, it could also be due to an intrinsic difference between the developing versus the mature gland that determines how the cells respond to <italic>Pten</italic> loss. For example, it has been suggested that of the lack of PTEN can be detrimental to tumour growth in the absence of other mutations (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Salmena1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>), and complete loss of this tumour suppressor can promote a senescence response that opposes tumour progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Chen1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. It was found that while <italic>Trp53</italic> inactivation in the mouse prostate failed to produce neoplasia, and <italic>Pten</italic> inactivation produced non-lethal invasive prostate cancer after a long latency, the combined inactivation of <italic>Trp53</italic> and <italic>Pten</italic> in the prostate elicited invasive prostate cancer in mice as young as two weeks of age. In this case, <italic>Pten</italic> inactivation was found to trigger growth arrest through a p53-dependent cellular senescence response that was &#x02018;rescued&#x02019; by the combined loss of <italic>Pten</italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Chen1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. It was also shown that <italic>Pten</italic> inactivation in the prostate correlated with an increased proliferation rate of the epithelial cells, but not with a reduced level of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Ma1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggested that while <italic>Pten</italic> inactivation promotes tumorigenesis there are also mechanisms at play which may push the Pten-deficient cells towards apoptosis. Although we found evidence of increased apoptosis within our experimental animals treated either at 2 wks or 6 wks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003940-g006">Figure 6</xref>), mice injected at 2 wks still progressed to PINs and microinvasive cancer more rapidly suggesting that the delayed latencies seen following <italic>Pten</italic> excision at 6 wks of age might have been a consequence of tumorigenic changes being targeted to a residual population of cells that had evaded the Pten loss-induced senescence response. Lastly, it is possible that the prostate progenitors responsible for the rapid pubertal growth of the gland are less susceptible to the senescence-promoting effect of Pten deficiency.</p><p>Using the <italic>PBCre4&#x000d7;Pten<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> model, Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Wang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> showed that, <italic>Pten</italic> loss can lead to increased stem/progenitor cell proliferation, which in turn may be associated with prostate tumor initiation and progression. However, the authors did not rule out the possibility that Pten loss might also be able to promote the transformation of cells with limited replicative capacity, providing them with self-renewal potential. In our model, <italic>Pten</italic> deletion in the mature glad did not result in early invasive adenocarcinomas and metastases, suggesting that loss of Pten within a differentiating population with low proliferative potential might only have a limited ability to augment residual proliferative capacity. In the adult prostate the number of self-renewing cells would be smaller than in the developing prostate, and this could be a factor in the slower pace of tumor progression seen in our model. Wang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Wang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> proposed that <italic>Pten</italic> loss may either increase the pool of stem and early progenitor cells, or that it might be a transforming event in non-actively dividing cells, leading them to acquire self-renewing proliferative potential. Since we did not observe rapid progression to invasive carcinoma and have not as yet seen metastases, it is possible that in our model <italic>Pten</italic> deletions are confined to cells with more limited self-renewal capacity. This observation was reinforced by the results of inducing <italic>Pten</italic> excisions in the developing prostate. While the progression through the various disease stages is not as rapid as that seen in the <italic>PBCre4&#x000d7;Pten<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice, we did see an accelerated phenotype as compared to that observed when <italic>Pten</italic> was excised in the fully developed prostate. In summary, our results suggest that the tumor promoting effects of <italic>Pten</italic> deficiency are highly dependent on the developmental stage of the prostate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Genotyping</title><p><italic>ARR2PB-CreER(T2)</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Luchman1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> were genotyped using the following primers to verify for germline transmission: HPRT-FP: cct tac ctt tca gaa gta ggc and CreER(T2)2: atc aac gtt ttc ttt tcg g. <italic>Pten<sup>flox/flox(fl/fl)</sup></italic> mice were genotyped with Pten Flox-1: ctc ctc tac tcc att ctt ccc and Pten Flox-2: act ccc acc aat gaa caa ac.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>In vivo experiments</title><p>Animals (mixed 129;C57BL/6 background) were injected with OHT at 6 wks of age, a time when stereological evaluation reveals the prostate to be fully developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Singh1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and at 2 wks of age, a time when prostate development is just commencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003940-Singh1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>ARR2PBCreER(T2)&#x000d7;Pten<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice and control mice lacking the Cre transgene were injected i.p. with 0.1 mg OHT in corn oil vehicle for five consecutive days and then allowed to age for the following periods: 4&#x02013;10, 16&#x02013;20, 30&#x02013;40, and 42&#x02013;52 wks for the mice injected at 6 wks of age; and for 4&#x02013;6 and 10&#x02013;12 wks post-injection (p.i.) for mice injected with OHT at 2 wks of age.
