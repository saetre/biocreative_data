Transcriptional regulation by PcG proteins is achieved, at least partly, through the PRC2-mediated methylation on lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) and PRC1-mediated ubiquitylation on lysine 119 of histone H2A (uH2A). As an integral component of PRC1, Bmi1 has been demonstrated to be critical for H2A ubiquitylation. Although recent studies have revealed the genome-wide binding patterns of some of the PRC1 and PRC2 components, as well as the H3K27me3 mark, there have been no reports describing genome-wide localization of uH2A. Using the recently developed ChIP-Seq technology, here, we report genome-wide localization of the Bmi1-dependent uH2A mark in MEF cells. Gene promoter averaging analysis indicates a peak of uH2A just inside the transcription start site (TSS) of well-annotated genes. This peak is enriched at promoters containing the H3K27me3 mark and represents the least expressed genes in WT MEF cells. In addition, peak finding reveals regions of local uH2A enrichment throughout the mouse genome, including almost 700 gene promoters. Genes with promoter peaks of uH2A exhibit lower-level expression when compared to genes that do not contain promoter peaks of uH2A. Moreover, we demonstrate that genes with uH2A peaks have increased expression upon Bmi1 knockout. Importantly, local enrichment of uH2A is not limited to regions containing the H3K27me3 mark. We describe the enrichment of H2A ubiquitylation at high-density CpG promoters and provide evidence to suggest that DNA methylation may be linked to uH2A at these regions. Thus, our work not only reveals Bmi1-dependent H2A ubiquitylation, but also suggests that uH2A targeting in differentiated cells may employ a different mechanism from that in ES cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>A wealth of recent studies has demonstrated the role of Bmi1-stimulated histone ubiquitylation in the repression of transcription at targeted genetic loci. However, the repressive function of this mark has never been extrapolated genome-wide. We have used deep sequencing technology to explore the global deposition of Bmi1-dependent H2A ubiquitylation (uH2A) in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Our study confirms the gene-specific repressive function of the uH2A mark on a genome-wide scale. In addition, we also analyzed the general trends of uH2A distribution with respect to genomic elements, such as various classes of gene promoters and transcribed regions. Our work implies that the mechanism of uH2A distribution in differentiated cells may vary from that in embryonic stem cells. Given the importance of the uH2A modification in fundamental biological processes and cancer, insight into the distribution of this modification has reaching implications in understanding the contribution of epigenetic silencing to cellular physiology.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In higher eukaryotes, DNA is organized in the form of chromatin. The basic repeating unit of chromatin is called the nucleosome, which consists of 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a core histone octamer. One unique feature of core histones is their proclivity for covalent modification including acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, and phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Jenuwein1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, DNA can be modified directly through methylation. These covalent modifications can affect gene transcription directly or indirectly through the recruitment of additional modulatory factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Martin1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, different combinations of modifications on chromatin may ultimately determine distinct cellular states through regulating the transcriptional programs that cells adopt. Thus, identification and characterization of the proteins that are responsible for the placement and maintenance of these epigenetic marks is of great importance in understanding cellular proliferation and differentiation.</p><p>The addition of a single ubiquitin molecule to histone H2A at lysine 119 was first discovered over thirty years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Olson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Classic experiments demonstrated that uH2A accounts for about 10&#x00025; of total H2A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Levinger1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the knowledge of its existence, the identity of the responsible enzymes and the function of this modification have only recently begun to be elucidated. The first H2A ubiquitin E3 ligase was identified as the core components of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) composed of RING1/2, BMI1, and HPH2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Wang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Biochemical and functional analysis of the PRC1 complex has revealed RING2/Ring1b as the catalytic subunit, which can be greatly stimulated by Bmi1 and Ring1a, as loss function on any of these two proteins resulted in drastic genome-wide reduction of uH2A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Buchwald1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Cao1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Genome-wide location studies revealed that PRC1 occupies the promoters of a subset of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) targets and both PRC1 and PRC2 are enriched at genes involved in developmental processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Boyer1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Lee1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent studies have uncovered that Bmi1 homologs, such as Mel18 and NSPc1, can target the PRC1 complex in various cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Elderkin1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Wu1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, a new E3 ligase for H2A, 2A-HUB, has also been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Zhou1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> highlighting the fact that there must be Bmi1-dependent and Bmi1-independent pools of uH2A in the genome.</p><p>Unlike PRC1, PRC2 possesses H3K27-specific histone methyltransferase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Cao2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The discovery that a component of PRC1, Pc, can specifically recognize and bind to H3K27me3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Cao3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Min1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> has prompted researchers to embrace a sequential recruitment model whereby PRC2-mediated H3K27 methylation contributes to PRC1 recruitment and subsequent ubiquitylation of histone H2A. This model is supported by three pieces of evidence. First, studies on Hox and <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic> loci indicate that PRC1 knockdown reduced local uH2A levels which correlate with upregulation of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Cao1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Jacobs1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Kotake1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, knockdown of the H3K27me3 demethylase, Utx, results in enrichment of both PRC1 and uH2A at PRC2 target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Lee2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Third, the majority of genome-wide Ring1b enriched regions in mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) co-localize with peaks of H3K27me3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Ku1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition to the relationship between H3K27 methylation and H2A ubiquitylation, several studies also suggest a potential link between H3K27 methylation and DNA methylation. For example, H3K27 methylation has been demonstrated to play an important role in imprinted gene silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Lewis1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Umlauf1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Components of PRC2, such as Ezh2, have been reported to interact with Dnmt1/3a/3b and are required for efficient DNA methylation at several target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Vire1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, Dnmt1 may contribute to the recruitment of PRC1 as knockdown of Dnmt1 abrogates localization of PRC1 components to Polycomb bodies in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-HernandezMunoz1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with this notion, recent studies have demonstrated that components of PRC1 can interact with a methyl-DNA binding protein, Mbd1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Sakamoto1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, and the Dnmt1-associated protein, Dmap1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Negishi1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite these reports, a general correlation between H3K27 methylation and DNA methylation may not exist as genome-wide epigenetic profiling revealed only a small subset of H3K27me3 positive promoters were found to be hypermethylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Fouse1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Kondo1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether there exists a genome-wide link between PRC1 mediated H2A ubiquitylation and DNA methylation remains to be determined.</p><p>The advent of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to genomic tiling arrays (ChIP-chip) has provided scores of reports highlighting genome-wide maps of histone modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Barrera1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, histone modifying enzyme binding profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Bracken1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, and transcription modulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Kim1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Xu1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent advances in ChIP-coupled deep sequencing have greatly expedited the tedious task of dissecting the interplay between epigenetic modifications and complex transcriptional output <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Schones1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, the recent discovery that the majority of uH2A in the fly genome is placed by a complex containing the Bmi1 homolog but lacking Pc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Lagarou1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> calls the generality of the sequential recruitment model into question.</p><p>To understand how uH2A fits into the complex epigenetic architecture associated with mammalian chromatin, we describe the genome-wide profile of Bmi1-dependent uH2A by comparing the enrichment of this mark in Bmi1 wild-type and null MEF cells. This analysis provides evidence that while Bmi1 dependent uH2A is enriched at genes containing the H3K27me3 mark, it is not limited to these regions. In addition, analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns reveals a link between uH2A and DNA methylation in high-density CpG promoters. Transcription profiling of wild-type MEF cells indicates that Bmi1-dependent uH2A is enriched at genes with low levels of <italic>de novo</italic> expression. Finally, genes containing the highest levels of Bmi1 dependent uH2A at their promoters are expressed higher upon Bmi1 loss of function than genes harboring low levels of uH2A. Thus, our study uncovers some previously unrecognized features of uH2A.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generating Genome-Wide uH2A Modification Maps</title><p>In an effort to understand the function of the Bmi1-dependent uH2A epigenetic mark, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments using the well characterized uH2A monoclonal antibody E6C5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Wang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Cao1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-deNapoles1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Vassilev1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> in wild-type MEFs. The precipitated DNA was subjected to deep sequencing using the Solexa sequencing technology. As a control for non-specific background, and to focus the research on the Bmi1-dependent proportion of genomic uH2A, parallel ChIPs were also performed in Bmi1 null MEF cells. A previous report has shown that these cells undergo drastic reductions in global H2A ubiquitylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Cao1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. After sequencing 25 bp DNA fragments, the data retrieved from both cell types were mapped to the <italic>mm</italic>8 build of the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> genome. DNA tags which did not uniquely map to the genome were discarded and the resulting tag libraries consisted of over 6 million and 8 million unique reads for the wild-type and Bmi1 null MEF cells, respectively. We next performed normalization for the total number of uniquely mapped reads, and generated a final Bmi1-dependent uH2A summary file by aligning reads from both libraries and subtracting uH2A tags derived from Bmi1 null MEFs from those derived from wild-type MEFs. Density maps were created by ignoring negative tag density regions. UCSC genome browser tracks corresponding to the normalized uH2A in wild-type MEFs, Bmi1 null MEFs, and subtracted tag density plots are available from the NCBI GEO Database under accession number GSE15909.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Enrichment of uH2A at the Majority of Gene Promoters Is Dependent on Bmi1 Function</title><p>Given the enrichment of many epigenetic marks at gene promoters, we began our analysis of Bmi1-dependent uH2A localization by examining the area directly surrounding the transcription start site of well annotated genes. To this end, the average per base pair normalized density of Bmi1-dependent uH2A was determined for a 10 kb region surrounding well annotated TSSs at a 200 bp resolution (analyzed gene list is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000506.s002">Table S1</xref>). This genome-wide averaging analysis revealed enrichment of the uH2A mark that peaked just inside the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Given the link between uH2A and PRC2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-HernandezMunoz1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, we next set out to determine if a quantitative relationship existed between Bmi1-dependent promoter uH2A enrichment and promoter H3K4me3 and/or H3K27me3 placement. To this end, well-annotated genes were grouped into four classes based on the presence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 within their promoters, as determined by a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Mikkelsen1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. The same averaging analysis was applied to these separate groups of genes which included promoters containing H3K4me3 only, H3K27me3 only, both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (bivalent), or lacking both modifications (no K4/no K27). This analysis revealed Bmi1-dependent enrichment of average uH2A tag density for both the bivalent and H3K27me3 modified gene classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, compare grey line to green and blue lines). Enrichment manifested in an increase in averaged peak height, as well as an overall broadening of the uH2A peak further into the body of K27me3 marked genes.

Biochemically, H3K27me3 has been shown to serve as a binding site for the recruitment of the PRC1 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Fischle1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Min1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies suggest that there should be a link between uH2A and H3K27me3. However, recent evidence from <italic>Drosophila</italic> has implicated another Bmi1 containing complex, dRAF, in H2A ubiquitylation. Interestingly, this complex lacks Pc and must utilize an alternative means of targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Lagarou1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. To examine whether our dataset could shed light on the relationship between the two modifications, we investigated the overlap between peaks of Bmi1-dependent uH2A, H3K27me3, and H3K4me3. We reasoned that if an alternate method of E3 ligase recruitment was present in MEF cells then uH2A enrichment would be present in regions not marked by H3K27me3. Of the 4132 peaks of H3K27me3 identified in a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Mikkelsen1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, about 15&#x00025; (651) overlap with peaks of uH2A. Furthermore, about 11&#x00025; of the 2,604 genomic regions defined as bivalent overlap with our uH2A dataset. Interestingly, about 5.6&#x00025; of the 14,178 peaks of H3K4me3 exhibit co-localization with peaks of Bmi1-dependent uH2A. Together, these findings reveal that enriched regions of uH2A show a marked localization bias to genomic regions which also contain the H3K27me3 mark. However, they also indicate that the vast majority of Bmi1-dependent uH2A falls outside of regions containing this mark and suggests that an alternate method of ubiquitin E3 ligase recruitment may exist in MEF cells.</p><p>Given that about half of all uH2A enriched regions in the genome fall outside of genic regions and only 4&#x00025; are localized to gene promoters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000506-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000506.s004">Table S3</xref>), we next explored possible differences between promoter and non-promoter peaks of uH2A with regards to H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 overlap. To this end, peaks were binned by their localization inside or outside of promoters, and the number of peaks from each of these groups which overlapped with additional epigenetic modifications was calculated. This analysis revealed that a higher proportion of promoter bound Bmi1-dependent uH2A peaks co-localized with either H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 when compared to peaks located outside of promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This result is not surprising given the relative enrichment of H3K4/H3K27 within gene promoter regions. However, this finding reinforces the fact that Bmi1-dependent uH2A is distinct from the H3K27me3 mark with respect to the extent of its enrichment outside of genic regions.</p><fig id="pgen-1000506-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000506.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Promoter and non-promoter peaks of Bmi1-dependent uH2A are distinct.</title><p>(A) Proportion of promoter uH2A peaks (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;671) (left bar) and non-promoter uH2A peaks (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;15735)(right bar) which overlap with H3K4/H3K27 methylation peaks.

In addition, further sub-division of promoter and non-promoter peaks by H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 overlap reveals two additional pieces of information.

Taken together, these data indicate that an overall increase in Bmi1-dependent uH2A abundance can be found at silenced or low expressed genes; likewise, genes marked by promoter peaks of uH2A tend to be expressed at a lower level then genes lacking peaks of Bmi1-dependent uH2A.</p><p>The correlation between increased levels of uH2A and gene repression could be due to an intrinsic repressive effect of uH2A on transcription or due to an association of uH2A with other silencing epigenetic marks. To differentiate between these possibilities, we compared genes with promoter uH2A enrichment peaks to those without peaks in terms of their association with promoter H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 marks. This analysis revealed that a higher proportion of genes containing uH2A are also marked by H3K27me3 either alone or in the context of bivalent domains when compared with genes not marked by uH2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In addition, the uH2A positive gene set is enriched for promoters lacking both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 as well as depleted for the H3K4me3 mark alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). This indicates that grouping genes based on uH2A results in a population enriched for epigenetic marks tightly linked to gene repression and depletion of epigenetic marks tightly linked to gene expression. Given that this proportional shift could indicate that uH2A is passively correlated to gene repression, we next asked the question whether uH2A could function in conjunction with these additional epigenetic marks to fine-tune mRNA expression levels. To this end, we repeated the analysis described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g005">Figure 5C</xref> for uH2A gene groups further sub-divided by additional promoter modifications and compared the average expression of these gene groups across classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Results confirm higher average expression of genes marked by H3K4me3 and drastically lower expression levels of genes containing promoter H3K27me3, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 (bivalent), and neither mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Co-occurrence of uH2A with H3K4me3, H3K27me3, or bivalent domains did not result in any changes of average expression level when compared to genes harboring only the K4/K27 combinations. The sole significant change in WT expression level was a small increase for genes containing only the uH2A mark (Wilcoxon <italic>P</italic> value&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.026) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). These results indicate that the correlation that exists between promoters bound by Bmi1-dependent uH2A and low level <italic>de novo</italic> gene expression is due to a proportional shift in other epigenetic marks that have a more profound effect on transcriptional state.</p><p>Even though Bmi1-dependent promoter uH2A is enriched at silenced genes, results of <italic>de novo</italic> expression analysis in wild-type cells were not able to ascertain an active function for uH2A in gene silencing. It is possible that a global role for uH2A in gene silencing was masked in this analysis by the presence of other epigenetic modifications which are more potent in enacting transcriptional control. To directly address a potential global role for Bmi1-dependent uH2A in gene silencing, we turned our attention to expression changes upon Bmi1 knock-out. To this end, we performed a microarray study on Bmi1 null MEFs and compared gene expression with that in the wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000506.s002">Table S1</xref>). Of the 671 genes marked by promoter uH2A, we were able to generate reliable fold-change transcription data for 472 genes. We found that on average, this group was upregulated in Bmi1 null MEF cells by 1.5 fold. We next investigated whether the level of uH2A loss at genes in Bmi1 null cells was correlated to increased expression upon Bmi1 knock-out. For this analysis, genes containing Bmi1-dependent peaks of uH2A were sorted into three groups by increasing tag density (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;157, 157, and 158, respectively), and both the average fold change as well as the data distribution of each group was determined. Interestingly, genes marked by the lowest levels of uH2A exhibited the smallest average increase in transcription upon Bmi1 knock-out when compared to both intermediate and high tag density groups (1.14, 1.98, and 1.37 fold, respectively). In addition, data distribution analysis and Wilcoxon signed-rank testing reveals that this finding is statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Taken together, these data are consistent with a global role for Bmi1-dependent uH2A in gene silencing and extend gene specific analysis at important developmental regulators to genome-wide correlation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Deep sequencing techniques have recently been used to map epigenetic marks in high definition throughout mammalian genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Barski1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Mikkelsen1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Meissner1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

Using a ChIP-Seq approach, here we analyzed the genome-wide distribution of Bmi1-dependent uH2A. This investigation revealed several interesting features of this epigenetic modification which serve as the basis for further studies.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Bmi1-Dependent uH2A Distribution throughout Mammalian Chromatin</title><p>By combining genome averaging and peak localization analyses, this study reveals the first picture of the genome-wide localization of the uH2A mark and identifies Bmi1-dependent enrichment within both genic and non-genic regions of the mouse genome. On average, uH2A tag density is enriched at gene promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) with further enrichment at genes marked by H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Peak analysis reveals that Bmi1-dependent uH2A enriched regions coincide with gene promoters at a much higher rate than can be expected by chance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000506-t001">Table 1</xref>), and these peaks encompass significantly higher tag values when compared with non-promoter peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, promoter peak tag values are enriched at genes also marked by H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, the gross distribution of genic uH2A peaks is skewed towards the 3&#x02032; end of genes, indicating that more regions of uH2A enrichment are found within these genic regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000506.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). However, these peaks represent lower enrichment regions when compared to promoter peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000506.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Together, these data support the notion that H3K27me3 can contribute to the recruitment of PRC2 and ubiquitylation of H2A in promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Fischle1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Min1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, even though the highest regions of Bmi- dependent uH2A enrichment are at H3K27me3 genes, clear peaks also exist at genomic regions (both genic and non-genic) that do not contain this mark. This uH2A distribution pattern is very different from what would be expected given a recent study of Ring1b and Bmi1 binding profiles in mES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Ku1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> but are more consistent with a previous study which described a proportion of gene promoters positive for Ring1b/Bmi1 but negative for PRC2 binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Boyer1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Although this discrepancy may reflect the differences of uH2A distribution in ES cells and MEF cells, it is possible that similar to the observations in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Lagarou1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, a Pc independent mechanism of Ring1b/Bmi1 recruitment may exist in MEF cells. Along these lines, about half of all the most enriched Bmi1-dependent uH2A regions lie outside of both promoter and transcribed regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000506-t001">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, these regions do not overlap significantly with peaks of H3K27me3.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Relationship between uH2A and DNA Methylation</title><p>Since the initial finding linking Polycomb silencing to DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Vire1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, genome-wide studies have called the generality of this association into question as very little overlap exists between genes methylated at H3K27 and genes that contain high levels of CpG island methylation associated with their promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Fouse1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Kondo1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000506-Farthing1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, whether these specific instances of convergence of silencing pathways are linked to global gene regulation has not been determined. Here we provide evidence to support a functional link between DNA methylation and histone ubiquitylation through Bmi1-dependent mechanisms in a group of high CpG-containing genes. Not only does the level of DNA methylation increase at HCP promoters marked by uH2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), a result that may be explained by an increase in H3K27 methylation on these genes, but knock-out of Dnmt1, which results in the ablation of CpG methylation genome wide, causes a global decrease in the uH2A levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, Bmi1 knock-out results in only a small, statistically insignificant, increase in global DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that DNA methylation may be upstream of Bmi1-dependent H2A ubiquitylation.

Peak centered analysis of promoter uH2A confirms this result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) and reveals that this enrichment is most likely a consequence of over-representation of the H3K27me3 mark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000506-g005">Figure 5C, 5D, and 5E</xref>).
