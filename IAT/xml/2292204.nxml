The observation of gene dosage effects in transgenic mouse models implies that subtle changes in expression levels can affect the correct function of the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene product. We have therefore characterized the promoter of the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene in order to study its transcriptional regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Transcription start sites of the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene are distributed over 800 bp within a region previously identified as an unmethylated CpG island. We have identified a new alternative noncoding 5'-exon of the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene which is located 772 bp upstream of the previously described transcription start site. Transcription of the two splicing variants is controlled by non-overlapping promoter regions that can independently drive reporter gene expression. We found no evidence of cell- or tissue-specific promoter usage, but the two promoter regions differed in their activity and their regulation. The sequence upstream of exon 1A (promoter region A) induced about 10-fold higher reporter gene activity than the sequence upstream of exon 1B (promoter region B). Overexpression of the transcription factor E2F1 increased <italic>DYRK1A </italic>mRNA levels in Saos2 and Phoenix cells and enhanced the activity of promoter region B three- to fourfold.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The identification of two alternatively spliced transcripts whose transcription is initiated from differentially regulated promoters regions indicates that the expression of the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene is subject to complex control mechanisms. The regulatory effect of E2F1 suggests that DYRK1A may play a role in cell cycle regulation or apoptosis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Protein kinases of the DYRK (<underline>d</underline>ual specificity t<underline>y</underline>rosine phosphorylation-<underline>r</underline>egulated <underline>k</underline>inase) family play key roles in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation in a variety of systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Processes controlled by DYRKs include the organization of the symmetric cell division in <italic>S. pombe </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], the transition from growth to development in <italic>Dictyostelium </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], the formation of the embryonic axis in <italic>C. elegans </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and the control of erythropoiesis in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the kinase encoded by the <italic>minibrain </italic>gene (MNB) plays an essential role in postembryonic neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and the orthologous proteins in chicken (MNB) and mammals (DYRK1A) have also been implicated in the regulation of neuronal differentiation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). Because the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene is localized within a region of chromosome 21 considered to be particularly important for many traits of Down syndrome ("Down syndrome critical region") [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], <italic>DYRK1A </italic>has attracted interest as a candidate gene for brain abnormalities and mental retardation in individuals with Down syndrome.</p><p>The proposed role of DYRK1A in Down syndrome-related mental retardation was supported by analyses of genetically altered mice. Three different mouse models (transgenic mice with a yeast artificial chromosome that includes the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene, transgenic mice overexpressing the cDNA of rat <italic>Dyrk1a</italic>, and transgenic mice with one extra copy of the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene in a bacterial artificial chromosome) were generated and found to exhibit neurodevelopmental delays and impairment in learning tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Interestingly, mice heterozygous for <italic>Dyrk1a </italic>also show marked abnormalities of brain development and behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], providing evidence that the function of DYRK1A is particularly sensitive to gene dosage effects. It is generally thought that the many features of Down syndrome originate from a 1.5-fold increase in the dosage of genes in the Down syndrome critical region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Expression of the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>was shown to be increased 1.5-fold in fetal and adult brains from subjects with Down syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>These results imply that the function of DYRK1A is strongly influenced by its level of expression. The activity of many protein kinases is subject to short term control by second messengers (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, cAMP, AMP), posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, or interaction with regulatory subunits (cyclins, CDK). In contrast, DYRKs require phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine residue in the activation loop to acquire maximal catalytic activity, but this is an autophosphorylation event that takes place during maturation of the protein and does not appear to be subject to regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Although the activity of DYRK1A has been reported to be modulated by bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and by interaction with 14-3-3 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], the kinase was found to be constitutively active in all systems studied so far. Hence, regulation of gene expression will directly influence the cellular function of DYRK1A. Microarray studies have revealed striking changes in the abundance of <italic>DYRK1A </italic>mRNA in various systems of cellular differentiation and proliferation, <italic>e.g</italic>., during activation of T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], in human neutrophils exposed to bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], in differentiating haematopoetic progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], in the course of melanoma tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], or in HPV16-immortalized keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, expression of DYRK1A is also tightly controlled in neural progenitor cells of early developing chicken brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Altogether, these studies clearly indicate that <italic>DYRK1A </italic>mRNA levels are highly regulated, although the question how the expression of the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene is controlled has not been directly addressed until now.</p><p>In this study we have characterized the promoter of the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene in order to analyze its transcriptional regulation. Our data show that transcription of the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene can start within a broad region of 800 bp. Two non-overlapping regions within the 5'-region of the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene exhibit promoter activity in reporter gene assays and lead to transcripts with alternative noncoding 5' exons. Interestingly, one of the two promoter regions is regulated by the transcription factor E2F1, suggesting a potential role of DYRK1A in the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Alternative transcription start sites in the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene</title><p>We performed RACE-PCR on cDNA from the human PC3 prostate carcinoma cell line. Sequencing of cloned PCR products revealed three types of cDNAs. The shortest clones contained cDNA fragments with their 5'-ends on exon 2 upstream of the initiator codon (transcript <italic>a </italic>in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We considered these cDNAs to be truncated because several longer transcripts were already known. Second, larger products (<italic>b </italic>in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, represented by four RACE clones) contained cDNA fragments that started 11 nucleotides upstream of the "type 1" transcript described by Wang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB015283">AB015283</ext-link>] and 14 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start of the MNBHa transcript that was previously identified by Guimera <italic>et al</italic>.

None of the RACE products from the PC3 cells corresponded to the alternatively spliced MNBHb transcript that was also described in the latter paper. However, we identified two independent clones that contained a short piece of sequence from bp -772 to -756 that was directly spliced to exon 2 (<italic>c </italic>in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; for detailed sequence information see Figure S1 in the Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> "supplementary figures").</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Mapping of transcripts to the 5'-region of the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene</bold>.

In parallel, a forward primer specific for exon 1B was used with the same reverse primers. We used cDNA from the human osteosarcoma cell line Saos2 as a template to exclude the possibility that the alternative transcript was an aberrant splice product specific to PC3 cells. All primer pairs yielded major amplification products that represented the expected transcripts (as indicated in the top panel of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). For each of the alternatively spliced first exons, the major bands in one of the PCRs (from lanes 2 and 4) were cloned and verified through sequencing. In addition, minor fragments were detected that were about 100 bp larger or smaller (very faint bands on the gel shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), and are derived from alternatively spliced transcripts (see below).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB015284">AB015284</ext-link>] (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, one of our RACE clones contained two additional exons between exon 2 and exon 3 (for detailed sequence information, see Figure S1 in the Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> "supplementary figures"). In addition, a clone derived from the upper band in lane 4 of the gel presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> contained another alternative exon between exon 2 and exon 3 (see Figure S2 in the Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> "supplementary figures"). These facultative exons are flanked by <italic>bona fide </italic>consensus splicing sites, but neither exon shows sequence conservation between rodents and human and they are not supported by expressed sequence tags in the database; furthermore, both contain premature termination codons. The smallest band produced by the PCR in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> represented a transcript in which exon 1B was directly spliced to exon 3, as in the clone [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB015282">AB015282</ext-link>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This transcript lacks the initiator codon on exon 2 and therefore would encode an N-terminally truncated version of DYRK1A, if another ATG codon could function as an alternative initiation codon. The relevance of these minor splicing variants is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Structure of the DYRK1A promoter</title><p>The present results provide evidence of two transcription start sites separated by 772 bp in the 5'-region of the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene. These start sites initiate two alternatively spliced transcripts that differ in their 5'-untranslated sequences, but are identical within their coding regions. The sequence of this region and the exact positions of the transcription start sites are shown in Figure S1 (in the Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> "supplementary figures"). We designate the alternative first exons of these transcripts exon 1A and 1B, respectively, and the corresponding <underline>t</underline>ranscription <underline>s</underline>tart <underline>s</underline>ites TSS A and TSS B. Both start sites are devoid of canonical TATA or CAAT boxes, but the whole region is very GC-rich and contains numerous potential binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 (Figure S1). TSS B lies within a CpG island that was previously found to be unmethylated in a comprehensive analysis of the methylation status of CpG islands on human chromosome 21 (#61 in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]).</p><p>No PCR product was identified that started at TSS A and contained the whole sequence up to exon 1B. However, we cannot exclude that such transcripts escaped detection because the shorter variant might have been positively selected during PCR. TSS B is identical to the 5'-end of the MNBHa transcript described by Guimera <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We designate the first exon of the MNBHb transcript proposed by Guimera exon 1M because this transcript was reported to be specifically expressed in muscle.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin organization in the 5'-region of the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene</title><p>Barski <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] have recently generated a genome-wide, high resolution map of histone methylation and chromatin organization in resting human CD4+ T-cells through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis (ChIP-Seq). The results for the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene within this dataset show that the highest level of RNA polymerase II binding was found in the region around exon 1A/1B (see Figure S3 in the Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> "supplementary figures"). Other characteristics typical of active promoters, <italic>e.g</italic>,. the presence of the histone H2A.Z and of histone H3 that is trimethylated on Lys4, were also specifically detected in this region. The region upstream of exon 2, which was regarded as the promoter of the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], exhibits neither the characteristics of an active nor an inactive promoter (<italic>e.g</italic>., binding of H3 trimethylated on Lys27; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription start sites of the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene in the CAGE database</title><p>To further define the heterogeneity of transcription start sites in the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>promoter, we took advantage of the <underline>c</underline>ap-<underline>a</underline>nalysis of <underline>g</underline>ene <underline>e</underline>xpression (CAGE) database of transcription start sites that was established by the FANTOM consortium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. CAGE tags are derived from capped mRNA molecules and thus represent the 5'-ends of individual transcripts. In total, 420 CAGE tags mapped to the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene (transcriptional unit 723 in the database, 148,314 bp). Of these, 234 tags mapped to the 1,000 bp-region upstream of TSS B, whereas only two tags were located in the vicinity (-1,000/+100 bp) of exon 1M, and no tags mapped to the 5,000 bp upstream of exon 2. Carninci <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] have grouped CAGE tags into tag clusters (TC) that were operationally defined to characterize promoters. As illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, major tag clusters are located close to TSS A and TSS B, respectively, confirming that the RACE clones obtained in our study represent major transcription start sites. In addition, a considerable number of tags, including the largest tag cluster of the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene (84 CAGE tags), map to the region between TSS A and TSS B. Given that each CAGE tag represents the true 5'-end of an individual mRNA molecule, this analysis shows that transcription of the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene can initiate within a broad region of about 800 bp. There was no difference in tissue distribution between the CAGE tags belonging to the different tag clusters. This unusual broad distribution of transcription start sites was also found in mouse tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), indicating that it is conserved feature of this gene.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Mapping of CAGE tags to the human DYRK1A promoter</bold>.

In addition, we generated a series of deletion constructs of the 1453-bp sequence in order to localize regulatory sequence elements and the minimal promoter region. The results of the luciferase assays in the human osteosarcoma cell line Saos2 clearly show that the two non-overlapping regions upstream of TSS A (-1453 to -756) and TSS B (-742 to +44) were able to independently drive reporter gene expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Promoter region A was 14-fold more active than promoter region B, and the promoter activity of all constructs including both TSS A and TSS B was consistently higher than of those containing only TSS B. The lower activity of the -1453/+44 construct as compared to the -1453/-756 construct is possibly due to the fact that in the full length construct, transcription from TSS A proceeds through the whole region between TSS A and TSS B. Also, the presence of the unusually long 5'-UTR (which is normally spliced out from the endogenous transcripts) may impede efficient translation.</p><p>In contrast to the regions upstream of TSS A and TSS B, the putative promoter region upstream of exon 1M did not stimulate luciferase activity in Saos2 cells. The same result was obtained in COS7 cells (data not shown), and this region was not studied further in the present work. Because of the muscle-specific expression of exon 1M containing transcripts, functional analysis of the promoter region might require the use of a myoblast cell line.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> demonstrates that two parts of the sequence appear to be particularly important for promoter activity: Deletion of the segments between -839 and -742 or between -324 and -226 caused marked decreases of luciferase activity. However, a short segment of 114 bp upstream of TSS B was still sufficient to induce luciferase expression more strongly (3.2-fold) than the promoterless vector, and thus may be considered the minimal promoter region of TSS B.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Deletion analysis of the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>promoter region</bold>.

For a direct comparison of human and murine promoters, reporter gene vectors including either TSS A or B were analyzed side by side in Saos2 cells. This experiment showed that the basal activities of homologous promoter constructs for TSS A and TSS B were very similar (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Like in the human promoter, two non-overlapping fragments of the murine promoter are capable of driving reporter gene expression, and also similar to the human promoter, promoter region A shows about 10-fold (12.3 &#x000b1; 2.0 mean &#x000b1; SD) higher activity than promoter region B. Overexpression of E2F1 enhanced the activity of promoter region B (-660 fragment), as was also observed with the human promoter constructs. Although these results provide clear evidence for an E2F1 effect on promoter region B, our data do not exclude the possibility that E2F1 can also affect transcription from TSS A because weak stimulatory effects may have been masked by the higher basal activity of these promoter constructs.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutational analysis of putative E2F1 and Sp1 binding sites in promoter region B</title><p>Inspection of the 1453 bp-sequence upstream of TSS B revealed a putative E2F1-binding site at -153 that matched the criteria of a consensus sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>).

Forskolin is an activator of adenylate cyclase, and the increased cAMP levels cause the phosphorylation of Ser133, and consequently the activation of CREB by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). However, treatment of PC12 cells with forskolin did not change <italic>Dyrk1a </italic>mRNA levels in PC12 cells, as revealed by Northern blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>). The same result was obtained in an experiment with a PC12 clone from a different source (data not shown). As a control, a known target gene of CREB, the protooncogene <italic>c-fos </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], was readily induced by forskolin. In spite of this negative result, we performed reporter gene assays in order to assess the effect of forskolin on the activity of promoter region A. No stimulation of either promoter region A or B by forskolin was observed in three different cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>). In contrast, a synthetic reporter gene construct driven by four consecutive CREs was stimulated by forskolin, indicating that the cell lines analyzed were capable of a transcriptional response to forskolin/cAMP. Finally, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with nuclear extracts from forskolin-treated PC12 cells to determine whether CREB can bind to the CRE motif in promoter region A. As shown in Figure S4 (in the Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> "supplementary figures"), the probe derived from the DYRK1A gene was detected in CREB-containing complexes but the intensity of the bands was much weaker that of those with the consensus CRE.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>DYRK1A </italic>has attracted considerable interest as a "candidate gene" potentially responsible for several traits related to Down syndrome. Although the characterization of transgenic mouse models has shown that the correct function of this protein kinase is critically dependent on the gene dosage and, consequently, the intracellular level of the DYRK1A protein, nothing is known about its regulation on the level of gene expression. The present study provides the first functional characterization of the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>promoter.</p><p>The structural organization of the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene has previously been described by Wang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and Guimera <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], who have also identified transcripts with 5'-ends in the promoter region. In other reports, the region upstream of exon 2 was regarded as the promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], probably because their <italic>in silico</italic>-methods for promoter identification failed to correctly recognize the first non-coding exon. Of the five transcript in the NCBI CoreNucleotide database, only transcript 3 (GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_101395">NM_101395</ext-link>) begins with exon 1B, whereas the others have 5'-ends at exon 2. The analysis of chromatin organization in the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene (Fig. S3 in the Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> "supplementary figures") provides clear evidence that only the region around exons 1A and 1B exhibits features of an active promoter. The distribution of CAGE tags also shows no evidence of a promoter upstream of exon 2. Here we describe a new transcription start site (TSS A) which belongs to an alternative first exon (exon 1A) located 772 bp upstream of the known TSS B. Both transcript variants encode the same protein, but their expression is controlled by different promoter sequences. In addition to these two transcription start sites, evaluation of the CAGE tag database revealed that transcription can start at many more different sites within the region between TSS A and B. According to the working definition used by Carninci <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], the promoter region of the human <italic>DYRK1A </italic>gene encompasses 5 non-overlapping CAGE tag clusters that by definition should represent alternative promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Each of these clusters displays a broad distribution of start sites, and according to the classification of Carninci <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] the overall distribution can be described as "broad with dominant peaks" (-252 to -814) plus an extra cluster at TSS B (-11 to -35). It remains to be determined whether the tag clusters between TSS A and TSS B, in particular the largest cluster at about -500, represent independent core promoters.</p><p>The extended distribution of TSS is typical for promoters that lack a TATA-box and contain transcription start sites within CpG islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The region of the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>promoter has previously been classified as an unmethylated CpG island [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Consensus sites for the transcription factor Sp1 are overrepresented in promoters with high CG content, and Sp1 is capable of recruiting TATA-binding protein in the absence of TATA boxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. We have studied the role of two Sp1 consensus sites close to TSS B and found that mutation of these sites did not affect the reporter gene activity of promoter region B. This result does not exclude a regulatory role of Sp1, since other Sp1 sites are present further upstream (Figure S1).</p><p>The use of alternative promoters allows for a more complex regulation of gene expression. Two different, non-overlapping fragments of the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>promoter region are capable of driving reporter gene expression. The higher activity of promoter region A was not specific to Saos2 cells, but was also observed in other cell lines (HeLa, COS-7, PC3, PC-12, data not shown), arguing against the possibility that the two promoters bring about tissue-specific transcriptional regulation. In accordance with this observation, the CAGE tag analysis also revealed no tissue-specificity in the composition of the different tag clusters (not shown). However, the two promoter regions differed strikingly in their response to overexpression of E2F1. All promoter constructs driven by promoter B were stimulated by E2F1, but none of the constructs that contained TSS A showed a significant response. Although promoter region A was still more active than promoter region B, total levels of <italic>DYRK1A </italic>mRNA were increased by E2F1 overexpression in Phoenix cells and Saos2 cells.</p><p>E2F transcription factors are well known to regulate numerous genes essential for DNA replication and cell cycle progression, and also DNA damage repair, apoptosis, development and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Although so far no study has directly addressed the function of DYRK1A in the cell cycle, DYRK1A mRNA levels were repeatedly found to be regulated in systems of cellular differentiation and proliferation (see introduction). Consistent with a role in cell cycle regulation or apoptosis, DYRK1A was identified among the 150 genes whose pattern of expression in human leukemia cells most accurately discriminated responses of patients to cytostatic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Interestingly, in transgenic mice DYRK1A overexpression has been described to be associated with high levels of cyclin B1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. On the other hand, DYRK1A overexpression has been shown to enhance nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Many E2F1 target genes including the homeobox genes are involved in developmental regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], which is another area where DYRK1A has been implicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Further research is required to clarify the consequences of DYRK1A upregulation by E2F1.</p><p>Mutation of the only potential E2F binding site in front of TSS B did not affect E2F1-induced reporter gene activity. However, it is well known that some genes are regulated by E2F factors in the absence of canonical E2F sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. For transcriptional activation of the human <italic>ASK </italic>gene, binding of E2F to a non-consensus site depends on the presence of a neighboring Sp1 site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. We have therefore also mutated the two Sp1 sites closest to TSS B but detected no effect on basal or E2F-induced promoter activity. Still, E2F1 can also bind to GC-rich elements in the absence of consensus E2F consensus elements, and the mutated -742 construct still contained several potential Sp1 sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Thus, our results neither exclude the possibility that E2F1 acts <italic>via </italic>binding to a non-consensus E2F site nor that its effect is mediated indirectly by activation or upregulation of other transcription factors.</p><p>In addition to E2F1, we tested CREB for its potential role in the regulation of the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>promoter because <italic>Dyrk1a </italic>was detected as a target gene of CREB in a chromatin immunoprecipitation-based screen in rat PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. A potential CRE is located 50 bp upstream of human TSS A and is conserved in the mouse promoter. Although the motif in the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>promoter does not exactly match the CRE consensus sequence, it contains two copies of the CRE half site (CGTCA), which binds CREB with a lower affinity and is found in about half of the genes with functional CREs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In fact, binding of CREB to this sequence in electrophoretic mobility shift assays was much weaker than binding to a consensus CRE (Figure S4 in the Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> "supplementary figures"). Forskolin did not enhance promoter activity in several cell lines, and <italic>Dyrk1a </italic>mRNA levels were not increased in forskolin-treated PC12 cells. Thus, it appears unlikely that CREB is a major transcriptional regulator of human or rat <italic>DYRK1A/Dyrk1a</italic>. However, we cannot totally exclude that the lack of a CREB effect in our hands is due to heterogeneity of PC12 subclones in different labs, or slightly divergent experimental conditions.</p><p>Up to now, the only transcription factor reported to regulate the <italic>DYRK1A </italic>promoter was AP4 (activator protein 4), which was described to negatively regulate expression of <italic>DYRK1A </italic>in non-neural cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>].
