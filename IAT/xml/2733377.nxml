In this study, we have used green fluorescent protein-positive bone marrow chimeras to investigate the effect of <italic>HOXA3</italic> expression on recruitment of BMDCs to wounds.

Here we show that diabetic mice treated with <italic>HOXA3</italic> displayed a significant increase in both mobilization and recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells compared with control mice. Importantly, we also found that <italic>HOXA3</italic>-treated mice had significantly fewer inflammatory cells recruited to the wound compared with control mice. Microarray analyses of <italic>HOXA3</italic>-treated wounds revealed that indeed HOXA3 locally increased expression of genes that selectively promote stem/progenitor cell mobilization and recruitment while also suppressing expression of numerous members of the proinflammatory nuclear factor &#x003ba;B pathway, including myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 and toll-interacting protein. Thus HOXA3 accelerates wound repair by mobilizing endothelial progenitor cells and attenuating the excessive inflammatory response of chronic wounds.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Wound repair</kwd><kwd>HOXA3</kwd><kwd>Bone marrow-derived cells</kwd><kwd>Endothelial progenitor cells</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>Vasculogenesis</kwd><kwd>GFP chimeras</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Tissue repair and regeneration require dramatic and coordinated changes in cell behavior in both wound-resident cells at the site of injury and in distant cells that respond to and are recruited to the injured tissue. Cells within the skin, normally homeostatic, respond to injury by increasing expression of genes that induce mitosis, migration, and direct synthesis and remodeling the extracellular matrix. This tightly regulated process involves a &#x0201c;ramping up&#x0201d; of growth factor and cytokine release followed by adult stem/progenitor cell mobilization, migration, engraftment, and finally, differentiation in response to injury. Studies investigating the genes involved in this process have identified both transcription factors and ligand/receptor pairs that have previously been implicated in wound healing. Genes such as <italic>Hif-1&#x003b1;,</italic><italic>Hoxa3, Cxcl12/Cxcr4,</italic> and <italic>Vegf/Vegfr2</italic> among others play a variety of roles in wound repair and regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>]; however, much of the genetic control of adult stem and progenitor cell behavior during wound repair and regeneration is largely unknown.</p><p>Angiogenesis is the growth of new blood vessels from existing blood vessels, whereas vasculogenesis is the growth of new blood vessels from stem or progenitor cells that are presumably recruited from the bone marrow. Previously we demonstrated that the transcription factor, HOXA3, significantly promotes angiogenesis/vasculogenesis during tissue repair and regeneration and accelerates cutaneous wound healing in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>]. In particular we demonstrated that transient gene transfer of <italic>HOXA3</italic> to skin wounds of diabetic mice resulted in the upregulation of target genes, such as <italic>Plaur, Mmp14,</italic> and <italic>Cdc42,</italic> that are involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and cell migration.</p><p>A number of recent studies have also suggested that recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) can enhance tissue repair in ischemic and myocardial infarction models, as well as in cutaneous wounds (recently reviewed in Wu et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]). Both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis can be improved in response to the presence of BMDCs in the wound milieu (recently reviewed in Schatteman et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>]). Specifically, recruitment of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can dramatically enhance neovascularization, either through direct incorporation and differentiation in the neovasculature, or by functioning as perivascular support cells that produce additional factors that stimulate repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>].</p><p>BMDCs are first mobilized from the bone marrow and enter circulation in response to signals from the wound. Growth factors and cytokines such as VEGF and SDF-1/CXCL12 have been strongly implicated as signals that mediate this response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>]. However, BMDCs consist of a heterogeneous population that can play repressive as well as supportive roles during wound healing. Over the past few decades, studies on the effects of inflammation during wound repair overwhelmingly support a model in which too many inflammatory cells and/or their overstimulation can impede the healing process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>]. Although mild inflammation early in response to injury may enhance angiogenesis/vasculogenesis, prolonged and/or excessive presence of leukocytes, activated neutrophils, and macrophages in particular, are associated with chronic wounds that have severely impaired healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>], and may interfere with efficient neovascularization.</p><p>Because many Hox genes have been found to play an important role in the regulation of blood stem cell proliferation and differentiation (recently reviewed in Argiropoulos and Humphries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]), and the Hox-3 paralog group in particular has been shown to promote neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>], we hypothesized that <italic>HOXA3</italic>-augmented diabetic wound healing may in part arise from its potential impact on BMDCs. This could occur via modulation of BMDC mobilization, recruitment, or differentiation of stem/progenitor cells, or any combination of these processes during wound repair and regeneration. Here we show that sustained expression of <italic>HOXA3</italic> in diabetic wounds is accompanied by specific transcriptional changes in the wound microenvironment that modulate both the quantity and type of BMDCs recruited to cutaneous wounds, accelerating tissue repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Mouse Strains and Bone Marrow Chimeras</title><p>All animals used in this study were housed in the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) animal care facility, and the UCSF Committee on Animal Research approved all procedures on animals.

Plasmid pellets were applied directly to the open wound at the time of wounding. Animals were housed individually and wounds left undressed.

Analyses of the HOXA3-repressed gene set revealed regulatory pathways inhibited by HOXA3. Seven of these pathways are specific to leukocyte signaling and differentiation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>, left-hand column, highlighted pathways), consistent with our findings that HOXA3 suppresses the inflammatory response. In particular, many members of the nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) pathway were repressed, including interleukin 1 alpha, Tnf receptor-associated factor 1, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 2, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, toll-interacting protein, TNFAIP3-interacting protein 1, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 10, and NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor-interacting Ras-like protein 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>).

This HOXA3-mediated repression of proinflammatory genes at day 4 is not due to a decrease in the number of inflammatory cells present in the wound at day 4, as the numbers of GFP<sup>+</sup>Cd45<sup>+</sup> cells in the wound at day 4 did not significantly differ between <italic>HOXA3</italic>-treated and control-treated <italic>db/db</italic> wounds at this time point (data not shown). All together, these data suggest that HOXA3 suppresses the exacerbated inflammatory cell response found in diabetic chronic wounds in part by silencing the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in cells in the wound by day 4, resulting in a significant reduction of inflammatory cells in the wound by day 7, coinciding with the peak of the neovascularization phase.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>1</label><caption><p>Regulatory pathways modulated by HOXA3 during wound repair</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><graphic xlink:href="stem0027-1654-t1"/></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Analyses of the much smaller set of upregulated genes in <italic>db/db</italic> wounds at day 4 did not reveal any KEGG pathways that are specific to neovascularization, per se, however several of the pathways promoted by HOXA3 are known to contribute to neovascularization, and in particular, to endothelial cell migration (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>, right column, highlighted in yellow), such as calcium signaling, glycan biosynthesis, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway components. GO function analyses of this gene set suggest HOXA3 promotes cell-cell signaling pathways and neurophysiological processes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>, right column, highlighted in yellow), both of which have also been shown to play a significant role in neovascularization (reviewed in Lok et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>] and Scott et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>]).

We show that local expression of HOXA3 in wound tissue not only results in increased mobilization and recruitment of EPCs, but also suppresses the excessive inflammatory response characteristic of diabetic wounds. Together, the enhanced angiogenic response and reduced inflammation lead to a significant acceleration of healing.</p><p>Previous attempts to improve healing in diabetic wounds have focused either on improving angiogenesis via direct activation and/or enhancing recruitment of EPCs, or reducing excessive inflammation, and have met with various degrees of success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>]. Reduced angiogenesis in diabetic wounds has been attributed to reduced mobilization, function, and engraftment of EPCs into tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>]. However, direct application of SDF-1/CXCL12 enhances mobilization of EPCs and improves healing, specifically enhancing recruitment of Cd34<sup>+</sup> EPCs into the neovasculature of granulation tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>]. In the current study we have shown that HOXA3 induces expression of MCP-1/Ccl2, a related member of the CxC/CC chemokine family that has previously been shown to directly recruit EPCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>] and stimulate angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>]. Although we did not detect any differences in VEGF expression itself, reduced VEGF signaling, as well as aberrant cell adhesion properties of EPCs to endothelial cells in diabetic wounds, also contributes to poor EPC recruitment and retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>]. VEGF itself has been shown sufficient for recruitment and retention of recruited bone marrow-derived circulating cells in wild type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>]. VEGF can accelerate wound healing when topically applied to diabetic wounds by promoting angiogenesis and recruitment of Tie2<sup>+</sup> EPCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>]. However, VEGF and other growth factor therapy in patients has proven less successful than expected, most likely due to high levels of proteases and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), both of which are associated with excessive inflammation in the diabetic wound environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>]. High levels of glucose can react nonenzymatically with the amino groups of proteins (glycation). One consequence of this is reduced effectiveness of downstream components of the VEGF signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>]. Thus, treatment of damaged tissue, even with high levels of ligand, is ineffective. Furthermore, AGE-modified fibronectin significantly reduced EPC attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>], whereas blockade of the receptor for AGE significantly improved vascularization in diabetic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>]. Our findings that peripheral blood of <italic>HOXA3</italic>-treated animals contained greater numbers of immature Cd34<sup>+</sup>Cd133<sup>+</sup> EPCs, whereas wounds contained predominantly more mature Cd34<sup>+</sup>Cd133<sup>&#x02212;</sup> EPCs, suggest that HOXA3 not only increased mobilization of immature EPCs but also created an appropriate wound environment that was permissive to adhesion and subsequent maturation of the recruited EPCs. This environment may have also stimulated additional stem/progenitor cells not derived from the bone marrow, and thus not detectable by our GFP tracking methods, as these studies are based on cells derived from reconstituted bone marrow cells descended from hematopoietic stem cells.</p><p>Chronic wounds also exhibit high levels of proteases that can modify the provisional extracellular matrix necessary for proper EPC adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>]. The high levels of proteases present in diabetic and chronic wounds have been linked to excessive inflammation with recruited neutrophils and macrophages expressing high levels of a variety of matrix-degrading proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>]. A role for limiting inflammation in improving tissue repair is also supported by studies in <italic>Pu.1</italic>-null mice that lack neutrophils and macrophages. These mice healed faster and displayed no evidence of fibrosis compared with their wild type counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>]. Importantly, in diabetic wounds, neutralization of TNF-&#x003b1; activity resulted in improved repair and healing due to inactivation of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>], and our present results show that in addition to improving EPC recruitment, HOXA3 also attenuates the TNF pathway, reducing inflammation. Specifically we show that HOXA3 inhibits hyperactivation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, resulting in attenuation of <italic>Tnf-&#x003b1;</italic> expression, and leading to an overall reduction in Cd45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes within the diabetic wound tissue. <italic>Myd88</italic> and <italic>Tollip,</italic> both significantly downregulated by HOXA3 treatment, encode central components of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, functioning as adaptor proteins required for most Toll-like receptor activation of NF-&#x003ba;B in both wound-resident cells and recruited BMDCs. Interestingly, complete loss of <italic>Myd88</italic> function, however, results in impaired wound healing and poor neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>]. Thus it seems that the correct balance of NF-&#x003ba;B activation must be achieved for efficient repair and regeneration. Concentration-dependent differential gene regulation by activated NF-&#x003ba;B is well documented (reviewed in Stathopoulos and Levine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>] and Sur et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>]). We speculate that high levels of nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B result in transcription of genes promoting recruitment/retention of leukocytes, whereas moderate levels of nuclear NF-&#x003ba;B do not, thus facilitating healing.</p><sec><title>Differential Recruitment of EPCs and Leukocytes?</title><p>The majority of EPCs as well as inflammatory cells recruited to the wound are derived form stem/progenitor populations within the bone marrow. However, it is not clear how different populations within the bone marrow are differentially mobilized. For example, MCP-1/Ccl2 can mobilize EPCs and monocyte populations. Although application of this factor has been linked to improved repair and increased EPC recruitment, <italic>Ccl2</italic>-null mice also displayed reduced inflammation and skin fibrosis after wounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>]. Thus the precise mechanisms that allow for enhanced EPC recruitment but restrict leukocyte retention in <italic>HOXA3</italic>-treated wounds are not clear. Whether enhanced EPC recruitment accelerates vascular maturation and stability, which in turn would reduce leukocyte extravasation, is not known. One possibility is that attenuated NF-&#x003ba;B activity results in a switch in phenotype of the recruited monocytes, resulting in their differentiation into endothelial cells or endothelial support cells instead of activated macrophages. This idea is supported by studies demonstrating that hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation into an activated dendritic cell can be blocked by VEGF receptor activation on the progenitor cell and requires inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>]. Furthermore, environmental cues, such as continued proangiogenic stimulation by factors such as VEGF, promote the differentiation of monocytic progenitor cells into endothelial-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>]. Future studies will be focused on elucidating the precise gene regulatory networks downstream of HOXA3 function controlling the recruitment and behavior of EPCs to sites of injury.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUMMARY</title><p>This study indicates that the ability of HOXA3 to activate multiple linked pathways to improve angiogenesis and EPC recruitment, as well as suppressing inflammatory pathways that can inhibit repair and regeneration, comprises a truly successful therapy for diabetic chronic wounds. HOXA3 acts as a &#x0201c;master control&#x0201d; transcription factor that sits at the top of a large transcriptional regulatory network, and affects a variety of pathways that regulate these processes in a developmental context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that restoring expression of &#x0201c;master morphoregulatory factors&#x0201d; important during embryonic development may significantly contribute to tissue repair therapies in adults, and perhaps provide a key to unlocking the potential for true tissue regeneration.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCLOSURE OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</title><p>The authors indicate no potential conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Mark Anderson (UCSF Diabetes center) and Amarjit Dosanjh (SFGH Surgical Lab) for their technical guidance in generating bone marrow chimeras, Marty Bigos and Valerie Stepps (Gladstone Flow Core) for their help with flow cytometry, and Kristin Mooseman for technical assistance.
