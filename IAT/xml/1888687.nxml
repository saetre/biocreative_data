In addition, both PIP<sub>2 </sub>and phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) have been localized to the cleavage furrow of dividing mammalian cells. PLC hydrolyzes PIP<sub>2 </sub>to yield diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), which in turn induces calcium (Ca<sup>2+) </sup>release from the ER. Several studies suggest PIP<sub>2 </sub>must be hydrolyzed continuously for continued cleavage furrow ingression. The majority of these studies employ the N-substituted maleimide U73122 as an inhibitor of PLC. However, the specificity of U73122 is unclear, as its active group closely resembles the non-specific alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). In addition, the pathway by which PIP<sub>2 </sub>regulates cytokinesis remains to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we compared the effects of U73122 and the structurally unrelated PLC inhibitor ET-18-OCH<sub>3 </sub>(edelfosine) on cytokinesis in crane-fly and <italic>Drosophila </italic>spermatocytes. Our data show that the effects of U73122 are indeed via PLC because U73122 and ET-18-OCH<sub>3 </sub>produced similar effects on cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton organization that were distinct from those caused by NEM. Furthermore, treatment with the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) inhibitor ML-7 caused cleavage furrow regression and loss of both F-actin and phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain from the contractile ring in a manner similar to treatment with U73122 and ET-18-OCH<sub>3</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have used multiple inhibitors to examine the roles of PLC and MLCK, a predicted downstream target of PLC regulation, in cytokinesis. Our results are consistent with a model in which PIP<sub>2 </sub>hydrolysis acts via Ca<sup>2+ </sup>to activate myosin via MLCK and thereby control actin dynamics during constriction of the contractile ring.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cell proliferation and growth require the coordination of cell signaling pathways. PLC plays an important role in cell signaling, mediating transduction of signals from a variety of intracellular and extracellular stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. PLC-dependent hydrolysis of PIP<sub>2 </sub>produces the second messengers DAG and IP<sub>3 </sub>(reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). IP<sub>3 </sub>binds specific receptors on the ER to mobilize calcium (Ca<sup>2+) </sup>from internal stores. DAG and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>activate protein kinase C (PKC), which stimulates cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, Ca<sup>2+ </sup>itself facilitates diverse cellular events including membrane trafficking, contractility and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. PLC-dependent pathways thus play key roles in promoting cell growth.</p><p>The synthetic aminosteroid U73122 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) is an important tool in identifying and studying PLC-dependent processes. Initially discovered in a search for inhibitors of platelet activation, U73122 was found to inhibit PLC function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. U73122 causes decreases in IP<sub>3 </sub>and DAG production, calcium levels, and phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover in agonist-stimulated platelets, indicating that U73122 blocks PLC-mediated hydrolysis of PIP<sub>2 </sub>in treated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The mechanism of action of U73122 is currently unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], although an examination of its structure can provide some insight into the biologically active domains of the molecule. The inhibitory activity of U73122 can be reduced by alteration of the C17 side chain or removal of the 3-methoxy group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Substitution of the electrophilic maleimide group of U73122 with the less electrophilic succinimide produces the inactive isomer U73343, which differs from the active form only by the absence of a double bond on the pyrrole ring (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Thus, reactivity appears to reside largely in the NEM moiety of the molecule. NEM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) is a sulfhydryl alkylating agent that covalently modifies cysteine residues, raising the possibility that U73122 acts by a similar mechanism.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Chemical structures of PLC inhibitors and controls</bold>.

In particular, treatment of cells with U73122 resulted in regression of the cleavage furrow and failure of cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The effects of U73122 suggested PIP<sub>2 </sub>hydrolysis is required for normal cytokinesis. Indeed, cytokinesis failed in cells treated with an IP<sub>3 </sub>receptor antagonist or in which intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>was chelated by BAPTA-AM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Perhaps most strikingly, our data indicated that PIP<sub>2 </sub>hydrolysis may be required to maintain F-actin in the contractile ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>U73122 may exert non-specific effects, however, because several lines of evidence suggest that U73122 may affect phosphoinositide cycling or Ca<sup>2+ </sup>levels independent of PLC inhibition. In rabbit platelets, U73122 caused up to 50% reduction in the levels of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) and PIP<sub>2</sub>, but not PI, indicating that U73122 may inhibit both PI and PIP kinases. Although IP<sub>3 </sub>levels were reduced in agonist-stimulated cells, consistent with inhibition of PLC, this may have been an indirect effect of a shortage in substrate availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In U73122-treated mouse fibroblasts and rat neutrophils, inhibition of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx across the plasma membrane contributed to the suppression of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In contrast, U73122 actually increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores in rat pancreatic acinar cells and rat liver microsomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>A second PLC inhibitor, the lysophosphatidylcholine analogue ET-18-OCH<sub>3 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]), is of interest in cancer therapy because of its demonstrated anti-tumor properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. ET-18-OCH<sub>3 </sub>and related compounds inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases and PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and selectively promote tumor cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Like U73122, ET-18-OCH<sub>3 </sub>also has other off-target effects, including release of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>from intracellular stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, unlike U73122, ET-18-OCH<sub>3 </sub>is inserted in the plasma membrane, and its effects may be due in part to alteration of membrane lipid and protein composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In both human histiocytic lymphoma and tumorigenic rat liver cells, ET-18-OCH<sub>3 </sub>inhibits cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>To determine if U73122 inhibits cytokinesis via PLC, we compared the effects of U73122 with those of ET-18-OCH<sub>3 </sub>and NEM. We further examined the role of a potential downstream target of PLC activity, MLCK. We found that inhibition of MLCK perturbed cytokinesis in a manner similar to inhibition of PLC by U73122 and ET-18-OCH<sub>3</sub>. Our results are consistent with a model in which PLC and MLCK act in the same pathway to maintain the integrity of the contractile ring, implicating MLCK as a target of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>regulation in this process.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PLC inhibition causes cleavage furrows to regress</title><p>We previously showed that the PLC inhibitor U73122 caused cleavage furrow regression during cytokinesis in crane-fly and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>spermatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In control cells, cytokinesis was initiated by invagination of the equatorial plasma membrane to form a furrow between the nascent daughter cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, B</xref>) [see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Ingression continued unabated until the cleavage furrow reached a minimum diameter of one to several micrometers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>).

Tubulin was present in spindle and astral microtubules and was organized longitudinally from pole-to-pole (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, A'</xref>). After treatment with U73122, tubulin organization was similar to that of control cells.

Nevertheless, its mechanism of action has yet to be elucidated. In some systems, NEM mimics treatment with U73122 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], raising the possibility that previously reported effects of U73122 were due to alkylation of off-target proteins rather than inhibition of PLC. To obtain such effects with NEM, Horowitz <italic>et al</italic>. treated cells with concentrations of NEM forty-times larger than those used for U73122. The authors suggested that higher concentrations of NEM were required because NEM lacks the lipophilic steroid domain of U73122 that targets the NEM moiety to membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Consistent with their observations, we found that the concentration required for NEM to block cytokinesis in crane-fly spermatocytes was twenty-times greater than the minimum effective concentration of U73122. However, unlike U73122, NEM did not cause regression of the cleavage furrow or redistribution of F-actin to the poles of the cell. In addition, the effect of U73122 on cytokinesis was reversible in crane-fly spermatocytes at the minimum effective concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], whereas the effect of NEM was not. In <italic>Drosophila </italic>spermatocytes, on the other hand, NEM stopped cleavage furrow ingression at a concentration well below the effective concentration of U73122 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suggesting that NEM has more pleiotropic effects. Indeed, NEM treatment resulted in blebbing of the plasma membrane, an effect not seen after treatment with U73122. These observations show that the effects of U73122 are distinct from those of NEM, and suggest that they are due to inhibition of PLC by U73122, although our data do not rule out a mechanism in which U73122 inhibits PLC by alkylation. Effects of other inhibitors strengthen the argument that a PLC-dependent pathway is involved in cytokinesis.</p><p>A second PLC inhibitor, ET-18-OCH<sub>3</sub>, had effects on cytokinesis similar to U73122. ET-18-OCH<sub>3 </sub>is believed to act by inserting into cellular membranes. Like U73122, ET-18-OCH<sub>3 </sub>caused cleavage furrow regression and redistribution of F-actin to the poles of the cell. These inhibitors have two known overlapping cellular effects: inhibition of PLC and release of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>from intracellular stores. In previous experiments using <italic>Drosophila </italic>spermatocytes, we showed that treatments predicted to greatly influence intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>levels had little effect on cytokinesis. Treatment of cells with Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ionophores A23187 or ionomycin did not block cleavage, although they did induce cell contractility and occasional ectopic cell fusion events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In contrast, chelation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>with the cell permeable chelator BAPTA-AM did block cytokinesis, but only when cells were cultured in buffer lacking Ca<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thus, at least <italic>Drosophila </italic>spermatocytes can divide provided they have either an intracellular or an extracellular source of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, rendering it unlikely that any effect of ET-18-OCH<sub>3 </sub>or U73122 on intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>stores would have blocked cytokinesis in these cells. The simplest explanation for the common effect of U73122 and ET-18-O-CH<sub>3 </sub>is that PLC activity is required for cytokinesis.</p><p>The requirement for PLC activity in cytokinesis appears to be conserved. Several mammalian PLC isoforms, PLC&#x003b4;1, PLC&#x003b2;1 and PLC&#x003b4;3, were found to localize to the cleavage furrows of HeLa, NIH3T3 and MDCK cells during cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Moreover, PLC&#x003b3; is tyrosine phosphorylated, and presumably activated, in dividing sea urchin embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. U73122, which blocks cleavage in sea urchin embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and ET-18-OCH<sub>3</sub>, which was originally found to interfere with cytokinesis in transformed cells and tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], were recently found to inhibit cytokinesis in NIH3T3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Although there are currently no genetic studies showing a role for individual PLCs in cytokinesis in any system, this is likely due to redundancy, as most organisms contain multiple PLCs.</p><p>In dividing crane-fly and <italic>Drosophila </italic>spermatocytes, two PLC inhibitors, U73122 and ET-18-OCH<sub>3</sub>, cause cleavage furrow regression ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; this study). Inhibition of PLC would be expected to result in an increase in PIP<sub>2</sub>, concomitant with a decrease in the second messengers DAG and IP<sub>3</sub>. PIP<sub>2 </sub>is required for cytokinesis in <italic>Drosophila </italic>spermatocytes and mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, it is unclear if an increase in PIP<sub>2 </sub>would be deleterious to the cell. On the other hand, inhibition of the IP<sub>3 </sub>receptor with 2-APB or chelation of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>with BAPTA-AM blocked continued cleavage in <italic>Drosophila </italic>spermatocytes and zebrafish embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Furthermore, we previously showed that treatment of spermatocytes with a Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ionophore prevented the cells from responding to U73122, strongly suggesting Ca<sup>2+ </sup>is a key downstream effector of PIP<sub>2 </sub>hydrolysis during cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Effects of the MLCK inhibitor ML-7 confirm this interpretation.</p><p>MLCK, a potential target of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>during cytokinesis, phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chain on Ser-19, and to a lesser extent on Thr-18. This diphosphorylation activates non-muscle myosin II, allowing it to form bipolar thick filaments postulated to constrict F-actin in the contractile ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Although recent experiments have focused on roles for other myosin activating kinases, Rho kinase and citron kinase, in cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], MLCK may also have a crucial role in this process. Indeed, treatment of both crane-fly and <italic>Drosophila </italic>spermatocytes with the MLCK inhibitor ML-7 reversibly blocked cytokinesis ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; this study). Similarly, ML-7 interferes with cytokinesis in sea urchin embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and with maintenance of F-actin in the contractile ring in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Strikingly, ML-7 caused cleavage furrow regression and redistribution of actin filaments in a manner similar to U73122 and ET-18-OCH<sub>3 </sub>(this report). Furthermore, treatment with all three inhibitors caused loss of phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain (phospho-Sqh) from the equator of the cell. Although ML-7 is reported to have other targets <italic>in vitro </italic>(<italic>e.g</italic>., PKA and PKC; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]), the most straightforward interpretation of our results is that all three inhibitors interfere with cytokinesis by blocking MLCK activity, myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation and myosin II contractility.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We showed that two different PLC inhibitors, U73122 and ET-18-OCH<sub>3</sub>, have similar effects on cleavage furrow stability, F-actin localization and myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation, indicating a role for PLC activity in cleavage furrow ingression. Moreover, inhibition of MLCK with ML-7 affects cytokinesis in a similar manner, suggesting that PIP<sub>2 </sub>hydrolysis and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>release stimulate non-muscle myosin II to maintain actin-myosin interactions and stability of the contractile ring.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Live spermatocyte preparation</title><p>Preparation of crane-fly spermatocytes in fibrin clots has been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]; a modified protocol was used to examine <italic>Drosophila </italic>spermatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].
