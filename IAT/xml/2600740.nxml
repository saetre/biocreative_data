Originally, angiogenesis was believed to primarily rely on the expansion of local vascular endothelial (VE) cells; however, the process is much more complicated and involves coordination of vascular cells with fibroblasts, immune cells of blood and tissue origin, and circulating blood components. Numerous studies have demonstrated the involvement of recruited bone marrow (BM)&#x02013;derived cells (BMDCs) in neovascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lyden et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ziegelhoeffer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peters et al., 2005</xref>). Although the identity and origin of these cells remains unclear and somewhat controversial, a role for BMDCs in angiogenesis has been documented by multiple groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khakoo and Finkel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peters et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grunewald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jin et al., 2006</xref>). These BMDCs appear to promote angiogenesis through the release of proangiogenic factors at sites of neovascularization to stimulate expansion of local blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ziegelhoeffer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grunewald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ruiz et al., 2006</xref>). Despite growing evidence depicting a key regulatory role of these cells in angiogenesis, the mechanisms underlying BMDC release, recruitment, and retention at sites of neovascularization are just now beginning to be investigated.</p><p>As in leukocyte adhesion and trafficking, specific key steps of BMDC recruitment are potentially mediated by cell adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eliceiri and Cheresh, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mahabeleshwar et al., 2007</xref>). The primary class of receptors known to mediate cell adhesion to other cells and extracellular matrix are integrins. Although many integrins have been shown to be involved in various aspects of angiogenesis, one of the most intriguing players remains integrin &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carmeliet, 2002</xref>). The vast majority of studies have focused on the regulatory function of endothelial &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> in angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reynolds et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mahabeleshwar et al., 2006</xref>); however, this receptor is also present on a variety of BMDCs. It has been suggested that &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin is a common surface marker for tissue-specific stem cells and its expression was found to be correlated to the properties of quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Umemoto et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>One of the most intriguing aspects of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin function in angiogenesis is the reported discrepancy between the effects of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> inhibitors on pathological angiogenesis and the phenotype of the &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooks et al., 1994a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eliceiri and Cheresh, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reynolds et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taverna et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mahabeleshwar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weis et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, recent studies using &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin knockout mice clearly demonstrate not suppressing but the stimulatory role of &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> on angiogenesis in certain tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanamori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weis et al., 2007</xref>). These studies further emphasize the need to solidify the very complex role of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrins in the regulation of physiological and pathological neovascularization.</p><p>Expression levels of &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> on the surface of myeloid cells were shown to be regulated by cytokines and chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Nichilo and Burns, 1993</xref>). Cytokines and chemokines also play vital roles in the mobilization and homing of BMDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grunewald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ruiz et al., 2006</xref>). Stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1), a CXC chemokine family member, controls numerous homeostatic, developmental, and pathological processes through interaction with its cognate receptor, CXCR4, which is highly expressed by BMDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Epstein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger and Kipps, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ruiz et al., 2006</xref>). Emerging evidence indicates that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis plays a pivotal role in the mobilization of hematopoietic cells from BM into peripheral blood and in dictating positional engraftment of these cells at angiogenic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Orimo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grunewald et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The importance of BMDCs in neovascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Palma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grunewald et al., 2006</xref>), the unique pattern of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin expression and cellular regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandhoke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mahabeleshwar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Umemoto et al., 2006</xref>), and the intriguing, yet controversial, role of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin receptor in angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooks et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eliceiri and Cheresh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reynolds et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taverna et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanamori et al., 2006</xref>) has prompted us to focus on the role of this integrin in the biology of BMDCs in angiogenesis. As a basic experimental model, we used knockin mice (DiYF mice) in which &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin tyrosines 747 and 759 are mutated to phenylalanine. We have previously shown that defective tyrosine phosphorylation of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin in DiYF mice resulted in abnormal &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> function denoted by impaired endothelial cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and tumor angiogenic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mahabeleshwar et al., 2006</xref>). This mutation is not limited to endothelial cells but affects numerous cell types involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, including platelets, leukocytes, and, potentially, other BMDCs. Previous in vitro studies have indicated that Y747 phosphorylation is crucial for &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin function on myeloid cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blystone et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandhoke et al., 2004</xref>). The present study is based on our surprising initial finding that transplantation of wild-type (WT) BM completely rescues angiogenic defects in tumors and wounds of DiYF mice. We have crossed DiYF mice with GFP-expressing transgenic mice to create DiYF/GFP mice as a source of BM to delineate the role of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin in the release and recruitment of BMDCs to sites of angiogenesis. Our analysis revealed that &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin on BMDCs plays a key role in tumor associated pathological angiogenesis as well as in wounds via regulation of BMDC adhesion and transmigration into sites of neovascularization, but not their release from the bone niche.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>BM transplantation (BMT) restores normal tumor growth and wound healing in DiYF mice</title><p>We have previously shown that endothelial cell function and angiogenesis are impaired in DiYF mice. In this study, we investigate the role of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin in BMDC recruitment to sites of neovascularization. To this end, we performed a series of BMT and assessed the role of BM in angiogenesis-dependent responses, i.e., tumor growth and wound healing.</p><p>In accord with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mahabeleshwar et al., 2006</xref>), the growth of implanted B16F10 melanoma was reduced about twofold in DiYF mice compared with WT counterparts. Transplantation of WT BM into irradiated DiYF hosts (WT&#x02192;DiYF) normalized tumor growth to that of control WT mice receiving WT marrow (WT&#x02192;WT; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). These results were corroborated using murine RM1 prostate carcinoma cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Alternatively, transplantation of DiYF BM into irradiated WT hosts (DiYF&#x02192;WT) resulted in stunted B16F10 and RM1 tumor growth, a difference similar to that observed in mice not undergoing BMT. These data suggest that reduced tumor growth in DiYF mice is at least partially a consequence of altered BMDC &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin function.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Reduced tumor growth and delayed wound healing in DiYF mice are BM dependent.</bold> (A) Weights of subcutaneous B16F10 tumors in WT and DiYF mice (11 d after implantation) or mice undergoing BMT (13 d) with WT or DiYF donor marrow.

By analyzing wound closure, we found diYF mice displayed an early (3&#x02013;7 d) wound healing delay (extent of closure) and extended time to complete closure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, top). Whereas reconstitution of DiYF mice with WT BM restored the wound healing process, transplantation of DiYF BM into WT mice reduced the extent of wound closure 3 d after surgery compared with WT mice with WT BM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, bottom). Gross inspection of healing wounds illuminated an angiogenic defect as the potential causative factor in the delay exhibited by DiYF mice, a condition corrected by BMT with WT marrow. These data demonstrated that impaired tumor growth and wound healing in DiYF mice are a consequence of altered &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin function of BMDCs and not of local remodeling tissues and that BM reconstitution may reverse such angiogenic defects.</p></sec><sec><title>DiYF angiogenic defects are reversed in mice transplanted with normal BM</title><p>Having previously reported angiogenic defects in implanted tumors of DiYF mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mahabeleshwar et al., 2006</xref>), we further investigated the phenotype of these defects and whether they were BM dependent. Histological examination of B16F10 and RM1 tumor, as well as wound sections, illuminates this angiogenic defect (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802179/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802179/DC1</ext-link>). Double staining of B16F10 tumor sections with the endothelial cell marker CD31 and the pericyte marker neuro/glial cell 2 chondroitin proteoglycan (NG2) revealed a substantial (greater than threefold) decrease in both CD31- and NG2-positive blood vessel densities in tumors of DiYF hosts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Total VE cell and pericytes positive areas in tumor tissues were also decreased (by 55 and 45%, respectively) in DiYF hosts (Fig. S1 B, top left) with no accompanying differences in blood vessel size (Fig. S1 B, top right). Colocalization of endothelial cells and pericytes in tumor vasculature revealed no morphological differences between B16F10 tumor sections regardless of host genotype. A reduction in the basement membrane protein laminin was also evident in tumors of DiYF hosts (Fig. S1 B, middle left). In addition, smooth muscle actin (SMA), a myofibroblast and adult smooth muscle pericyte marker, exhibited a fourfold decrease in DiYF B16F10 tumor sections compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a decrease in von Willebrand factor vessel density (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>) and area (Fig. S1 B, bottom) in DiYF mice wound tissues compared with WT mice. Reduced staining for these vascular markers has previously been shown in RM1 tumor sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mahabeleshwar et al., 2006</xref>) and is consistent with that of healing wounds of DiYF mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref> and Fig. S1 B, middle right) as well.

This was confirmed immunohistochemically by double staining B16F10 tumor sections with anti-CD31 and -NG2 antibodies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref> and Fig. S1 D). The density of SMA-positive vessels in tumor sections of WT marrow recipient DiYF mice was similar to that of WT mice receiving WT marrow (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Conversely, we performed BMT wherein WT BM was reconstituted with DiYF marrow. Although immunohistochemical analysis of B16F10 tumor sections in these mice revealed no statistically significant difference in blood vessel density (Fig. S1 E), transplantation of DiYF BM into WT mice caused a reduction in blood vessel and pericyte area compared with WT mice receiving WT BM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). SMA-positive vessel densities in tumor sections of DiYF&#x02192;WT mice were also reduced by &#x0003e;40% compared with WT&#x02192;WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>). Thus, transplantation of DiYF BM into WT mice yields tumor angiogenic defects as well. These data therefore indicate that &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin function of BM cells plays a key role in angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Platelet defects are not causative in the DiYF angiogenic defect</title><p>Because the DiYF mutation affects &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> signaling and platelet-dependent responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Law et al., 1999</xref>), we next assessed to what extent, if any, that platelets contribute to the abnormal angiogenesis exhibited by DiYF mice. Using an anti-mouse GPIb&#x003b1; antibody, platelets were depleted in both WT and DiYF mice causing a &#x0003e;90% reduction in circulating platelets compared with control IgG. This reduced platelet level was maintained during the entire experiment through repeated antibody treatment. Although platelet depletion resulted in a reduction of tumor growth in both WT and DIYF mice, tumors in platelet-depleted WT hosts were &#x0223c;70% larger than those formed in DiYF counterparts (0.323 &#x000b1; 0.034 vs. 0.191 &#x000b1; 0.051 g, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10, P &#x0003c; 0.05), a difference paralleling that of nondepleted WT and DiYF mice (0.493 &#x000b1; 0.051 vs. 0.346 &#x000b1; 0.046 g, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10, P &#x0003c; 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections with laminin revealed that the difference in tumor vascular density between WT and DiYF mice remained after platelet depletion (unpublished data), a difference similar to that of WT and DiYF mice. Thus, although platelets are indeed important for tumor progression and angiogenesis, impaired platelet function is not the predominant contributor to altered tumor progression in DiYF mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment of DiYF BMDCs to sites of neovascularization is impaired</title><p>Because BMT rescued the angiogenic phenotype of DiYF mice, we next assessed whether recruitment of BMDCs into the developing vasculature was defective in these mice. To monitor the extent of BMDC recruitment, DiYF mice were crossed with GFP-expressing transgenic WT (WT/GFP) mice. The resultant DiYF/GFP and normal WT/GFP mice were used as donors for BMT experiments. In brief, WT/GFP marrow was transplanted into WT mice (WT/GFP&#x02192;WT) and DiYF mice (WT/GFP&#x02192;DiYF) and WT marrow was reconstituted with donor DiYF/GFP marrow (DiYF/GFP&#x02192;WT). More than 80% of nucleated cells and 95% of platelets in blood expressed GFP 8 wk after BMT.</p><p>Analysis of B16F10 tumors formed in chimeric mice revealed large numbers of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells located within the tumor periphery and in the vicinity of tumor vasculature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell numbers were elevated in WT/GFP&#x02192;WT and WT/GFP&#x02192;DiYF mice compared with those from DiYF/GFP&#x02192;WT mice (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802179/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802179/DC1</ext-link>).

These findings were confirmed by assessing infiltration of BMDCs into healing wounds 7 d after wound initiation. As shown previously (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, bottom right), histological analysis of wound tissues at this time point revealed almost complete wound closure and vascular similarities in WT and DiFY mice. Similar to our tumor model, recruitment of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells to wound tissues was impaired in DiYF/GFP&#x02192;WT mice compared with mice receiving WT/GFP marrow regardless of genotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>).

The present study was initiated as a result of a preliminary finding wherein transplantation of WT BM completely rescued defective angiogenesis in DiYF mice. The findings presented in this paper are depicted in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> with the key points summarized as follows. The course of tumor- and wound-associated angiogenic responses are dependent on BM cell &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin function and not resident host tissue. Defects in platelet function stemming from the DiYF mutation are not causative of the angiogenic defects displayed by DiYF mice. The recruitment of DiYF BMDCs to sites of neovascularization is compromised compared with that of WT BMDCs. The majority of recruited BMDCs are negative for endothelial or smooth muscle cell markers, but appear to express CD45, Gr1, CD3, and CXCR4, indicating the hematopoietic origin of these cells. SDF-1 levels are reduced in tumors grown in DiYF mice compared with WT, a condition corrected by BMT. Impaired &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin activity has little effect on the process of BMDC release into the circulation; however, DiYF CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> BMDCs exhibit defective adhesion and transmigration through endothelial monolayers compared with WT counterparts. These data indicate that &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin activity on circulating CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> BMDCs, but not &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin on resident endothelial cells or platelets, plays a governing role in angiogenesis through regulating BMDC recruitment to angiogenic sites and adherence to and transmigration through endothelium.</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Model depicting steps in the angiogenic process affected by defective &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin as exemplified by the DiYF mouse.</bold> Although impaired &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> function in the DiYF mouse does not affect the mobilization of BMDCs from the BM niche, it weakens adhesion and decreases migration functions, which, in turn, reduce the overall recruitment and retention of BMDCs, resulting in elevated levels of circulating CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> BMDCs. This leads to dampened vascular sprouting and an inhibition of angiogenesis. Defective endothelial cell function in DiYF mice appears to play a recessive role in this process. Low levels of SDF-1, a result of this angiogenic defect, further potentiate the reduced recruitment and retention of CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1831145f08"></graphic></fig><p>A definitive role for &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin in the regulation of angiogenesis remains elusive. Conflicting data regarding &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin's role in the development of neovasculature have been reported. Although &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> inhibitors define a proangiogenic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooks et al., 1994a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">b</xref>), studies using &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> knockout mice suggest negative regulatory angiogenic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reynolds et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, increased tumor vascularization and tumor growth in &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>-null mice could be reversed by marrow repopulation with WT donor marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taverna et al., 2004</xref>), thus implicating BM as a key factor in the neovascularization processes. Although the impaired angiogenesis exhibited by DiYF knockin mice alludes to a proangiogenic role for &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin in angiogenic responses similar to that described using inhibitors of &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>, this impairment can be rescued through BMT with WT marrow, a response mirrored in &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> knockout mice.</p><p>Thus, results of both &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> knockin and knockout models suggest pathological angiogenesis is dependent on the function of this integrin on BM cells rather than residential endothelium. Because both knockout and knockin of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin are known to affect the function of platelet &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>, an obvious explanation for the results of BMT studies would be the regulatory role of platelet &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> in angiogenesis. Indeed, platelets were recently shown to regulate pathological vascularization in certain models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brill et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Italiano et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, thrombocytopenia, as well as the inhibition of platelet aggregation by a highly specific &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin antagonist, resulted in a reduction of retinal neovascularization in a hypoxia-induced mouse model of angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rhee et al., 2004</xref>). Considering these data, impaired platelet functions of DiYF mice should elicit angiogenic defects and stunted tumor growth, both of which should be capable of being abrogated or reduced through the depletion of circulating platelets. Platelet depletion reduced the angiogenic response in both WT and DiYF mice; however, the absence of circulating platelets failed to normalize the angiogenic and tumor growth differences between WT and DiYF mice. Thus, it appears that platelets are not solely responsible for the effects of BMT. This finding is in agreement with prior work suggesting that &#x003b1;<sub>IIb</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> inhibitors fail to modify blood vessel development or platelet&#x02013;tumor interactions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brill et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kisucka et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, in DiYF mice there is a functional defect in other types of BMDCs that substantially contribute to the angiogenic phenotype.</p><p>Our results using BMT of GFP-expressing WT and DiYF mice revealed recruitment deficiencies of DiYF BMDCs in comparison to WT BMDCs. Several recent studies have demonstrated stimulatory roles for BMDCs in angiogenic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Palma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Orimo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grunewald et al., 2006</xref>), potentially explaining the overall reduced angiogenic response observed in DiYF mice.

With little to no recruited BMDCs displaying endothelial or pericyte characteristics, results from our model suggest a more supporting, paracrine-like function of BMDCs in angiogenesis. At the same time, we observed that the majority of recruited BMDCs appear to be of hematopoietic origin as they express CD45, F4/80, CD3, and Gr1. Similar papers by others emphasize the role of hematopoietic cells in angiogenic in vivo models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ziegelhoeffer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grunewald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jin et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, we, along with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grunewald et al., 2006</xref>), have found that CXCR4 appears to be a marker expressed on the vast majority of recruited BMDCs. Therefore, in our model, BMDCs have a prominent stimulatory role in neovascularization without direct incorporation into blood vessels. Moreover, the functional activity of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin on BMDCs is crucial for their recruitment.</p><p>Because BMDC recruitment to neovascularizing sites is a multistep process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lindbom and Werr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grunewald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamagna and Bergers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vestweber, 2007</xref>), we assessed whether impaired activity of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin influences the process of BMDC release from the BM niche into the circulation. The latter process is known to be triggered by angiogenic factors produced by injured tissues and tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hattori et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lindbom and Werr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grunewald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kopp et al., 2006</xref>). &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin is crucial for osteoclast-mediated bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>), which, in turn, contributes to the release of cells from the BM niche into blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kollet et al., 2006</xref>). However, similar to the experiments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al. (2005)</xref>, we observed no major differences in bone resorptive function of tumor-bearing WT and DiYF mice, indicating that the DiYF mutation does not impair &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin activity on osteoclasts. Thus, even though DiYF mice exhibited higher numbers of circulating CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> BMDCs compared with WT, it appears that &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin activity affects not the release of CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from BM, but rather their recruitment from the circulation into tissues. Vascular walls present a barrier to circulating cells for relocating from the blood stream to sites of angiogenesis. The recruitment of BMDCs into surrounding tissues involves sequential interactions with endothelium and extravascular tissue components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lindbom and Werr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schenkel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Millan et al., 2006</xref>). First, transmigrating BMDCs need to establish transient and dynamic adhesive contacts with endothelium. Previous studies have shown that &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin serves as a heterotypic ligand for CD31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckley et al., 1996</xref>), a molecular marker for endothelial cells, and controls the arrest and extravasation of hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lindbom and Werr, 2002</xref>). Moreover, &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin on monocytes, neutrophils, and other leukocyte subsets plays a key role in the transition between tight adhesion to the VE and subsequent diapedesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weerasinghe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lindbom and Werr, 2002</xref>). Our previous study demonstrated that the DiYF mutation impairs adhesion and migration of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mahabeleshwar et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we found that this mutation affected the ability of BM-derived CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells to adhere to and transmigrate through an endothelial monolayer. Therefore, functional activity of &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin is crucial for the adhesion and transmigration of BMDCs at sites of neovascularization, which, in turn, is crucial for the angiogenesis-dependent responses of tumor growth and wound healing.</p><p>Angiogenic factors released by peripheral tissues promote mobilization of BMDCs, especially CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells from the BM niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hattori et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hiratsuka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grunewald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kopp et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, our data showed higher CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell numbers in the circulating blood of both tumor-bearing WT and DiYF mice compared with nontumor-bearing mice. SDF-1, along with its receptor CXCR4, is a key chemoattractant for hematopoietic progenitor/stem cell mobilization, trafficking, recruitment, and retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petit et al., 2007</xref>). As perivascular cells, these recruited CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> hematopoietic cells promote and stabilize neovessels by releasing angiogenic factors and providing physical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petit et al., 2007</xref>). In fact, defective vascularization was noted in SDF-1 or CXCR4 knockout embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ara et al., 2005</xref>). In our model, all of the vasculature-associated BMDCs were CXCR4 positive, indicating that these cells were recruited by its ligand, SDF-1. Elevated plasma SDF-1 levels stimulates CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> BMDC mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hattori et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heissig et al., 2002</xref>). We did not find any notable differences in plasma SDF-1 levels in WT or DiYF mice. Other factors associated with BMDC mobilization and osteoclast function, such as BM resident MMP-2 and MMP-9 or serum TRAcP levels, were also found to be similar in WT and DiYF mice. However, increased blood CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell numbers were observed in DiYF or tumor-bearing DiYF mice compared with WT or tumor-bearing WT mice. Therefore, decreased recruitment of BMDCs into tissues and defective adhesive and migratory capacities and hence retention of DiYF CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> BMDCs were causal in the increased levels of circulating CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CXCR4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin&#x02013;defective DiYF or tumor-bearing DiYF mice. Interestingly, we found that the levels of SDF-1 in tumors from DiYF mice were lower than tumor-bearing WT mice. The major source of SDF-1 in peripheral tissues are VE cells, epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, and SMA-positive myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fedyk et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Orimo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ruiz et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, in our model, defective recruitment of BMDCs and impaired angiogenesis were accompanied by reduced SDF-1 expression, which, in turn, further augmented the angiogenic defect in DiYF mice. Transplantation of WT BM restored these defects, including SDF-1 levels, in DiYF mice.</p><p>In sum, this study establishes a new role for &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> integrin in the regulation of angiogenesis, one that may influence not only the interpretations of numerous preclinical studies using &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> inhibitors but also the development of new anti- as well as proangiogenic strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>8&#x02013;12-wk-old WT or DiYF mice were on a C57BL/6 background as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Law et al., 1999</xref>).
