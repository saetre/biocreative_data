We have previously shown that these interactions require the &#x003b3;-tubulin targeting factor GCP-WD/NEDD1, which has an essential role in spindle formation. The recruitment of additional &#x003b3;-tubulin to the centrosomes occurs during centrosome maturation at the G2/M transition and is regulated by the mitotic kinase Plk1. However, the molecular details of this important pathway are unknown and a Plk1 substrate that controls &#x003b3;-tubulin recruitment has not been identified. Here we show that Plk1 associates with GCP-WD in mitosis and Plk1 activity contributes to phosphorylation of GCP-WD. Plk1 depletion or inhibition prevents accumulation of GCP-WD at mitotic centrosomes, but GCP-WD mutants that are defective in Plk1-binding and -phosphorylation still accumulate at mitotic centrosomes and recruit &#x003b3;-tubulin. Moreover, Plk1 also controls the recruitment of other PCM proteins implicated in centrosomal &#x003b3;-tubulin attachment (Cep192/hSPD2, pericentrin, Cep215/Cdk5Rap2). Our results support a model in which Plk1-dependent recruitment of &#x003b3;-tubulin to mitotic centrosomes is regulated upstream of GCP-WD, involves multiple PCM proteins and therefore potentially multiple Plk1 substrates.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mitosis centrosomal and non-centrosomal microtubule nucleation pathways contribute to the formation of the bipolar spindle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Wiese1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Clarke1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In late G2 cells prepare for mitosis and increase size and microtubule nucleating activity of the duplicated centrosomes.

This process, also termed centrosome maturation, is critical for the function of centrosomes as microtubule organizing centers in mitosis, and depends on the activity of mitotic kinases such as Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Barr1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Interfering with Plk1 function by RNAi or specific inhibitors prevents the recruitment of &#x003b3;-tubulin to mitotic centrosomes and inhibits the centrosomal microtubule nucleation pathway. Moreover, similar to &#x003b3;-tubulin depletion or mislocalization, suppression of Plk1 activity causes loss of centrosome separation and formation of monopolar spindles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Lane1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Lenart1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. To date, a Plk1 substrate that controls &#x003b3;-tubulin recruitment in a phosphorylation-dependent manner has not been identified.</p><p>The &#x003b3;-tubulin ring complex (&#x003b3;TuRC) is a large, multisubunit protein complex consisting of multiple copies of &#x003b3;-tubulin and at least 6 additional proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Wiese1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-RaynaudMessina1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Several centrosome proteins have been suggested to attach the &#x003b3;TuRC to the PCM of the centrosome including the recently identified &#x003b3;TuRC component GCP-WD/NEDD1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Luders2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Haren1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. GCP-WD is specifically required for the localization of &#x003b3;-tubulin to centrosomes in interphase and mitosis, but not for the localization of other PCM proteins. It behaves like a true &#x003b3;TuRC subunit but does not require the &#x003b3;TuRC for localization to the centrosome. Its unique properties suggest that it is the attachment factor most proximal to the &#x003b3;TuRC. In addition to centrosomal attachment GCP-WD mediates the interaction of the &#x003b3;TuRC with the mitotic spindle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Luders2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Haren1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Spindle localization of &#x003b3;TuRCs requires phosphorylation of GCP-WD at serine 418 and contributes to proper spindle assembly, possibly by nucleation of additional microtubules within the spindle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Luders2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutation of serine 418 to alanine abolishes spindle localization of GCP-WD and of &#x003b3;-tubulin without affecting their accumulation at mitotic centrosomes. GCP-WD phosphorylation promotes interaction with the augmin complex, which was recently shown to be required for the spindle localization of the &#x003b3;TuRC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Goshima1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Lawo1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

A similar staining pattern can be observed in rare monopolar spindles in untreated cells (data not shown). Plk1 inhibition also impaired this localization of &#x003b3;-tubulin to spindle microtubules. Spindle-associated &#x003b3;-tubulin was often undetectable or, in cells with more &#x003b3;-tubulin remaining at the centrosome, was confined to a region close to the spindle monopole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005976-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, bottom). We tested whether &#x003b3;-tubulin mislocalization after Plk1 inhibition resulted from the loss of the targeting factor GCP-WD from centrosomes and spindle microtubules by probing with GCP-WD-specific antibodies. Indeed, GCP-WD localization to these structures was strongly reduced in cells treated with the Plk1 inhibitor or depleted of Plk1 compared to monastrol-treated cells (&#x0003e;90&#x00025; reduction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005976-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).

GCP-WD also interacted with transiently expressed myc-tagged Plk1 immunoprecipitated from asynchronously growing cells. In this case the phosphorylated form of GCP-WD preferentially coprecipitated with the kinase as revealed by phosphatase treatment after immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005976-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). We identified the Plk1-binding region in GCP-WD by coexpression of Myc-tagged Plk1 with EGFP-tagged GCP-WD fragments followed by immunoprecipitation. In this assay Myc-Plk1 did not interact with the WD40 repeat-containing N-terminal half of GCP-WD (data not shown). The C-terminal half of GCP-WD (C300) was sufficient for the interaction with Plk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005976-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).

Remarkably, the S418A mutation abolished interaction with Plk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005976-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Serine 418 and adjacent residues do not match the consensus of a polo box docking site, however phosphorylation of serine 418 might trigger subsequent phosphorylation of a polo box binding site elsewhere in the molecule, which would prime it for Plk1 binding. Consistent with this model, deletion of the last 121 amino acids (aa 546&#x02013;667) from the C-terminal half of GCP-WD, which does not include serine 418, also abolished Plk1 binding (data not shown). We tested whether a consensus polo box binding motif surrounding threonine 557 is involved in Plk1 binding. Mutation of threonine 557 to alanine abolished interaction with Plk1, whereas mutation of two nearby serine residues in the conserved C-terminus of GCP-WD (S565A and S573A) had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005976-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). These results suggest that GCP-WD contains a phosphorylation-dependent Plk1 docking site.

Inhibition of Plk1 completely abolished phosphorylation, suggesting that coprecipitated endogenous Plk1 was responsible for this activity. The S418A and T557A mutants were not efficiently phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005976-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Full length EGFP-tagged GCP-WD and the T557A mutant were expressed in cells and their phosphorylation state in mitotic extracts analyzed by western blotting. Compared to the wild type protein, the T557A mutant showed a slightly reduced mobility in high resolution SDS-PAGE, similar to the shift in mobility seen for endogenous GCP-WD after Plk1 inhibition (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005976-g002">Fig. 2F</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005976-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Plk1 inhibition did not further reduce the mobility of the T557A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005976-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). Together these results suggest that phosphorylation of GCP-WD at serine 418 is required for subsequent phosphorylation at other sites, including threonine 557. This promotes association with Plk1 and additional phosphorylation of GCP-WD.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Mutation of the Plk1 binding and phosphorylation sites in GCP-WD does not affect centrosome targeting of GCP-WD</title><p>Plk1 might control &#x003b3;-tubulin targeting to mitotic centrosomes through phosphorylation of GCP-WD. One possibility is that phosphorylation of GCP-WD by Plk1 controls its interaction with the &#x003b3;TuRC. However, sucrose gradient analysis of interphase and mitotic cell extract as well as phosphatase-treated extract indicated that cofractionation of GCP-WD with the &#x003b3;TuRC is independent of its phosphorylation state (data not shown). Alternatively, phosphorylation of GCP-WD by Plk1 might regulate its interaction with the centrosome. To test this hypothesis we constructed RNAi-resistant, EGFP-tagged GCP-WD and a series of mutants carrying alanine mutations in either Plk1 binding (S418A, T557A) or Plk1 consensus phosphorylation motifs (S433A, T487A, S433A/T487A double mutant). These proteins were expressed in cells depleted of endogenous GCP-WD by RNAi. With the exception of the S418A mutant, all other mutants localized to centrosomes and to spindle microtubules, and supported the targeting of &#x003b3;-tubulin to these structures, similar to the wild type protein. In addition, cells expressing these mutants had no obvious defect in bipolar spindle formation and chromosome segregation (data not shown). The S418A mutation interfered with spindle targeting but did not cause any defect in the accumulation of GCP-WD and &#x003b3;-tubulin at mitotic centrosomes, confirming our previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Luders2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005976-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

Plk1 inhibition also prevented localization of tagged wild type GCP-WD to spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005976-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).

A longstanding goal in the analysis of this pathway has been the identification of a Plk1 substrate that regulates this process. Our results suggest that Plk1 regulates &#x003b3;-tubulin recruitment to mitotic centrosomes by controlling the centrosomal levels of the &#x003b3;-tubulin targeting factor GCP-WD, and that GCP-WD itself is a Plk1 substrate. However, by analyzing GCP-WD mutations that disrupt interaction with Plk1 (S418A, T557A) and mutations in potential Plk1 phosphorylation sites (S433A, T487A) we find no evidence for defects in centrosome targeting.</p><p>What is the role Plk1 in the regulation of GCP-WD? One possibility is that Plk1 regulates the interaction of GCP-WD with the mitotic spindle, which depends on phosphorylation of serine S418 and is critical for spindle-targeting of the &#x003b3;TuRC and the formation of additional microtubules within the spindle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Luders2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Might Plk1 be responsible for serine 418 phosphorylation? We consider this unlikely because serine 418 does not correspond to a Plk1 consensus phosphorylation site, and because the S418A mutation strongly reduces the global phosphorylation of GCP-WD, whereas Plk1 inhibition has only mild effects (as judged by changes in GCP-WD mobility in SDS-PAGE). However, serine 418 phosphorylation could promote additional phosphorylation by Plk1 at a different site, which could contribute to the interaction of GCP-WD with the spindle. This is supported by our observation that Plk1 inhibition not only prevents accumulation of GCP-WD and &#x003b3;-tubulin at centrosomes, but also reduces their spindle localization. This would impair microtubule formation within the spindle and could contribute to the defects in kinetochore fiber assembly after Plk1 inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Sumara1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Peters1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our results for the T557A mutant, which is defective in Plk1-binding and phosphorylation but does not show any localization defects, suggest that regulation of GCP-WD by Plk1 is not essential for spindle localization of &#x003b3;TuRCs. Instead, Plk1 might regulate the augmin complex, which mediates spindle interaction of GCP-WD/&#x003b3;TuRC without affecting centrosome targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Goshima1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Zhu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

One of these proteins, Cep192, has recently been shown to function upstream of GCP-WD in centrosome targeting of &#x003b3;-tubulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-GomezFerreria1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Zhu2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Cep192 is also required for the recruitment of pericentrin to mitotic centrosomes. These results indicate that at least one Plk1-dependent step in &#x003b3;TuRC recruitment takes place upstream of GCP-WD and might promote the recruitment of other &#x003b3;TuRC attachment factors. Several lines of evidence suggest that &#x003b3;TuRC recruitment to mitotic centrosomes might not follow a simple pathway based on a single adaptor protein, but rather be the result of complex interactions between several PCM proteins. For example, pericentrin has been suggested to directly interact with &#x003b3;TuRC subunits and recruit &#x003b3;TuRCs to mitotic centrosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Zimmerman1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Dictenberg1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, but compared to Cep192 the depletion of pericentrin causes only a moderate loss of centrosomal &#x003b3;-tubulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005976-GomezFerreria1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>(this study).

Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope using Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.) or on a Leica DMI6000B microscope using AF6000 software (Leica). Fluorescence intensities at centrosomes were quantified on images acquired under constant exposure for each antigen. For quantification signal intensities in a circular area of 2 &#x000b5;m diameter surrounding each centrosome were measured using Axiovision, AF6000 and ImageJ software. An adjacent area of the same dimensions within each cell was quantified and subtracted as background.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Andreas Merdes for supporting this work and for critical reading and comments on the manuscript.
