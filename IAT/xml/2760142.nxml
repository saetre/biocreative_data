The genesis of their pleiotropic phenotypes is, however, poorly understood. We provide evidence that neither distorted depositions of cutin, nor deficiencies in the chemical composition of cuticular lipids, account for these features, instead suggesting that the mutants alleviate the functional disorder of the cuticle by reinforcing their defenses. To better understand how plants adapt to these mutations, we performed a genome-wide gene expression analysis. We found that apparent compensatory transcriptional responses in these mutants involve the induction of wax, cutin, cell wall, and defense genes. To gain greater insight into the mechanism by which cuticular mutations trigger this response in the plants, we performed an overlap meta-analysis, which is termed MASTA (MicroArray overlap Search Tool and Analysis), of differentially expressed genes. This suggested that different cell integrity pathways are recruited in <italic>cesA</italic> cellulose synthase and cuticular mutants. Using MASTA for an <italic>in silico</italic> suppressor/enhancer screen, we identified <italic>SERRATE</italic> (<italic>SE</italic>), which encodes a protein of RNA&#x02013;processing multi-protein complexes, as a likely enhancer. In confirmation of this notion, the <italic>se lcr</italic> and <italic>se bdg</italic> double mutants eradicate severe leaf deformations as well as the organ fusions that are typical of <italic>lcr</italic> and <italic>bdg</italic> and other cuticular mutants. Also, <italic>lcr</italic> does not confer resistance to <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> in a <italic>se</italic> mutant background. We propose that there is a role for SERRATE-mediated RNA signaling in the cuticle integrity pathway.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>As the skin of a plant, the epidermis mediates a broad set of protective functions which includes defense against abiotic environmental stresses and pathogens. The majority of its barrier capacity is localized to the outermost cell wall, which is covered by a waxy cuticle. Several distinct cuticular mutants in the model plant Arabidopsis produce a remarkable syndrome that is characterized by ectopic cell adhesion and changes in plant morphology. We used these mutants to study the constitution of the cuticle and the activation of the molecular compensatory mechanisms that are important for adaptation. We examined whole-genome responses in these mutants and used an appropriate statistical procedure to reveal the genes which change their expression. We then applied the same approach to the analysis of hundreds of datasets in repositories. The comparison of gene expression profiles identified the gene <italic>SERRATE</italic>, which encodes a protein of RNA&#x02013;processing multi-protein complexes, and further analysis revealed that the syndrome is suppressed in double mutants, as predicted. Our finding suggests that the mechanism which operates to control the integrity of the cuticle involves the regulation of small&#x02013;RNA signaling.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to maintain the barrier properties of the epidermis, which covers the aerial surface of higher plants, is largely due to their outermost cell walls which are impregnated and covered with specialized lipids. The fine structure and composition of this complex layer, called the cuticle, has been the subject of numerous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000703-Jeffree1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000703-Jeffree2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The innermost periclinal layer of the cuticle is, in fact, a cutinized portion of the epidermal cell wall, in which cell wall polysaccharides are perhaps cross-linked to phenolics and aliphatic components of the cutin. The presence of phenolics, which may contribute to the barrier function, is evident in this layer through fluorescence microscopy and chemical analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000703-Markham1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Under transmission electron microscopy, however, this cutinized layer of the cell wall is often heterogeneous in appearance and penetrated by tufts of fibrillar material, or is sometimes barely visible. This is in contrast to the opaque stripe of the continuous cuticle proper which, at a higher resolution, often appears to be finely lamellated; it is composed of polyester cutin and non-hydrolyzable polymer cutan and is, essentially, free of cell wall polysaccharides. In the early stages, in particular, it may have a pectinaceous under-layer. Wax forms the outermost structural layer, although a certain amount of it (intracuticular wax) permeates the interior of the cuticle. Individual plant species display some variations of this standard pattern.</p><p>Waxes and cutin represent two groups of cuticular lipids that are supposed to be primarily responsible for the barrier function of the plant epidermis. The structural, biochemical, biophysical and molecular genetic aspects of cuticular lipids and their role in the defense against pathogens have been reviewed elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000703-Jeffree2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000703-Pollard1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000703-ReinaPinto1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Plant growth and development demand that the cuticle changes continuously and also maintains the balance between rigidity and flexibility. During the early stages of epidermal development, cells are covered with osmiophilic amorphous procuticle, but the lamellar structure of the cuticle proper and the reticulate fibrillar pattern of the cutinized portion of the cell wall may become distinguishable as the cuticle forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000703-Jeffree2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Chemical and structural changes in the cuticle may be beneficial, both in terms of the adaptation to fluctuating environmental conditions and in response to various stresses. However, this view of the cuticle as a dynamic structure has yet to be supported by extensive data.</p><p>Recent molecular, genetic studies of cuticular mutants have lead to the identification and characterization of a number of genes involved in various aspects of cuticle formation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000703-Nawrath1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000703-Kunst1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000703-Yephremov1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000703-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>A group of Arabidopsis mutants, including <italic>fiddlehead</italic> (<italic>fdh</italic>), <italic>lacerata</italic> (<italic>lcr</italic>) and <italic>bodyguard</italic> (<italic>bdg</italic>), which are thought to be defective in the biosynthesis of cuticular polyesters, reveals secondary phenotypes which include drastic changes in cell differentiation, plant architecture, organ morphology, pathogen resistance and other elements.

This experimental design should minimize the inter-dependence between mutant versus wild type group differences. One would also expect statistical power to increase as the number of replicates goes from three to nine for the mutant group. By using the same parameter settings in the Rank Product method, and the same pfp cut-off value, we obtained a list of 744 upregulated DEGs. Compared to the 87 commonly upregulated genes which were identified with the first approach, many more candidates were detected by Rank Product this time, suggesting that the actual number of genes discriminating between the three cuticular mutants and wild type is higher. However, 74 (85&#x00025;) of these 87 genes were found in the overlap with the top-87 gene list from the second approach. A comparison of gene ranking also reveals that there is a significant consensus between the lists obtained by the two approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Verification of microarray hybridization by semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization</title><p>To further corroborate our results, we sought to first demonstrate by semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR that the selected genes are, in fact, up or downregulated as predicted by the microarrays. We have chosen 12 candidate genes from among those which are commonly upregulated in the three mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000703.s008">Table S3</xref>), as well as two genes which were not included in this list. The first was <italic>CER1</italic>, which is thought to be directly involved in wax biosynthesis, although its enzymic function remains unknown; the other was a <italic>RAP2.6</italic>-like gene (<italic>RAP2.6L</italic>) which encodes an AP2/EREBP domain protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000703.s011">Text S1</xref>). <italic>RAP2.6L</italic> was one of the genes which appeared to be upregulated, but did not meet the criteria because one of its pfp values was slightly above the 0.05 cut-off (0.052). From the microarray hybridization analysis, we estimated that the selected genes were upregulated in the range of 3 to 172-fold in the mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000703.s008">Table S3</xref>).</p><p>The results of semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR assays, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000703-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, indicated that all selected genes were consistently upregulated in the mutants. Interestingly, one can also observe a correlation between the genes that are strongly upregulated in both assays (namely the microarray and the semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR) with the <italic>LTPs</italic>, <italic>PPT</italic>, <italic>RAP2.6</italic> and <italic>DAISY</italic> genes which display the most distinct expression between mutants and wild type. However, we did not aim to quantitatively evaluate gene expression measurements, or compare respective fold changes which would have required the use of real-time, quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR.</p><p>One of the genes which was found to be highly up-regulated in the leaves of all three mutants (in <italic>lcr</italic> 5.8-fold, in <italic>fdh</italic> 11.7-fold and in <italic>bdg</italic> 9.0-fold, as revealed by microarrays) was <italic>DAISY</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000703-t001">Table 1</xref>). It was shown to encode a KCS which is involved in the biosynthesis of aliphatic suberin in roots. The roots of the <italic>daisy</italic> mutant accumulate significantly less C22 and C24 very-long-chain fatty acid derivatives in suberin, suggesting that it functions as a docosanoic acid synthase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000703-Franke2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. The RT&#x02013;PCR analysis and promoter-GUS fusions revealed that it was also expressed in various aerial organs of the plant, although its expression levels in leaves were very low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000703-Franke2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. While <italic>DAISY</italic> was almost undetectable in unwounded rosette leaves, its expression was rapidly induced by wounding, and correlated with suberin deposition around punctures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000703-Franke2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. These features render <italic>DAISY</italic> a good target for confirmation by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. In particular, we wondered whether it would be specifically induced in the leaf epidermis of the cuticular mutants.</p><p>The <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization results from wild type leaves, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000703-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, demonstrate that the expression of <italic>DAISY</italic> is restricted to the xylem and phloem in vascular bundles of older rosette leaves; the hybridization signal was also observed the transmitting tract and ovules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000703-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). In the <italic>lcr</italic> and <italic>bdg</italic> mutants, the signal was also detected in leaf primordia and young developing leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000703-g006">Figure 6C&#x02013;6 F</xref>), and the intensity of labeling in these organs was similar to that in the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000703-g006">Figure 6E and 6F</xref>). In the mutants, <italic>DAISY</italic> was ectopically expressed in all cell types in leaves, including the epidermis, and careful examination did not reveal any cell specificity. We concluded that the enlargement of the domain of <italic>DAISY</italic> expression obtained by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization is in agreement with our microarray data and the results of semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR, all of which evidence the induction of <italic>DAISY</italic> in young leaves of <italic>lcr</italic> and <italic>bdg</italic>.

The most prominent functional group of the upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000703.s008">Table S3</xref>) was represented by &#x0201c;cell wall&#x0201d; related proteins, with a 15.8&#x000b1;4.7-fold enrichment (mean&#x000b1;standard deviation for 100 bootstraps) when compared to the whole genome.

These results strongly indicate that the cell wall undergoes extensive changes in response to cuticular mutations. Given that the cuticle is an essential part of the cell wall, this should not come as a surprise. However, it is interesting that the genes associated with responses to abiotic or biotic stimuli were only third in this list, suggesting that the response to cuticular dysfunction leads to a specific compensatory response whereby the normal homeostasis of the cell wall (and cuticle) is altered, and the viability of the mutants is increased.</p><p>Our survey also showed that genes potentially associated with the cell wall, the cuticle and defense responses are upregulated in the cuticular mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000703.s011">Text S1</xref>).

Moreover, the fact that the three mutants display a peculiar phenotype, which is comprised of the overproduction of wax, organ fusions, irregular leaf shapes and defects in cell differentiation, suggests that the underlying signaling pathways may be distinct from, but overlap with, those that are activated in response to conventional biotic and abiotic factors.</p><p>To identify related pathways, we sought to determine which transcriptional responses were the most similar to those observed in <italic>bdg</italic>, <italic>lcr</italic> and <italic>fdh</italic>. We also thought that contrasting these results to a similar analysis for cell wall deficient mutants would help further in the definition of the mechanism by which cuticular mutations induce plant defenses.</p><p>To this end, a comparative analysis of differentially regulated genes among the three mutants should be extended to include several hundred of the microarray datasets that are available for Arabidopsis. This is challenging to implement because the generally low consistency of differentially expressed gene (DEG) lists achieved with the use of t-type tests has been reported by several groups, including those participating in the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000703-MAQC1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.
