Here, we show that APOBEC3G, but not other APOBEC3 family members, binds 7SL RNA, the common ancestor of Alu RNAs that is specifically recruited into HIV virions. Our data further indicate that APOBEC3G recognizes 7SL RNA and Alu RNA by its common structure, the Alu domain, suggesting a mechanism for APOBEC3G- mediated inhibition of Alu retrotransposition. However, we also demonstrate that APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G are normally recruited into and inhibit the infectivity of &#x00394;Vif HIV1 virions when 7SLRNA is prevented from accessing particles by RNA interference against SRP14 or by over expression of SRP19, both components of the signal recognition particle. We thus conclude that 7SL RNA is not an essential mediator of the virion packaging of these antiviral cytidine deaminases.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>APOBEC proteins are members of a family of polynucleotide cytidine deaminases (CDA) that play important roles in antiviral defence. Human APOBEC3G and 3F can block the replication of a wide array of exogenous retroelements, including retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and murine leukaemia virus (MLV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and hepadnaviruses such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Primate lentiviruses including HIV counter APOBEC3G and 3F via their Vif protein, which binds to and triggers the proteasomal degradation of these cellular antivirals. In the absence of Vif, APOBEC3G and -F are packaged into retroviral particles, and lethally edit nascent viral reverse transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. What tethers APOBEC proteins to virions has so far remained incompletely characterized. While some have invoked a role for the viral genomic RNA, more undisputed is the claimed importance of the nucleocapsid region of HIV-1 Gag and of yet unknown cellular RNAs in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>APOBEC family members can also act on endogenous substrates, notably retroelements. APOBEC3A, 3G and 3F can block the propagation of endogenous retroviruses such as intracisternal-A particles (IAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] or MusD, and APOBEC3A, 3B and, to a lesser extent, 3C and 3F can inhibit LINE-1 (Long Interspersed Nuclear Element 1) retrotransposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B, APOBEC3C and APOBEC3G can prevent Alu retrotransposition, a process mediated in trans by the reverse transcriptase and integrase activities encoded by LINE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Interestingly, APOBEC3G overexpression appears to recruit Alu RNAs into APOBEC3G-containing high molecular mass ribonucleoprotein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The Alu family of repetitive sequences is one of the most successful groups of mobile genetic elements, having multiplied to more than one million copies in the human genome in some 65 million years of primate evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, the emergence of Alu as major primate genome remodelers has coincided with the expansion of the APOBEC3 gene family long before the appearance of modern lentiviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and there is a striking evolutionary coincidence between the expansion of the APOBEC gene cluster and the abrupt drop in retrotransposon activity that took place in primates, compared with rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. While the functions of Alu repetitive elements remain largely unknown, sequence analyses indicate that they originated from the evolutionary conserved 7SL RNA gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This gene encodes for the approximately 300-nucleotide-long RNA moiety of the signal recognition particle (SRP), a cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complex that associates with ribosomes to mediate the translocation of nascent proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Interestingly, 7SL RNA was amongst the first host RNAs detected in avian and murine retroviral particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and is packaged in HIV-1 virions at ten thousand and seven fold molar excess over the actin mRNA and viral genomic RNA respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A recent study points to 7SL RNA as a mediator of APOBEC3G packaging into HIV virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The results of the present work rather support a model in which the interaction between 7SL RNA and APOBEC3G may shed light on APOBEC3G-mediated inhibition of Alu retrotransposition, but does not mediate the retroviral particle incorporation of the CDA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>Plasmids pCMV4-HA expressing the HA-tagged form of APOBEC3G and APOBEC3A were a kind gift from M. Malim (King's College, London, UK). Human APOBEC3B and APOBEC3F cDNAs were amplified from activated peripheral blood lymphocytes. We used primers cem196: 5'-agattagcttggctgaacatgaatccacagatcag-3' and cem197: 5'-ttacttctagagtttccctgattctggagaatgg-3' for APOBEC3B and primers cem157: 5'-agattaagcttccaaggatgaagcctcacttcag-3' and cem156: 5'-ttacttctagactcgagaatctcctgcagcttgc-3' for APOBEC3F. These cDNAs were then introduced in the HindIII and XbaI sites of the pCMV4-HA plasmid, replacing the human APOBEC3G cDNA. The resulting proteins correspond to the NP_004891 and NP_660341 NCBI entries, respectively. The cDNAs for APOBEC3C, APOBEC2, APOBEC1 and AID come from B. Matija Peterlin and Yong-Hui Zheng (University of California, San Francisco, USA) and were obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH. All cDNAs for APOBEC family members were inserted into the same expression vector pCMV4-HA. Single-aminoacid substitutions were made on APOBEC3G coding sequence using Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids for GAG expression and NC deletion construct, Zwt-p6, were kindly provided by P. Bieniasz (Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center and the Rockefeller University, New York, USA). Plasmids for Alu retrotransposition, were a kind gift from T. Heidmann (Alu-Sb1: pAlu pA+ neoTet) and from J. Moran (L1-RP: pJM101 L1-RP &#x00394; neo). Plasmids for SRP19 and SRP19 &#x00394; 6 were kindly provided by Xiao-Fang Yu (Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore USA).

Accordingly, the demonstrated interaction between APOBEC3G and Alu RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and the specific incorporation of 7SL RNA in HIV-1 particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] suggested that 7SL RNA might bind APOBEC3G, and perhaps mediate the recruitment of the cytidine deaminase into virions. To probe this issue, we first immunoprecipitated extracts of HeLa cells expressing HA-tagged APOBEC proteins with a HA-specific antibody, and subjected the resulting material to Western blotting and 7SL RNA-specific RT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). 7SL RNA was detected in human APOBEC3G-specific immunoprecipitates, but not in association with APOBEC1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C or 3F, nor with murine APOBEC3. By transfecting serial dilutions of the APOBEC3G-HA plasmid, we confirmed that 7SL RNA recovery was proportional to the levels of immunoprecipitated protein, and that the failure to detect this RNA in association with other APOBEC family members was not due to less efficient recovery of these latter proteins. Moreover, overexpression of an Alu RNA (Alu-Sb1) inhibited the recruitment of 7SL RNA by APOBEC3G (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), consistent with a model in which the cytidine deaminase recognizes the Alu domain of the SRP RNA constituent. In order to confirm this result, we overexpressed the 7SL Alu and S-stem domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and tested their effect in similar competition experiments. We found that the 7SL S-stem domain had little effect on APOBEC3G binding to full-length 7SL RNA, whereas the 7SL Alu domain strongly interfered with this interaction, even more effectively than Alu-Sb1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). This suggests that APOBEC3G binds to the Alu domain of 7SL RNA.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>APOBEC3G binds 7SL RNA</bold>. A.

We identified a series of single amino acid mutants with either partial (H65R, W94L, C97S, Y124A) or complete (Y91A, R122A, W127L) HIV packaging defect, which correlated with an inability to block the infectivity of &#x00394; Vif HIV-1 (not illustrated).

HIV-1 viral-like particles (VLP) can be produced from a Gag derivative in which NC is replaced by a heterologous sequence providing the intermolecular Gag interaction function normally fulfilled by this region. It was previously demonstrated that one such chimerical protein termed Zwt-p6, in which NC is replaced by a leucine zipper from GCN4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), induces the efficient formation of virions, but that these contain low levels of non viral RNA and fail to incorporate APOBEC3G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We indeed found that Zwt-p6 VLPs contained about ten times less 7SL RNA than wild-type Gag VLPs, as recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and very low levels of not only APOBEC3G but also APOBEC3F (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5BC</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>7SL RNA packaging into HIV-1 virus like particles is dependent on nucleocapsid</bold>.

To probe the issue more directly, we examined the incorporation of the cytidine deaminase into virions produced from cells in which the SRP RNA was downregulated. First we tried to downregulate 7SL RNA by transfection of small interfering RNAs targeted against its sequence. However, these attempts were unsuccessful (data not shown). We thus turned to an indirect approach. For this, we took advantage of the fact that downregulation of SRP14 (a protein constituent of the SRP) by RNA interference leads to destabilization of the signal recognition particle and degradation of 7SL RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). It was previously demonstrated that cell growth and protein translocation defects caused by low levels of functional SRP can be prevented by slowing down nascent chain elongation with sublethal doses of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, which restore the secretion pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We thus produced HIV-derived lentiviral vector particles in the presence of either APOBEC3G or APOBEC3F from 293T cells expressing SRP14-shRNA or control-shRNA, using this protocol. Viral production was diminished five fold when 7SL RNA was downregulated, whether or not a cytidine deaminase was present (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Virions produced from SRP14-shRNA expressing cells contained about 100-fold less 7SL RNA than control, as measured by quantitative PCR, normalizing for the viral genomic RNA. In contrast, levels of other small cellular RNA species previously shown to be incorporated in HIV virions, such as Y3 and 5S, were either unchanged or augmented (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In spite of the marked drop in 7SL RNA, intraviral concentrations of APOBEC3G were only very slightly diminished, and those of APOBEC3F actually increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). From these data, we conclude that the SRP scaffold RNA is not essential for the virion incorporation of these cytidine deaminases. Of note, virions lacking 7SL RNA exhibited significantly reduced levels of infectivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), suggesting that the selective packaging of 7SLRNA into HIV-1 virions could be functionally relevant. However, we cannot exclude non-specific consequences of the manipulation of the protein production machinery inherent to our approach. Importantly, however, the inhibitory effect of A3F and A3G was still fully obtained on 7SL RNA-less particles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p><p>To confirm these data, we used a second approach. SRP19 is a key component in the formation of the SRP complex, demonstrated to be the first SRP protein to bind the 7SL RNA during assembly of the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and to induce conformational changes in this RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. It was recently suggested that sequesteration of 7SL RNA by over expression of SRP19 decreases APOBEC3G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] as well as APOBEC3F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] packaging into HIV1 virions. Since this result was at odd with our own data obtained by SRP14/7SL RNA downregulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), we produced &#x00394;Vif HIV1 virions in cells overexpressing SRP19 (at SRP19: HIV plasmid ratios of 4:1 or 2:1) in absence or presence of APOBEC3F or APOBEC3G. Under all the conditions, viral production was normal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), contrasting with what observed in case of SRP14 knockdown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). While without impact on cellular levels of 7SL RNA (not illustrated), SRP19 over expression lead to a more than 90% decrease in the virion incorporation of this RNA species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). In spite of this effect, and contrary to the results of recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], there was no corresponding decrease in the packaging of APOBEC3G or APOBEC3F into virus particles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Moreover, the inhibitory effect of the cytidine deaminases on the infectivity of &#x00394;Vif HIV1 was at least as pronounced upon SRP19 over expression (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that 7SL RNA is not responsible for mediating packaging of neither APOBEC3G nor APOBEC3F.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>7SL RNA down regulation by over expression of SRP19 does not inhibit APOBEC3F and 3G encapsidation and antiviral effect</bold>.

The SRP contains, in addition to 7SL RNA (or SRP RNA), at least six polypeptides, named according to their apparent molecular mass (SRP9, 14, 19, 54, 68 and 72). This multimolecular complex recognizes the signal peptide present at the N-terminal end of secreted and transmembrane proteins, as it emerges from ribosomes translating the corresponding mRNAs. These mRNAs are then targeted by the SRP to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where translation of the new ER-translocated protein continues. Assembly of the SRP proceeds through the recognition of the 7SL RNA Alu domain by the SRP9-SRP14 heterodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], the other SRP proteins, including the SRP68-SRP72 heterodimer, binding the 7SL RNA S domain (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. SRP9 and SRP14 also bind Alu RNAs by interacting with their so-called Alu domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], the common signature of all Alu-related RNAs. Noteworthy SRP9 and SRP14 and Alu RNAs have been recently identified as part of an APOBEC3G-containing high molecular weight complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] Alu emerged during primate evolution by deletion of the S domain of the 7SL RNA, yielding elements that rapidly spread in the primates genome via reverse transcription and integration through the action of proteins encoded by LINE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. APOBEC3A, 3B, 3C inhibit LINE-1 retrotransposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and concomitantly blocks LINE-mediated Alu retrotransposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Less clear is the role of APOBEC3F, which has been shown to inhibit LINE-1 retrotransposition in some [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], but not all studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and to have only a mild effect on Alu retrotransposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Strikingly, APOBEC3G is able to inhibit LINE-mediated Alu retrotransposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] despite being largely inactive on LINE-1 retrotransposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Here, we characterize APOBEC3G specific binding to the Alu-related 7SL RNA, and demonstrate that this interaction can be competitively inhibited by overexpressing the Alu-Sb1 RNA or the Alu domain of 7SL RNA. Furthermore, the study of a collection of APOBEC3G single amino acid mutants identified a derivative, carrying a tryptophan to leucine change in the first zinc-coordinating motif (APOBEC3G<sub>W127L</sub>), that was stably expressed, W127L properly localized, and still sensitive to Vif-induced degradation, but defective for 7SL RNA and Alu RNA binding. This mutant also failed to inhibit Alu retrotransposition. These data support a model whereby APOBEC3G blocks Alu retrotransposition by recognizing the Alu domain common to all Alu-related RNAs, rather than the trans-acting LINE-encoded Orf2 protein. This is consistent with recent evidence suggesting that APOBEC3G does not interact with any of the polypeptides encoded by LINE-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and, when overexpressed, can recruit Alu to a high molecular mass nucleoprotein complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The binding of APOBEC3G to the 7SL and Alu RNAs could be direct, or via the SRP9/14 heterodimer. In contrast, it is possible that APOBEC3A, 3B, 3C and 3F inhibit Alu retrotransposition via their effect on LINE since none of these proteins was found here to bind the Alu-related 7SL RNA.</p><p>7SL RNA is the most abundant RNA found in retroviral particles. For each molecule of viral genomic RNA, there are 7 molecules of 7SL RNA in an HIV-1 virion, and levels of 7SL RNA in particles are ten-thousand fold higher than those of actin messenger RNA, even though the latter is much more abundant in producer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. 7SL RNA thus appears to be actively incorporated into nascent particles during retroviral assembly. Cumulated evidence demonstrates that the nucleocapsid (NC) region of HIV-1 Gag mediates the recruitment of cellular RNAs into virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Here, when we produced VLPs with NC-deleted versions of HIV-1 Gag, virion levels of 7SL RNA were decreased about ten fold, and APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F also failed to be incorporated. These results confirm previous work indicating that APOBEC3G packaging into HIV virions is an RNA-dependent process requiring the NC basic linker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and extend this finding to APOBEC3F, but contradict the suggestion that 7SL RNA packaging is independent of NC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. We cannot explain this discrepancy, although we feel that the highly quantitative nature of our real-time RT-PCR measurements may provide a more rigorous assessment than the techniques used in these two other studies, namely an RNase protection assay with a probe recognizing at the same time the HIV-1 genomic and the 7SL RNA or a non-quantitative RT-PCR assay. Moreover, although a low level NC-independent incorporation of RNAs in VLPs cannot be excluded, the role of NC on packaging seems to be important for 7SL RNA and not for others Pol-III promoted RNAs such as tRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Finally, in an effort to elucidate the importance of 7SL RNA for APOBEC3G and 3F incorporation into HIV1 virions, we first produced virus from cells in which 7SL RNA was downregulated by RNA interference against SRP14. These particles lacked 7SL RNA but still incorporated other small cellular RNA species such as 5S and Y3, and did not exhibit significant changes in APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F levels. As the decreased infectivity of these virions somewhat hampered the interpretation of our data, we used a second approach by overexpressing SRP19, in order to sequester 7SL RNA away from assembling retroviral particles as recently described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The resulting virions exhibited at least ten-fold decreased levels of 7SL RNA, yet no change in their APOBEC3G or APOBEC3F content was detected. Furthermore the infectivity of these 7SL RNA-depleted viruses, whilst normal in the absence of cytidine deaminases, was inhibited at least as effectively as that of control virions by either APOBEC3G or APOBEC3F. We conclude from these data that 7SL RNA is not an essential mediator of APOBEC3G or 3F recruitment into HIV1 virions. Interestingly, a recent study revealed that short (&#x02265; 10 nucleotides) G-rich single-stranded RNA facilitate nucleocapsid-APOBEC3G complex formation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. While this result suggest that a wide range of cellular and viral RNAs could mediate packaging of antiviral cytidine deaminases into HIV1 virions, it would be surprising if a specific RNA species or a specificity-conferring cofactor were not at play in this process, to account for the target specificity of the various antiviral cytidine deaminases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The binding of APOBEC3G to 7SL RNA through its Alu domain suggests a mechanism for APOBEC-mediated inhibition of Alu retrotransposition.
