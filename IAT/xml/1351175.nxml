The ligand activation of PPAR&#x003b3; resulted in the down-regulation of c-myc and hTERT mRNA expression. By using specific activator and inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), it was demonstrated that Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent down-regulation of hTERT gene transcription involved inhibition of PKC.

The replication of telomeres during cell division poses a special problem for the cells because the conventional DNA polymerases are unable to completely replicate the chromosome ends. Most eukaryotic cells employ the enzyme telomerase for the maintenance of telomeres. Telomerase is a RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that synthesizes telomeric DNA sequences and almost universally provides the molecular basis for unlimited proliferative potential. The telomerase activity has been found to be absent in most normal somatic cells but present in over 90% of cancerous cells and in vitro immortalized cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Telomerase is also expressed in germ line cells and in a small number of normal somatic cells that possess high turnover capability, such as, haematopoietic stem cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes, skin keratinocytes, intestinal crypt cells etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Due to the absence of telomerase in most normal somatic cells, telomeres in these cells, shorten with progressive cell division in vitro and with increased age in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This telomere shortening has been proposed to act as a mitotic clock, which counts the number of divisions undergone by a cell and triggers cellular senescence at a critically short telomere length. The maintenance of telomere length by telomerase is thus essential for long-term cell proliferation and cell immortalization. The mechanisms involved in the regulation of telomerase activity are of special interest since the modulation of telomerase activity can be used to alter cellular life span and thus, can be exploited in anti-cancer and anti-ageing therapies.</p><p>The human telomerase consists of two essential components: (i) the human telomerase RNA component (hTR or hTERC) and (ii) the catalytic component, known as the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Several other protein subunits associate with these core components to form the telomerase holoenzyme that synthesizes telomeric DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Among the multiple components of human telomerase, only the catalytic subunit, hTERT seems to be the key determinant of telomerase activity. While the expression of hTERT is repressed in normal somatic cells (telomerase negative) and is upregulated in immortal cells (telomerase positive), the other components of telomerase holoenzyme are usually expressed ubiquitously in both telomerase positive and telomerase negative cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Although various steps at post-transcriptional and post-translational levels have been found to modulate telomerase activity, substantial experimental data have established that the transcriptional control of hTERT gene is the major contributor to the regulation of telomerase activity in most cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Binding sites for several transcription factors have been identified on the promoter of hTERT gene. Transcription factors such as c-myc, Sp1, nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) and upstream stimulatory factors (USF) have been shown to upregulate hTERT transcription whereas transcription factors like Mad1, Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) tumor suppressor protein, E2F, p53 and myeloid cell-specific zinc finger protein-2 (MZF-2) have been found to down-regulate hTERT transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Bcl-2, the oncoprotein involved in the inhibition of cellular apoptosis has also been reported to modulate telomerase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Several studies have implicated sex steroid hormones (estrogen, progesterone and androgens) in the regulation of hTERT transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Some human chromosomes (chromosome 3, 4, 6, 7, 10 and 17) have been found to potentially contain transcriptional repressors of hTERT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The hTERT gene is also a target site for viruses frequently associated with human cancers, such as human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Further, some studies suggest that methylation of the promoter of hTERT gene may contribute to the repression of hTERT gene transcription in some cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. There is also evidence to suggest that chromatin remodeling by various transcription factors may be involved in the regulation of hTERT gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Although the enormous amount of research has identified numerous protein factors as putative hTERT regulators, the exact mechanisms involved in the regulation of hTERT transcription are still far from being fully established. It is likely that as yet unidentified factors are important players in the control of activation and repression of hTERT transcription.</p><p>In this context, Receptor C<sub>k</sub>, a cell-surface receptor specific for the cholesterol moiety in lipoprotein particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], may be a good candidate for the regulation of hTERT transcription. Receptor C<sub>k </sub>has been shown to initiate a signaling pathway that controls the expression of several genes involved in cell cycle, such as, the genes encoding cyclin D, Bcl-2, p27, c-myc and c-fos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Out of these Receptor C<sub>k </sub>target genes, the c-myc and Bcl-2 gene products are known modulators of hTERT transcription and telomerase activity. Further, investigations have revealed that Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent signaling is defective in various leukemic cell lines/patients and also in tumors of the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The present study was thus, designed to explore the effect, if any, of Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent signaling on hTERT transcription. We also sought to identify the various transcription factors involved in the above process. Besides the transcription factors c-myc and Bcl-2, which were obvious candidates for the potential link between Receptor C<sub>k </sub>and hTERT expression, we also examined cyclin D and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;). D-type cyclins are rate-limiting controllers of G1 phase progression in mammalian cells. Overexpression of these cyclins has been detected in several types of cancers and an oncogenic role for them has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Chromosomal translocations involving cyclin D1 locus have been reported in different tumor types, such as, carcinoma of the breast, oesophagus, stomach, bladder and liver, and in squamous carcinomas of the head and neck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. PPAR&#x003b3;, a ligand activated transcription factor of the nuclear hormone receptor family, was initially characterized as a regulator of adipogenesis and glucose homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. New investigations have revealed that PPAR&#x003b3; also regulates cell proliferation/differentiation pathways and the expression of many genes involved in carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Given their involvement in tumorigenesis, both cyclin D and PPAR&#x003b3; are potential candidates for the regulation of hTERT transcription.</p><p>The majority of studies have evaluated the regulation of hTERT and telomerase in tumor models. There is a relative paucity of information on this front in normal cells. Hence, the cellular models employed in the present study were the normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which are known to express hTERT and telomerase in a highly regulated manner. Our results revealed a novel mechanism for the regulation of hTERT transcription controlled by cholesterol activated Receptor C<sub>k</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Involvement of Receptor C<sub>k </sub>in the transcription of hTERT, c-myc and PPAR&#x003b3; genes</title><p>In order to determine whether cholesterol-activated Receptor C<sub>k </sub>regulates the transcription of hTERT, c-myc and PPAR&#x003b3; genes in normal human PBMCs, the cells were cultured in growth medium enriched with 10% normal human serum (NHS) in the presence and absence of a polyclonal monospecific antibody against Receptor C<sub>k</sub>. These cells were harvested at various time points and the cellular mRNA levels of hTERT, c-myc and PPAR&#x003b3; genes were measured by RT-PCR. In the cells exposed to growth medium containing 10% NHS alone, Receptor C<sub>k </sub>was activated by the cholesterol moiety of low density lipoprotein (LDL) supplied by 10% NHS and a decrease in the mRNA levels of hTERT, c-myc and PPAR&#x003b3; genes over 12 hours was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This decrease was abolished in the presence of the antibody against Receptor C<sub>k</sub>, which blocked Receptor C<sub>k </sub>activation. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, addition of antibody against Receptor C<sub>k </sub>resulted in the upregulation of mRNA expression of hTERT, c-myc and PPAR&#x003b3; genes.

The possible involvement of LDLR was ruled out by culturing normal human PBMCs in growth medium enriched with 10% NHS in the presence of 2.5 mM ethyleneglycol-bis-(&#x003b2;-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N' -tetraacetic acid (EGTA). EGTA is a known blocker of the interaction of LDL with LDLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Hence, in the presence of EGTA, LDLR pathway is shut off while Receptor C<sub>k </sub>signaling is functional. The results obtained after EGTA addition (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) were similar to those observed when PBMCs were exposed to growth medium enriched with 10% NHS without EGTA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) thereby showing that the blockage of LDLR pathway had no effect upon the transcription of these genes. Hence, the cholesterol specific Receptor C<sub>k </sub>and not LDLR was responsible for the transcriptional regulation of hTERT, c-myc and PPAR&#x003b3; genes.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The expression of hTERT, c-myc, PPAR&#x003b3;, cyclin D and bcl-2 genes over 12 h (hours) in normal human PBMCs treated with growth medium containing 10% NHS and 2.5 mM EGTA</bold>.

However, on comparing the expression pattern of cyclin D and Bcl-2 proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) with the hTERT mRNA expression in human normal PBMCs exposed to growth medium containing 10% NHS and 2.5 mM EGTA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), no correlation was found between cyclin D expression and hTERT transcription or between Bcl-2 expression and hTERT transcription. While cyclin D protein was expressed at only 4 hours and Bcl-2 protein was not expressed at all (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), the level of hTERT mRNA gradually decreased over 12 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Hence, it was inferred that cyclin D and Bcl-2 might not play any role in the regulation of hTERT transcription in normal human PBMCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of c-myc in Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent regulation of hTERT gene transcription</title><p>Substantial data have implicated c-myc in the upregulation of hTERT transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In order to determine whether or not c-myc mediates the Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent down-regulation of hTERT gene transcription, normal human PBMCs cultured in medium containing 10% NHS were exposed to antibody against Receptor C<sub>k </sub>along with 1 &#x003bc;M of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OH-C), which is a negative regulator of c-myc mRNA and protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. As expected, c-myc mRNA levels declined gradually over 12 hours due to the presence of 25OH-C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). A similar decrease was observed in hTERT mRNA expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), thus proving that Receptor C<sub>k </sub>regulates hTERT gene transcription indirectly by controlling the transcription of c-myc gene. The PPAR&#x003b3; mRNA levels were not affected by the addition of 25OH-C. In both the cases &#x02013; PBMCs exposed only to antibody against Receptor C<sub>k </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and PBMCs exposed to antibody against Receptor C<sub>k </sub>along with 25OH-C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) &#x02013; the PPAR&#x003b3; transcript levels increased over 12 hours, demonstrating the high specificity of the inhibitory effect of 25OH-C on c-myc mRNA expression.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The hTERT, c-myc and PPAR&#x003b3; mRNA levels over 12 h (hours) in normal human PBMCs exposed to growth medium containing 10% NHS along with antibody against receptor C<sub>k </sub>(Ab RC<sub>k</sub>) and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OH-C; 1 &#x003bc;M)</bold>.

The exposure of PBMCs to growth medium containing 10% NHS had resulted in a gradual decrease in the mRNA levels of c-myc, PPAR&#x003b3; and hTERT genes over 12 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Due to the negative regulation of the c-myc mRNA expression by 25OH-C, the addition of 25OH-C to this culture system was expected to further decrease c-myc and hTERT mRNA levels while not affecting the decline of PPAR&#x003b3; mRNA levels. However, surprisingly, the exposure of normal human PBMCs to growth medium containing 10% NHS along with 1 &#x003bc;M 25OH-C revealed a completely different scenario (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Addition of 25OH-C transiently abolished the Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent transcriptional down-regulation of hTERT, c-myc and PPAR&#x003b3; genes observed in PBMCs cultured in growth medium containing 10% NHS alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and exhibited a biphasic effect on the transcription of these genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The hTERT transcript levels increased by about 9.3 fold as compared to the levels in control cells after 4 hours of 25OH-C treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These levels then decreased to the hTERT mRNA levels in control cells, at 8 hours and again increased slightly (about 1.7 fold) at 12 hours (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The c-myc and PPAR&#x003b3; mRNA expression also followed a similar pattern of time-dependent increase and decrease though the fold increase was less as compared to that seen in hTERT mRNA expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The observation that the addition of 25OH-C to PBMCs cultured in medium enriched with 10% NHS is able to disrupt the Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent down-regulation of hTERT, c-myc and PPAR&#x003b3; mRNA expression (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) indicates that 25OH-C also contributes to the transcriptional regulation of these genes in normal human PBMCs.

The normal human PBMCs were cultured in growth medium enriched with 10% NHS in the presence of antibody against Receptor C<sub>k </sub>and 200 &#x003bc;M of propranolol. Propranolol is known to be an inhibitor of the enzyme phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAP), which catalyses the conversion of PA to DAG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Hence, propranolol indirectly inhibits PKC by blocking the generation of its activator, DAG from PA. The addition of propranolol abrogated the increase in mRNA expression of c-myc, PPAR&#x003b3; and hTERT genes that was observed in PBMCs exposed to growth medium containing 10% NHS and antibody against Receptor C<sub>k </sub>(Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).

Based on the results of our experiments, we have proposed a signaling pathway (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>) that links Receptor C<sub>k </sub>with hTERT gene transcription through the transcription factors, c-myc and PPAR&#x003b3;. Despite the ability of activated Receptor C<sub>k </sub>to generate the second messenger PA as reported by previous studies, the experiments of this study demonstrate that Receptor C<sub>k </sub>is not able to activate PKC. The data of the present study suggest that activated Receptor C<sub>k </sub>may be involved in the inhibition of PKC. To explain this, it was speculated that Receptor C<sub>k </sub>could inhibit PKC by blocking the production of DAG either by inhibiting the enzyme PAP, which catalyses the conversion of PA to DAG or by activating the enzyme diacylglycerol kinase (DAGK) which catalyses the conversion of DAG back to PA. The inhibition of PAP by Receptor C<sub>k </sub>does not explain the time-dependent biphasic effect on the transcription of c-myc, PPAR&#x003b3; and hTERT genes that was observed when normal human PBMCs were exposed to 25OH-C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). However, all the results are compatible with the Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent DAGK activation model.

The Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent down-regulation of hTERT transcription observed in normal human PBMCs may reflect a general mechanism for the repression of hTERT and telomerase expression in normal somatic cells. It is attractive to suggest that the failure of this Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent repressive mechanism may contribute to upregulation of hTERT transcription and induction of telomerase activity in cancer cells. In this context, it is interesting to note that Receptor C<sub>k </sub>expression has been found to be lacking in several leukemic cell lines / patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The treatment of cells with PMA (PKC activator) was found to abolish the Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent transcriptional down-regulation of hTERT, PPAR&#x003b3; and c-myc genes and result in time-dependent increase in the mRNA levels of these genes (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). On the other hand, PKC inhibition by propranolol resulted in the down-regulation of mRNA expression of these genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).

Also, the upregulation of c-myc gene expression by activation of PKC has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Several studies have suggested the important role of PKC isoforms in the upregulation of telomerase activity through the PKC-mediated phosphorylation of hTERT protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the role of PKC in the transcription of hTERT gene has not been thoroughly investigated. Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] observed that PKC inhibitors decreased telomerase activities by decreasing the expression of full length hTERT transcripts in human cervical cancers. Consistent with this, the results of the present study also suggest the involvement of PKC inhibition in the down-regulation of hTERT gene transcription and PKC activation in the upregulation of hTERT gene transcription.</p><p>The activation of PPAR&#x003b3; by its agonist pioglitazone was found to down-regulate the mRNA expression of c-myc and hTERT genes in PBMCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Also, hTERT mRNA expression was upregulated in PBMCs in which PPAR&#x003b3; mRNA expression was knocked down as compared to that in control PBMCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of a link between PPAR&#x003b3; activation and hTERT gene transcription. The inhibition of c-myc mRNA expression by activated PPAR&#x003b3; has also been reported by other groups. Activation of PPAR&#x003b3; by ligands such as troglitazone and 15-deoxy-&#x00394;<sup>12,14 </sup>&#x02013; prostaglandin J<sub>2 </sub>has been shown to down-regulate c-myc mRNA and protein expression in colon cancer cells and leukemic cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Whether PPAR&#x003b3; downregulates hTERT gene transcription through a c-myc dependent or c-myc independent mechanism remains an open question. It has been reported that PPAR&#x003b3; directly interacts with the transcription factor Sp1 at the protein level leading to inhibition of Sp1 and thereby, the transcriptional down-regulation of Sp1 target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Also, activated PPAR&#x003b3; has been shown to antagonize the activity of the pleiotropic transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NF &#x02013; &#x003ba;B) thus inhibiting the transcription of NF-&#x003ba;B target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

Hence, the effect of activated PPAR&#x003b3; on hTERT mRNA expression may also be mediated by the transcription factors Sp1 and NF-&#x003ba;B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). The possibility of a direct effect of activated PPAR&#x003b3; on hTERT gene transcription through a PPAR&#x003b3; specific binding site on hTERT promoter remains to be explored.</p><p>The link between activated PPAR&#x003b3; and hTERT transcription observed in this study suggests that PPAR&#x003b3; activation may have important implications in the processes of carcinogenesis and ageing. Recent studies have implicated PPAR&#x003b3; in the regulation of genes relevant to carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Deficient expression of PPAR&#x003b3; can be a significant risk factor for carcinogenesis, although in some cases, PPAR&#x003b3; overexpression has been demonstrated to enhance carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Our finding that PPAR&#x003b3; negatively regulates hTERT transcription suggests that deficient expression of PPAR&#x003b3; may contribute to carcinogenesis through the upregulation of hTERT expression. The link between PPAR&#x003b3; and hTERT gene expression also assumes importance in the light of the fact that PPAR&#x003b3; can be activated by a large number of ligands, which include polyunsaturated fatty acids, metabolites of prostaglandin J, antidiabetic drugs (thiazolidinediones) and a variety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. All these molecules may repress hTERT gene expression and thereby, telomerase activity through PPAR&#x003b3; activation. It is interesting to note here that ligand activation of PPAR&#x003b3; has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in several cancer cells such as, breast, colon and prostate cancer cells and in various leukemic cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Besides implicating cholesterol (through Receptor C<sub>k</sub>) in the transcriptional regulation of hTERT gene, the present study reveals the involvement of oxysterols, the oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol, in the regulation of hTERT gene transcription. Initially used in the study as an inhibitor of c-myc mRNA expression, the oxysterol, 25OH-C was found to have a dual effect on the expression of hTERT gene. This dual effect was found to depend on the activation / inactivation of Receptor C<sub>k</sub>. When Receptor C<sub>k </sub>was not activated due to the presence of antibody against Receptor C<sub>k </sub>in the 'PBMCs + Medium + 10% NHS + 1 &#x003bc;M 25OH-C + Antibody against Receptor C<sub>k</sub>' culture system, 25OH-C repressed hTERT mRNA levels by inhibiting c-myc mRNA expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In contrast, when 25OH-C was present along with activated Receptor C<sub>k </sub>as in 'PBMCs + Medium + 10% NHS + 1 &#x003bc;M 25OH-C' culture experiment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), it abrogated the Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent down-regulation of hTERT, c-myc and PPAR&#x003b3; mRNA expression and transiently upregulated the mRNA levels of these genes (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). A time-dependent biphasic effect on the mRNA levels of hTERT, c-myc and PPAR&#x003b3; genes was observed in this situation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) suggesting that 25OH-C might be interacting at some point with the Receptor C<sub>k </sub>signaling pathway, leading to the transient upregulation of the genes under study. In an attempt to understand the mechanism underlying the observed biphasic effect of 25OH-C, we investigated the effect of PKC inhibition on this action of 25OH-C. Inhibition of PKC by propranolol was found to abolish the biphasic effect of 25OH-C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>) showing that the 25OH-C mediated transient disruption of Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent signaling involved the conversion of PA to DAG and PKC activation. This observation coupled with the previous report that 25OH-C possesses the ability to amplify the Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent generation of PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] suggests that PA generation followed by the conversion of PA to DAG and PKC activation may be the point at which 25OH-C interacts with Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent signaling pathway. Due to the increase in the generation of PA when 25OH-C is present along with activated Receptor C<sub>k</sub>, PKC could be activated (even in the presence of activated Receptor C<sub>k</sub>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>), leading to the observed transient upregulation of the mRNA expression of c-myc, PPAR&#x003b3; and hTERT genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Decrease in the mRNA levels of these genes, observed during the biphasic effect is due to the Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent DAGK activation resulting in the inhibition of PKC (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). Hence, the biphasic effect on the mRNA expression of c-myc, PPAR&#x003b3; and hTERT genes observed when 25OH-C is present along with activated Receptor C<sub>k </sub>is attributed to the ability of 25OH-C to activate PKC and the ability of activated Receptor C<sub>k </sub>to inhibit PKC (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). These observations, which suggest a role for the oxygenated derivative of cholesterol in the regulation of hTERT gene transcription and more importantly, reveal the ability of 25OH-C to reverse the Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent transcriptional repression of hTERT, c-myc and PPAR&#x003b3; genes may have important implications given the diverse biological roles of oxysterols. It is pertinent to note here that 25OH-C is one of the abundant oxysterols present in the human plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The oxysterols have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including lipid metabolism, apoptosis and cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Several studies have indicated that oxysterols play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Oxysterols have also been suggested as potential cancer chemotherapeutic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>The peripheral blood immune cells exhibit particularly interesting telomere dynamics. Despite the presence of telomerase, the telomeres in these cells shorten progressively with increasing age and with cellular replication in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Telomere attrition even in the presence of telomerase suggests that the level of hTERT and telomerase expression is insufficient for the maintenance of telomere lengths. This deficient expression of hTERT and telomerase in PBMCs possibly represents a tumor suppressor mechanism, essential for the protection of these cells against the development of cancer. The Receptor C<sub>k</sub>-dependent down-regulation of hTERT mRNA expression observed in the present study may cooperate with the other repressive mechanisms operational in PBMCs in order to maintain appropriate low levels of telomerase in these cells. Further, it has been reported that unlike most telomerase positive cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes do not exhibit a tight correlation between hTERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity. The hTERT transcripts are expressed in these cells independently of the presence, absence or quantitative level of detectable telomerase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. However, hTERT transcription is upregulated along with the increase in telomerase activity during the activation of peripheral blood cells. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In the present study, since Receptor C<sub>k </sub>activation has been found to down-regulate hTERT transcription, it is expected to repress telomerase activity as well, because the enzymatic activity of telomerase can not possibly occur in the absence of hTERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase. The absence of correlation between hTERT mRNA expression and telomerase activity in PBMCs suggests that hTERT may have some other roles besides contributing to telomerase activity and telomere lengthening. Recent studies have, indeed, shown that actions of hTERT in cellular proliferation and tumor progression extend beyond the singular role of telomere maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. hTERT has also been shown to enhance cell survival independent of its effect on telomere length maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Hence, the study of hTERT transcription irrespective of its contribution to telomerase activity assumes importance. Besides participating in the suppression of telomerase, Receptor C<sub>k </sub>dependent down-regulation of hTERT transcription may be involved in the other as yet uncharacterized roles of hTERT in PBMCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings of this study provide new insights into the regulation of hTERT transcription and may have important implications in cancer and ageing research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Lipoprotein deficient serum (LPDS), fetal bovine serum (FBS), Ethyleneglycol-bis-(&#x003b2;-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N' -tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25OH-C), Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and DL-Propranolol hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma (U.S.A.). Pioglitazone was kindly provided by Dr. S. Varma (Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education &#x00026; Research, Chandigarh, India). Specific antibodies against cyclin D and Bcl-2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (U.S.A.). Polyclonal monospecific antibody against Receptor C<sub>k </sub>was raised in our laboratory as reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. All the other reagents used in the study were of the highest quality commercially available.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>Normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from healthy volunteers, who were fasting for 12 hours and abstained from any medication for 2 weeks before blood donation. Blood was drawn through venipuncture into heparinized tubes and PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. These PBMCs were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline and then cultured at a density of 0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% LPDS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 20 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethyl piperazine-N' -2-ethanesulphonic acid), 24 mM sodium bicarbonate, 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin. Culturing was done for 24 hours at 37&#x000b0;C in humidified 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere. At the end of this incubation period, the PBMCs were exposed to fresh DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated normal human serum (NHS) in place of LPDS. At this stage, PBMCs were cultured for an additional 0, 4, 8 and 12 hours either in the presence of medium + 10% NHS alone or in combination with antibody against Receptor C<sub>k</sub>, EGTA (2.5 mM), 25OH-C (1 &#x003bc;M), PMA (100 nM) or propranolol (200 &#x003bc;M). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 250 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 15 minutes and the obtained pellets were subjected to RNA and protein extraction.</p><p>To study the effect of PPAR&#x003b3; activation, PBMCs cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS were used instead of LPDS treated PBMCs. These cells were preincubated with different concentrations (0&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;M) of pioglitazone (a synthetic PPAR&#x003b3; agonist belonging to the class of thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents) in FBS-free medium for 4 hours. After 4 hours, 10% FBS was added and the cells were harvested after culturing for additional 20 hours. Harvested cells were subjected to RNA isolation.</p><p>Both propranolol and pioglitazone were prepared fresh before use by dissolving in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Stocks of PMA and 25OH-C were made by dissolving in DMSO and absolute ethanol respectively. These stock preparations were stored at -20&#x000b0;C and diluted immediately before use. Vehicle concentration in the medium was maintained at 0.1% vol/vol. Viable cells always exceeded 90% as determined by trypan blue exclusion dye test.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction</title><p>Total cellular RNA was extracted by the acid guanidinium phenol chloroform method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].

This PCR product was employed as a template for the production of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) using the BLOCK-iT&#x02122; RNAi TOPO Transcription kit (Invitrogen). The dsRNA was diced into PPAR&#x003b3; gene-specific siRNA using the BLOCK-iT&#x02122; Dicer RNAi kit (Invitrogen). Scrambled siRNA was used as a negative control. PPAR&#x003b3;-specific siRNA or scrambled siRNA were transfected into normal human PBMCs using the Lipofectamine&#x02122; 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). These cells were harvested after 72 hours and subjected to RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis in order to determine the relative levels of PPAR&#x003b3; and hTERT mRNA expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KS participated in the design of the study, carried out all the experiments and drafted the manuscript.
