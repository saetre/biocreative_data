AtTBP1 is an <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> protein that binds plant telomeric DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here, we demonstrated that lack of <italic>AtTBP1</italic> results in a deregulation of telomere length control, with mutant telomeres expanding steadily by the fourth generation. DNA-binding studies with mutant AtTBP1 proteins showed that the Myb-extension domain of AtTBP1 is required for binding to plant telomeric DNA. Our results suggest that AtTBP1 is involved in the telomere length mechanism in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and that the Myb-extension domain of AtTBP1 may stabilize plant telomeric DNA binding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Eukaryotic telomeres are maintained by several telomeric factors, including telomerase, shelterin subunits (TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, Rap1, TPP1 and POT1) and non-shelterin proteins (Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1, ERCC1/XPF, WRN, BLM, DNA-PK, Tankyrases and Rad51D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The typical shelterin components, TRF1 and TRF2, recognize telomeric DNA, have the capacity to regulate t-loop structures, and can be involved in the canonical DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The <italic>in vivo</italic> dominant inhibition studies suggest that the main function of TRF1 is to negatively regulate telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and that of TRF2 is to protect chromosome ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In mouse embryonic cells, a conditional null mutation in TRF1 induces growth defects and chromosomal instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Deletion of TRF2 results in extensive telomere fusions and activates the DNA damage response machinery without detectable degradation of the telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to mammals, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> displays a remarkable tolerance to telomere dysfunction and chromosome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). This makes <italic>A. thaliana</italic> a useful system to investigate the roles of shelterin genes in telomere biology by studying lines containing multiple mutations. For example, the disruption of <italic>AtTERT</italic> gene leads to telomere shortening and the symptom of developmental defects in the sixth generation of the mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). AtRad50 mutant cells present a dramatic loss of telomeric DNA and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In contrast, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> mutants lacking <italic>Ku70, Ku80</italic> and <italic>MRE11</italic> display increased telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>). Using activation-tagged line screening method, Ren <italic>et al</italic>. characterized a novel zinc-finger protein, telomerase activator 1, which induces telomerase in leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). However, this activity does not increase telomere length. This result implies that access to the telomeres by telomerase is regulated by shelterin proteins. Thus shelterin is more critical regulator in telomere homeostasis.</p><p>Although several non-shelterin proteins from plants have been characterized, the physiological functions of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> double-stranded TBPs have not previously been assessed. Several <italic>A. thaliana AtTBP</italic> genes have been identified, and these genes encode proteins that specifically bind to plant telomeric DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). These proteins are similar in structure to the mammalian TRFs as they harbor a single Myb telomeric DNA-binding domain in their C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Here, we investigate the role of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> telomeric DNA-binding protein 1 (AtTBP1) in telomere maintenance and describe the consequences of an AtTBP1 deficiency in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. In the mouse, inactivation of the shelterin (<italic>mTRF1</italic> or <italic>mTIN2</italic> genes) results in embryonic lethality, and this phenotype is not due to unregulated telomeric function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In contrast, we found that mutant <italic>AtTBP1</italic> plants were viable and that a lack of this gene resulted in a deregulation of telomere length control, with mutant telomeres expanding steadily by the fourth generation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants (ecotype Wassilewskija) were cultivated at 22&#x000b0;C in a growth chamber under a 16/8&#x02009;h light/dark photoperiod. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds were surface sterilized in 5% bleach solution and plated on solid 1X Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium or transferred to soil.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutant identification</title><p>We screened the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique Versailles (INRAV) <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> T-DNA insertion collection, using the flanking insertion site FLAG sequence database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and identified a putative mutant plant (FST 072C05) with a T-DNA insertion in the <italic>AtTBP1</italic> gene.

In the INRAV database, the insertion was annotated within the 10th exon, with the left border oriented toward the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>AtTBP1</italic> gene. To determine the genomic organization in detail, including the exact position of insertion, the <italic>AtTBP1</italic>&#x02013;T-DNA junctions were amplified and sequenced. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, the T-DNA insertion resulted in vast deletion of DNA from the 8th to the 10th exons. We refer to this mutation, which disrupts the gene in the region coding for the conserved DNA-binding motif, as the <italic>attbp1-1</italic> allele. On selective medium, the progeny of self-pollinated heterozygotes segregated in a ratio of &#x0223c;3:1 for the selection marker (Basta-resistant:Basta-sensitive&#x02009;=&#x02009;467:160; <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>[1df]&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09). This result suggests that the T-DNA insertion is inherited in a Mendelian manner and indicates a single T-DNA insertion in the <italic>AtTBP1</italic> gene. Southern blot analysis, using T-DNA border sequence as a probe, confirmed that the T-DNA insertion is present at a single locus (supplementary Figure S1). </p><p>Northern blot analysis of mutants homozygous for the T-DNA insertion failed to detect <italic>AtTBP1</italic> mRNA, while mRNA of the predicted size, &#x0223c;2.5&#x02009;kb, was detected in wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). We confirmed that expression of the full-length transcript was abolished by the T-DNA insertion by performing RT-PCR, using various primers. No product was obtained after 38 cycles of PCR amplification (data not shown). RT-PCR of the <italic>AtTBP1</italic> 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; coding regions flanking the T-DNA insertion, however, revealed the presence of low-abundance transcripts, undetectable by northern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Remarkably, the expression of an <italic>AtTBP1</italic> mRNA downstream of the insertion was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, F2&#x02009;+&#x02009;R4). As in other T-DNA mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), these short transcripts are probably abnormal RNA forms that are fused with RNA produced from the T-DNA marker cassette, which is regulated by the 35S promoter and initiated within the T-DNA insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, L1&#x02009;+&#x02009;R4). It is unlikely that this unusual RT-PCR product is functional, because it contains only a very short coding region of the C-terminus of AtTBP1 (&#x0223c;30&#x02009;a.a.). Sequence analysis of the cDNA species, amplified by RT-PCR with the 5&#x02032; flanking region of T-DNA, predicts that the mutant produces a truncated protein, comprised of the first 451&#x02009;a.a. of the 640&#x02009;a.a. full-length AtTBP1 protein, because a TAA stop codon is encountered in the eighth exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). These results suggest that the function of this truncated AtTBP1 protein is severely compromised if not null.</p><p>Selected heterozygous plants were self-pollinated to obtain homozygous mutants (G1 <italic>AtTBP1</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;) and wild-type plants (G1 WT). Four homozygous lines, including two mutant G1 plants and two wild-type plants, were generated from the heterozygous line. These wild-type siblings were used for experimental controls. Individual lines were propagated through successive generations by self-pollination. Seeds from several plants within a single line were pooled each generation until G4. Plants with an <italic>AtTBP1</italic> disruption, however, did not exhibit an obvious phenotypic difference from wild type in the first four generations under normal growth conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Telomere status in <italic>AtTBP1</italic>-deficient <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title><p>As <italic>AtTBP1</italic> mutant plants were visibly indistinguishable from wild-type plants, we next examined the role of <italic>AtTBP1</italic> in telomere length homeostasis by determining telomere length in mutant plants with TRF analysis. A recent study suggested that the Ws ecotype of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> displays a bimodal size distribution, with one group bearing shorter telomeres (2&#x02013;5&#x02009;kb) and the other bearing longer telomeres (4&#x02013;9&#x02009;kb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In our experiments, the wild-type telomeres ranged in size from 2.5 to 4.5&#x02009;kb and were the same size as the telomeres in the short group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lane 2). This short telomere size of wild-type plants was stably inherited for at least four successive generations (data not shown). In sharp contrast, TRF analysis of G2 to G4 mutant populations showed that telomeres in <italic>AtTBP1</italic> homozygous mutants increased steadily to 10&#x02009;kb after four generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, lanes 3&#x02013;5). Thus, telomeres in <italic>AtTBP1</italic> mutants extended to over twice the size of those in wild-type plants in four generations. </p><p>To investigate telomere dynamics in individual plants, we examined TRFs from individual G2 to G4 mutant leaves. As expected, the telomeres in individual mutants increased steadily like those of pooled mutant seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The banding profile of TRFs in individuals was, however, displayed in a more discrete pattern than that of pooled samples. For analysis of individual chromosome ends, TRF analysis was performed with a probe specific to the Ch2R. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, the Ch2R probe displayed a discrete band of 4&#x02013;5&#x02009;kb in wild-type plants, and one or two discrete bands of 4&#x02013;7 kb in mutant plants. Individual telomere tracts at the same generation were distributed within a 1-kb range. These results indicate that the telomeres in individual mutant plants also increased continuously for each generation.</p><p>To verify that the telomere elongation phenotype was associated with the T-DNA insertion in the <italic>AtTBP1</italic> gene, molecular complementation was performed. A wild-type genomic fragment, containing a putative promoter sequence, was introduced into the <italic>AtTBP1</italic> mutant background via <italic>in planta</italic> transformation. Selected T3 transformants were analyzed for <italic>AtTBP1</italic> mRNA expression and telomere length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The complemented mutants expressed wild-type <italic>AtTBP1</italic> mRNA ectopically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). In each case, the ectopic expression of <italic>AtTBP1</italic> prevented the telomere extension and restored the telomere length to that of the wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, lanes 4 and 5). Therefore, we conclude that <italic>attbp1</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; corresponds to a mutant allele of the <italic>AtTBP1</italic> gene. These results also demonstrate that <italic>AtTBP1</italic> is involved in the regulation of telomere length. </p></sec><sec><title>Telomeric DNA-binding activity and the functional telomere-binding domain</title><p>We previously reported that the isolated C-terminal segment of AtTBP1 is capable of sequence-specific binding to plant telomeric repeats <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The <italic>AtTBP1</italic> mutant that we characterized here, carries a T-DNA insertion at the eighth exon, which encodes the putative DNA-binding domain of AtTBP1. Although we could detect no full-length transcripts in <italic>AtTBP1</italic> mutant plants, a transcript of very low abundance, containing the N-terminal sequence upstream of the T-DNA insertion, was detected by RT-PCR. It is unlikely that a truncated protein translated from this RNA would be functional in telomere maintenance. Therefore, we hypothesized that full-length AtTBP1 binds to plant telomeric DNA, whereas the C-terminal deletion mutant does not bind to plant telomeric DNA. Expression of full-length AtTBP1 and mutant AtTBP1 (AtTBP1-&#x00394;Myb) was achieved by using an <italic>in vitro</italic> translation system. As expected, <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of the <italic>AtTBP1</italic> and <italic>AtTBP1-&#x00394;Myb</italic> cDNAs resulted in the synthesis of a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of &#x0223c;70 and &#x0223c;50&#x02009;kDa, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). In order to test whether full-length AtTBP1 binds to plant telomeric DNA, specifically, the <italic>in vitro</italic> translated protein was used in EMSAs with a radiolabeled DNA probe. The reticulocyte lysate, containing AtTBP1, gave rise to a discrete complex, whereas the lysate devoid of AtTBP1 did not exhibit any DNA-binding activity under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 2&#x02013;8). However, the full-length AtTBP1 and telomeric DNA complexes failed to exit the well of the gel, as also noted from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Nevertheless, the intensities of discrete bands increased upon the addition of an increasing amount of the expressed AtTBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 2&#x02013;4). Competition binding experiments showed that a 5-fold excess of cold AtTR-4 is enough to displace the labeled probe, whereas higher molar amounts of unrelated non-specific cold competitor (commercial 1-kb DNA ladder marker or non-plant telomeric repeats, such as the human telomeric repeat, TTAGGG) did not compete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 5&#x02013;7, data not shown). These results demonstrate that the telomeric DNA-binding activity of full-length AtTBP1 increased with increasing amounts of protein, and the binding activity was sequence specific to plant telomeric DNA. In contrast, the AtTBP1-&#x00394;Myb mutant did not bind to plant telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 9 and 10). These results suggest that full-length AtTBP1 is sufficient for specific interaction with duplex telomeric DNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, and the C-terminus of this protein may be required for the telomeric function of AtTBP1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, these results strongly suggest that the telomere length deregulation in the <italic>AtTBP1</italic> mutant may be associated with the loss of the telomeric DNA-binding activity of AtTBP1. </p><p>Sequence analysis of plant TBPs has demonstrated that there are key features of specific, well-conserved domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Interestingly, plant TBPs have an expanded and plant-specific Myb-domain, which is very highly conserved. We asked whether this domain would play an important role in binding to plant telomeric DNA. Recent results have shown that <italic>A. thaliana</italic> TBPs, TRFL1 (At3g12560) and AtTRP1 (At5g59430), have the Myb-extension domain and that this domain is required for binding plant telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). However, these reports did not characterize the functional region of the Myb-extension domain in detail. Therefore, we characterized several mutant AtTBP1 proteins in order to define the minimal length for telomeric-DNA binding and also to examine the binding properties of the Myb-extension domain of AtTBP1. To examine the contribution of the expanded plant-specific Myb domain and to avoid the problem of protein aggregation associated with the full-length protein-binding assay, we performed EMSA with the various mutated forms, using either fragments or the entire GST-AtTBP1<sup>461&#x02013;640</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D demonstrate that the truncated mutants, &#x00394;C1 (461&#x02013;592), &#x00394;C2 (461&#x02013;601), and &#x00394;593&#x02013;618, did not bind to plant telomeric DNA (lanes 4&#x02013;7 and lanes 18&#x02013;20). In contrast, the other mutant proteins, &#x00394;C3 (461&#x02013;609), &#x00394;C4 (461&#x02013;618) and &#x00394;C5 (461&#x02013;622) were capable of binding to the telomeric DNA (lanes 8&#x02013;13). Lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 12 and 13 showed that &#x00394;C5 (461&#x02013;622) formed a complex with plant telomeric DNA which resembled that of the GST-AtTBP1<sup>461&#x02013;640</sup> control. A noteworthy observation is that, when more of the Myb-extension domain of AtTBP1 was deleted, weaker DNA&#x02013;protein complexes were observed (lanes 8 and 9 and lanes 10 and 11). The binding signal of the deletion mutants, &#x00394;C3 and &#x00394;C4, were 39 and 60%, respectively, of that of GST-AtTBP1<sup>461&#x02013;640</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E). Additionally, in order to evaluate the importance of this putative &#x003b1;-helix portion of the Myb-extension domain, we constructed AtTBP1 point mutants, containing a glycine (R607G) or an isoleucine (R607I) at position 607. The single substitution of the 607 arginine residue reduced the capacity to bind telomeric DNA to 41% (R607G) and 23% (R607I), respectively, of that of GST-AtTBP1<sup>461&#x02013;640</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D lanes 21&#x02013;26 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E). These results firmly support the idea that the region of the plant-specific Myb-extension domain between residues 593 and 622 is critical for optimal plant telomere binding of AtTBP1.</p><p>A recent study suggested that hTRF1 enters the nucleus through a nuclear import pathway mediated by Importin and that the concentration of nuclear hTRF1 is critical in regulating telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Based on these observations, we concluded that understanding the NLS (Nuclear Localization Signal)-singular form of AtTBP1 should be important in understanding the biological function of AtTBP1. In order to confirm the nuclear localization of AtTBP1, we performed experiments involving green fluorescent protein fused to AtTBP1. Our localization experiments indicate that AtTBP1 proteins accumulate in nucleus and the NLS for these proteins is present in the fourth basic cluster (287-KRETIHRKRK-296) of the full-length protein (supplementary Figure S2). Thus, these results demonstrate that the functional NLS of AtTBP1 may play crucial roles in telomere functions, such as the localization to the nucleus, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Because onion cells, in which we transiently expressed GFP-AtTBP1, apparently lack <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>-type telomeric repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), we could not show the sub-nuclear localization of AtTBP1. Therefore, further analysis will be required to determine whether this protein associates specifically with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>-chromosome ends <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The telomeres of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> became much longer when the <italic>AtTBP1</italic> gene was disrupted. One possible explanation for this phenomenon derives from the roll that shelterins play in telomere length control. Shelterin determines the t-loop architecture of the telomere terminus and controls the synthesis of telomeric DNA by telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Disturbing expression levels of sheterin components dramatically impacts on telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). As t-loops are also observed at plant telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), the telomere regulation mechanism in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> may be very similar to other eukaryotes. Therefore, the longer telomeres in <italic>AtTBP1</italic> mutant plants could result from a disruption in higher order telomere structure that increases the access of telomerase.</p><p>Several mutational analyses revealed that <italic>A. thaliana</italic> telomeric factors are orthologous to human and yeast telomeric factors, but have some unique functions. For example, <italic>AtKu70</italic> mutants have dramatically extended telomeres that reach to &#x0223c;20&#x02013;30&#x02009;kb by the second generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Additionally, in <italic>AtKu80&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> cells, telomeres have reached their maximum length (ca. &#x0223c;10&#x02009;kb) after 27 weeks, and this length is stable for 34 weeks of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). On the other hand, the telomeres of the <italic>AtTBP1</italic> mutants shown in the present study are like those of <italic>AtMre11</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), which have telomeres extended to &#x0223c;10&#x02009;kb by the fourth generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). These findings demonstrate that these telomeric proteins may have different effects on telomere length. Based on these observations, we suggest that AtTBP1 may have a more subtle role in telomere length regulation, as compared to the double-strand break repair proteins, such as the Ku heterodimer. Recent data showed that <italic>A. thaliana</italic> contains multiple AtTBP1 members which can bind to plant telomeric DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), whereas vertebrates have only two double-strand TBPs, TRF1 and TRF2. Thus, it is possible that the plant shelterin structure is more complex than that of human shelterin. Therefore, whether <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants with mutations in multiple members of this gene family have any effect on telomere homoeostasis needs to be investigated further. In addition, monitoring telomere status in subsequent generations of the <italic>AtTBP1</italic> mutants studied in present study will be necessary to determine whether and when equilibrium is reached.</p><p>The telomeric-DNA-binding function of AtTBP1 is likely to be completely abolished in the <italic>AtTBP1</italic> mutants, based on our <italic>in vitro</italic> results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a polypeptide derived from the AtTBP1 N-terminus, which was detected at the transcript level by RT-PCR, interferes with the biological functions of the telomere machinery <italic>in planta</italic>. Human TRFs contain different N-terminal domains, such as an acidic domain in hTRF1 and a basic domain in hTRF2, as well as a conserved TRF homology domain, which can form homodimers and also mediate interactions with other telomeric proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). These domains play important roles in protein modification, such as ADP-ribosylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which may play a role in telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35 B36 B37 B38 B39">35&#x02013;39</xref>). Like other well-known telomere-binding proteins (TBPs), such as hTRF1 and hTRF2, highly conserved domains are also located in the N-terminus of AtTBP1 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Therefore, whether the N-terminal conserved domains of AtTBP1 are involved in metabolism of this protein and/or the regulation of telomere length needs to be investigated further.</p><p>One of the most conspicuous differences between AtTBP1 and hTRF1 is the presence of a highly conserved Myb-extension domain in AtTBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). We found that the Myb-extension domain is necessary to allow the C-terminus of AtTBP1 to bind to plant telomeric DNA and to stabilize the DNA&#x02013;protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). The NMR structure of the C-terminus of AtTRP1, which is a member of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> TBPs, displays a novel four-helix tetrahedron rather than the three-helix bundle structure, found in hTRF1 families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). However, similar to the hTRF1 Myb-domain, AtTRP1 uses a helix-turn-helix motif to bind to telomeric DNA, and the third helix plays a major role in sequence-specific recognition. Although there are structural similarities between plant and animal proteins, our present data showed that Myb-extension domain deletion mutants of AtTBP1, which have an intact, three-helix bundle motif, like hTRF1, were unable to bind either to plant telomeric DNA or to human telomeric DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D lanes 18&#x02013;20, data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the C-terminus of AtTBP1 comprises a domain unique to plants that specifically recognizes plant telomeric DNA. </p><p>Taken together, our study provides the first insight into the role of AtTBP1 as a negative regulator of telomere homeostasis in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Our results also demonstrate that a plant-specific Myb-extension domain may be critical for recognition of plant telomeric DNA and in stabilization of AtTBP1 binding to plant telomeric DNA. In addition, further analysis of the genetic interactions of AtTBP1 and other telomeric components using previously isolated <italic>A. thaliana</italic> mutants, like <italic>attert, atku70, atku80, atmre11</italic> and others, should help to clarify the contribution of these proteins to telomere maintenance.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data is available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm043_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm043_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank the INRA-FLAG databases for providing the T-DNA knockout resource and Fran&#x000e7;ois Parcy for his kind gift of the pFP100 vector.
