The use of common anticancer drugs is hampered by the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), causing poor distribution of these agents. This restrictive action of the BBB has been linked to the presence on the brain endothelial cells of drug efflux transport systems, especially transporters belonging to the ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], out of which two have been shown to have a functional importance <italic>in vivo </italic>on the BBB: the P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) and the Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP/ABCG2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>One way of efficiently treating glioblastoma is to identify bifunctional molecules able not only to block glioblastoma cells proliferation, but also to cross the BBB without being effluxed by ABC proteins. In searching for such molecules, we targeted the naturally occurring flavonoids and their derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We have already described the potential of flavonoid derivatives as antimitotics and as multidrug reversers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the present report, we describe the biological activities of a new derivative named JAI-51.

The optimization phase, which deals with identification of the optimal substituteds, led to the identification of JAI-51. The access to the target compound was achieved in one step starting from 2',4',6'-trimethoxyacetophenone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

As a control, a known concentration of JAI-51 was analyzed in the same experimental conditions as the samples to be sure that the peak detected corresponded to JAI-51. The detection of the unmetabolized compound was performed on brain, liver and kidney of three untreated mice and on three mice treated with JAI-51 (schedules 1 and 2) two days after the injection. On tumours, the detection was done an hour and a half after the injection, on three untreated mice and on three mice treated with schedule 2, as this schedule was the one showing a significant decrease in the mean tumour volume compared to the control mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data are expressed as the mean &#x000b1; SD of 2 (<italic>in vivo </italic>studies) or at least 3 (<italic>in vitro </italic>studies) experiments.

Some of these molecules cross the BBB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and induce apoptosis in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], but to date no molecule displaying all these activities has been described. In this context, we report the <italic>in-vitro </italic>and <italic>in-vivo </italic>effects of a new chalcone derivative, named JAI-51.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic>, JAI-51 reduces the proliferation of glioblastoma cell lines from human and mouse origins and induces apoptosis, in some cases through a Caspase-3 dependent pathway, depending on the cell line studied. For U138 cell line, a Caspase-independent apoptosis process could be involved, as reviewed by Tait and Green [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This phenomenon can occur during mitosis and has been described to be a mechanism for protecting cells from an endoreplicative process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated that flavonoids can induce apoptosis by both Caspase-mediated or Caspase-independent processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our compound acts in a dose- or a time-dependent manner: low doses or short induction times induce a cytostatic effect whereas higher concentrations or higher induction times induce a cytolytic effect. The differences in the reactions of the various cell lines on JAI-51 incubation were not related to the presence of P-gp or BCRP, as a functional assay showed no accumulation of daunorubicin (P-gp substrate) or mitoxantrone (BCRP substrate) in these cell lines (data not shown). Hence, the differences in the cytostatic effects of JAI-51 on the cell lines tested were probably due to differences in the doubling times of these cell lines. Cytological analyses showed that JAI-51 blocks cell cycle in metaphase, probably by modulating microtubule stability. This destabilizing effect was characterized in a cell-free system and the substoichiometric concentrations of JAI-51 in relation with the tubulin concentration were sufficient to block tubulin polymerization in a way similar to vincaalkaloids or colchicine. JAI-51 is able to compete with colchicine for the same binding site that induces inhibition of tubulin polymerization. Tubulin targeting agents are usually classified in two groups, according to their effects: microtubule stabilizers such as taxol and epothilone and microtubule destabilizers including vincaalkaloids and colchicine. In the same way as microtubule destabilizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], JAI-51 is able to disrupt the formation of microtubules, leading to pronounced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Classically, one of the limiting phenomena for the use of common microtubule destabilizers is drug resistance mediated by P-gp or BCRP. However, in the present study, no differential cytotoxic activities (through cell cycle analysis) were observed between sensitive and resistant cell lines overexpressing P-gp or BCRP, suggesting that JAI-51 is not a substrate for these efflux pumps, in drastic contrast to vinblastine and paclitaxel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In accordance with our results, Liu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] reported a chalcone which can inhibit both P-gp and BCRP and whose structure is similar to that of JAI-51, which was developed from a basic chalcone with a meta dimethoxy motif on ring A, an important feature for activity, as proposed by Seelig and Landwojtowicz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Moreover, the active concentrations used in the study of Liu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] are closely related to those obtained in our experiments. However the authors didn't investigate the biological activities of their compound other that P-gp and BCRP inhibition.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, in a model of sc GL26 xenografted C57BL/6 mice, our compound induced a delay in tumour onset and a tumour growth inhibition at 96 mg/kg once a week (schedule 2). In accordance with these results, HPLC analysis of tumours from mice treated with schedule 2 showed that JAI-51 reached concentrations similar to those inducing a cytostatic effect in our <italic>in vitro </italic>studies.</p><p>JAI-51 was also detected by HPLC in the liver, kidney and brain of treated mice. As these organs express a high level of ABC pumps, these results reinforce those obtained <italic>in vitro </italic>showing that our compound is a modulator without being a substrate of these ABC pumps. Moreover, as JAI-51 was detected in the brain of the treated mice, this shows that our compound is able to cross the BBB. In addition, no toxicity in terms of blood cell counts, body weight or behaviour was observed in the treated animals (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In view of our results, when compared to other anticancer agents, our compound possesses a number of interesting properties.
