Visualization of the DCC, a large ribonucleoprotein complex, on male larval polytene chromosomes reveals that the complex binds selectively to many interbands on the X chromosome. The targeting of the DCC is thought to be in part determined by DNA sequences that are enriched on the X. So far, lack of knowledge about DCC binding sites has prevented the identification of sequence determinants. Only three binding sites have been identified to date, but analysis of their DNA sequence did not allow the prediction of further binding sites. We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify a number of new DCC binding fragments and characterized them in vivo by visualizing DCC binding to autosomal insertions of these fragments, and we have demonstrated that they possess a wide range of potential to recruit the DCC. By varying the in vivo concentration of the DCC, we provide evidence that this range of recruitment potential is due to differences in affinity of the complex to these sites. We were also able to establish that DCC binding to ectopic high-affinity sites can allow nearby low-affinity sites to recruit the complex. Using the sequences of the newly identified and previously characterized binding fragments, we have uncovered a number of short sequence motifs, which in combination may contribute to DCC recruitment. Our findings suggest that the DCC is recruited to the X via a number of binding sites of decreasing affinities, and that the presence of high- and moderate-affinity sites on the X may ensure that lower-affinity sites are occupied in a context-dependent manner. Our bioinformatics analysis suggests that DCC binding sites may be composed of variable combinations of degenerate motifs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>In fruit flies, just like in humans, the two sexes are distinguished by different sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes and hence a double dose of all X-linked genes when compared to males, which only have a single X chromosome. This different gene dosage needs to be compensated for by adjusting transcription levels such that male and female cells synthesize equal amounts of gene products. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> dosage compensation occurs by doubling the transcription of many genes on the single male X. This chromosome-wide control is achieved by a male-specific dosage compensation complex (DCC), which contains enzymes, structural proteins, and non-coding RNA. How is the DCC able to distinguish the X chromosome from the autosomes for selective interaction? In the following article, the authors identify and characterize several novel DNA sequences on the X chromosome that can recruit the DCC. Their results suggest that the X chromosome contains a large number of binding sites for the DCC, which are made up of combinations of degenerate sequence elements. These elements constitute binding sites with varying affinities for the complex. Collectively, their abundance on the X chromosome restricts the action of DCC to the X chromosomal territory.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Dahlsveen IK, Gilfillan GD, Shelest VI, Lamm R, Becker PB (2006) Targeting determinants of dosage compensation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

Genetic sex determination in animals usually involves a pair of heterologous sex chromosomes and leads to a chromosome imbalance between males and females. Consequently, the process of dosage compensation is necessary to ensure equal expression of sex chromosome&#x02013;linked genes. Studies in different species have revealed that dosage compensation may be achieved through different modes of chromosome-wide transcriptional regulation, and that different means of targeting the selected chromosome may be employed (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;). In all cases, the chromosome or chromosomes to be regulated are marked by the presence of specific protein or ribonucleoprotein complexes as well as alterations in chromatin structure.</p><p>In mammals, dosage compensation is achieved by the inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in females. The selection of this chromosome for inactivation is initiated from a single locus, the X inactivation center (XIC) on the X (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;). This locus encodes the non-coding <italic>Xist</italic> RNA whose accumulation is necessary and sufficient to mark the chromosome for inactivation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. In the worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> gene expression from both X chromosomes in hermaphrodites is reduced to about half when compared to expression of the single X chromosomes in males (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;). This is achieved by the binding of a multi-subunit dosage compensation complex (DCC) along the entire length of both X chromosomes. In this case, the selection of the chromosomes is not due to a single locus, but is thought to involve multiple recognition sites for the DCC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. In the fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> dosage compensation is also achieved by a large ribonucleoprotein complex (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> DCC, however, is recruited to the single male X chromosome and leads to an approximate two-fold increase in transcription of many X-linked genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. The selection of the X in flies uses a system with similarities to both mechanisms mentioned above, relying in part on the expression and accumulation of two non-coding RNAs from the X and in part on the presence of specific recruitment sites distinguishing the X from other chromosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The DCC of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> contains at least five proteins and one of two non-coding RNAs that are all essential for male survival.

The function of the two non-coding RNAs, <italic>roX1</italic> (RNA on the X) and <italic>roX2,</italic> is so far unknown. However, all the structural components and both enzymatic activities, as well as at least one RNA, are required for proper targeting of the DCC to the male X and its distribution over the entire chromosome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b021">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.

The binding pattern of the DCC is well defined, being restricted to interbands on the male X chromosome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Mutations in DCC components change this binding pattern. If MSL1 or MSL2 are mutated, the entire complex is lost from the X chromosome. Mutations in the remaining components lead to binding of partial complexes to a defined subset of sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, which shows the distribution of MSL1 on polytene chromosomes of female larvae expressing MSL2 ectopically and carrying mutations in <italic>mle, msl-3,</italic> and <italic>mof</italic>.

MSL2-expression constructs with mutations in the 5&#x02032; and/or 3&#x02032; UTR that make them less sensitive to regulation by SXL (SXB-1, NOPU), can be used to express different levels of MSL2 protein in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;). As previously noted &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, the subset of sites visible in these females matches those visible in females carrying <italic>msl</italic> mutations .</p><p>The identification and characterization of two specific binding sites for the DCC within the <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic> genes provided support for the &#x0201c;recruitment and spreading&#x0201d; model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.

When <italic>roX</italic> genes were inserted into autosomes via P element transformation, the DCC was recruited to the insertion site both in wild-type and mutant backgrounds, suggesting that these genes contain &#x0201c;entry sites&#x0201d; for the complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Detailed studies led to the identification of a 110 base pair (bp) DNA binding element within male-specific DNAseI hypersensitive sites in both <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Importantly, the DCC could occasionally be seen to spread from the ectopic <italic>roX</italic> loci to neighboring autosomal chromatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. The spreading was characterized by DCC binding close to the insertion sites on polytene chromosomes. Further studies revealed that the spreading could be expanded by raising the levels of DCC present in the cell or reducing the number of <italic>roX</italic> loci &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The &#x0201c;entry-site and spreading&#x0201d; model appeared attractive because of its similarity to current views of how mammalian X inactivation is achieved. However, the generality of the model was challenged by more recent studies, which showed that recruitment of the DCC is not a property of a small set of entry sites, as many large X-derived fragments were able to recruit the complex to ectopic autosomal sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, characterization of a third DCC binding site at polytene band 18D10 revealed only minimal spreading in rare cases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. No spreading was observed from X to autosome translocations, even when they contained a <italic>roX</italic> gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, when pieces of autosomes were translocated to the X, the DCC did not bind to the translocated chromatin, but stayed specific to X derived chromatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Collectively, these results lead to the proposition of an alternative model for the recruitment of the DCC to the X not involving spreading, but rather involving a large number of specific binding sites with varying affinities for the complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. In this model, each site of DCC binding on the X involves specific recognition and only depends on the concentration of the complex available. Studies of DCC binding in females expressing varying levels of MSL2, discussed above, support the concept of sites with different affinities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Clearly, evaluation and refinement of current concepts for DCC recruitment requires analysis of a larger number of DCC binding sites. In this study we have used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to identify a number of new DCC binding fragments (DBFs) from the X and characterized them in vivo. Among them are sites that are bound by the DCC even in <italic>msl</italic> mutant backgrounds (novel &#x0201c;chromatin entry sites&#x0201d; by the old nomenclature). We show that the identified fragments have different abilities to recruit the DCC when inserted into autosomes. By varying complex levels, we gained support for the existence of sites with different affinities for the complex on the X. Rare cases of secondary binding sites close to high-affinity inserts appear not to be due to non-specific spreading of the complex along the chromatin fiber, but rather to recognition of low-affinity binding sites nearby. In addition, we identified pairs of sequence elements that are common between the new high-affinity DBFs and previously characterized sites, and found that some of these are modestly enriched on the X.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of DCC Binding Fragments Using ChIP</title><p>To identify DNA fragments associated with the DCC, we performed ChIP from mixed-sex <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos using anti-MSL1 antibodies.

Visual comparison of MSL1 versus mock ChIP signals revealed several clones that were enriched in the MSL1 ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).

In cases in which no single band could be identified as the strongest site of hybridization, two bands were selected. Hybridization with an MSL3 ChIP probe to the digests produced a similar pattern, verifying the enrichment of the DCC on these fragments (data not shown). The selected restriction fragments were cloned and subjected to a third round of hybridization. Quantification of the MSL1 ChIP signals compared to the mock signals allowed us to select a single candidate fragment from each P1 clone.

The overlap of the signals was confirmed by confocal microscopy (data not shown). Two of the DCC binding fragments, DBF12 and DBF11, are located only 20 kb apart within the same gene.

In summary, the results from the immuno-FISH experiments (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020005-t001">Table 1</xref>) indicated that the fragments identified by ChIP were all very close to or coincident with in vivo DCC binding sites and hence good candidates for DCC binding determinants. Furthermore, the set of fragments contains representatives of different classes of DCC binding determinants, as defined by MSL1 binding in different genetic backgrounds.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>In Vivo Analysis of DCC Binding Fragments</title><p>It is possible that the DNA fragments found to be associated with the DCC by ChIP do not represent recruitment sites for the DCC, but rather represent the distribution of active complex on the X chromosome. In order to investigate if the new DBFs were able to recruit the DCC in vivo, we employed the same assay as was used in the analysis of the <italic>roX1, roX2,</italic> and 18D sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. The ten DBFs were cloned into the pCasper4 P-element vector for generation of transgenic flies. Preliminary analysis of the DBF sequences had revealed that a number of them contained OPA repeats &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. To investigate a possible role for OPA repeats in DCC binding in vivo, DBF12 was split to yield a 5&#x02032; construct containing the OPA sequences (DBF12-A) and a 3&#x02032; construct devoid of such repeats (DBF12-B). Due to its large size, DBF9 was also cloned in two halves, generating DBF9-A and DBF9-B. For each construct, several different insertions of the P element on the second and/or third chromosomes were selected. The insertion sites were mapped by DNA FISH using the mini-white gene as a probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Recruitment of the DCC to the inserts was analyzed by anti-MSL1 immunostaining on polytene chromosomes. It had previously been shown that the presence of MSL1 entails the presence of the whole DCC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. For each DBF, we analyzed between three and five different inserts in order to minimize bias from position effects. For each insert in each genetic background, a total of 50&#x02013;100 nuclei from two or three different individuals were examined. It was immediately clear that the different DBF insertions possessed different DCC recruitment abilities. Variation could be observed in the signal intensity of the anti-MSL1 staining compared to the signals on the X as well as the number of nuclei in which the signal could be observed. Typically, strong signals were observed in a high percentage of nuclei, whereas weak signals could only be observed in a subset of nuclei. In addition, different insertions of the same DBF showed different recruitment abilities indicating that they were subject to position effects.</p><p>Recruitment of the DCC to autosomal insertions of DBF constructs was first investigated in wild-type males. For nine out of the eleven DBFs, anti-MSL1 signals could be detected for at least one insert. DBF5, DBF6, DBF7, DBF12-B, and DBF9-B had strong recruitment ability at all insertion sites, whereas DBF1, DBF9-A, DBF11, and DBF13 had variable recruitment ability (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020005-t002">Table 2</xref>). These initial results indicated that the enrichment of the DBF sequences in the MSL1 ChIP indeed reflects an in vivo association of the DCC with most of these sequences. No anti-MSL1 signal could be detected at any inserts of DBF3 and DBF10. These fragments are also among the weakest DCC interaction sites in their native X chromosomal context (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Inserts of DBF12-A were also unable to recruit the DCC, excluding a connection between OPA repeats and DCC binding. The variability in the recruitment of the DCC indicates that the identified fragments have different affinities for the complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Recruitment of the DCC at Varying Complex Concentrations</title><p>Investigation of differences in affinity between DBFs requires that the levels of intact complex be varied. As discussed in the introduction, expression of varying MSL2 levels in females leads to corresponding levels of intact DCC, which associates with both X chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We first investigated the ability of the ten DBFs to recruit the DCC in females carrying one copy of the SXB1-2D MSL2-expression construct. Due to lower than wild-type MSL2 levels only 30&#x02013;60 DCC binding sites are visible on the X chromosomes of these females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g001">Figure 1</xref>, &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;). Those fragments that gave rise to the most robust binding in wild-type males were also able to recruit the DCC in this background, albeit less efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Insertions of DBF12, DBF9-B, and DBF5 showed intermediate anti-MSL1 signals, whereas insertions of DBF6, DBF7, and DBF1 showed only very weak and occasional signals. None of the other fragments seemed to recruit the DCC at this concentration of complex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020005-t002">Table 2</xref>). Next we analyzed recruitment ability in females carrying one copy of the NOPU MSL2 construct. In these females, the DCC binds to between 60&#x02013;120 sites on the X, reflecting higher levels of MSL2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g001">Figure 1</xref>,&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;). Under these conditions the recruitment potential of DBF6, DBF7, and DBF1 was enhanced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020005-t002">Table 2</xref>). In addition, one insert of both DBF9-A and DBF11 showed weak anti-MSL1 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These results provide further evidence that the DBFs we isolated have different affinities for the DCC in vivo.</p><p>None of the autosomal inserts of DBF3 or DBF10 were able to recruit the DCC in wild-type males. In addition, some inserts of DBFs with moderate recruitment ability (i.e., DBF11 and DBF13) were also negative for MSL1 binding in vivo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020005-t002">Table 2</xref>). We wanted to investigate if increasing the concentration of the DCC in the nucleus would allow DCC binding to such sites. Over-expressing MSL1 and MSL2 in male flies raises the levels of the DCC leading to increased binding to the X, which disrupts the morphology of this chromosome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, the association of the DCC with many autosomal sites becomes visible &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. We found that DBF inserts with weak recruitment potential showed more robust binding of the DCC under conditions of MSL1 and MSL2 over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020005-t002">Table 2</xref>). In addition, some inserts that were not bound in wild-type males, such as inserts of DBF3, recruited the DCC when MSL1 and MSL2 were over-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g006">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020005-t002">Table 2</xref>). This suggests that DBF3 has very low affinity for the complex, whereas DBF10 and DBF12-A have no detectable affinity in this assay. However, we cannot exclude that critical DCC binding determinants were lost during the selection and subcloning of these fragments from the original P1 clones.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Recruitment of Partial Complexes</title><p>To investigate the ability of the DBFs to recruit partial and non-functional DCC complexes, we looked for anti-MSL1 staining in the <italic>msl</italic> mutant backgrounds. The analysis was done in females expressing MSL2 and homozygous for the <italic>msl-3<sup>1</sup></italic> or <italic>mof<sup>1</sup></italic> mutations. All the inserts that showed recruitment in wild-type males were tested for recruitment of complexes lacking MSL3. From the initial immuno-FISH analysis, we knew that at least four of the endogenous DBF loci overlap with DCC binding sites in this background. Indeed, DBF12-B, DBF9-B, and DBF6 were able to consistently recruit partial DCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g007">Figure 7</xref>) and, therefore, qualify as novel &#x0201c;chromatin entry sites&#x0201d; in the old terminology. One insert of DBF5 also shows weak anti-MSL1 signals in the <italic>msl-3<sup>1</sup></italic> background, so may be considered a fourth new entry site. The <italic>mof<sup>1</sup></italic> mutation leads to the formation of a DCC that lacks the histone acetyltransferase activity. In terms of DCC recruitment to the X, the <italic>mof<sup>1</sup></italic> mutation is less damaging than the <italic>msl-3<sup>1</sup></italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g001">Figure 1</xref>). DBF insertions that recruit the DCC in the <italic>msl-3<sup>1</sup></italic> background would therefore also be expected to recruit the DCC in a <italic>mof<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant background, and this was demonstrated for a subset of inserts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020005-t002">Table 2</xref>). In addition, two inserts of DBF7 were able to recruit the DCC weakly in the <italic>mof<sup>1</sup></italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The binding fragments with low affinity for the DCC were not able to recruit partial or mutant complexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020005-t002">Table 2</xref>). We conclude that the affinity of binding sites as judged from recruitment at different DCC levels correlates with their ability to attract partial or non-functional complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Additional Binding of the DCC Close to Ectopic High-Affinity Sites</title><p>During our analysis of the DBFs in wild-type males, we observed rare cases of additional DCC binding close to inserts of the high-affinity fragments DBF12, DBF5, and DBF7 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020005-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This is reminiscent of the minimal &#x0201c;spreading&#x0201d; of the DCC observed from the <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic> transgenes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d; and the more recently described 18D site &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Because more extensive spreading from <italic>roX</italic> transgenes (both in terms of number of additional binding sites and distance from the insertion) could be achieved by raising the levels of DCC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, we investigated if we could induce spreading from other high-affinity sites by over-expressing MSL1 and MSL2. Even at increased DCC levels, we could not detect additional bands of DCC binding close to any inserts other than those already seen to support such additional binding events. For the three inserts that did show a secondary band in wild-type nuclei, this band could be detected more often if MSL1 and MSL2 were over-expressed (data not shown). However, the secondary bands associated with the DBF9-B-96C and DBF5-91F inserts could also be observed in controls over-expressing MSL1 and MSL2 in which the inserts were not present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Consequently, these additional bands belong to those autosomal sequences of lowest affinity that attract complex only if DCC concentrations are experimentally increased beyond physiological levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Identification of Common Sequence Elements in DCC Binding Fragments</title><p>This study has lead to the identification of a number of new high-affinity binding fragments for the DCC. We explored whether it was possible to identify common elements between these and previously characterized fragments that may contribute to defining DCC binding sites. We considered DBF12-B, DBF9-B, DBF6, DBF5, and DBF7 to contain high-affinity sites as they produced consistent DCC recruitment in wild-type males as well as in <italic>msl-3<sup>1</sup></italic> and/or <italic>mof<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants. In addition, we included the full-length <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic> sequences &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d; and the 8.8 kb fragment of 18D &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. DBF10 and two large autosomal regions from 2L and 3R represent fragments with no affinity for the DCC (no recruitment of the DCC on polytene chromosomes) and thus provided control sequences. Initial analysis suggested that there were no simple nucleotide sequences or &#x0201c;words&#x0201d; (6&#x02013;10 bp) in common between all the high-affinity fragments that were also absent from the control fragments. It is, however, conceivable that the DCC binding sites consist of combinations or clusters of different words. In order to search for such combinations, we limited the search to words that were present in the <italic>roX1</italic> or <italic>roX</italic>2 DHS fragments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d; as these are the best-studied high-affinity sites. Using these words, we identified a set of &#x0201c;elements&#x0201d; present in at least six out of the eight candidate fragments that consist of families of 6&#x02013;8 bp words related to each other by a defined allowance for mismatches (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). None of these elements were absent in the control sequences.</p><p>In order to investigate possible clustering, we looked for pairs of elements found within a 5&#x02013;200 bp window. We identified a large number of pairs present in at least six out of eight of the high-affinity fragments and absent in controls. Many of the pairs were very similar or overlapping, and by merging related pairs, we could generate a list of 61 pairs of elements with two or fewer mismatches between the individual words of each element. All of these pairs were absent in the control sequences and present in a larger number of high-affinity fragments (seven or eight out of eight) than the individual component pairs (a list of all 61 element pairs is available on request).</p><p>It would be expected that any element or combination of elements (such as a pair) involved in dosage compensation should be over-represented on the X chromosome compared to other chromosomes. We therefore individually compared the frequency of occurrence of each of the 61 element pairs on the X to the frequency on the five other chromosome arms. We found that 24 of the pairs were modestly, but significantly, enriched on the X compared to other chromosomes. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020005-st001">Table S1</xref> contains a list of the pairs with significant enrichment on the X, grouped together according to sequence similarities. For each pair, we also calculated the percentage of occurrence on the X out of total genomic occurrences. Compared to the percentage expected from a random distribution, all pairs occurred more often on the X than expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020005-st001">Table S1</xref>). The X chromosome enrichment of most of the pairs may be explained by the presence of GAGA-related sequences in one of the elements. It has previously been shown that GA dinucleotide repeats are over-represented on the X &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. It is interesting to note, however, that most of the pairs are found at appreciably higher frequency in the high-affinity fragments compared to the moderate- and low-affinity fragments DBF1, DBF9-A, DBF11, DBF13, and DBF3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020005-st001">Table S1</xref>). Our results suggest that it is possible to identify pairs of short elements in common between most of the high affinity fragments, which are also over-represented on the X chromosome. However, the localization of these pairs is not exclusive to the X and therefore not sufficient to explain the X-specific localization of the DCC<bold>.</bold></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>DCC Binding Sites of Different Affinities</title><p>Using a ChIP strategy, we have identified several new DCC binding fragments and demonstrated that they possess a wide range of potential to recruit the DCC. Because the majority of the isolated candidate fragments co-map with endogenous DCC binding sites at the resolution afforded by staining of polytene chromosomes, we believe our ChIP selection procedure was appropriate. By tuning DCC levels in vivo, we came to conclude that the difference in recruitment ability is due to different affinity of the DCC for these fragments. At limiting concentrations of complex, only the sites of highest affinity are occupied. Conversely, at non-physiologically high concentrations of DCC, even &#x0201c;cryptic&#x0201d; binding sites on autosomes are recognized by the complex. This suggests, in concordance with previous observations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, that selective interaction of the DCC with the X chromosome is a function of tightly controlled levels of complex components that are adjusted to assure interaction with binding sites of varying affinity clustered on the X, but insufficient to occupy cryptic sequences on autosomes. Our data are also in broad agreement with recent observations from Oh et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d; and Fagegaltier and Baker &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, who found that numerous sites on the X chromosomes contain DCC binding determinants. We now show that these determinants are not all equal, but represent a diverse set of DCC targets that differ by a wide range of affinities for the complex, as expected from a sequence determinant that became gradually enriched on the X chromosome during evolution.</p><p>The use of the term &#x0201c;chromatin entry sites&#x0201d; for the subset of DCC binding sites that are still occupied by partial complexes in the absence of MSL3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, implied that these sites were somehow qualitatively and perhaps functionally distinct from the remaining sites that only attract the intact complex. Although it is possible that not all DCC binding sites are functionally equivalent, our characterization of several new examples of both types of DCC binding sites rather supports the &#x0201c;affinities model&#x0201d; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. According to this model, &#x0201c;chromatin entry sites&#x0201d; are not qualitatively different from other sites, but only represent those sites with the highest affinity for the complex. A prediction from this model that is further substantiated by our results is that non-functional complexes that lack MSL3 or the acetyltransferase activity of MOF have lower affinity for target sites. Only those determinants with highest affinity for the DCC are able to recruit partial complexes in the absence of MSL3. Sites with slightly lower affinity are still able to recruit the complex in the <italic>mof<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant. Because the interaction of the DCC with the X chromosome is thought to be largely mediated by MSL1 and MSL2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;, it remains to be explored whether MSL3 and the acetylase activity of MOF affect the active concentration of MSL1 and MSL2 or lead instead to the adoption of a high-affinity conformation of the complex. Conversely, it remains to be seen if over-expression of MSL1 and MSL2 in the <italic>msl-3<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>mof<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants would allow partial complexes to bind additional sites. In this respect it is intriguing that the mutation of both <italic>roX</italic> RNAs, which is presumed to lead to incomplete and non-functional complexes, can be partially rescued by the over-expression of MSL1 and MSL2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Distribution of the DCC</title><p>During our analysis of DCC recruitment to high-affinity sites inserted into autosomes of wild-type males, we observed an additional band of DCC binding close to the insertion site in three independent cases (one insert each of DBF9, DBF5, and DBF7). Such minimal and rare &#x0201c;spreading&#x0201d; has previously been observed for ectopic insertions of the 18D high-affinity site &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d; and from <italic>roX</italic> transgenes in the wild-type male background &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Our study now reveals that these additional DCC binding sites are not a result of random spreading, but are most likely due to interaction of the DCC with one of the low-affinity sites on autosomes, which happened to reside close to the insertion site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g008">Figure 8</xref>). These sites are usually only observed when the DCC concentrations are globally increased by over-expression of MSL1 and MSL2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Accordingly, we suggest that the autosomal insertion of a high-affinity DCC binding site leads to a local rise in complex concentration, which allows these low-affinity sites to be recognized by the DCC even in wild-type males. However, additional requirements must clearly be met to allow low-affinity sites to profit from local increases in complex concentration, as not all ectopic high-affinity sites support the phenomenon (I. K. Dahlsveen, unpublished data). Permissive conditions may include active transcription or the presence of specific epigenetic marks.</p><p>We envision that the clustering of DCC binding determinants of high and intermediate affinity on the X chromosome (combined with the transcription of the <italic>roX</italic> RNAs) elevates the concentration of the DCC within the X chromosomal territory and ensures the occupancy of lower-affinity sites in a context-dependent manner. This may explain the observation that autosomally derived transgenes often acquire dosage compensation. The transgenes may contain cryptic DCC binding determinants and may thus acquire binding if placed in the context of the X chromosomal territory. Conversely, an X chromosomal fragment that harbors only low-affinity sites may not be recognized if translocated to an autosomal context, and our fragment DBF3 may be an example for such a scenario. The presence of a large number of low-affinity sites may also contribute significantly to restricting the binding of the DCC to the X chromosome.</p><p>The term &#x0201c;spreading&#x0201d; has been used to describe the appearance of additional bands of DCC binding around autosomal insertions of <italic>roX</italic> cDNAs or fragments derived thereof &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. However, extensive, long-range spreading from <italic>roX</italic> transgenes, which leads to the appearance of many ectopic DCC bands at greater distances from the insertion sites, only occurs under unusual conditions and depends on the transcription of the <italic>roX</italic> RNA rather than the DCC binding sites on DNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;.

We suggest that large translocations maintain their original chromosomal context (DCC enriched or not), and therefore no redistribution of DCC over the new chromosomal junction is observable at the resolution of the polytene chromosomes. Importantly, our study does not address the higher-resolution distribution of the DCC within a chromosomal band. It is possible that such a band contains many individual binding sites, also of varying affinity. At this resolution, the term &#x0201c;spreading&#x0201d; may characterize the local diffusion of the DCC from high- to low-affinity sites. Our study does not exclude this type of spreading, or indeed any other kind of complex distribution within a chromosomal band. High-resolution ChIP analyses will be necessary to resolve the detailed nature of DCC distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Defining DCC Binding Sites</title><p>Previously, only three high-affinity binding sites for DCC were known &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Our study identified nine more fragments, which encouraged investigation of common features within a larger pool. Interestingly, we find that all new DBFs map to gene-rich regions and either overlap with or lie close to essential genes. Three high-affinity fragments (DBF12, DBF9, and DBF6) reside entirely within genes. It is possible that specific recruitment sites, such as those inferred to reside within our DBFs, have been enriched in and around genes that require dosage compensation during evolution &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, and consequently, high-affinity sites may represent loci that are particularly dosage sensitive. Previous experiments indicated that the DCC tends to bind to the coding regions of genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;, and it was suggested that this was linked to transcriptional activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. Although recent observations suggest that transcriptional activity alone is not sufficient to attract DCC binding &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;, it is possible that transcription influences DCC recruitment to specific sites. For example, high-affinity sites, which in our assays show consistent and strong recruitment of the DCC at many chromosomal positions, may not be influenced by transcription. However, sites with lower affinity and variable recruitment ability may profit from transcriptional activity. Developmental differences in transcriptional activity may therefore also explain the lack of DCC recruitment in salivary glands to fragments isolated by ChIP from embryos.</p><p>We have attempted to identify common sequence elements within previously characterized and new high-affinity DCC binding fragments and have uncovered a number of short sequence elements, whose clustering in combinations could contribute to DCC recruitment. Clearly, the importance of these elements remains to be tested experimentally. Previous analysis of the <italic>roX</italic> DCC binding sites identified a 110 bp sequence containing several blocks of conservation between <italic>roX1</italic> and <italic>roX2</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. DCC binding was affected by mutation in several of the conserved blocks, indicating that DCC binding sites may be made up of combinations of shorter elements. We have started to look for such combinations by defining pairs of elements found within a 200 bp window in the high-affinity DCC binding fragments. Those pairs that are significantly enriched on the X chromosome compared to other chromosomes are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020005-st001">Table S1</xref>. Importantly, these X-enriched pairs often occur in multiple copies in the high-affinity fragments (not shown) and at higher frequencies compared to the lower-affinity fragments DBF9-A, DBF1, DBF11, DBF13, and DBF3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020005-st001">Table S1</xref>). Nonetheless, there is no obvious correlation between the location of individual pairs on the X and any specific features such as predicted genes. We hypothesize that the elements that define these pairs (and other such elements that may have escaped our attention) correspond to building blocks of DCC binding sites. Accordingly, a DCC binding site of given affinity for the complex would not be determined by a unique DNA sequence, but by clustering of variable combinations of short, degenerate sequence motifs, as previously suggested &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Individual low-affinity binding sites may not be unique to the X, but their clustering on the X may contribute to high-affinity binding &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. We already have indications that the DCC binds to several sites in close proximity. The two parts of DBF9, DBF9-A and DBF9-B, are both able to recruit the DCC, albeit with different affinity. The analysis of the 18D high-affinity fragment also suggested that multiple elements over 8.8 kb contribute to the binding of the complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020005-st001">Table S1</xref>, we have ordered the pairs according to sequence similarity. Interestingly, a large family of elements contain GAGA-related motifs. Mutation of GAGA or CTCT motifs in the 110 bp <italic>roX1</italic>/<italic>roX2</italic> consensus severely affected DCC recruitment to that sequence, indicating that GAGA motifs are involved in DCC binding &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. The fact that we find these elements enriched in several independently identified high-affinity fragments demonstrates the appropriateness of our algorithms. Besides elements with a clear relationship to GAGA motifs, we also noticed several other element families defined by sequence similarity (separated by broad horizontal bars in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020005-st001">Table S1</xref>). In order to visualize the element families, the related words may be aligned such that sequence logos representing degenerate motifs can be derived using the WebLogo software (<ext-link xlink:href="http://weblogo.cbr.nrc.ca" ext-link-type="uri">http://weblogo.cbr.nrc.ca</ext-link>). Pairs of representative motifs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020005-g009">Figure 9</xref>, but the logos are less constrained than the original pairs of elements and therefore do not only represent pairs specifically enriched on the X. However, we consider it possible that some of these degenerate motifs may contribute to DCC binding sites. Evaluation of the contributions of these novel motifs to the targeting of the complex will require increased resolution analysis and systematic evaluation of candidate sequences in the in vivo recruitment assay.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>DCC&#x02013;DNA Interactions</title><p>Our study suggests that high-affinity DCC binding sites are composed of variable combinations of clustered, degenerate sequence motifs. The degeneracy of the sequence motifs indicates that many individual elements may have low affinity. Therefore, the interaction of the DCC with each individual site should be in dynamic equilibrium. However, we recently observed by photobleaching techniques that the DCC components most likely involved in chromatin binding, MSL2 and MSL1, interact with the X chromosomal territory in cultured cells in an unusually stable manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;, which is not compatible with binding equilibria involving off-rates that commonly characterize protein&#x02013;DNA interactions. Several hypotheses can be formulated, whose evaluation may lead to resolution of this apparent contradiction. First, formation of higher-order structures involving many DCC components engaged in numerous simultaneous DNA interactions may lead to a trapping of the DCC within the X chromosome territory. Second, an initial sequence-directed targeting event may be followed by a stabilization of the interaction through positive reinforcement involving additional principles, such as epigenetic marks or a topological linkage (see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020005-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d; for discussion). Finally, we consider that the arrangement of the interphase genome in polytene chromosomes may differ in a relevant aspect from the more compact chromosomal territories of diploid cultured cells. Ultimately, the identification of the DNA-binding domains of DCC components and analysis of their mode of DNA interaction will be required to solve the targeting issue.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>P1 clones and cloning of DBFs.</title><p>Bacteriophage P1 clone (sources of DBF clones) identifiers are as follows: DBF1 (DS00954); DBF2 (DS05757); DBF3 (DS02577); DBF4 (DS04038); DBF5 (DS00375); DBF6 (DS05338); DBF7 (DS00951); DBF8 (DS06397); DBF9 (DS09077); DBF10 (DS08342); DBF11 (DS08372); DBF12 (DS04200); DBF13 (DS01141); DBF14 (DS04283).

The DBF3-96B insert does not recruit the DCC in wild-type males, but recruitment can be seen when MSL1 and MSL2 are over-expressed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0020005.g006"/></fig><fig id="pgen-0020005-g007" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>High-Affinity DCC Binding Fragments Recruit Partial and Inactive Complexes in <italic>msl-3<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>mof<sup>1</sup></italic> Mutants</title><p>Examples of DCC recruitment to DBF inserts in females expressing MSL2 and carrying mutations in <italic>msl-3<sup>1</sup></italic> (<italic>w</italic>/<italic>w; msl-3<sup>1</sup>,</italic> &#x0005b;w&#x0002b; Hsp83 MSL2&#x0005d;/&#x0002b;) or <italic>mof<sup>1</sup></italic> (<italic>mof<sup>1</sup></italic>/<italic>mof<sup>1</sup>;</italic> &#x0002b;; &#x0005b;w&#x0002b; Hsp83 MSL2&#x0005d;/&#x0002b;).
