Unrepaired DSBs are thought to trigger apoptosis during midpachytene of male meiosis if synapsis fails. An early pachytene response to asynapsis is meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC), which, in normal males, silences the X and Y chromosomes (meiotic sex chromosome inactivation [MSCI]). In this study, we show that MSUC occurs in <italic>Spo11</italic>-null mouse spermatocytes with extensive asynapsis but lacking meiotic DSBs. In contrast, three mutants (<italic>Dnmt3l, Msh5</italic>, and <italic>Dmc1</italic>) with high levels of asynapsis and numerous persistent unrepaired DSBs have a severely impaired MSUC response. We suggest that MSUC-related proteins, including the MSUC initiator BRCA1, are sequestered at unrepaired DSBs. All four mutants fail to silence the X and Y chromosomes (MSCI failure), which is sufficient to explain the midpachytene apoptosis. Apoptosis does not occur in mice with a single additional asynapsed chromosome with unrepaired meiotic DSBs and no disturbance of MSCI.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: ATR, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related; BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; DSB, double-strand break; MSCI, meiotic sex chromosome inactivation; MSUC, meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin; SCD, SQ/TQ cluster domain.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The discovery of the phenomenon of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baarends et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Turner et al., 2005</xref>) followed from studies of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), the transcriptional silencing of unsynapsed regions of the XY bivalent during pachytene of normal male meiosis, the morphological correlate of which is the so-called sex or XY body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Handel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Turner and Burgoyne, 2007</xref>). It is now clear that MSCI is an MSUC response to unsynapsed chromosomal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turner et al., 2006</xref>). Three key steps have been identified that trigger the chromatin changes resulting in MSCI/MSUC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turner et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2005</xref>). First, there is an accumulation of the DNA damage response protein BRCA1 on the unsynapsed chromosome axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scully et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turner et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2005</xref>). This is followed by a BRCA1-dependent axial accumulation of the PI3K kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR), which then spreads throughout the chromatin associated with the unsynapsed axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turner et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2005</xref>). ATR then phosphorylates serine 139 of the variant nucleosomal histone H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bellani et al., 2005</xref>), and it is this phosphorylation event that triggers the chromatin changes that lead to transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernandez-Capetillo et al., 2003</xref>). BRCA1 and ATR are also key players in the checkpoint management of double-strand breaks (DSBs) during G2 of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lisby and Rothstein, 2005</xref>) and are thought to play a similar checkpoint role in meiosis because they localize to meiotic DSBs during leptotene and zygotene before being shed soon after the completion of homologue synapsis and DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keegan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scully et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moens et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turner et al., 2004</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgoyne et al., 2007</xref>). It is for this reason that the accumulation of BRCA1 and ATR during pachytene on chromosomal axes that fail to synapse and, thus, the resulting MSUC response have also been assumed to be DSB dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perera et al., 2004</xref>). However, although the presence of DSB markers (e.g., RAD51) on the unsynapsed X chromosome axis indicates that there are multiple meiotic DSBs present throughout most of pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moens et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plug et al., 1998</xref>), such markers are rarely seen on the unsynapsed Y chromosome axis; nevertheless, the Y is subject to MSCI/MSUC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turner et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2006</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, two studies of <italic>Spo11</italic>-null male meiosis revealed that the sex body&#x02013;like structure apparent in <italic>Spo11</italic>-null pachytene spermatocytes rarely encompassed the X or Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bellani et al., 2005</xref>). However, neither study established whether this was associated with MSCI failure, whether the &#x0201c;pseudo&#x02013;sex body&#x0201d; domain was transcriptionally silenced, or whether it was targeted to asynapsed chromatin. Because we now know that MSCI is a manifestation of the MSUC response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turner et al., 2006</xref>), resolution of these issues is important to allow any conclusion as to whether MSUC can be provoked by asynapsis in the absence of meiotic (i.e., <italic>Spo11</italic> dependent) DSBs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>An MSUC response occurs in <italic>Spo11</italic>-null males, but there is extensive MSCI failure</title><p>To test whether the MSUC response can occur independently of meiotic DSBs, we looked for an MSUC response in <italic>Spo11</italic>-null male meiosis in which the lack of the SPO11 DNA transesterase prevents meiotic DSB formation (Fig. S1, a&#x02013;f; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710195/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710195/DC1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Romanienko and Camerini-Otero, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baudat et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mahadevaiah et al., 2001</xref>). In these males, the lack of meiotic DSBs severely disrupts homologous synapsis, and although there is some nonhomologous synapsis at or after the zygotene/pachytene transition (a meiotic DSB-independent default synapsis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zickler and Kleckner, 1999</xref>), many chromosome axes remain unsynapsed until the pachytene spermatocytes are eliminated by apoptosis.</p><p>We first immunostained spread <italic>Spo11</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> meiotic cells for BRCA1 and for the synaptonemal complex protein SYCP3 (which is loaded onto the chromosome axes before synapsis); the pattern of SYCP3 staining allows an assessment of meiotic stage. Unexpectedly, BRCA1, which is known to localize to meiotic DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scully et al., 1997</xref>), was clearly detectable as foci on the chromosome axes in <italic>Spo11</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes despite the lack of meiotic DSBs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, e and f</xref>).

As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scully et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turner et al., 2004</xref>), in wild-type males, the DSB-associated BRCA1 was lost after synapsis and during pachytene accumulated on the asynapsed axes of the X and Y chromosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, b and c</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>Spo11</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> spermatocytes, BRCA1 disappeared from the axes in conjunction with nonhomologous synapsis, which initiates at the zygotene&#x02013;pachytene transition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 g</xref>, inset). It then accumulated during early pachytene on the chromosome axes of a restricted chromatin domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 g</xref>); this is the domain within which ATR accumulates and phosphorylation of H2AX occurs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 h</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mahadevaiah et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bellani et al., 2005</xref>). This domain has been termed the pseudo&#x02013;sex body because it resembles the inactivated XY chromatin domain in wild-type pachytene spermatocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 d</xref>) but is not restricted to X and Y chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bellani et al., 2005</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>The MSUC initiator proteins BRCA1 and ATR are recruited to the pseudo&#x02013;sex body domain of <italic>Spo11</italic>-null pachytene spermatocytes.</bold> (a&#x02013;c) SYCP3 and BRCA1 staining of control spermatocytes showing the appearance of BRCA1 foci on the forming axial elements in leptotene, their loss after synapsis during zygotene, and BRCA1 accumulation on the asynapsed X and Y axes in pachytene.

(e&#x02013;g) In <italic>Spo11</italic>-null spermatocytes, which lack meiotic DSBs, BRCA1 foci still appear on the axial elements in leptotene, are retained throughout the asynaptic zygotene stage (magnified in insets), and are lost in conjunction with the nonhomologous synapsis apparent in pachytene (highlighted in insets, which show synapsed and asynapsed axes with BRCA1 staining offset).

To confirm this, we performed immunostaining for ATR and SYCP3 together with the synaptonemal complex protein SYCP1 that locates to regions of synapsis (whether homologous or nonhomologous). In all 50 pachytene cells analyzed, the ATR domain was found to be excluded from SYCP1-positive axes and associated chromatin; nevertheless, there were many unsynapsed chromosomal regions that were devoid of ATR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, k and l</xref>). We conclude that the pseudo&#x02013;sex body in <italic>Spo11</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pachytene spermatocytes is targeted to unsynapsed chromatin but fails to encompass all such chromatin.</p><p>We then asked whether the &#x003b3;H2AX-positive pseudo&#x02013;sex body domain was transcriptionally repressed by use of a Cot1 probe to detect nascent transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Turner et al., 2005</xref>) and then immunostained for &#x003b3;H2AX to locate the pseudo&#x02013;sex body domain. This showed that the &#x003b3;H2AX domain was indeed transcriptionally repressed in cells that had a clear pseudo&#x02013;sex body (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, a and b</xref>). We next combined &#x003b3;H2AX immunostaining with RNA FISH and DNA FISH for <italic>Atr</italic>, which is autosomal and in wild-type males is robustly expressed throughout pachytene (Fig. S2, a&#x02013;e; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710195/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710195/DC1</ext-link>). It was predicted that any pachytene cells with an <italic>Atr</italic> locus that failed to transcribe would have the <italic>Atr</italic> locus within the transcriptionally repressed &#x003b3;H2AX domain. 7/42 (17%) pachytene cells had one transcribed and one nontranscribed <italic>Atr</italic> locus, and, in each case, the nontranscribing locus was within the &#x003b3;H2AX-positive region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, c and d</xref>). We next performed RNA FISH analysis for the Y-located gene <italic>Zfy2</italic> that in normal males is weakly expressed in leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes when chromatin condensation is associated with global transcriptional repression and is then shut down by MSCI/MSUC throughout pachytene (Fig. S2, k&#x02013;o). This revealed that 70/74 (95%) <italic>Spo11</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pachytene cells were inappropriately expressing <italic>Zfy2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, e and f</xref>); in 69 of these cells, the <italic>Zfy2</italic> locus was located away from the &#x003b3;H2AX-positive domain, and one weakly expressed locus was at the edge of the domain. In the four nonexpressing cells, the <italic>Zfy2</italic> locus was located within the &#x003b3;H2AX-positive domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, g and h</xref>). Finally, we performed RNA FISH analysis using an X-chromosomal bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probe encompassing <italic>Ddx3x</italic> and 28 kb of <italic>Usp9x</italic>. We have found that this BAC gives no detectable RNA FISH signal in normal spermatocytes (Figs. S2, p&#x02013;t; and S4, a and b); however, in <italic>Brca1</italic><sup>&#x00394;11/&#x00394;11</sup> males (which have extensive MSCI failure; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turner et al., 2004</xref>), a <italic>Ddx3x/Usp9x</italic> signal becomes progressively more evident during pachytene (Figs. S3, g&#x02013;i; and S4, c and d). This provides a robust pachytene-specific marker of MSCI failure but will underestimate the proportion of pachytene cells with MSCI failure because transcription does not commence immediately upon entry of cells into pachytene.

If so, pachytene cells with extensive asynapsis that is associated with widespread, unrepaired meiotic DSBs should mount a more complete MSUC response. <italic>Dnmt3l</italic>-null males are very unusual in that progression to meiotic prophase is only seen before puberty, after which there is progressively earlier spermatogenic failure as a result of the progressive depletion of early proliferating spermatogonial stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bourc'his et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Webster et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">La Salle et al., 2007</xref>).

However, with increasing asynapsis, the unsynapsed chromatin&#x02013;located &#x003b3;H2AX staining became progressively more fragmented and weaker, and this was associated with increasingly focal ATR staining that was axially restricted without the spreading to adjacent chromatin that characterizes the MSUC response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, c&#x02013;f</xref>). This fragmented &#x003b3;H2AX staining resembled that of meiotic DSB-associated &#x003b3;H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mahadevaiah et al., 2001</xref>).

Because the cells with fragmented and weak &#x003b3;H2AX staining had multiple regions of asynapsis and lacked a sex body or pseudo&#x02013;sex body, we were concerned that they might have been zygotene spermatocytes, although there was often nonhomologous synapsis with the more extensive asynapsis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, e and f</xref>), which we consider a robust pachytene marker.

Intriguingly, self-synapsis of h21 is associated with loss of the RAD51 foci (Fig. S4 e). Abundant cells with asynapsed h21 chromosomes survive through to late pachytene; the DSB-associated markers then disappear from h21 and from the asynapsed X chromosome axis (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 j</xref>). We have used sections stained with DAPI and TUNEL to assess whether there is any excess pachytene apoptosis at epithelial stage IV in these h21 testes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, k and l</xref>), and there was no significant difference between the two genotypes (TUNEL-positive pachytene cells per tubule cross section: h21, 1.82 &#x000b1; 0.91; wild type, 1.82 &#x000b1; 0.74).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our initial objective was to see whether the presence of unrepaired meiotic DSBs on asynapsed axes is essential to trigger an MSUC response. Our analysis of <italic>Spo11</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pachytene spermatocytes shows that a robust MSUC response can occur in the absence of <italic>Spo11</italic>-dependent meiotic DSBs. As befits an MSUC response, it was targeted to asynapsed axes, but it was restricted to only a small proportion of the asynapsed axes present. This <italic>Spo11</italic> independence is reminiscent of the <italic>Spo11</italic> independence of histone H3 methylation of lysine 9 that is a feature of the transcriptionally repressed X in pachytene spermatocytes of XO males in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reddy and Villeneuve, 2004</xref>) and of the <italic>Spo11</italic> independence of meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelly and Aramayo, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, we did consider that the presence of unrepaired meiotic DSBs may potentiate the MSUC response. However, our analysis of <italic>Dnmt3l</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pachytene spermatocytes showed that with increasing asynapsis and associated unrepaired DSBs, there is in fact a progressive impairment of the MSUC response. Triggering of the MSUC response has previously been shown to require the BRCA1-dependent recruitment of ATR to axes that remain asynapsed at the zygotene/pachytene transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turner et al., 2004</xref>). In the present study, we have found that the total amount of axially located BRCA1 remains constant in the face of increasing asynapsis. The resulting progressive diminution of the amount of BRCA1 per unit length of asynapsed axis with the consequent reduction in ATR recruitment provides an explanation for the progressive impairment of the MSUC response.</p><p>Why isn't the axial BRCA1 recruitment maintained in the face of increasing asynapsis? One possibility that we plan to investigate further is that the BRCA1 recruited to asynapsed axes at the zygotene/pachytene transition is normally derived from the pool of BRCA1 released from DSBs after synapsis rather than from a more general cellular pool. Under this model, the BRCA1 retained at unrepaired breaks in <italic>Dnmt3l</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pachytene spermatocytes would then be unavailable for recruitment to asynapsed axes, thus accounting for abrogation of the MSUC response.</p><p>Because MSCI is a consequence of the MSUC response to the unsynapsed X and Y chromatin, this model for abrogation of the MSUC response by BRCA1 retention at unrepaired breaks provides an explanation for the observed MSCI failure in <italic>Dnmt3l</italic>-, <italic>Msh5</italic>-, and <italic>Dmc1</italic>-null males. There is now substantial evidence that MSCI failure is sufficient to cause stage IV (midpachytene) apoptosis in the absence of any significant increase in asynapsis or unrepaired DSBs. Thus, as we have shown here, the catastrophic pachytene failure in H2AX<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> males occurs at stage IV; these mice have MSCI failure because there is no H2AX to be phosphorylated, but they do not have obvious synaptic defects other than increased XY asynapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernandez-Capetillo et al., 2003</xref>). Further compelling evidence for the link between MSCI failure and midpachytene loss comes from the finding that in XYY males, there is selective loss of XYY pachytene cells with YY synapsis and associated inappropriate Y gene expression; XYY cells in which the two Ys remain unsynapsed (and thus are transcriptionally inactivated by MSUC) survive meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turner et al., 2006</xref>). Our current finding of extensive MSCI failure in <italic>Spo11</italic>-null males also provides a sufficient explanation for the previously puzzling stage IV pachytene apoptosis in the absence of meiotic DSBs. It is important to emphasize that we are not asserting that MSCI failure is necessarily the only cause of stage IV pachytene apoptosis. Based on H1t staining, it is clear that in <italic>Dmc1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutants, apoptotic elimination is completed earlier in stage IV than in <italic>Msh5</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutants. This could be because the more penetrant synaptic failure in <italic>Dmc1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> leads to more complete MSCI failure. However, it could indicate the presence of an additional, as yet unidentified trigger for apoptosis that operates slightly earlier in stage IV.</p><p>In light of our findings, it is likely that MSCI failure is a predominant cause of midpachytene spermatocyte apoptosis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Rooij and de Boer (2003)</xref> were the first to suggest that there is an epithelial stage IV checkpoint of pachytene spermatocytes that triggers the apoptotic elimination of aberrant cells. Since then, an increasing number of mutants have been shown to have substantial apoptosis at around this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Vries et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashley et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Vries et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolcun-Filas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carmell et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kolas et al. (2004)</xref> have also pointed out that several such mutants have aberrant sex body morphology; this is almost certain to be associated with MSCI failure. In our view, for any mutants exhibiting elevated epithelial stage IV pachytene spermatocyte apoptosis, it will be necessary in the future to rule out MSCI failure before invoking other causes. Given the link between asynapsis and MSCI failure and that MSCI failure is necessarily a male-specific phenomenon, our results also go a long way toward explaining the more severe consequences of asynapsis for male as compared with female fertility in mice and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hunt and Hassold, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morelli and Cohen, 2005</xref>).</p><p>What, then, is the response to unrepaired meiotic DSBs in pachytene spermatocytes in the absence of MSCI failure? The present analysis of mice carrying an additional h21-derived chromosome shows that these mice have a robust MSUC response that inactivates h21 (except when self-synapsed) together with the X and Y chromosomes. The approximately four unrepaired DSBs present on the asynapsed h21 chromosome do not trigger increased stage IV pachytene apoptosis. This is perhaps unsurprising because pachytene spermatocytes always have approximately nine unrepaired DSBs on the X that are tolerated. At the level of the present analysis, the cellular response to the asynapsed h21 chromosome was in fact indistinguishable from the response to the unsynapsed region of the X chromosome. Thus, both were subject to MSUC, and RAD51 foci (indicative of unrepaired DSBs) were present in early and midpachytene, but these foci disappeared during late pachytene, suggesting that the DSBs were then repaired (presumably using the DNA strand of the sister chromatid as the repair template). Heterologous self-synapsis of h21, on the other hand, was associated with an earlier loss of RAD51 foci; this is also true after heterologous self-synapsis of the X chromosome (our unpublished data). We conclude that meiotic DSBs that remain unrepaired as a consequence of asynapsis when on chromosomes subject to MSUC do not trigger midpachytene spermatocyte apoptosis; repair of the DSBs in late pachytene will serve to avoid any subsequent DSB-related checkpoint response.</p><p>We should emphasize that we nevertheless subscribe to the view that there is a checkpoint operating in mammalian meiosis related to that in meiotic G2, which in spermatogenesis prevents progression to the first meiotic division (MI) while unrepaired breaks are present (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgoyne et al., 2007</xref>). We also presume that ATR is the key checkpoint kinase. As we have discussed elsewhere, we suspect that the ATR-rich sex body is a potent checkpoint signaling module that will prevent progression to MI and that loss of the sex body during diplotene (even though X and Y silencing is largely maintained via other chromatin modifications) is essential to allow progression to MI (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgoyne et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, during the tenure of the sex body, ATR signaling from any unrepaired DSBs may be irrelevant. In addition to a G2-related response to unrepaired DSBs, there may also be a checkpoint equivalent to that in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hochwagen and Amon, 2006</xref>) that detects stalled recombination intermediates. In this regard, there is an interesting recent report of a severely hypomorphic mutant of <italic>Trip13</italic> that leads to extensive pachytene failure in both sexes despite near-normal synapsis and an intact MSUC response (as indicated by the presence of sex bodies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li and Schimenti, 2007</xref>). In this mutant, various markers of recombination intermediates were retained on the synapsed axes, showing that the process of homologous recombination was stalled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li and Schimenti, 2007</xref>).</p><p>There are several unresolved questions with respect to the present and previous analyses of <italic>Spo11</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> male meiosis that warrant further investigation. First, there is our surprising finding of BRCA1 foci on the forming axial elements despite the absence of meiotic (<italic>Spo11</italic> dependent) DSBs; it would be fascinating to know what underlies this BRCA1 localization. Of more relevance to the present study is the question as to why there is a robust but spatially limited BRCA1 recruitment to asynapsed chromatin (to form the pseudo&#x02013;sex body). BRCA1 is a very large protein with several functionally separable domains, including a C-terminal BRCT domain and a central DNA-binding domain, between which is an SQ/TQ cluster domain (SCD); the latter includes phosphorylation sites for ATM and ATR (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgoyne et al., 2007</xref>). The localization of BRCA1 to DSBs is likely to involve binding to &#x003b3;H2AX in the vicinity of the break via the BRCT domain and/or binding to specific DNA structures at the break via the DNA-binding domain. In the model we have suggested here, it is BRCA1 released from meiotic DSBs after synapsis that is normally recruited in a meiotic DSB-independent manner to unsynapsed axes to initiate the MSUC response. In <italic>Brca1</italic><sup>&#x00394;11/&#x00394;11</sup>,<italic>Trp53</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> males, which lack the region encoding the SCD, the shortened BRCA1 protein is nevertheless still recruited to the asynapsed axes of the X and Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turner et al., 2004</xref>; Fig. S2 b). Thus, the SCD is not needed for this axial BRCA1 recruitment but is required for the subsequent axial recruitment of ATR. In <italic>Spo11</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> males, BRCA1 still appears (as foci) on the unsynapsed axes as soon as they form in leptotene and is subsequently shed from regions of synapsis. However, because it has not been associated with meiotic DSBs, it is likely that the SCD may not be phosphorylated at those sites normally phosphorylated by ATM and/or ATR. We have observed that one or a few clumps of ATR are present in the nuclei of late zygotene <italic>Spo11</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> spermatocytes, and we hypothesize that this ATR is needed to phosphorylate one or more sites in the BRCA1 SCD that are critical for subsequent axial recruitment of ATR. Under this model, the formation of a pseudo&#x02013;sex body thus depends on the colocalization of asynapsed axes that recruit BRCA1 with one of these ATR clumps.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>The <italic>Spo11</italic>- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baudat et al., 2000</xref>) and <italic>Dnmt3l</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bourc'his et al., 2001</xref>)-null mutations were on a C57BL/6 background, the <italic>Msh5</italic>- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edelmann et al., 1999</xref>) and <italic>Dmc1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pittman et al., 1998</xref>)-null mutations were on a mixed C57BL/6 &#x0002b; 129/Sv background, the <italic>Brca1</italic><sup>&#x00394;11</sup> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2001</xref>) together with the accompanying <italic>Trp53</italic>-null mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donehower et al., 1992</xref>) was on a mixed C57BL/6 &#x0002b; 129/Sv &#x0002b; Black Swiss background (National Institutes of Health), and the h21 chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Doherty et al., 2005</xref>) on a predominantly random bred MF1 (National Institute for Medical Research colony) background.

Because MSCI is impaired with higher levels of asynapsis, the morphology of the XY bivalent/sex body also cannot be used to differentiate between late zygotene and early pachytene. Instead, we used the following criteria to identify pachytene cells in spread preparations. (1) DAPI staining pattern: during leptotene/zygotene, DAPI staining is bright throughout the nucleus, and centromeres are clustered in a few subdomains. In contrast, pachytene nuclei have more heterogeneous DAPI staining, with euchromatin more faintly stained and centromeres brightly stained and separated into multiple subdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Turner et al., 2001</xref>). (2) The length and thickness of axial elements/synaptonemal complexes: axial elements appear long and thin in leptotene and zygotene, whereas those of pachytene cells are shorter and thicker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashley et al., 2004a</xref>). (3) Pachytene cells with asynapsis can also be discriminated from zygotene cells by the presence of markedly asynchronous synapsis between individual bivalents (for example, completely asynapsed bivalents in the presence of multiple fully synapsed bivalents). (4) We view the presence of nonhomologous synapsis (particularly evident in <italic>Spo11</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) and/or evidence of a robust MSUC response because both of these processes initiate close to the zygotene&#x02013;pachytene transition (Zickler and Kleckner, 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Turner et al., 2005</xref>) as definitive criteria, but they often cannot be used for pachytene cells with extensive asynapsis.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b3;H2AX and BRCA1 quantitation</title><p>To select <italic>Dnmt3l</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> pachytene cells for quantitation, the SYCP3 signal and then the DAPI signal were viewed under a 40&#x000d7; objective.

The amount of fluorescence was measured from the captured images using the integrated density feature of the Softworx software of the DeltaVision microscope (Applied Precision). For measuring nuclear anti-&#x003b3;H2AX fluorescence, each nucleus was outlined, and the total fluorescence was measured within this outline; for each nucleus background, fluorescence (estimated for an equivalent area in the near vicinity of the nucleus) was subtracted. To measure the amount of BRCA1, which is present on the asynapsed axial elements, the outlines of all of the asynapsed axes were carefully traced, and the anti-BRCA1 fluorescence within the areas covered by these outlines was measured. A sample of synapsed axes in each nucleus was also outlined from which the background subtraction was calculated.
