CTCF has been connected to multiple functions in chromatin organization and gene regulation including chromatin insulator activity and transcriptional enhancement and silencing. Here we show that CTCF harbors several autonomous repression domains. One of these domains, the zinc-finger cluster, silences transcription in all cell types tested and binds directly to the co-repressor SIN3A. Two distinct regions of SIN3A, the PAH3 domain and the extreme C-terminal region, bind independently to this zinc-finger cluster. Analysis of nuclear extract from HeLa cells revealed that CTCF is also capable of retaining functional histone deacetylase activity. Furthermore, the ability of regions of CTCF to retain deacetylase activity correlates with the ability to bind to SIN3A and to repress gene activity. We suggest that CTCF driven repression is mediated in part by the recruitment of histone deacetylase activity by SIN3A.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The zinc-finger protein CTCF, previously known as NeP1, was one of the first identified factors binding to metazoan silencing elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c2">2</xref>). Transcription of the chicken lysozyme gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c3">3</xref>) and the chicken and human myc-genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c4">4</xref>) is repressed by DNA elements, which are bound by CTCF. The identification of CTCF binding to repressive or silencing elements in both types of genes was hampered by the fact that the binding sites are extremely divergent. This divergence is such that the name giving CTC-richness of the binding site at the human c-myc gene is not found at the CTCF binding site at the chicken lysozyme gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c3">3</xref>). The explanation of this apparent paradox is that the 11-zinc-finger DNA binding domain of CTCF allows a selective and specific usage of different combinations of individual zinc-fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c5">5</xref>). These zinc-fingers are of the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-type except for the eleventh zinc-finger, which has an unusual amino acid sequence.</p><p>The zinc-finger DNA binding domain of about 300 amino acids is 100&#x00025; identical between mouse, man and chicken. Even the full-length protein of about 700 amino acids is 93&#x00025; identical between avian and human. This highly conserved protein is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues analyzed so far. Because of this distribution, like a product of a house keeping gene, and because of the high degree of conservation, important and general cellular functions must be mediated by CTCF. In many cases transcriptional repression has been associated with CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c6">6</xref>). Gene activation mediated by CTCF response elements has also been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c8">8</xref>). Interestingly, modulation of the effects of CTCF on transcription has been observed in the context of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR). In the case of the chicken lysozyme silencer (S-2.4), synergistic repression of the adjacent CTCF and TR binding sites have been seen in the absence of thyroid hormone, whereas addition of hormone leads to a synergistic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c2">2</xref>). In the context of a negative thyroid hormone response element (TRE), the thyroid hormone response is reversed such that the presence of hormone synergistically represses an adjacent gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c5">5</xref>).</p><p>An even more widespread role of CTCF has been suggested recently. Insulator elements, which act as a barrier to prevent neighboring <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements from regulating a distal gene, have been found to mediate their function by CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c9">9</xref>). All of the vertebrate enhancer-blocking elements examined by this group contain CTCF binding sites. Therefore, given that CTCF has such a fundamental role, it is not surprising that the gene coding for CTCF is a candidate tumor suppressor gene located within a region frequently deleted in several different human malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c10">10</xref>).</p><p>A mechanism mediating these effects has not yet been elucidated. Although specific DNA bending has been found to be induced by CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c11">11</xref>), it is not very likely that all of the biological effects induced by CTCF will be mediated just by a change in the DNA conformation. Since many of the CTCF functions are repressive, we wondered whether co-repressor proteins might bind to CTCF. Here we find, in contrast to other repressive zinc-finger proteins, that the zinc-finger domain of CTCF binds directly to the co-repressor SIN3A. In addition, we demonstrate that histone deacetylases from nuclear extracts are bound by the CTCF zinc-finger domain, indicating that CTCF may repress transcription by recruitment of histone deacetylases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>Regions of CTCF were generated by PCR using <italic>Pfu</italic> polymerase (Stratagene) and specific primers using pSG5&#x02013;CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c7">7</xref>) as a template and cloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene). CTCF-FL, CTCF-NT, CTCF-ZF, CTCF-ZF&#x0002f;CT and CTCF-CT encode amino acids 2&#x02013;728, 2&#x02013;268, 269&#x02013;577, 269&#x02013;738 and 577&#x02013;738 of chicken CTCF, respectively (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd296f1">1</xref>). All junctions were sequenced with a T7 Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB). The GST&#x02013;CTCF and Gal&#x02013;CTCF fusion constructs were generated by fusing fragments of CTCF cDNA from the above pBluescript II SK clones, in frame into pGST-linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c12">12</xref>) that encodes for glutathione S-transferase (GST) or pABgal94 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c13">13</xref>), which encodes for amino acids 1&#x02013;94 of the Gal4 DNA binding domain.

This transcriptional repression is seen when CTCF is directly targeted to promoter sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c4">4</xref>). Recently it has been demonstrated that CTCF plays a central role in the function of vertebrate insulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c9">9</xref>). Here we wanted to test whether CTCF harbors autonomous silencing domains. Therefore we fused the coding region of full-length CTCF to the sequence coding for the DNA binding domain of Gal 4 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd296f1">1</xref>). Co-transfection of the Gal&#x02013;CTCF expression plasmid with the p17mer6xs-tk-CAT reporter repressed the reporter activity, when tested in several vertebrate cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd296f2">2</xref>). Repression is expressed relative to the effect mediated by the empty expression vector Gal. In order to identify a repression domain within CTCF, the coding sequence was dissected into different parts containing the N-terminus, the C-terminus and the region coding for the 11 zinc-fingers from the center of the protein. Fusions to the Gal DNA binding domain were tested for repression and showed the strongest repression effect for the zinc-finger region attached to the C-terminus. Dissection of this region into the zinc-finger domain by itself and the remaining C-terminal part showed repression for both of these regions, such that apparently the zinc-finger plus C-terminal region consists of at least two repressive domains. In contrast, the N-terminal domain showed no repression in some cell lines (COS1 and CV1 cells are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd296f2">2</xref>), whereas in the chicken erythroblast line, HD3, a strong repression was mediated by the N-terminal domain as well. This apparent tissue-specific effect was not further analyzed since we wanted to focus on the general transcriptional mechanisms conferred by the ubiquitous CTCF protein.</p><p>Thus, CTCF harbors strong transcriptional silencing domains, one of which is located in the zinc-finger region.</p></sec><sec><title>CTCF binds to the co-repressor SIN3A</title><p>Since CTCF contains autonomous repression domains, we wondered whether at least one of the repression functions of CTCF might be mediated by one of the known co-repressors. Therefore we replaced the Gal DNA binding domain from the Gal&#x02013;CTCF fusion constructs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd296f1">1</xref>) with GST. We then tested <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> expressed GST&#x02013;CTCF fusions for the ability to bind several published co-repressors (data not shown). Among these, <italic>in vitro</italic> translated SIN3A was bound to the GST&#x02013;CTCF fusions. The binding was specific, since SIN3A did not bind to GST alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd296f3">3</xref>A, lane 2) nor did any GST&#x02013;CTCF fusion bind to <italic>in vitro</italic> translated luciferase (data not shown). As a positive control we used the <italic>E.coli</italic> expressed GST&#x02013;N-CoR fusion, which previously has been shown to bind SIN3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c23">23</xref>). Analysis of the individual CTCF domains fused to GST showed binding of SIN3A to full-length CTCF, to the zinc-finger plus C-terminal part and to the zinc-finger domain itself. The C-terminal domain without the zinc-finger region showed almost no binding. The N-terminal domain was also negative for SIN3A binding. The binding of SIN3A to the zinc-finger domain was much stronger as compared to full-length CTCF. Such a finding, that a subdomain interacts or functions much stronger as compared to the full-length construct, has been seen in many other cases as well. This may indicate a potential shielding of the binding domain by other regions of the protein. Furthermore, we wanted to know whether <italic>in vivo</italic> produced SIN3A could bind to CTCF as well. Therefore we used the same GST&#x02013;CTCF fusion proteins linked to Sepharose beads and carried out a co-precipitation with nuclear extract from HeLa cells. The bound proteins were analyzed by western blotting with an antibody against SIN3A. The western blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd296f3">3</xref>B) shows a clear SIN3A signal precipitated by full-length CTCF, the zinc-finger plus C-terminal region and the zinc-finger domain by itself. No signal was detected after binding to either the N- or C-terminal region alone. There are some differences in the relative binding efficiencies, when binding of <italic>in vitro</italic> translated material is compared with <italic>in vivo</italic> produced HeLa SIN3A, nevertheless the common finding of both types of analyses shows that the zinc-finger domain by itself is sufficient to bind SIN3A.</p><p>Previously identified domains of SIN3A that interact with other proteins include the so-called PAH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c24">24</xref>), four of which are found in SIN3A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd296f4">4</xref>A). In order to identify a region of the SIN3A protein binding to the CTCF zinc-finger domain we generated different SIN3A truncations for <italic>in vitro</italic> translation. The GST&#x02013;CTCF zinc-finger domain fusion showed binding to full-length SIN3A, but not to SIN3A regions encompassing the PAH1 domain or PAH1&#x0002b;2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd296f4">4</xref>B). Longer SIN3A constructs, containing PAH domains 1&#x02013;3 or 1&#x02013;4 are efficiently bound. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> translated PAH2&#x02013;3 was also efficiently bound by the GST&#x02013;CTCF zinc-finger fusion protein. These data indicate that PAH domain 3 of SIN3A is involved in binding of the CTCF zinc-finger domain. Similar results were achieved with the full-length CTCF molecule fused to GST (data not shown). Since interaction of CTCF could be with more than one region of SIN3A, we tested the very C-terminal part of SIN3A for possible CTCF binding. The <italic>in vitro</italic> translated C-terminal region of SIN3A (amino acids 1001&#x02013;1219) showed efficient binding to the zinc-finger domain of CTCF as well as to full-length CTCF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd296f3">3</xref>B).</p><p>Thus, the CTCF zinc-finger domain is bound by two different regions of SIN3A, one region containing the PAH3 domain and another region encompassing the C-terminal 200 amino acids.</p></sec><sec><title>CTCF recruits histone deacetylation activity</title><p>Several authors have demonstrated that SIN3A can bind to histone deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c28">28</xref>). Therefore we wondered whether CTCF can bind to nuclear complexes containing histone deacetylase activity. Again, <italic>E.coli</italic> expressed GST&#x02013;CTCF was used to bind factors provided by nuclear extracts from HeLa cells. The bound material was assayed for enzymatic activity resulting in histone deacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c20">20</xref>). HDAC activity is readily detectable in the GST&#x02013;CTCF bound fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd296f5">5</xref>A), in contrast to the negative controls, empty beads and GST alone. The CTCF bound HDAC activity reached about half of that bound by a GST retinoblastoma protein fusion, which served as a positive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c20">20</xref>). To determine which areas of CTCF were responsible for this recruitment of HDAC activity, we used fusions of the individual N-terminal, C-terminal and zinc-finger domains of CTCF with GST in the HDAC binding assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd296f5">5</xref>B). Clearly, full-length CTCF as well as the zinc-finger domain containing constructs bind an activity from HeLa nuclear extracts, which mediates deacetylation of histones. Neither the N-terminal domain nor the C-terminal region of CTCF alone show HDAC activity above background. Since <italic>in vitro</italic> translated HDAC-1 or baculovirus expressed HDAC-1 does not bind to GST&#x02013;CTCF (data not shown), we conclude that HDAC binding to CTCF is indirect. The likely mediator of HDAC binding is SIN3A, which binds directly to CTCF (see above) and which has been shown to bind directly to HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c28">28</xref>).</p><p>In order to test the functional relevance of HDAC activity in the context of CTCF mediated repression we tested the effect of an HDAC inhibitor. Although effects of histone acetylation and deacetylation can be studied in transient transfection protocols, we decided to generate cell pools which have reporter gene sequences stably integrated into the genome. This procedure has the advantage that the tested reporter gene is packaged in chromatin similar to endogenous genes. For this purpose we used NIH 3T3 cells that contain a stably integrated reporter gene p17mer6xs-tk-CAT. A pool of these cell clones shows a reporter gene driven CAT activity, which is high enough to analyze transcriptional repression. Transient transfection of an expression plasmid coding for a Gal DNA binding domain fused to the zinc-finger plus C-terminal region of CTCF results in measurable repression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd296f6">6</xref>). As expected, this repression is much lower than that achieved with transient co-transfection of the reporter plasmid (compare Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd296f2">2</xref>), since the expression plasmid is only taken up by ~10 &#x00025; of the cells (measured by transfection of an EGFP expression plasmid; data not shown). Addition of the HDAC inhibitor, TSA, clearly interferes with the CTCF induced repression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd296f6">6</xref>), indicating that recruitment of HDAC activity is contributing to the repression mediated by the zinc-finger plus C-terminal region.</p><p>Thus, CTCF, which is able to function as an insulator protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c9">9</xref>), harbors an autonomous transcriptional silencing domain which is able to recruit histone deacetylase activity.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The multivalent zinc-finger protein CTCF has been shown to be involved in transcriptional enhancement as well as in silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c3">3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c8">8</xref>). In addition, CTCF has been shown to be required for insulator function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c9">9</xref>). Until now a mechanism or a co-factor has not been determined for either of these functions. Here we show that CTCF comprises autonomous silencing domains which mediate transcriptional repression when tethered to a promoter sequence. At least one of these domains, the zinc-finger region of CTCF, binds SIN3A and recruits histone deacetylation activity. For the SIN3A co-repressor we identified two different domains that interact independently with the CTCF zinc-finger cluster. One of these regions contains the PAH3 domain, which has previously been shown to be able to interact with the co-repressor SMRT and with TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c27">27</xref>). The other SIN3A region that interacts with CTCF (the C-terminal 200 amino acids) has not yet been demonstrated to independently bind to other factors. Whether these two domains bind to the zinc-finger cluster simultaneously or whether they constitute alternative binding targets remains to be clarified.</p><p>Several other transcriptional factors involved in repression contain zinc-fingers, and for some of these factors co-repressors have been identified that bind to specific domains required for repression of transcriptional activity. These repression domains have been located both outside as well as within the zinc-finger domains. Based on the identity and the function of the co-repressors, a mechanism of transcriptional repression by these factors could be proposed. The POZ domain, found outside of the zinc-finger region of the lymphoma oncogene BCL6&#x0002f;LAZ3 and in many other zinc-finger containing transcriptional repressors, has been shown to bind directly the&#x000a0;co-repressors N-CoR and SMRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c31">31</xref>). Since these co-repressors have been demonstrated to recruit HDAC activity by binding to SIN3, chromatin deacetylation is one mechanism for the repression of POZ domain containing repressors.</p><p>The KRAB domain of many Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like zinc-finger proteins interacts with the co-repressor KAP-1&#x0002f;TIF1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c35">35</xref>). Binding of KAP-1 to members of the HP1 protein family suggests a possible role of these co-repressors in heterochromatin formation. The co-repressors NAB1&#x0002f;2 have been shown to interact with the repression domain of zinc-finger transcription factors encoded by the immediate&#x02013;early genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c37">37</xref>). A functional role for these co-repressors has not yet been established, but the finding that NAB molecules are able to multimerize suggests a repressive chromatin structure may also be involved.</p><p>Although zinc-finger domains by themselves have been shown in many cases to mediate protein&#x02013;protein interactions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c38">38</xref>), for the transcriptional repressors only a few zinc-finger domains have been demonstrated to bind co-repressors. A single zinc-finger motif within the transcription factor REST is required for CoREST interaction, a co-repressor required for regulation of neural-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c39">39</xref>). The mechanism of repression by CoREST is however unknown. The zinc-finger protein ETO binds directly the co-repressors N-CoR&#x0002f;SMRT but in contrast to BCL6, co-repressor binding to ETO is mediated by two unusual zinc-finger motifs present at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c41">41</xref>).</p><p>Co-repressor binding by the zinc-finger protein GATA again is different from the previous examples. In this case, the interacting partners (FOG1&#x0002f;2) contain zinc-fingers that are involved in binding to the zinc-finger domain of GATA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c44">44</xref>). This repression mechanism may be mediated by a HDAC, since FOG interacts with CtBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c43">43</xref>), which is very similar to CtBP1 for which HDAC binding has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c45">45</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that the zinc-finger domain of CTCF binds directly to SIN3A, which is different from all the other zinc-finger repressors. This direct SIN3A binding is very likely responsible for complexing the HDAC activity. Such a connection of SIN3A and HDAC proteins has been shown for HDAC1 and HDAC2 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c46">46</xref>). In addition an interaction of SIN3A with HDAC7 has been published recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c47">47</xref>). Since a direct binding of HDAC-1 to CTCF could not be demonstrated (data not shown) we suggest that CTCF recruits the SIN3&#x02013;HDAC complex.</p><p>The zinc-finger domain of CTCF is 100&#x00025; identical between chicken and man. This domain shows sequence-specific binding to a large number of different response elements. Specificity of binding is achieved by the usage of different groups of individual zinc-fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c5">5</xref>). Potentially one could envisage that binding of zinc-fingers to SIN3A may be modulated by different DNA response elements, nevertheless, simultaneous binding of zinc-finger to DNA and proteins seems to be possible (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c38">38</xref>).</p><p>A specific property of CTCF is that some CTCF binding sites are found in the vicinity of TR binding sites. This is the case for the chicken lysozyme silencer element (S-2.4) which consists of two binding sites, one for TR and one for CTCF. Interestingly, both factors synergize in repression in the absence of ligand as well as in activation in the presence of thyroid hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c3">3</xref>). A similar functional synergy of these two proteins has also been found for a negative TRE downstream of an unknown gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c48">48</xref>). For this element, synergistic effects of the thyroid hormone are reversed such that thyroid hormone mediated transcriptional repression depends on the CTCF binding site.</p><p>Recently it was demonstrated that CTCF is able to interact directly with TR <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c49">49</xref>). The TR itself has been shown to bind a complex of N-CoR&#x0002f;SMRT and SIN3A as well as HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c22">22</xref>). Thus, synergy in repression may be attributed to a higher efficiency of HDAC recruitment in the presence of CTCF plus TR. Currently we are testing whether HDAC binding to TR complexes is influenced by CTCF and whether the CTCF recruitment of HDAC is modulated by the hormone-bound or unbound TR.</p><p>For most of the zinc-finger repressors and their co-repressors a potential effect on modulating chromatin structures has been shown. Recently, CTCF has been demonstrated to be required for the enhancer blocking activity of vertebrate insulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c9">9</xref>). Molecular mechanisms mediating this enhancer insulation or blocking activity have been discussed controversially (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c50">50</xref>). A change in chromatin acetylation has been connected to the presence of insulators. A sharp transition is found at the locus of the insulator element demonstrating histone hyper-acetylation of the active chromatin domain and a lower level of acetylation outside of the domain, which is marked by insulator elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c51">51</xref>). Furthermore, maintenance of transgene activity and histone hyper-acetylation have been found to depend on the presence of flanking insulator elements leading to the hypothesis that insulators prevent histone deacetylation of transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd296c52">52</xref>). Our finding that the insulator protein CTCF itself is able to bind histone deacetylases argues for the necessity of directional components that prevent deacetylation of the gene containing unit flanked by insulator elements.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd296f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Recombinant CTCF constructs.
