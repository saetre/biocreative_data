In humans, the KCNMB3 gene contains four N-terminal alternative exons that produce four functionally distinct &#x003b2;3 subunits, &#x003b2;3a&#x02013;d. Three variants, &#x003b2;3a&#x02013;c, exhibit kinetically distinct inactivation behaviors. Since investigation of the physiological roles of BK auxiliary subunits will depend on studies in rodents, here we have determined the identity and functional properties of mouse &#x003b2;3 variants. Whereas &#x003b2;1, &#x003b2;2, and &#x003b2;4 subunits exhibit 83.2%, 95.3%, and 93.8% identity between mouse and human, the mouse &#x003b2;3 subunit, excluding N-terminal splice variants, shares only 62.8% amino acid identity with its human counterpart. Based on an examination of the mouse genome and screening of mouse cDNA libraries, here we have identified only two N-terminal candidates, &#x003b2;3a and &#x003b2;3b, of the four found in humans. Both human and mouse &#x003b2;3a subunits produce a characteristic use-dependent inactivation. Surprisingly, whereas the h&#x003b2;3b exhibits rapid inactivation, the putative m&#x003b2;3b does not inactivate. Furthermore, unlike h&#x003b2;3, the m&#x003b2;3 subunit, irrespective of the N terminus, mediates a shift in gating to more negative potentials at a given Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration. The shift in gating gradually is lost following patch excision, suggesting that the gating shift involves some regulatory process dependent on the cytosolic milieu. Examination of additional genomes to assess conservation among splice variants suggests that the putative m&#x003b2;3b N terminus may not be a true orthologue of the h&#x003b2;3b N terminus and that both &#x003b2;3c and &#x003b2;3d appear likely to be primate-specific N-terminal variants. These results have three key implications: first, functional properties of homologous &#x003b2;3 subunits may differ among mammalian species; second, the specific physiological roles of homologous &#x003b2;3 subunits may differ among mammalian species; and, third, some &#x003b2;3 variants may be primate-specific ion channel subunits.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviation used in this paper: BK, large conductance Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-activated K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Functional properties of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-activated, large conductance BK-type K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels are defined in part by the tissue-specific expression of auxiliary &#x003b2; subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Orio et al., 2002</xref>).

This includes the apparent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dependence of channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cox and Aldrich, 2000</xref>), the tail current behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Xia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>), and the ability to inactivate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Wallner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Xia et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>). Both &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 subunits are able to shift the apparent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dependence of gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">McManus et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Wallner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Xia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cox and Aldrich, 2000</xref>), such that at a given voltage, less Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is required for a given level of activation. Similarly, &#x003b2;4 subunits may also influence the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dependence of activation over particular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations. &#x003b2;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Wallner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Xia et al., 1999</xref>) and some &#x003b2;3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Uebele et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Xia et al., 2000</xref>) subunits can produce inactivation that may regulate BK channel availability and BK tail current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>). &#x003b2;4 may be the primary brain BK &#x003b2; subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brenner et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Meera et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Weiger et al., 2000</xref>), and has also been shown to influence some aspects of BK channel function and expression. Most of our understanding of the functional properties of the other auxiliary subunits stems largely from expression studies in heterologous systems, primarily using the human forms of the particular &#x003b2; subunits. However, our understanding of the roles of &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;4 subunits has been advanced considerably by the development of mice in which each of these subunits has been genetically removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brenner et al., 2000b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2005</xref>). Our understanding of the roles of &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3 subunits will most likely depend on similar approaches, and such studies may help provide insight into the physiological roles of inactivating BK channels.</p><p>In humans, there are four &#x003b2;3 splice variants that arise from four alternative exons each encoding a distinct N terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Uebele et al., 2000</xref>). Three of these are capable of mediating N-terminal&#x02013;mediated inactivation of distinct temporal characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Uebele et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Xia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>). Effects of the human &#x003b2;3 subunits on gating shifts appear to be minimal, except as a consequence of inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Xia et al., 2000</xref>). Two of the &#x003b2;3 inactivating isoforms, &#x003b2;3a, and &#x003b2;3b, have been studied in some detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Xia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lingle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>) and exhibit distinctive inactivation behaviors that presumably depend on the specific N-terminal sequences. Given that further exploration of the physiological roles of inactivating BK auxiliary subunits will certainly depend on investigations in mice or rats, here we have undertaken an examination of the identity and function of mouse BK &#x003b2;3 subunits. The results indicate that, in contrast to the four variants found in the human genome, the mouse genome encodes a single N-terminus, &#x003b2;3a, that is a clear homologue of a human variant. A second mouse variant similar to human &#x003b2;3b was also identified, but this appears to be of independent origin with distinct functional properties. We also undertook a comparison of conservation among &#x003b2;3 genes over a wide range of vertebrate species. This analysis suggests that &#x003b2;3b, &#x003b2;3c, and &#x003b2;3d may represent primate-specific genes. The analysis raises the possibility that &#x003b2;3 variants may have unique functions in primates and points out that the physiological roles of even homologous subunits may differ among species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Heterologous Expression of Cloned cDNAs in Oocytes</title><p>Stage IV <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes were used for expression of currents as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Xia et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2002</xref>).

Mouse liver and testes cDNA libraries (Strategene) were used to screen for m&#x003b2;3 variants using nested PCR. The first round PCR was performed with a LacZ reverse primer (5&#x02032;GGAAACAGCTATGACCATG) and m&#x003b2;3 primer (5&#x02032;GAGCATGAAGGGCTTCAACACAGT). After a second round PCR with T3 primer and another m&#x003b2;3 primer (5&#x02032;CATCATGGCCACGCCCAGCAGCATGGC), the PCR products were analyzed with EcoRI and HINDIII and then subcloned into the pSK vector. 40 clones were analyzed and clone 39 corresponded to a &#x003b2;3b N terminus, with upstream residues corresponding to an open reading frame present within the mouse genome. This clone encoded a single methonione appended to exon 2 (primer sequence: lower case; putative exon 1b: underlined; exon 2: upper case; gaattcggcacgagg<underline>GCAACTGCCACTCTGCAACGGCTTCCCACAACCCAGGGTTTCATGGATGCTTGGCAAACACTTTCCCAACAGAGGCTACCTCTCCAGTACCAGTATTCTACTTTAAAAAAAGATTTATTTT</underline><bold><underline>AT</underline></bold>GACAGCACTTCCGGCCTCGGGCAAAATCAATGGAGATCCCCTGAAGGTGCACCCAAAGCTT). The putative 1b transcript corresponds to position chr3:32,400,082-32,400,204 in the July, 2007 assembly of the mouse genome. In addition to this putative &#x003b2;3b N terminus, five other clones were obtained that contained putative reading frames appended to the shared &#x003b2;3 exon 2. Three (termed w, y, and z) of these did not encode an initiation methonine in the putative reading frame. Two others arose from different reading frames of the same region. One (putative Exon x1), corresponding to an open reading frame located 1,696 bp upstream of exon 1b, would result in an additional 42 N-terminal residues (MPVGRSKGVTSPRSFSATKS<underline>VGVNLVYVGPRIDREREWPDYV</underline>). Only nucleotide sequence corresponding to the underlined translated residues was identified from cloning. The second (putative Exon x2) would result in addition of a single N-terminal methonine to exon 2, but with an alteration in the first residue following M such that the N terminus would begin MSLP instead of MTALP. No homologues corresponding to these sequences were found in a blast search of the human genome database and no rodent ESTs containing such N termini are present in current databases. A region of the rat genome shared homology with the putative exons x1 and x2, including a conserved GTGAGT intron&#x02013;exon splice junction, but in the rat genome, the reading frame corresponding to exon x1 fails to encode an initiation methionine.</p><p>Mouse &#x003b2;3 subunits were generated by first cloning most of the &#x003b2;3 subunit (exons 2, 3, and 4) via PCR from the mouse liver cDNA library. Subsequently, &#x003b2;3a and &#x003b2;3b variants were generated by overlapping PCR from the 1a- and 1b-specific exons. Mutations of &#x003b2;3a and &#x003b2;3b subunits followed standard procedures in use in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Xia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Zeng et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Currents were typically recorded in the inside-out configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hamill et al., 1981</xref>) with an Axopatch 200 amplifier (Molecular Devices).

Our examination of conservation within the KCNMB3 gene occurred in two passes. First, we used default BLAST settings using tblastn to search for known &#x003b2; subunit sequences. Second, we used the capabilities of the University of California-Santa Cruz Genome Bioinformatics website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.genome.ucsc.edu">www.genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kent et al., 2002</xref>) to obtain measures of conservation among various species within the presuming coding regions of the KCNBM3 N-terminal splice variants.</p><p>Tblastn searches typically returned regions of strong identity that reflect likely exons. Such exons were then assembled into the putative full subunit based on alignments with the validated &#x003b2; subunits.

To test for the existence of a &#x003b2;3b variant in mice, we screened mouse liver and testes cDNA libraries for &#x003b2;3 subunit N termini (see Materials and methods). In humans, these tissues have been reported to express &#x003b2;3b, &#x003b2;3c, &#x003b2;3d message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Uebele et al., 2000</xref>). This screening resulted in identification of a clone that encoded a single initiation methonine appended to the shared exon 2, suggesting that a putative &#x003b2;3b homologue may be present in mouse tissues. The position of the putative &#x003b2;3 1b exon was identified in the mouse genome and found upstream of the other KCNMB3 exons, although with its position reversed relative to exon 1a in comparison to the human arrangement (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). No other clones were identified that corresponded to any of the identified human N-terminal variants. However, as noted in the Materials and methods, in some clones, additional sequences were found to be appended to exon 2 and corresponded to reading frames also found in the mouse genome upstream of the other KCNMB3 exons.

All such homologues mapped to appropriate positions within the KCNMB3 genes (see Fig. S5). In sum, these considerations establish that a candidate &#x003b2;3b message is generated in mouse and that an exon encoding a &#x003b2;3a N terminus is present in the mouse genome.

We therefore compared the properties of human and mouse &#x003b2;3a subunits. A novel property of the h&#x003b2;3a subunit is its ability to produce an inactivation-dependent enhancement of net tail current flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>). Similar to h&#x003b2;3a subunits, coexpression of &#x003b1; with m&#x003b2;3a subunits resulted in inactivating currents (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). m&#x003b2;3a subunits (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>) cause somewhat faster and more complete inactivation than h&#x003b2;3a (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>).

On average, m&#x003b2;3a subunit results in about threefold faster inactivation than the human subunit (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Both subunits produce a characteristic inactivation-dependent slow tail current that is removed by digestion of the N terminus with trypsin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). The slow, use-dependent tail current appears to be the key functional property defined by the highly conserved &#x003b2;3a exon.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The mouse &#x003b2;3a subunit produces a use-dependent tail current enhancement similar to h&#x003b2;3a, but m&#x003b2;3a inactivation is more rapid and more complete.

First, the position of the cloned candidate mouse 1b exon relative to the 1a exon was reversed in comparison to humans, suggesting that the putative mouse 1b exon may be of independent origin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Second, because cloning revealed additional N-terminal sequences of unknown origin (see Materials and methods), some caution is warranted regarding the origins of the candidate 1b clone. Third, the upstream noncoding sequence of the candidate 1b mouse segment exhibits minimal homology to that in humans. To further compare the putative 1b exons in both human and mouse, here we have examined the extent of conservation in nucleotides near human and mouse candidate 1b exons. If 1b exons contribute to expressed proteins that are conserved among sets of species, selective pressures should be acting upon the &#x003b2;3b subunits. In such cases, one might expect that there would be some conservation among genomes both in the intron&#x02013;exon junction preceding the 1b exon and in its noncoding region.</p><p>A 200-bp segment of nucleotides corresponding to the noncoding sequence upstream of the human 1b ORF was compared against other genomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>), revealing a similar segment in both chimp and rhesus monkey.

All three primate genomes shared an appropriate canonical 5&#x02032; GT intron&#x02013;exon splice donor site (GTAAGT; reverse complement). In contrast, when the 123 base pairs identified in the cloned candidate mouse 1b sequence were compared (using the mm9 mouse genome build) against genomes of other placental mammals, no homologues were identified (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>), although the candidate mouse 1b exon was preceded by an appropriate intron&#x02013;exon 5&#x02032; splice donor site.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Primate and candidate rodent KCNMB3 1b exons probably arose independently and neither appear to be conserved among mammals.

Stronger filtering tends to remove paralogues and pseudo-genes, but may also remove relevant orthologues of weaker homology. In this case, a region of homology was identified in the rat genome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). This corresponded to two distinct segments of homology, an initial 10 homologous residues adjacent to the presumed intron&#x02013;exon splice site and then an additional segment of 78 bp of high homology, separated by a 120-bp insert in the rat genome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Both genomes share similar consensus sequences denoting a canonical GT intron&#x02013;exon splice donor site. Although this rat sequence is not recognized with homology screens based on the current build of the mouse genome, we think it likely that these are true orthologues. Both putative exons map to similar positions within their respective KCNMB3 gene maps (Fig. S5). It should be noted that the insert in the rat KCNMB3 gene region (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>) appears to be a transposable element, since blast searches of the rat genome reveal similar segments of almost complete identity on chrs. 1&#x02013;20 and chr. X. This insert shows no conservation with any bacterial or viral genomic sequences. A similar repetitive element of &#x0003e;90% identity also appears in the mouse genome.

First, a hydrophobic phenylalanine residue, F4, at the beginning of the human &#x003b2;3b N terminus, is replaced by a leucine in m&#x003b2;3b'. A critical role of bulky hydrophobic residues in inactivation has previously been demonstrated for the &#x003b2;2 N terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Xia et al., 2003</xref>). Second, the m&#x003b2;3b' N terminus contains a six-residue deletion that may also impact on the ability of the N terminus to reach an appropriate blocking position. Although the length of the m&#x003b2;3b' N terminus is sufficient to support inactivation in artificial N termini containing a three-residue inactivation segment and a polyglutamine linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Xia et al., 2003</xref>), the combination of a weaker binding epitope (e.g., MTAL) coupled with shorter length might both contribute to the absence of inactivation. Three separate constructs were examined to test these ideas.</p><p>Two alterations were made in h&#x003b2;3b in an attempt to make it more like m&#x003b2;3b'. Construct h&#x003b2;3b-F4L produced no observable time-dependent inactivation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>) using protocols that reveal fast inactivation with wild-type h&#x003b2;3b (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). However, application of trypsin resulted in pronounced increases in the outward current activated at positive potentials, indicative that the MTAL N terminus was still able to produce some block of the channel. However, the trypsin-mediated increase in current was much less than is observed for wild-type h&#x003b2;3b (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>), indicative that the F4L mutation does weaken block by the &#x003b2;3 N terminus. In a second construct, h&#x003b2;3b-&#x00394;10-15, a deletion of six residues resulted in currents that showed a slight hint of time-dependent inactivation, but only at the most positive activation potentials (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>). However, the currents exhibited substantial voltage-dependent block of steady-state current at positive potentials, indicative that the N terminus is still capable of blocking the channel. Application of trypsin for durations that readily remove h&#x003b2;3b inactivation had only minor effects on the outward current block of h&#x003b2;3b-&#x00394;10-15. We interpret these results to indicate that the &#x00394;10-15 deletion reduces the blocking affinity of the &#x003b2;3b N terminus. The failure of trypsin to remove this block probably relates to the shortening of the N terminus and the fact that &#x003b2; subunit N termini can be to some extent protected from digestion by trypsin when positioned within the antechamber formed between the pore domain and the cytosolic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). The resistance of h&#x003b2;3b-&#x00394;10-15 to digestion by trypsin is somewhat surprising, given that in the &#x00394;10-15 construct, a lysine at position 9 might be expected to be subject to digestion by trypsin. However, there may be secondary structural aspects of the &#x003b2;3b N terminus that also contribute to the failure of trypsin to digest this construct. We also examined an m&#x003b2;3b' subunit with an L4F mutation. In this case, currents did not reveal any rapid time-dependent inactivation, but trypsin application produced a slight increase in outward current. Overall, these results are consistent with the idea that phenylalalanine in position 4 may help stabilize the inactivated state, and that the length of the N terminus is also important in permitting inactivation to occur. However, the fact that neither the chain length nor the F/L mutation completely converts human to m&#x003b2;3b behavior suggests that other differences in the N terminus are also likely to contribute to the inability of the m&#x003b2;3b subunit to produce inactivation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Both residue and length variation contribute to differences in inactivation behavior between mouse &#x003b2;3b' and human &#x003b2;3b subunits.

Representative GV curves are shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref> and the V<sub>h</sub> as a function of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>) shows that at any Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> the V<sub>h</sub> for activation is shifted negatively &#x0223c;50&#x02013;70 mV relative to Slo1 alone. Similar shifts in GV curves were not observed with human &#x003b2;3 subunits. Activation and deactivation time constants for &#x003b1;&#x0002b;m&#x003b2;3b' currents were also determined over a range of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). In comparison to Slo1 &#x003b1; alone, m&#x003b2;3b' results in a substantial slowing of deactivation, similar to previously described effects of &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Wallner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Xia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cox and Aldrich, 2000</xref>). However, whereas both &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;2 also slow activation, a phenomenon particularly noticeable at 0 Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, the mouse &#x003b2;3b' subunit has only small effects on current activation at 0 Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> at potentials positive to &#x0002b;100 mV. In sum, the ability of the mouse &#x003b2;3 subunit to shift gating differs markedly from the behavior of the human &#x003b2;3 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zeng et al., 2001</xref>).

Specifically, instantaneous current&#x02013;voltage (I-V) curves resulting from &#x003b1;&#x0002b;h&#x003b2;3 subunits exhibit a marked curvature with larger conductances at more positive potentials. Furthermore, single &#x003b1;&#x0002b;h&#x003b2;3 channel openings exhibit the characteristics of a rapid voltage-dependent block at more negative potentials that is relieved with depolarization. These properties have been shown to arise from the h&#x003b2;3 extracellular loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Zeng et al., 2003</xref>). Treatment with extracellular DTT abolishes the rectification presumably because of disruption of a structure arising from disulfide linkages of the conserved cysteines in the extracellular loop. Here we examined instantaneous I-V curves for &#x003b1;&#x0002b;m&#x003b2;3&#x02032; currents (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 A</xref>) and compared them to similar I-V curves obtained from currents arising from subunits alone and for currents from &#x003b1;&#x0002b;h&#x003b2;3 subunits (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 B</xref>). &#x003b1;&#x0002b;m&#x003b2;3b' instantaneous I-V curves exhibited substantially less outward rectification than the &#x003b1;&#x0002b;h&#x003b2;3b currents, although more than &#x003b1; subunits alone. To confirm that the instantaneous I-V curves reflected the conductance properties of the underlying single channels, openings of single &#x003b1;&#x0002b;m&#x003b2;3b' were examined over a similar range of voltages (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 C</xref>). The curvature in the single channel IVs were found to mirror the behavior of the macroscopic instantaneous I-V curves. In sum, the mouse &#x003b2;3 subunit exhibits less macroscopic outward current rectification than its human counterpart, and the single channel openings exhibit less reduction in conductance at negative potentials. For mouse &#x003b1;&#x0002b;&#x003b2;3b' channels, the single channel slope conductance measured over the range of 0 to &#x0002b;140 mV was 207.7 &#x000b1; 4.1 pS (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9).

However, to better address this issue, we undertook an examination of conservation among genomes over the region containing the potential exons 1c and 1d.</p><p>The 1d and 1c exons in humans immediately precede exon 2, with the 1c reading frame being contiguous with exon 2. <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 A</xref> displays nucleotide alignments spanning the end of exon 2 through the identified coding sequence of the human 1c exon. A PhastCons evaluation within the placental mammals indicates only weak conservation over exon 1c, suggesting that there has been little selective pressure to maintain sequence in this region. In some species, gaps and inserts disrupt the alignments and, furthermore, except for the primates, only in horse and cat is a putative AUG (complement: CAT) methionine-encoding triplet observed in the reading frame (see Fig. S6 for translations of the nucleotide sequences for all reading frames). Although it is not possible to exclude the possibility that within the lower mammals some of these reading frames encode expressed 1c exons, the overall absence of conservation among mammals suggests that the primate-specific 1c exon is likely to be functionally unique.</p><fig position="float" id="fig10"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>KCNMB3 exons 1c and 1d exhibit weak conservation among mammals. (A) A segment from human KCNMB3 containing the end of shared exon 2 and exon 1c was used to search for homology among placental mammals. The translated open reading frame is shown at the top. Both exon 1c and the end of exon 2 exhibit low PhastCons scores indicative that there has been little selective pressure in this region among placental mammals. Many species also lack a triplet (CAT complementary to AUG) encoding an initiation methionine or contain gaps or inserts that disrupt the ORF (see Fig. S6 for translations of different reading frames).

The 5&#x02032; intron&#x02013;exon splice site, which is conserved in primates, exhibits a number of substitutions across species, although the initial GT motif is shared among most of the displayed genomes.

Human, chimp, and rhesus share a similar 6-bp 5&#x02032; GT intron&#x02013;exon splice donor site. Although the GT motif was conserved in most of the other mammals (but not in rat, mouse, hedgehog), overall conservation within the 6-bp segment was low, suggesting that there has been little selective pressure maintaining conservation in this region. Again, although we cannot exclude that this region in lower mammals may result in expressible exons with weak homology to the primate 1d exon, the overall weak homology (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and Fig. S6) of the resulting amino acids within such exons would likely result in N termini with distinct functional properties.</p><p>Whereas the &#x003b2;3c subunit variant containing the 1c exon produces inactivating currents that differ in kinetic and steady-state behavior from inactivation produced by either &#x003b2;3a or &#x003b2;3b subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Uebele et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Xia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>), the functional properties conferred on BK channels by the &#x003b2;3d variant are less certain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Uebele et al.

Similarly, in studies of &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2;3d subunits in oocytes, we have found that the resulting currents are indistinguishable from those resulting from &#x003b1; alone. Furthermore, the currents do not have the characteristic rectification of the macroscopic instantaneous current&#x02013;voltage relationship (e.g., see <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) that is diagnostic for expression of human &#x003b2;3 subunits. As such, the role of &#x003b2;3d subunits in BK channel function remains uncertain, but its existence in native tissues is strongly supported by the presence of &#x003b2;3 message both in human cDNA libraries and in Northern blots of various human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Uebele et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>N Termini of Inactivating Kv Subunits Exhibit Little Divergence among Mammals</title><p>Given the substantial sequence variability in &#x003b2;3 N termini among species, we wondered whether N-terminal variability might be common in other segments thought to be important in mediating rapid inactivation. We therefore compared the first 40 N-terminal residues of N termini of inactivating Kv &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits among the same set of species. These comparisons show strong conservation among mammalian species particularly in the initial 10&#x02013;20 residues likely to be critically important in terms of defining inactivation behavior. It has been shown for both Kv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hoshi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Murrell-Lagnado and Aldrich, 1993</xref>) and BK &#x003b2;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Xia et al., 2003</xref>) N termini that the basic ability of an N terminus to produce inactivation can tolerate a variety of manipulations of the N terminus, albeit with some alteration of the inactivation kinetics. However, the strong selection for a particular N-terminal sequence across species suggests that the kinetic properties conferred by a given N terminus likely have very strongly defined functional consequences. These considerations further emphasize the unique nature of the species-specific changes in the &#x003b2;3 N termini.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>These results show that auxiliary &#x003b2;3 subunits encoded by the KCNMB3 gene differ appreciably in sequence and function between primates and rodents. We feel there are two primary implications of the present results. First, because of functional differences among orthologues in different species, the physiological roles of such subunits may also be species specific. As a consequence, conclusions regarding a physiological role of a subunit in a given species must be taken with some caution. Second, the &#x003b2;3b, &#x003b2;3c, and &#x003b2;3d subunits appear to be primate-specific functional variants. As a consequence, these subunits may confer on BK channels functional properties that are unique to primates. In this Discussion, we will focus on two general topics: first, the differences in functional properties of a given &#x003b2; subunit among species and how this may impact on attempts to understand physiological roles and, second, a more speculative consideration of the origins and significance of the species-specific differences in the KCNMB3 gene.</p><sec><title>Physiological Roles of &#x003b2;3 Subunit Variants Will Differ among Species</title><p>Among the family of subunits encoded by the four KCNMB genes, the &#x003b2;3 subunit shows substantially more amino acid variation than other BK &#x003b2; subunits and, remarkably, this also includes variation in the number and properties of alternative exons that encode the functionally critical N terminus. Of the four distinct N-terminal splice variants identified in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Uebele et al., 2000</xref>), we have identified only two variants in mouse (and rat), exons 1a and 1b', which might be considered similar to those in humans. However, despite the similarity in amino acid sequences encoded by these exons, our functional analyses suggest that the rodent &#x003b2;3 N-terminal variants are likely to have distinct functional consequences than their human counterparts.</p><p>The mouse (and rat) appear to share with humans only one true orthologue, &#x003b2;3a. Both human and rodent &#x003b2;3a subunits result in qualitatively similar behavior, an interesting inactivation-dependent development of a slow tail current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>). However, there are marked differences between the two in terms of the rate of onset of inactivation and also the extent of steady-state inactivation, which impact on the rate of development of the slow tail current. These differences may be in part linked to differences between the human and mouse &#x003b2;3 subunits in terms of their effects on the apparent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dependence of gating, with the mouse &#x003b2;3a subunit shifting gating approximately &#x02212;60 mV at a given [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] in comparison to the h&#x003b2;3a subunit. Overall, we would therefore predict that BK channels containing either rodent or human &#x003b2;3a subunits would have quite different effects on cellular excitability. Yet, we think it is important to keep in mind that the strong conservation in mammals of the 20-residue &#x003b2;3a exon suggests that the slow, use-dependent tail current prolongation produced by this N terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>) likely plays some conserved physiological role in BK channel function, wherever it is expressed.</p><p>The mouse and rat genomes also appear to encode a second candidate &#x003b2;3 N-terminal variant, termed exon 1b', which, similar to the human 1b exon, encodes a single N-terminal methionine. However, since this 1b' exon most likely arose independently of the 1b exon in primates and the m&#x003b2;3b' and h&#x003b2;3b subunits results in distinct species-specific functional differences, it seems likely that the two variants do not represent true orthologues. The functional differences between m&#x003b2;3b' and h&#x003b2;3b are even more dramatic than for the &#x003b2;3a subunits, with h&#x003b2;3b subunit producing a very rapid inactivation that, in effect, results in marked current rectification, while the m&#x003b2;3b' subunit produces no observable inactivation.</p><p>Together these comparisons indicate that the physiological contributions of these apparently similar subunits will almost certainly differ markedly between primates and rodents. At present, no information is available about the expression pattern of &#x003b2;3 subunits in rodents to aid in assessing the potential physiological roles of such channels in native tissues. These observations point out that caution must be exercised in regards to cross species inferences regarding a physiological role of a particular subunit, when that subunit may differ substantially in sequence, function, and most likely loci of cellular expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance of &#x003b2;3 N-terminal Diversity among Species</title><p>The results presented here show that the KCNMB3 gene has undergone extensive evolutionary change in N-terminal variation. Although the comparisons undertaken here have used some genomes in which the current level of sequencing is incomplete and/or at low coverage, the regions of the genomes compared here, particularly with respect to the &#x003b2;3c and &#x003b2;3d variants, appear sufficiently complete that this concern is minor.</p><p>Perhaps most intriguingly, three of the four &#x003b2;3 N-terminal variants found in humans may be primate-specific gene products. This includes &#x003b2;3b, &#x003b2;3c, and &#x003b2;3d. The reasons for considering the human &#x003b2;3b subunit distinct from the rodent &#x003b2;3b' were considered above. We cannot exclude that other similar &#x003b2;3b paralogues may have arisen in other mammalian genomes and would not have been recognized in our evaluations. However, for the present, the results indicate that no homologue of the primate 1b exon can be found in other genomes. The apparent absence of homologues for the &#x003b2;3c and &#x003b2;3d N-terminal variants in both the mouse and rat genomes prompted our search of other genomes and also a close examination of the reading frames upstream of exon 2 in various species. PhastCons scores of placental mammals in the 1c and 1d coding regions revealed little conservation in nucleotides, indicative that there has been little selective pressure in the candidate coding regions. Furthermore, the presence of inserts and gaps, the absence of appropriate initiation methionines encoded in the open reading frames, and, in the case of the 1d exon, a lack of conservation at the GT intron&#x02013;exon splice donor site argue strongly that these regions have undergone considerable change throughout the evolution of mammals and that there has been little selective pressure that might minimize any changes. As such, these considerations lead substantive support to the idea that both the 1c and 1d exons are primate-specific exons, leading to a diversity of KCNMb3 isoforms apparently not present in the non-primates. Even if 1c or 1d exons were expressed in some non-primates, the predicted sequence differences suggest that both &#x003b2;3c and &#x003b2;3d variants define ion channel subunits that are functionally specific to high primates.</p><p>What might the specific functional roles of the KCNMB3 variants be in primates? In regards to the first question, the only information of some relevance is the distribution of &#x003b2;3 message in Northern blots from human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Uebele et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, of the four N-terminal variants, the most evolutionarily conserved variant, &#x003b2;3a, shows the most restricted distribution, being found primarily in spleen and placenta, with weaker presence in heart, kidney, and pancreas. In contrast, message for &#x003b2;3b, &#x003b2;3c, and &#x003b2;3d exhibits widespread distribution, with each subunit showing particularly robust expression in particular loci (&#x003b2;3b: kidney, pancreas, spleen; &#x003b2;3c: liver, kidney, pancreas, spleen; &#x003b2;3d: kidney, pancreas, testes, spleen). Of the four human KCNMB3 variants, the &#x003b2;3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>) and &#x003b2;3b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Xia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lingle et al., 2001</xref>) are the most extensively studied, and properties of &#x003b2;3c and &#x003b2;3d have only been noted in passing. The &#x003b2;3c, like &#x003b2;3a and &#x003b2;3b, produces inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Uebele et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Xia et al., 2000</xref>), although it does not appear to share the use-dependent properties characteristic of &#x003b2;3a. The &#x003b2;3c variant has been shown by immunohistochemistry to be present in human pancreatic &#x003b2; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Uebele et al., 2000</xref>), but properties of BK channels in such cells have not been defined. As noted in the Results, knowledge about &#x003b2;3d is even more limited, and its effects on BK channels studied in heterologous systems remains unclear. Potentially, BK currents can be investigated in cells from some of these tissues that contain &#x003b2;3b, &#x003b2;3c, or &#x003b2;3d message to test whether currents of appropriate properties can be found and what the physiological roles of such currents might be.</p><p>Another question raised by these results is, why is there such extensive N-terminal variation in the KCNMB3 gene? At present, there is insufficient information to answer this question and we may not even know the full extent of the N-terminal variation. For example, although the present work establishes two candidate KCNMB3 N-terminal exons in rodents, it may be the case that additional variants, perhaps the putative x1 and x2 exons described in the Materials and methods, may also occur. Similarly, the failure to identify by genomic analysis viable exons other than the 1a exon in many species does not preclude that additional N-terminal variants may be found in those species.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>Ultimately, elucidation of the potential physiological roles of &#x003b2;3 subunits will be aided by studies in rodent species, a fact that motivated the characterization of &#x003b2;3 functional properties in mouse presented here. However, the marked functional differences observed here between human and mouse &#x003b2;3 subunit variants argue that any role defined by genetic manipulations in mice may not be strictly applicable to other species, including humans. On the other hand, since &#x003b2;3a seems to be the major KCNMB3 variant in mice, a general KO of the KCNMB3 gene is likely to lead to some understanding about the possible physiological roles of the slow use-dependent tail currents mediated by this subunit. Overall, the present results highlight an important lesson of comparative physiology, that proteins that are presumably homologous across species may have quite different functional properties and perhaps different physiological roles among different species.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Yefei Cai for technical assistance.
