While original studies on &#x003b1;-crystallins dealt with their abundant expression and role in the lens, it is now generally accepted that &#x003b1;-crystallins are proteins with entirely different non-lens roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>] and expressed in multiple tissues of the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. The two forms of &#x003b1;-crystallins, A and B, share an amino acid sequence homology of about 57% and are found in heterogeneous aggregates of the two proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. While the distribution of &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;B-crystallins are different-&#x003b1;A is found predominantly in the lens while &#x003b1;B is ubiquitous-both have been demonstrated to protect cells from thermal and metabolic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, their ability to prevent apoptosis by inhibiting caspases implies that &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;B-crystallins may provide crucial physiological functions in non-lens tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>].</p><p>An analysis of the expression of crystallins in the mouse retina showed that &#x003b1;A, &#x003b1;B, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3;-crystallins were found in the inner and outer nuclear layers and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. In another study, RPE cells overexpressing &#x003b1;B-crystallin showed resistance to apoptosis, suggesting that &#x003b1;-crystallins may play a beneficial role in preventing stress-induced cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. While both &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;B-crystallins offer cell protection, the relative potencies and mechanisms of cell protection have not been fully delineated. Andley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>] found that the antiapoptotic activity of &#x003b1;A is greater than &#x003b1;B-crystallin in the lens, while Mao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>] have shown that &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;B-crystallins display similar degrees of protection against apoptosis in both lens and non-lens tissues. Information on the subcellular localization of &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;B-crystallin within RPE, which has hitherto not been studied in detail, may offer clues for similarities/dissimilarities in &#x003b1;-crystallin function.</p><p>Generation of mice lacking &#x003b1;A (&#x003b1;A(-/-)) and &#x003b1;B (&#x003b1;B(-/-))-crystallin has provided valuable insights into the functional roles of these proteins in the lens. Lenses of &#x003b1;A-crystallin deficient mice appeared structurally normal, but developed opacification quickly with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. The presence of dense &#x003b1;B-crystallin inclusion bodies in the central lens fiber cells of &#x003b1;A(-/-) mice was also observed, suggesting that &#x003b1;A-crystallin may be necessary for maintaining the solubility of other crystallins in the lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. It was also found that the absence of &#x003b1;A increases cell death during the mitotic phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. On the other hand, lenses in the &#x003b1;B(-/-) mice developed normally and were remarkably similar to wild-type mouse lenses, but &#x003b1;B(-/-) mice showed skeletal muscle degeneration, spine curvature and a life span one half that of wild type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Further, lens cells from &#x003b1;B(-/-) mice exhibited a greater tendency for hyperproliferation in culture and genomic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Recent studies have addressed the link between crystallin expression and progression of retinal diseases. The level of &#x003b1;B-crystallin in rd1 mouse retina increased significantly at 15 days postnatal, which correlated with the stage of maximal rod degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Further, an increase in &#x003b1;B-crystallin was also found in various retinal degenerations which varied according to the severity, type and onset of the degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Oxidative stress could cause alterations in crystallin content of the retina as has been observed in brain and Alzheimer disease, but the evidence is lacking at the present time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>].</p><p>In an attempt to better understand the role of drusen in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Crabb et al. performed a proteomic analysis of drusen preparations from AMD and non-AMD donor eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. They found that crystallins were detected in all drusen preparations in AMD patients, and were inconsistently observed in non-AMD samples. The results indicated that &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;B-crystallins accumulated in Bruch membrane and choroidal connective tissue to a greater degree in AMD than in normal aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. It was suggested that accumulation of crystallins was a stress response manifested during the presence of AMD, and that crystallins may be involved in trapping damaged proteins and preventing their aggregation. Recent drusen analyses on primates have identified an elevated titer for &#x003bc;-crystallin antibodies in macular degeneration animals, suggesting that autoantibodies against &#x003bc;-crystallin may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>].</p><p>The compartmental localization of &#x003b1;-crystallins in ocular tissues and its significance are topics of great interest. &#x003b1;-Crystallins are predominantly cytosolic proteins but nuclear localization of &#x003b1;B-crystallins has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. Deretic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>] had shown that &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;B-crystallins are expressed in frog retinal cells in soluble form and associated with post-Golgi membrane of photoreceptors that participate in the transport of newly synthesized rhodopsin. Recently, studies in U373MG cells, which express appreciable amounts of &#x003b1;B-crystallin, showed that &#x003b1;B-crystallin localized in the perinuclear region of the Golgi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. The function of crystallins in the Golgi and the effects of physical and chemical stress on their reorganization in Golgi as well as other compartments has not been fully explored.</p><p>In the present study we have investigated the effect of the absence of &#x003b1;-crystallins on the susceptibility of RPE cells to apoptotic stimuli. The influence of oxidative stress on the expression and subcellular distribution of &#x003b1;-crystallins in human RPE is also examined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and materials</title><p>Hydrogen peroxide was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The 129S6/SvEvTac control mice were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY), while the &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;B-crystallin knockout mice in 129S6/SvEvTac background were obtained from the National Eye Institute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Human RPE cells were isolated from fetal human donor eyes obtained from Advanced Bioscience Resources, Inc., (Alameda, CA). Eight donors were used for experiments, and donor to donor variation had a negligible effect on the results.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation and characterization of primary cultured retinal pigment epithelium from knockout mice</title><p>All animal studies were conducted with adherence to the ARVO animal statement. The cornea, lens, vitreous, and retina were removed from eyes soaked in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). The choroid/sclera tissue was then placed into a 2% dispase solution in PBS for 20 min at 37 &#x000b0;C. After the incubation, the tissue was rapidly pipetted up and down for 30 s. The dispase solution containing the RPE cells was passed through a 70 &#x003bc; filter followed by a 40 &#x003bc; filter after which the cells were spun down and resuspended in Ham's F-12 Media (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) containing at least 25% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA). The RPE were then grown on laminin coated plates (Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and primary passages of wild type RPE controls, &#x003b1;A(-/-), and &#x003b1;B(-/-) mice were then incubated in medium containing 1% FBS overnight prior to treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (100 &#x003bc;M -200 &#x003bc;M) for 24 h. RPE cell cultures were characterized by immunoreactivity for cytokeratin and RPE65, established markers of RPE.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and treatment for human retinal pigment epithelium</title><p>Studies using cultured human RPE were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Southern California and adhere to the Declaration of Helsinki. Primary RPE cells were cultured in DMEM with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin (Sigma), and 10% heat-inactivated FBS as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Third to fourth passage cells at &#x0003e;90% confluency were used in all experiments. Prior to treatment, cells were changed to 1% FBS DMEM for 16 h and then treated with varying doses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 24 h. Initial studies on time course of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment established 24 h as an optimal time point for all studies. Experiments in 1% serum were repeated in serum-free media, and subsequent results revealed similar trends. Cell viability following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment protocol in our experiments was verified by Trypan Blue (Cellgro), and Annexin V staining (Annexin V FLUOS staining kit; Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN).</p></sec><sec><title>Apoptosis assays</title><p>To determine whether knockout of &#x003b1;-crystallin gene expression in mouse RPE cells would cause an increase in apoptosis, DNA cleavage of &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;B-crystallin knockout mice and wild type control cells were measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL; In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein; Roche). After treatment, floating and adherent cells were collected and pooled together. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate. To label DNA strand breaks, cells were incubated with 50 &#x003bc;l TUNEL reaction mixture containing TdT and fluorescein-dUTP in the binding buffer and incubated for 90 min at 37 &#x000b0;C in a humidified chamber. Cells were then washed and analyzed by flow cytometry. Further differentiation between apoptotic versus necrotic mechanisms of cell death was achieved by Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining (Annexin V FLUOS staining kit; Roche) of RPE isolated from wild type and &#x003b1;-crystallin knockout mice at the various doses of oxidative stress. Cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. Cells positive for Annexin V staining, but not PI were gated as early apoptotic cells. AnnexinV/PI double positive cells indicated either late stage apoptosis or necrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Caspase-3 activation</title><p>Caspase-3 activation was determined using a CaspACE<sup>TM</sup> FITC-VAD-FMK In Situ Marker (Promega, Madison, WI), a FITC-conjugated caspase inhibitor. Cells were collected and incubated with FITC-VAD-FMK for 60 min, then measured by flow cytometry using the FL-1 setting. Ten thousand events were recorded in each analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Mitochondrial membrane permeability transition</title><p>The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential by apoptosis is marked by increased mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) thought to occur through the formation of pores in the mitochondria by dimerizing apoptotic proteins. During this process, the electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial membrane collapses. To assess the mitochondrial membrane potential, a cell permeable cationic dye (Mito Flow; Cell Technology, Mountain View, CA) is added to the cells for 30 min at culture conditions and then analyzed by flow cytometry using FL-3 setting. Ten thousand events were recorded in each analysis. Healthy cells retain the reagent, while apoptotic cells exhibit a lower fluorescence signal due to less accumulation of the dye.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of &#x003b1;-crystallin genes with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment</title><p>Initial relative gene expression levels of &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;B-crystallin was examined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). cDNA from harvested RNA was transcribed using oligo(dT) and 5 &#x003bc;g of total RNA. 1 &#x003bc;l of cDNA was added to a master mix of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10X buffer, dNTP, primers (see below), and Taq polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After 30 cycles, samples were run on an agarose gel with ethidium bromide. Quantitative expression of &#x003b1;-crystallin was examined using real-time PCR (LightCycler; Roche). Trizol (GIBCO BRL, Rockville, MD) was used to extract and isolate RNA, while contaminating genomic DNA was removed with a DNAase kit (DNA-free; Ambion, Austin, TX). One &#x003bc;g of total RNA, measured by a spectrophotometer, was added to oligo(dT)<sub>15</sub> primer (Promega, Madison, WI) and AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega) for the reverse transcriptase reaction. After a 1:10 dilution of the cDNA, 2 &#x003bc;l of the cDNA was added to 2 &#x003bc;l of green fluorescent dye with Taq DNA polymerase in a 20 &#x003bc;l PCR mix (LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I, Roche). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as an internal control. Human primers were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and were only selected if the pair spanned across exons to minimize non-specific products (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA): &#x003b1;A 5'-GAG ATC CAC GGA AAG CAC AAC-3' (nucleotide position 52-72) and 5'- GGT AGC GGC GGT GGA ACT-3' (107-127); &#x003b1;B 5'-TCC CCA GAG GAA CTC AAA GTT AAG-3' (278-301) and 5'-GGC GCT CTT CAT GTT TCC A-3' (327-347); GAPDH 5'-CCA CAT CGC TCA GAC ACC AT-3' (85-104) and 5'-GGC AAC AAT ATC CAC TTT ACC AGA GT-3' (150-169).</p><p>Product formation detection was set in the center of the linear portion of PCR amplification, and the cycle at which each reaction reached the set threshold (C<sub>T</sub>) was determined. Relative change in mRNA expression was calculated to obtain the &#x00394;&#x00394;C<sub>T</sub> values. Four separate sets of RNA were isolated and examined, and each set was tested in duplicate. Levels were normalized relative to GAPDH mRNA and reported as fold change over controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation and fractionation of proteins</title><p>For crude cell lysates, trypsinized cells were pelleted and washed once with PBS. Fifty microliters of Mammalian Protein Extraction buffer (Pierce, Rockford, IL), along with a 1:100 dilution of proteinase inhibitor mix (Sigma), was added to each pellet. After incubation for 1 h at 4 &#x000b0;C, cell debris was pelleted at 14,000xg for 10 min. The remaining supernatant, containing the soluble cell proteins, was measured for protein concentration, using bovine serum albumin as a standard.</p><p>To separate mitochondrial proteins from cytosolic proteins, mitochondria were first isolated using a Mitochondria/Cytosol Fractionation Kit (BioVision Inc., Mountain View, CA). To check the efficiency of homogenization, suspensions were observed under a microscope. A shiny ring around the cell indicated intact cells, and 35 strokes with a dounce homogenizer lysed 90% of the cells. The lysate was first spun for 10 min at 700xg to remove cellular debris and then at 10,000xg for 30 min to pellet the mitochondria. The resulting supernatant was saved as the cytosol portion while the pellet, containing whole mitochondria, was lysed with a mitochondria-specific buffer supplied with the kit. The purity of the fractions was checked by Western blot analysis with a polyclonal antibody against prohibitin, a mitochondrial marker (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and GW182, a cytoplasmic resident protein (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). Nuclear fractions were isolated using a Nuclear/Cytosol Fractionation Kit (BioVision Inc.). Harvested samples were examined by Western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein analysis</title><p>Protein expression was examined using Western blot techniques. Concentration of harvested proteins was examined by the Bradford-Lowry assay. Equal amounts of protein lysate (15-50 &#x003bc;g) were resolved on 12.5-15% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels (Ready Gel; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) at 120 V and then transferred to a PVDF blotting membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Each membrane was blocked with 5% blotting grade non-fat dry milk (Biorad), incubated with rabbit anti-&#x003b1;A crystallin or anti-&#x003b1;B crystallin antibody (Stressgen, San Diego, CA). Specificity of antibodies was confirmed by testing in knockout mice; &#x003b1;A showed no immunoreactive band in &#x003b1;A(-/-) and &#x003b1;B showed no immunoreactive band in &#x003b1;B(-/-) retina. After incubation with the secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Cleveland, OH). To verify equal loading of proteins, gels were stained with Coomassie stain (Bio-Safe Coomassie Stain, BioRad) or PVDF membranes were stripped with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween for 30 min at 60 &#x000b0;C and then incubated with GAPDH antibody (Ambion).</p></sec><sec><title>Confocal microscopy</title><p>RPE cells, grown to &#x0003e;90% confluency on chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Naperville, IL) and exposed to oxidative stress, were examined for &#x003b1;-crystallin expression and for mitochondrial localization. To visualize the mitochondria, mitochondria tracker (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to samples for 30 min, prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. GM130 antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was used to label the Golgi body. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 (J. T. Baker Chemical Co, Phillipsburg, NJ) for 15 min, and then blocked with 5% blotting grade non-fat dry milk (Bio-Rad) in Tris buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween for 15 min. A 1:100 dilution of &#x003b1;A or &#x003b1;B crystallin antibody was incubated overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C prior to addition of Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 30 min the following day.

The blocks were then ultra thin sectioned (75 nm in thickness) and placed on parlodian coated nickel grids. Sections on grids were etched with 0.5% sodium metaperiodate 10 min at room temperature to remove excess resin, and then washed 5 times for 10 min each by drops of 0.025 M Tris buffer (pH 7.4).

The depletion of &#x003b1;B-crystallin in mitochondria with supra-physiological H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> doses (&#x0003e;300 &#x003bc;M) in human RPE may reflect the consumption of &#x003b1;B-crystallin for scavenging large amounts of ROS generated.</p><p>We found that &#x003b1;A-crystallin protein expression remained stable, while &#x003b1;B-crystallin expression increased upon low doses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and returned back to control levels with high doses. &#x003b1;A-Crystallin mRNA expression showed approximately a two-fold induction with both low and high doses of oxidative stress. &#x003b1;B-Crystallin mRNA expression was also upregulated with low doses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but interestingly, decreased dramatically at higher doses. The concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in this study are in the range previously used by others to examine &#x003b1;B-crystallin gene expression. Alge et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>] reported that 200 &#x003bc;M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulted in an upregulation of &#x003b1;B-crystallin mRNA. The maximal increase occurred at 6 h in their study, while the conditions we have chosen are intended to mimic chronic oxidative stress more frequently seen in vivo. The upregulation of several genes with sublethal doses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and a down-regulation with higher doses has been reported in a number of recent studies supporting the idea that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> may act as a signaling molecule at low doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. The exact signaling mechanism associated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> remains to be elucidated. It is worth noting that it was found that human <italic>bcl2</italic> gene attenuates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis in rabbit lens epithelial cells through down-regulation of the &#x003b1;B-crystallin gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>].</p><p>Studies on crystallins have focused predominantly in the lens, where both &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;B-crystallin are expressed in equal amounts and comprise a huge portion of total soluble protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. On the other hand, in mouse retina, &#x003b1;B-crystallin is 15 to 30 fold lower than &#x003b1;A-crystallin, but distributed in the same layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. While the information on &#x003b1;-crystallin expression in the RPE is scarce, data from our current study indicate a much higher expression of &#x003b1;B-crystallin as compared to &#x003b1;A-crystallin. RPE isolated from &#x003b1;A or &#x003b1;B-crystallin knockout mice showed an increased susceptibility to apoptosis via oxidative stress. The extent of cell death from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was similar in both &#x003b1;A(-/-) and &#x003b1;B(-/-) RPE, but it is interesting that the utilization of antiapoptotic mechanistic pathways could vary among the three prominent members of the sHSP family, namely Hsp27, &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;B-crystallins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>].</p><p>The BCL-2 family contributes to the regulation of the swelling of the mitochondria and the opening of the permeability transition pore. Our studies have revealed that RPE cells from &#x003b1;A(-/-) mice show an increased mitochondrial membrane permeability transition compared to wildtype cells under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> insult. While BCL-2 family members are thought to be the sentinels of cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>], crystallins may be acting as chaperones or regulators, possibly by interaction at the BH3 domain of these proteins. &#x003b1;-Crystallins may also be directly and/or indirectly affecting downstream death effectors at the caspase level. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated RPE cells from &#x003b1;A(-/-) show increased caspase-3 activation compared to wildtype RPE. Studies done by others show that &#x003b1;B-crystallin negatively regulates cyt c and caspase-8-independent activation of caspase 3 by inhibiting its autoproteolytic maturation, which may provide further clues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Further work will be needed to assess the contribution of mitochondrial (and extramitochondrial) pathways of apoptosis in RPE cells under oxidative stress.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Tony Rodriguez, and Xiaoping Wang for technical assistance and Dr. Jie Cai for statistical analysis.
