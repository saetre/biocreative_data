We previously identified limitations on poliovirus spread after peripheral injection of mice expressing the human poliovirus receptor (PVR), and we hypothesized that the host interferon response may contribute to the viral bottlenecks. Here, we examined poliovirus population bottlenecks in PVR mice and in PVR mice that lack the interferon &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptor (PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>), an important component of innate immunity. To monitor population dynamics, we developed a pool of ten marked polioviruses discriminated by a novel hybridization-based assay. Following intramuscular or intraperitoneal injection of the ten-virus pool, a major bottleneck was observed during transit to the brain in PVR mice, but was absent in PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, suggesting that the interferon response was a determinant of the peripheral site-to-brain bottleneck. Since poliovirus infects humans by the fecal&#x02013;oral route, we tested whether bottlenecks exist after oral inoculation of PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Despite the lack of a bottleneck following peripheral injection of PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, we identified major bottlenecks in orally inoculated animals, suggesting physical barriers may contribute to the oral bottlenecks. Interestingly, two of the three major bottlenecks we identified were partially overcome by pre-treating mice with dextran sulfate sodium, which damages the colonic epithelium. Overall, we found that viral trafficking from the gut to other body sites, including the CNS, is a very dynamic, stochastic process. We propose that multiple host barriers and the resulting limited poliovirus population diversity may help explain the rare occurrence of viral CNS invasion and paralytic poliomyelitis. These natural host barriers are likely to play a role in limiting the spread of many microbes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>RNA viruses are highly error prone, and can use their replication infidelity to adapt to complex environments within an infected host. However, viral populations may experience bottlenecks, which limit their diversity and potentially reduce their virulence. We hypothesized that natural barriers may limit the spread of RNA viruses within an infected host. To test this hypothesis, we engineered a pool of ten marked polioviruses identifiable by a novel assay, infected susceptible mice by injection or oral inoculation, and determined the percentage of the ten viruses that successfully spread to various body sites, including the brain. We found that, on average, only 10&#x00025;&#x02013;20&#x00025; of the input viruses were found in most tissues, suggesting that barriers prevented the spread of the whole population. The importance of one such physical barrier, the colonic epithelium, was demonstrated in experiments where the colon was damaged prior to oral inoculation. Under these conditions, 30&#x00025;&#x02013;50&#x00025; of the input viruses successfully spread to various body sites. We propose that host barriers limit viral spread, and this could possibly explain the rare incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis due to central nervous system invasion.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA viruses undergo error-prone replication and exist as quasispecies due to the high error rate of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp).

In fact, direct injection of a large inoculum (2&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> PFU) of the virus pool into the brains of PVR mice resulted in an average of 76&#x00025; of input viruses detected in the brain, confirming the absence of a major bottleneck in peripherally-injected PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. We propose several possible reasons for the diminished bottleneck in peripherally-injected PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice: 1) The first viruses to enter the brain in PVR mice established an anti-viral state which limited the spread of later viruses, resulting in a bottleneck effect. The lack of IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; response in PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, therefore, facilitated higher brain diversity. 2) Increased peripheral titers in hyper-susceptible PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may have essentially increased the poliovirus dose. This effect could be unique to PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice since our previous work determined it was very difficult to overcome the bottleneck by increased dose in PVR mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Pfeiffer2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. 3) Physical barriers in PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may have been altered due to lack of the type I IFN environment. Perhaps lack of IFNAR created differences in neurons or the blood-brain barrier that may have contributed to higher viral brain diversity in PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Importantly, data from our oral inoculation studies demonstrated a bottleneck exists between mouth and brain in PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, the lack of the IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; response in the brain was not the sole cause for the diminished bottleneck in peripherally-injected PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> brains. Additionally, PVR and PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice injected by the IC route with a low dose of the virus pool (2&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> PFU) demonstrated comparable low levels of viral diversity in the brain (13&#x00025; and 24&#x00025; of input viruses, respectively). These results suggest that viral diversity in the brain is governed by the amount of virus that enters the brain, and that elevated peripheral titers in injected PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice contribute to the elevated viral diversity in the brains of these animals.</p><p>Following oral inoculation of PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, poliovirus moves through the GI tract without much difficulty. Relatively high amounts of virus were shed in feces, including input/non-replicated viruses and replicated viruses, depending on the sampling time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Population diversity in feces was relatively high with an overall average of 81&#x00025; of input viruses present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g006">6A</xref>), suggesting only a minor bottleneck was encountered during GI lumenal passage. Although we consider this bottleneck minor, it could actually represent the successful passage of just 0.025&#x00025; (5&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> PFU) of the input virus, which would still allow detection of all pool members in our system. Regardless, this mouth-to-feces bottleneck was minor in comparison to other bottlenecks we observed.</p><p>Our experiments identified three major bottlenecks following oral inoculation of PVR-IFNAR<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice: mouth-to-gut tissues, mouth-to-blood, and mouth-to-brain. First, a major bottleneck existed between the mouth and gut tissues. Of the ten viruses, an average of 16&#x00025; of input viruses were present in the stomach, and 19&#x00025; of input viruses were present in the small intestine and the colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g006">6</xref>). We presume that virus must be replicating in these tissues to be detected late in infection when the tissues were harvested (day 5&#x02013;10). However, gut tissues could have been re-seeded by virus in the blood.</p><p>We identified a second bottleneck between mouth and blood. Blood titers were moderate, but diversity was very low (avg.&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9&#x00025; of input viruses) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g006">6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g007">7</xref>). We are uncertain how the virus is traveling from the inoculation site into the blood, but possibilities include drainage from lymph, mucosal passage to the blood, and entrance into the bloodstream at sites of mucosal micro-damage. Viruses may have entered the bloodstream early in infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Sabin1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Bodian2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Melnick1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Third, a prominent bottleneck existed between the mouth and the brain. Viral trafficking between the mouth and brain could have occurred through blood or neural routes. Historically, poliovirus invasion of the brain has been presumed to occur through the blood route because neutralizing antibodies are protective and IV-injected radiolabeled virions readily enter the murine brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Yang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Bodian3">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Bodian4">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. However, viral trafficking in neurons may also occur and contribute to pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Gromeier1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Ren2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Ohka1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Mueller1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Surprisingly, 93&#x00025; of viruses found in the brain were present in gut tissues of a given mouse, but only 35&#x00025; were detected in blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This suggests that a gut tissue-to-brain pathway was involved in viral spread. Virus may have entered the blood from gut tissues and trafficked to the brain, or virus may have infected neurons associated with the GI tract and reached the brain by retrograde transport. Trafficking via neurons has been demonstrated by sciatic nerve transection experiments following poliovirus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Ren2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Ohka1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Although our data did not definitively discriminate between blood and neural routes, our data did show that absolute match of blood and brain viruses was rare. In some instances, there was no overlap between viruses present in the brain and blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, 9-6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g005">Figure 5</xref>, 9-1). These results indicated that virus may enter the brain by a non-hematogenous route, such as neurons, that low-abundance viruses in blood seeded the brain, or that virus found in the blood at disease onset differed from the virus in the blood at earlier time-points. Interestingly, the blood/brain virus mismatch was confirmed in an experiment where blood was collected at day three post-inoculation and upon disease onset, and then blood diversity was compared with brain diversity. This experiment revealed that only 44&#x00025; of viruses found in the brain are present in blood at day three post-infection, suggesting that not all viruses may spread to the brain via a blood route (data not shown). Aside from possible GI neuronal trafficking, it is likely that virus moves into and out of blood throughout infection by seeding other tissues with subsequent re-seeding of the blood. In humans, it is thought that a primary asymptomatic viremia may seed tissues, with a subsequent secondary viremia contributing to minor or major illness, which can lead to CNS invasion and paralytic poliomyelitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Sabin1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Bodian1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Horstmann1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our results suggested that disease onset and viral diversity are linked. Earlier disease onset correlated with greater viral diversity in the gut tissues, blood, and brain. Mice that developed symptoms before day seven had 3.3-fold (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.025) higher brain diversity than those that developed symptoms later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). These early onset mice also had higher blood diversity (9-fold, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.042) and gut diversity (2.1&#x02013;3.3 fold, stomach: p&#x0003c;0.05). Greater diversity upon earlier onset was not simply due to a tissue sampling time bias, because a separate study demonstrated very low population diversity in tissues harvested on days one and three post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000082.s004">Figure S4</xref>). There are several possible explanations for the correlation of disease onset and viral diversity. First, since high population diversity and virulence are linked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Pfeiffer1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000082-Vignuzzi1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, higher viral diversity may contribute to faster disease progression. Second, some component of host immunity may have developed later in infection, which limited viral replication, and ultimately, viral diversity.</p><p>Interestingly, two of the three major bottlenecks could be overcome by pre-treating the mice with a colonic epithelial-damaging agent, DSS. The first (mouth-to-gut tissues) and second bottlenecks (mouth-to-blood) were affected by DSS treatment: gut tissue and blood diversity increased &#x0223c;2&#x02013;3-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively. Additionally, blood titers increased 66-fold in the presence of colonic damage. Importantly, the mouth-to-brain bottleneck was unchanged in DSS-treated mice compared to untreated mice. These results suggest that either virus trafficked to the brain via a non-blood route, which was unaffected by DSS treatment, or virus trafficked to the brain via a blood route, but spread to the brain was limited by another barrier, such as the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>Viral titer and diversity were not linked after a bottleneck was encountered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g007">Figure 7</xref>). By monitoring diversity, we uncovered limitations on viral trafficking that would be missed by viral titer analysis. For example, blood and fecal titers were similar; therefore, one might conclude that transit from the gut to blood was not difficult. Our assay allowed us to conclude that a major bottleneck exists since blood diversity was low. We presume that virus was replicating in blood and/or other tissues that seed blood, thus increasing the blood titer post-bottleneck encounter, resulting in founder effects.</p><p>We found that viral population trafficking was a very dynamic, stochastic process. Using virus 2 as an example, a given virus might be present in all tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g003">Figure 3</xref>, 9-1), in colon and feces only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g003">Figure 3</xref>, 9-2), in brain and feces only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g003">Figure 3</xref>, 9-6), or in other differing combinations.

Blot image intensities were adjusted such that any apparent mismatch dot was no longer visible, thus eliminating the minimal level of cross-reactivity of the probes with non-matched PCR products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000082-g001">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Accession Number</title><p>The Genbank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez</ext-link>) accession number for serotype 1 poliovirus (Mahoney strain) is NC002058.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000082.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Oligonucleotide probe sequences for detection of individual virus pool members.</p><p>(0.40 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1000082.s001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000082.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>Single-cycle growth curves.</p><p>(0.30 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1000082.s002.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000082.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>Distribution of pool members in mouse tissues.</p><p>(0.25 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1000082.s003.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000082.s004"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><p>Viral diversity in tissues harvested at early time points.</p><p>(2.58 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1000082.s004.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Lora Hooper and David Rasko for helpful comments on the manuscript.
