Here we show in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that the broadly conserved scaffolding molecule MAGI-1 is required for the plasticity observed in a glutamatergic circuit. This mechanosensory circuit mediates reversals in locomotion in response to touch stimulation, and the AMPA-type receptor (AMPAR) subunits GLR-1 and GLR-2, which are required for reversal behavior, are localized to ventral cord synapses in this circuit. We find that animals modulate GLR-1 and GLR-2 localization in response to prior mechanosensory stimulation; a specific isoform of MAGI-1 (MAGI-1L) is critical for this modulation. We show that MAGI-1L interacts with AMPARs through the intracellular domain of the GLR-2 subunit, which is required for the modulation of AMPAR synaptic localization by mechanical stimulation. In addition, mutations that prevent the ubiquitination of GLR-1 prevent the decrease in AMPAR localization observed in previously stimulated <italic>magi-1</italic> mutants. Finally, we find that previously-stimulated animals later habituate to subsequent mechanostimulation more rapidly compared to animals initially reared without mechanical stimulation; MAGI-1L, GLR-1, and GLR-2 are required for this change in habituation kinetics. Our findings demonstrate that prior experience can cause long-term alterations in both behavioral plasticity and AMPAR localization at synapses in an intact animal, and indicate a new, direct role for MAGI/S-SCAM proteins in modulating AMPAR localization and function in the wake of variable sensory experience.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Experience leads to learning and memory formation through changes in the strength of connectivity between neurons (synaptic plasticity).

These findings imply that AMPARs are not functional in the absence of GLR-1, and that AMPARs in <italic>glr-2</italic> mutants contain only GLR-1 homomers.

However, both behavioral and electrophysiological data show that GLR-2 does not form homomeric channels. Taken together, these data suggest that sequences in the GLR-2 tail mediate the trafficking and localization of GLR-1/GLR-2 heteromeric channels. The proteins that interact with these GLR-2 tail sequences have not yet been identified.</p><p>Here we show that a specific isoform of the scaffolding molecule MAGI-1 (MAGI-1L), a close homolog of mammalian MAGI/S-SCAM proteins, interacts with AMPA receptors through binding to the GLR-2 subunit. We also show that prior mechanosensory stimulation alters AMPAR localization in the interneurons that connect mechanosensory input with motor output; such alterations require MAGI-1L function. Specifically, we used a GFP fusion to examine GLR-1 localization both before and after mechanical stimulation, and we find that wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> roughly maintain consistent synaptic GLR-1 localization regardless of prior mechanosensory stimulation, whereas stimulated mutants lacking MAGI-1L show a reduction in localized GLR-1. In addition, we find that wild-type animals show a mechanosensory stimulation-dependent change in GLR-2 localization; this change also requires MAGI-1L. The requirement for MAGI-1L function in regulating GLR-1 localization is abolished in mutants lacking GLR-2, suggesting that MAGI-1L responds to prior experience by specifically modulating the trafficking of GLR-1/GLR-2 heteromers via its interaction with GLR-2.

Non-overlapping puncta were also classified, with three classes (GLR-1 alone, MAGI-1 alone, and colocalized) being totaled for each animal.

The animals were allowed to adjust to the plates for 6&#x02013;7 minutes, and the number of spontaneous reversals for a single animal was counted over a 4-minute period. Again, all strains compared in a particular assay were raised and stimulated (where appropriate) at 25&#x000b0;C in parallel. Each assay was performed at least 3 times on different animals of the same genotype. The first two trials of spontaneous reversal frequency were done on animals of known genotype; however, those results were confirmed in trials blind to genotype, and all subsequent trials were done blind.</p><p>Habituation assays were performed in two ways. First, habituation to body touch was assayed using an eyebrow hair to stroke the animal transverse to the body length. The animals were stroked alternately on their anterior, between the pharynx and vulva, and on their posterior (tail). We assayed habituation by measuring the failure of an animal to reverse direction in response to touch. We counted the number of touches to the anterior body required before there was a failed response. We also counted the number of anterior touches required before there were two consecutive failures; this number was consistent with the first. In order to prevent contact between animals during the assay, three animals were put on each plate and allowed to recover from the move for at least 45 minutes. Only animals that stayed on the bacterial lawn throughout the assay were recorded.</p><p>Our second assay for habituation measured reversal magnitude. Single animals were put on each plate and allowed to recover for 2 hours. Each plate was then dropped from a height of 9 mm. Reversal magnitude was estimated as the number of quarter body bends executed in the response. Each plate was dropped 10 times. These experiments, as those above, were done blind to genotype in order to eliminate any bias in scoring. Both sets of habituation assays were performed over three separate trials on different animals of the same genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Coimmunoprecipitations</title><p>For testing MAGI-1/GluR interactions, MAGI-1S and MAGI-1L cDNA sequences were subcloned into pCMV expression vectors (Stratagene), which include a FLAG tag sequence.

We could detect no interaction between MAGI-1 prey and GLR-2AAA bait. GLR-1 also has a PDZ binding motif at its C-terminus; therefore, we considered the possibility that MAGI-1L also interacts directly with GLR-1.

We also detected an interaction between MAGI-1L and the GLR-1 carboxy-terminus; however, this interaction was much weaker (data not shown). Interestingly, similar experiments with the MAGI-1 short isoform did not show an interaction with either GLR-1 or GLR-2 (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction might be specific to MAGI-1L.

We used GLR-1(4KR)::GFP to assay whether ubiquitination is required for the decrease in GLR-1 levels in stimulated <italic>magi-1</italic> mutants. We found that the loss of GLR-1::GFP puncta in previously stimulated <italic>magi-1(tm446)</italic> mutants requires ubiquitination of the GLR-1 subunit, as the number of puncta in <italic>magi-1(tm446)</italic> mutants expressing GLR-1(4KR)::GFP does not decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004613-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>).

GLR-1 and GLR-2 AMPARs are expressed in the command interneurons of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> reversal circuit, where they mediate spontaneous reversals in locomotion during foraging. We adapted a protocol to expose animals to periodic, spaced mechanical stimulation, and then examined the long-term effects of this prior sensory experience on AMPAR function and subcellular localization. We found that the reversal frequency of wild-type animals is apparently kept constant regardless of prior mechanosensory experience. The number of GLR-1 puncta drops slightly, while there is a significant increase in the number of GLR-2 puncta. We found that the long isoform of MAGI-1 (MAGI-1L) is required to maintain the reversal frequency and modulate the number of GLR-1 and GLR-2 puncta in animals exposed to prior stimulation. Blocking the ubiquitin-dependent removal of GLR-1 can supersede the requirement for MAGI-1L during GLR-1 localization. Moreover, we found that MAGI-1L can interact with the cytosolic tail sequences of GLR-2, and that GLR-2 is required for the effect of the <italic>magi-1(tm446)</italic> mutation on spontaneous reversals and GLR-1 localization.</p><p>Based on our results, we propose the existence of a regulatory mechanism that maintains the constant, basal efficacy of the spontaneous reversal circuit regardless of prior sensory experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004613-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). MAGI-1L is part of this regulatory mechanism, as mutations in this isoform result in a decrease in GLR-1 puncta and spontaneous reversal behavior for animals given prior stimulation. By contrast, naive, unstimulated animals do not require MAGI-1L function for reversal behavior or to maintain AMPAR puncta. MAGI-1L is only needed to modulate AMPAR localization and function in animals given prior stimulation. Thus, we can infer that prior stimulation must activate a mechanism that reduces AMPARs, and that MAGI-1L acts to counterbalance such a mechanism, thereby maintaining AMPAR localization in the face of variable mechanosensory experience.</p><fig id="pone-0004613-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004613.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>A model for the modulation of the reversal circuit by prior activity.</title><p>(A) Reversal circuit synapses for wild-type animals likely contain heteromeric AMPAR channels comprised of GLR-1 (red) and GLR-2 (blue) subunits. MAGI-1L is shown as a green circle. The interneurons receive input (red arrows) from gap junctions and chemical synapses (synaptic vesicles are red circles). (B) Exposure to repeated mechanostimulation results in increased ubiquitination activity in the interneurons (only the activity from gap junctions is shown for simplicity). The removal of GLR-1/GLR-2 heteromers by ubiquitination (yellow T-bar) is prevented by MAGI-1L (green T-bar), which associates with the channel via its interaction with GLR-2. GLR-1 homomers appear to be immune to the effects of prior stimulation and MAGI-1L activity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0004613.g008"/></fig><p>What is the mechanism that MAGI-1L is counterbalancing? GLR-1 is removed by direct ubiquitination and endocytosis, and this process can be blocked if the ubiquitination sites on GLR-1 are mutated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-Burbea1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. We found that by blocking GLR-1 ubiquitination, we could prevent the downregulation of GLR-1 puncta and the decrease in reversal behavior in stimulated <italic>magi-1L</italic> mutants, indicating that at least one of the mechanisms that MAGI-1L counterbalances is receptor ubiquitination. Interestingly, ubiquitination has been tied to multiple forms of synaptic plasticity, and increased neural activity results in a robust increase in ubiquitination in stimulated neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-Ehlers1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, proteins like MAGI-1L might protect certain factors like the AMPARs from degradation during periods of high neural activity.</p><p>Animals that are stimulated to reverse by nondirectional vibrations of their growth media (taps) presumably have increased levels of activity in the reversal circuit. We suggest that multiple, spaced bouts of such stimulation increase ubiquitination in the interneurons, and likely activate other signaling pathways as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004613-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). The GLR-1-containing AMPARs are protected from such increased ubiquitination by MAGI-1L, which can directly bind to the GLR-1/GLR-2 heteromeric AMPARs via its association with the GLR-2 PDZ tail. Whether MAGI-1L protects GLR-1/GLR-2 AMPARs by preventing AMPAR ubiquitination, recruiting a deubiquitination enzyme to remove ubiquitin from the receptors, or preventing ubiquitinated AMPARs from being destroyed remains to be determined. In the absence of MAGI-1L, naive <italic>magi-1</italic> mutants have the normal complement of AMPAR puncta and reversals. By contrast, stimulated mutants remove many of the AMPAR puncta by ubiquitin-dependent pathways, resulting in decreased spontaneous reversals.</p><p>Are GLR-1/GLR-2 heteromers and GLR-1 homomers regulated differently? Surprisingly, wild-type animals exposed to prior mechanosensory activity show little change in the number of GLR-1 puncta, while simultaneously showing a significant increase in the number of GLR-2 puncta; this increase requires MAGI-1L. This finding suggests that MAGI-1L adds additional GLR-2 subunits to the ventral cord in response to prior mechanosensory experience. Interestingly, whereas MAGI-1L maintains a relatively high number of GLR-1 puncta, mutations that remove <italic>glr-2</italic> abolish this maintenance of GLR-1 localization, suggesting that GLR-1 homomers, unlike GLR-1/GLR-2 heteromers, are not apparently regulated by MAGI-1L. Thus, the presence of a GLR-2 subunit within the AMPAR channel appears to confer MAGI-1L-dependent regulation. These results are supported by the observed strong interaction of MAGI-1L with the GLR-2 C-terminal sequences, compared to the quite weak interaction of MAGI-1L with the GLR-1 C-terminal sequences. It should be noted that we cannot exclude the possibility that MAGI-1L regulates other accessory factors that assist GLR-1 and GLR-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-Walker1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. One prediction of our model is that MAGI-1L should preferentially associate with GLR-2-containing puncta in the ventral cord. Unfortunately, the GLR-2::GFP reporter is dim, and it is therefore likely that we are not visualizing all of the GLR-2-containing puncta. This drawback currently precludes a complete quantitative assessment of GLR-2/MAGI-1L colocalization.</p><p>Interestingly, MAGI-1 is only co-expressed with GLR-1 in the backward command interneurons AVA and AVD. It is thought that there is a competition between the forward and backward command interneurons to direct movement, and that the forward interneurons usually predominate, driving locomotion forward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-Chalfie1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Presumably during a spontaneous reversal, the balance of activity in the circuit is briefly tipped towards the backward interneurons. This balance can be shifted in response to prior mechanostimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-Wicks1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. While MAGI-1 likely only maintains AMPARs populating connections in the AVA and AVD backward interneurons, we suggest that this maintenance would have a significant enough impact on the forward-backward balance of activity in the circuit to alter the spontaneous reversal rate. Previous work indicates that the rate of spontaneous reversals is regulated by food and olfactory cues, and this regulation is critical for successful foraging and chemoattraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-Zhao1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-Gray1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, proteins like MAGI-1L probably help foraging animals maintain their spontaneous reversal behavior even in the face of periods of prior stimulation, allowing them to consistently navigate over long distances.</p><p>In prior studies, Rose et al. noted a decrease in GLR-1 puncta size in stimulated wild-type animals in a region of the posterior ventral cord (posterior to the vulva but anterior to the preanal ganglia) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-Rose1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The posterior half of the animal contains only about 25&#x00025; of the GLR-1 puncta, many of which belong to the PVC forward command interneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-Rongo1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-Chen1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-White1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. We did not observe changes in GLR-1 puncta in stimulated wild-type animals; however, our studies focused on GLR-1 puncta in the anterior ventral cord, most of which are derived from backward command interneurons. It is likely that GLR-1 is regulated by neural activity in a different fashion in the forward versus the backward command interneurons, depending on the change in directional behavior required. We feel this is the likely explanation for the differences observed between our studies and those of Rose et al. Indeed, the restricted expression of MAGI-1 only to the backward command interneurons supports this view.</p><p>Whereas prior mechanostimulation does not affect spontaneous reversal frequency, prior stimulation can modulate the short-term habituation of the circuit to later stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-Rankin1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-Beck1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Naive animals become habituated during a single train of stimulations, as exhibited by a depression in reversal magnitude; this habituation can quickly recover. Multiple, spaced trains of prior stimulation, like our stimulation protocol, result in a long-lasting depression in reversal magnitude. Nevertheless, stimulated animals can still be further habituated; indeed, they habituate more rapidly than naive animals. We find that MAGI-1L, like GLR-1 and GLR-2, is also required for this form of long-term memory. Are the command interneurons the site of habituation for the circuit? While we cannot rule out that the command interneurons undergo habituation, there is evidence that the mechanosensory cells themselves can undergo habituation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-Wicks1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-Kindt1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. For GLR-1, GLR-2, and MAGI-1L to be required in the command interneurons to modulate habituation in the mechanosensory neurons, one must posit that there is either a retrograde signal that mediates the modulation or that the command interneurons regulate a separate set of neurons, which in turn act as modulators of the mechanosensory neurons. Future studies will focus on the downstream signaling pathways that mediate this modulation.</p><p>Future studies should also reveal the role of the short isoform of MAGI-1, as different isoforms of scaffolding molecules can have disparate, sometimes contrary, functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-MendozaTopaz1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004613-Schluter1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Regardless, our current study indicates two important roles for the long isoform. On one hand, MAGI-1L is regulating AMPAR localization in response to prior experience, thereby maintaining a consistent spontaneous reversal frequency. On the other hand, MAGI-1L is also modulating short-term habituation in response to prior experience, thereby allowing animals to rapidly adjust to stimuli that they have previously encountered. This combination of functions allows the circuit to remain flexible in its response to acute mechanostimulation, while simultaneously maintaining consistency during long-term foraging and navigation towards chemoattractants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004613.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>C. elegans MAGI-1 is similar to vertebrate MAGI-1.
