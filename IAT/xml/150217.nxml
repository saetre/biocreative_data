Although it is well known that the TAF N-terminal domain (TAND) at the amino-terminus of the TAF1 protein binds to TBP and thereby inhibits TBP function <italic>in vitro</italic>, the physiological role of this domain remains obscure. In our previous study, we screened for mutations that cause lethality when co-expressed with the <italic>TAF1</italic> gene lacking TAND (<italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic>) and identified two &#x00394;TA<underline>N</underline>D <underline>s</underline>ynthetic <underline>l</underline>ethal (<italic>nsl</italic>) mutations as those in the <italic>SPT15</italic> gene encoding TBP.

TFIID, composed of the evolutionarily conserved TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c6">6</xref>), is required for specific recognition of core promoter elements such as the TATA box, the initiator element and the downstream promoter element (DPE) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c8">8</xref>). TFIID nucleates the assembly of the preinitiation complex (PIC) around the transcription initiation site by recruiting other GTFs and RNA PolII, either sequentially or as part of a pre-assembled holoenzyme complex (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c10">10</xref>). The efficiency of PIC assembly is regulated by gene-specific activators that are usually bound to upstream activating sequences (UAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c11">11</xref>). One of the most crucial molecular roles of activators is postulated to be the binding of TFIID to the core promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c17">17</xref>). A number of biochemical studies using <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reconstitution systems demonstrated that suboptimal core promoter binding by TFIID might provide an energetic blockade for initiating transcription, and activators can overcome this rate-limiting step by inducing conformational changes in TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c19">19</xref>). In fact, basal transcriptional activity mediated by TFIID was significantly lower than that mediated by TBP, for example, on the adenovirus E1b and HIV core promoters, even when both factors added to the reaction were adjusted to include the same amount of TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c20">20</xref>). Importantly, gene-specific activators such as NF-&#x003ba;B can stimulate TFIID-mediated transcriptional activity to a much greater extent than TBP-mediated activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c20">20</xref>). Therefore, TAFs appear to have a dual function; that is, they inhibit TBP-mediated basal transcription in the absence of activators and stimulate transcription in response to the presence of activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c22">22</xref>). At least a part of the former function can be attributed to TAF1 since a binary complex comprised of human TAF1 (hsTAF1) and TBP showed lower basal activity than that of TBP alone, whereas transcription was restored to the level of TBP-mediated basal activity when activators were present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c22">22</xref>) &#x0005b;PolII TAFs are named according to the new nomenclature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c6">6</xref>)&#x0005d;.</p><p>Consistent with the observation described above, the amino-termini of hsTAF1 and its orthologues carry an inhibitory activity for TBP-TATA interactions which can be suppressed by the coordinated action of TFIIA and certain types of activators (e.g., c-Jun, Zta and VP16) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c30">30</xref>). The structural organization of this inhibitory domain, which was designated as TAF N-terminal domain (TAND), has been extensively characterized, especially for the yeast TAF1 (scTAF1) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> TAF1 (dmTAF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c31">31</xref>). In both species, TAND is composed of two functionally distinct subdomains, TAND1 and TAND2, which bind to the concave and convex surface of TBP, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c31">31</xref>). Interestingly, acidic activation domains (ADs) of some activators derived from yeast cells and mammalian viruses were demonstrated to be functionally exchangeable with scTAND1 <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic>, indicating that these two distinct classes of molecules might be similar in structure at least when bound to a common target, i.e., the concave surface of TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c29">29</xref>). These observations encouraged us to build a two-step hand-off model depicting an early stage of the activation process in which TAND1, bound to the concave surface of TBP, could first be displaced by AD, and AD could be successively displaced by the TATA element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c29">29</xref>). However, the precise molecular events involving TFIID during activation remain in dispute. For instance, another mechanism has been proposed for the action of AD in dissociating TAND-TBP interactions; c-Jun binds to hsTAND directly so as to cancel the TAND inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c30">30</xref>). This direct binding model sharply contrasts with our two-step hand-off model (indirect competitive model) in which AD and TAND1 bind to the overlapping surface of TBP, thereby allowing AD to compete out the inhibitory effect of TAND1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c29">29</xref>). More recent studies have demonstrated that the interaction between the convex surface of TBP and the high-mobility group (HMG) box-like region of hsTAF1 is also crucial for activation by several activators, including GAL4-E1A and GAL4-VP16 in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c32">32</xref>). Although one molecule of TBP per TFIID complex is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c33">33</xref>), multiple potential binding sites for TBP were identified on the scTAF1 protein (four molecules of TBP could be bound to one molecule of scTAF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c34">34</xref>). Interestingly, at both binding sites (TAND of scTAF1 and the HMG box-like region of hsTAF1) TFIIA appears to play a key role in dissociating TAF1-TBP interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c32">32</xref>). Considering that this same action of TFIIA was not shown to be involved in c-Jun-mediated hsTAND-TBP dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c30">30</xref>), the molecular mechanisms triggering the initial step of TFIID activation may differ depending on the sort of activator and&#x0002f;or promoter structure of target genes.</p><p>Although accumulating evidence suggests that TAND is involved in transcriptional activation, it is hard to obtain direct proof of such involvement <italic>in vivo</italic>, probably because there are multiple and redundant pathways to support transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c35">35</xref>). Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription systems reconstituted with factors derived from either yeast or mammalian cells revealed that TAFs are dispensable for transcriptional activation, for example, when mediator components are added to the reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c39">39</xref>). Genetic studies consistently show that at least a subset of TAFs can be deleted without affecting general activator function in yeast (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c40">40</xref>). Furthermore, mutations of TAFs included in both TFIID and Spt-Ada-Gcm5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) tend to affect transcription more broadly than those of TAFs specifically included in TFIID (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c35">35</xref>). These observations suggest that mediators and SAGA might be functionally redundant with TFIID in regulated transcription.</p><p>To obtain further evidence indicating that TAND is indeed involved in regulated transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>, we screened &#x00394;TA<underline>N</underline>D <underline>s</underline>ynthetic <underline>l</underline>ethal (<italic>nsl</italic>) mutations that cause lethality in combination with a <italic>taf1</italic> gene lacking TAND (<italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic>) in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c41">41</xref>). As reported previously, the <italic>NSL1</italic> gene we isolated in this screen was found to be allelic with the <italic>SPT15</italic> gene encoding TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c41">41</xref>). Intriguingly, our studies demonstrated that <italic>nsl1&#x0002f;spt15</italic> alleles encoding TBP mutants, which are activation-deficient and especially defective at the post-TBP recruitment step, showed stronger <italic>nsl</italic> phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c41">41</xref>). In the present study, we used the same screen to isolate a temperature-sensitive (TS) mutation of another gene designated as <italic>NSL2</italic>. Further analyses reveal that <italic>NSL2</italic> is allelic with the <italic>TAF12</italic> gene that encodes a common subunit of TFIID and SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c42">42</xref>). The <italic>nsl2&#x0002f;taf12</italic> allele we isolated has a missense mutation (<italic>L420S</italic>) in the histone fold domain (HFD). Several other previously characterized <italic>nsl2&#x0002f;taf12</italic> alleles harboring HFD mutations (<italic>W486stop</italic>, <italic>L446A</italic>, <italic>L464A</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c45">45</xref>) also show <italic>nsl</italic> phenotypes. All of these <italic>nsl2&#x0002f;taf12</italic> mutants are more or less deficient in transcriptional activation. Interestingly, further analyses suggest that <italic>nsl1&#x0002f;spt15</italic> and <italic>nsl2&#x0002f;taf12</italic> alleles cause lethality in the <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic> mutant, apparently by different molecular mechanisms.

A <italic>His3MX6</italic> marker module derived from <italic>Saccharomyces kluveri</italic> was amplified by PCR from the pFA6a-His3MX6 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr Mark Longtine) using the primer pair of TK1337 and TK1338 (oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Supplementary Material Table S1).

In this study, another <italic>nsl</italic> mutant, A22, was characterized as described below.</p><p>Genetic crosses and tetrad dissection showed that the A22 mutant carries a recessive mutation belonging to a different complementation group from <italic>nsl1&#x0002f;spt15</italic> mutants (data not shown). The gene responsible for the A22 <italic>nsl</italic> phenotype was designated as <italic>NSL2</italic>. We also refer to a mutant allele of A22 as <italic>nsl2-1</italic>. Since linkage analysis indicated that the <italic>nsl2-1</italic> allele exhibits a TS growth phenotype, we tried to isolate the wild-type <italic>NSL2</italic> gene by complementing the TS phenotype of the <italic>nsl2-1</italic> mutant. The <italic>nsl2-1</italic> mutant was transformed with a partial <italic>Sau3A</italic> yeast genomic library, and several complementing colonies were isolated.

We subcloned each gene into a centromeric vector and tested it in the complementation assay. Only the plasmid carrying the <italic>TAF12</italic> gene rescued the TS growth defects of the <italic>nsl2-1</italic> mutant, suggesting that <italic>NSL2</italic> might be allelic to <italic>TAF12</italic>.</p><p>To identify possible mutations in the <italic>TAF12</italic> gene of the <italic>nsl2-1</italic> mutant, we sequenced PCR-amplified genomic fragments encompassing the entire ORF plus 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-adjacent DNA regions (&#x0223c;500 bp each) of the <italic>TAF12</italic> gene. We found a single amino acid substitution, L420S, in the coding region of the <italic>TAF12</italic> gene of the <italic>nsl2-1</italic> mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f1">1</xref>A). We next asked whether this mutation was sufficient to reproduce the <italic>nsl</italic> phenotype and whether such a phenotype depended on a particular genetic background. To address these questions, we reconstructed the <italic>taf12-L420S</italic> allele on a centromeric <italic>TRP1</italic> plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis to exclude any other possible mutations. Then we constructed yeast strains containing either the wild-type <italic>TAF12</italic> gene (YAK985) or the <italic>taf12-L420S</italic> mutant allele (YAK986) on a centromeric <italic>TRP1</italic> plasmid as well as the wild-type <italic>TAF1</italic> gene on a centromeric <italic>URA3</italic> plasmid in combination with double deletions of chromosomal <italic>TAF12</italic> and <italic>TAF1</italic> genes. These strains have different general genetic backgrounds from the one used in the original genetic screen for the <italic>nsl</italic> mutants. The centromeric <italic>LEU2</italic> plasmid harboring either the wild-type <italic>TAF1</italic> gene or <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic> mutant allele was transformed into the YAK985 and YAK986 strains described above, and strains were tested for their growth on 5FOA plates. We reasoned that if <italic>taf12-L420S</italic> is responsible for the <italic>nsl</italic> phenotype, strains derived from YAK986 (i.e., those carrying the <italic>taf12-L420S</italic> gene on a <italic>TRP1</italic> plasmid) would be viable on 5FOA plates, which select for cells that have lost the <italic>URA3</italic>- and <italic>TAF1</italic>-containing plasmid, only when the <italic>LEU2</italic>- and <italic>TAF1</italic>-containing plasmid has been introduced into cells as a substitute. Consistent with this expectation, yeast strains carrying the <italic>taf12-L420S</italic> gene grew well on 5FOA plates only when they expressed the wild-type <italic>TAF1</italic> gene but not when they expressed the <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f1">1</xref>B).

We also confirmed that the <italic>taf12-L420S</italic> allele was recessive and showed a TS phenotype in the genetic background of the YAK986 strain just as in the original mutant strain A22 (data not shown).

Leucines at positions 446 and 464 on the &#x003b1;2 helix of TAF12 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f1">1</xref>A) (equivalent to methionine at position 59 and leucine at position 77 of <italic>X.laevis</italic> H2B) are assumed to be located on the interaction surface with TAF4 and TAF6, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c45">45</xref>). On the other hand, a truncated mutation, W486stop, which lacks the &#x003b1;C helix, was isolated as a <italic>taf12</italic> TS mutant by two groups independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c44">44</xref>).

These observations indicate that the HFD function of the TAF12 protein is required for both basal and activated transcription of at least a subset of genes. Considering that two activation-defective TBP mutants, <italic>P65S</italic> and <italic>S118L</italic>, were isolated in the same screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c41">41</xref>), we reasoned that the <italic>taf12-L420S</italic> mutant might also be deficient in its response to some activators. Thus, we examined activation efficiencies in the <italic>taf12-L420S</italic> mutant (YAK278) which had been backcrossed to an isogenic wild-type strain more than three times so as to avoid the effect of other unrelated mutations. The &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity from the Gal4 UAS-dependent reporter plasmid was measured when ADs of VP16 and TAND1 fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain were expressed in the cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f2">2</xref>A). As expected, activation efficiencies of both activator proteins were substantially lower in the <italic>taf12-L420S</italic> mutant than in the wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f2">2</xref>A).</p><p>To see the correlation between the degree of the <italic>nsl</italic> phenotype and that of activation defects, we compared activation efficiencies of several <italic>taf12</italic> HFD mutants described above, under the same conditions where VP16, TAND1, GCN4, GAL4, EBNA2 and TADIV (ADR1) ADs were used as activators (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f2">2</xref>B). Consistent with the results in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f2">2</xref>A, activation efficiencies of VP16 and TAND1 were significantly decreased in the <italic>L420S</italic> mutant. Additionally, activation efficiencies of GCN4 and GAL4 also decreased in this mutant, whereas those of EBNA2 and TADIV did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f2">2</xref>B). A similar differential response to activators was observed for the <italic>W486stop</italic> mutant, where the activation efficiencies of VP16, TAND1 and GCN4 were specifically reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f2">2</xref>B). In contrast, in the weaker <italic>nsl</italic> mutants like <italic>L446A</italic> and <italic>L464A</italic>, activation efficiencies of EBNA2 and&#x0002f;or TADIV were somewhat lower, whereas those of VP16, TAND1, GCN4 and GAL4 were almost normal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f2">2</xref>B). Importantly, no similar activation defect was observed for the 391&#x02013;539 amino acid mutant, which did not exhibit any <italic>nsl</italic> phenotypes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f1">1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f2">2</xref>B). This is consistent with previous experiments showing that transcription was affected only when the 391&#x02013;539 amino acid mutant was expressed at low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c60">60</xref>). Collectively, the degree of the <italic>nsl</italic> phenotype is apparently correlated with that of the activation defect and&#x0002f;or the type of ADs in the various <italic>taf12</italic> mutants we tested.</p></sec><sec><title>The post-recruitment step appears to be normal in <italic>nsl2&#x0002f;taf12</italic> mutants</title><p>Previous studies demonstrated that transcription could be activated in the absence of activators by artificial recruitment of TBP and&#x0002f;or TAFs physically connected to a heterologous DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c64">64</xref>).

Namely, if an activation-defective TBP&#x0002f;TAF can activate transcription when it is recruited to the template DNA, its defect is probably involved in the step(s) before its recruitment to the core promoter. Conversely, if the TBP&#x0002f;TAF mutant fails to activate transcription under the same conditions, it probably lacks the ability to function at a post-recruitment step. We previously found that a number of <italic>nsl</italic> mutants of TBP (e.g., P65S, S118L, K138T&#x0002f;Y139A, N159D, N159L, V161A, E236P and F237D) showed lower activities in this assay (&#x0003c;40&#x00025;), suggesting that the defects in the post-TBP (apparently post-TFIID) recruitment step might cause a stronger <italic>nsl</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c41">41</xref>).</p><p>To test whether <italic>nsl2&#x0002f;taf12</italic> mutants are also defective at a post-recruitment step, we transformed wild-type strains with the reporter plasmid harboring the GAL1 promoter-driven <italic>LacZ</italic> gene as well as the effector plasmid expressing each <italic>taf12</italic> mutant fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f2">2</xref>C). As already shown for other scTAFs (e.g., TAF5, TAF6, TAF9 and TAF10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c66">66</xref>), artificial recruitment of scTAF12 to the promoter activates transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f2">2</xref>C). This parallels the effect of LexA-hsTAF12 in mammalian cells, which activates transcription from chromosomally integrated promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c64">64</xref>). Unexpectedly, however, all <italic>taf12</italic> mutants we tested activated transcription at the same level or more efficiently than the wild type when recruited to the promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f2">2</xref>C), indicating that they were not impaired in a post-recruitment step. Therefore, <italic>nsl</italic> mutants of TBP and TAF12 probably cause lethality in the <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic> mutant by different mechanisms, despite the fact that both are affected in activated transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>The expression of TFIID- and SAGA-dependent genes are affected in the <italic>nsl2</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>taf12</italic> mutants</title><p>TFIID and SAGA have five subunits in common: TAF5, TAF6, TAF9, TAF10 and TAF12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c42">42</xref>). Genome-wide expression analysis using high-density oligonucleotide arrays demonstrated that the sum of the effects seen with mutations in each complex-specific subunit was substantially less than the sum of effects of the shared TAFs, suggesting redundant roles for TFIID and SAGA complexes in global transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c35">35</xref>).</p><p>Since TAF12 was one of the shared TAFs, we decided to examine whether <italic>nsl2&#x0002f;taf12</italic> mutations affect the function of either TFIID or SAGA or both. The expression of a subset of genes depends on either TFIID or SAGA function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c35">35</xref>). We examined transcriptional defects of those genes that require complex-specific function to assess which complex, TFIID or SAGA, is more severely damaged in the <italic>nsl2&#x0002f;taf12</italic> mutants. We used northern blotting to examine the expression levels of TFIID-dependent genes listed by Lee <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c35">35</xref>): <italic>GNA1, CAM1</italic>, <italic>PMT4</italic>, <italic>HTA3</italic>, <italic>TRX1</italic> and <italic>WTM2</italic> genes in the <italic>taf12-L420S</italic> and -<italic>W486stop</italic> TS mutants as well as in the 391&#x02013;539 amino acid mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>A, left panel). Consistent with the difference of restrictive temperatures of the <italic>W486stop</italic> and <italic>L420S</italic> mutants (36 and 37&#x000b0;C, respectively), the expression of these genes was most severely damaged in the <italic>W486stop</italic> mutant when cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>A). A significant reduction was observed for only the <italic>TRX1</italic> gene in the <italic>taf12-L420S</italic> mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>A). Unexpectedly, the expression of <italic>TRX1</italic> was slightly reduced even in the 391&#x02013;539 amino acid mutant. These observations suggest that TFIID function was more or less impaired in these three <italic>taf12</italic> mutants and that the extent of transcriptional defects appeared to correlate with that of the <italic>nsl</italic> phenotypes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>). Next, we examined the expression levels of SAGA-dependent genes, that is, <italic>PHO84</italic>, <italic>YPL019C</italic>, <italic>PHO5</italic>, <italic>YHB1</italic> and <italic>YDL124W</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c35">35</xref>), in these three <italic>taf12</italic> mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>A, right panel). The expression of <italic>PHO84</italic> and <italic>YPL019C</italic> was significantly reduced at 37&#x000b0;C in the <italic>taf12-W486stop</italic> mutant, whereas other genes were expressed at near normal levels. In contrast, the expression of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>YHB1</italic> increased in the <italic>taf12-L420S</italic> and 391&#x02013;539 amino acid mutants, while the expression of other genes was only slightly affected. These results suggest that SAGA function is also affected in a mutation-specific manner in these three <italic>taf12</italic> mutants. The transcriptional defects of the W486stop mutant were rather different from those of the other two mutants, implying that the impaired function of the SAGA complex might be less closely related to the <italic>nsl</italic> phenotype than that of TFIID.</p></sec><sec><title>A comparison of expression of TAND-dependent genes in the <italic>nsl2</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>taf12</italic> and <italic>nsl1</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>spt15</italic> mutants</title><p>Expression analyses of TFIID- and SAGA-dependent genes described above imply that TFIID, which appears to be more substantially damaged than SAGA in the activation-defective <italic>nsl2&#x0002f;taf12</italic> mutants, might be predominantly responsible for the <italic>nsl</italic> phenotypes. This supports our previous results demonstrating that activation-defective <italic>nsl1&#x0002f;spt15</italic> (i.e., TBP) mutants also display strong <italic>nsl</italic> phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c41">41</xref>). However, an artificial recruitment assay implies that molecular mechanisms yielding <italic>nsl</italic> phenotypes are different in these two mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f2">2</xref>C). To further pursue this point, we decided to examine the expression level of TAND-dependent genes (<italic>YJR078W</italic>, <italic>HIS4</italic>, <italic>YDR539W</italic> and <italic>CTT1</italic>), which were selected by our DNA chip experiments (K.Ohtsuki, Y.Tsukihashi, K.Shirahige and T.Kokubo, unpublished observations). Each of these four genes was expressed differently in the <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic> mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>B). For instance, expression of the <italic>YJR078W</italic> gene was induced at 37&#x000b0;C in the wild-type strain but not in the <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic> mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>B, left panel). In contrast, the expression of the <italic>CTT1</italic> gene was induced at 37&#x000b0;C specifically in the <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic> mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>B, left panel). The expression of <italic>HIS4</italic> and <italic>YDR539W</italic> genes was reduced at 37&#x000b0;C specifically in the <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic> mutant; however, expression of the latter gene (<italic>YDR539W</italic>) was reduced even at 25&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>B, left panel). Intriguingly, careful inspection of other data obtained for the <italic>taf12</italic> and <italic>spt15</italic> (TBP) mutants revealed that only the <italic>taf12-L420S</italic> and -<italic>W486stop</italic> mutants recapitulated transcriptional defects of the <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic> mutant. Since the expression of the SAGA-dependent <italic>YDL124W</italic> gene remained unchanged in all lanes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>B, the lowest column), we believe that the changes in other genes are not due to differences in the amount of RNA loading. In the <italic>spt15-P65S</italic> and -<italic>S118L</italic> mutants, distinct expression profiles were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>B, right panel). For instance, the expression of the <italic>CTT1</italic> gene was reduced in both <italic>spt15</italic> mutants, whereas it was induced in the <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic> and <italic>taf12</italic> mutants. It is notable that the enhanced expression of the <italic>HIS4</italic> gene as well as the slightly reduced expression of the <italic>YJR078W</italic> and <italic>YDR539W</italic> genes was specific to the P65S mutant but not the S118L mutant. Only the latter finding is also observed in the <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic> and <italic>taf12</italic> mutants. Taken together, transcription of TAND-dependent genes appears to be similarly impaired in the <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic> and the <italic>taf12</italic> mutants but not in the <italic>spt15</italic> mutants. Moreover, the extent of transcriptional defects of these genes was closely related to that of <italic>nsl</italic> phenotypes in the <italic>taf12</italic> mutants but not in the <italic>spt15</italic> mutants. These observations further support the idea that <italic>nsl</italic> phenotypes of <italic>taf12</italic> and <italic>spt15</italic> mutants are generated by different molecular mechanisms. We speculate that impairment of overlapping and distinct functions of TFIID may cause synthetic lethality in the <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND&#x0002f;taf12</italic> and <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND&#x0002f;spt15</italic> mutants, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Physical interaction of TAF12 HFD mutants with ADA1 and TAF4</title><p>We showed that the integrity of the HFD of TAF12 is important for cell growth of the <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic> mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f1">1</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that direct interacting partners of this domain are different in SAGA and TFIID com plexes, i.e., ADA1 and TAF4, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c53">53</xref>). Gene expression analyses suggest that the damage to TFIID is more closely related to the <italic>nsl</italic> phenotypes of the <italic>taf12</italic> mutants than that of SAGA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>). Hence, the interaction between TAF12 and TAF4 might be more substantially weakened than that between TAF12 and ADA1 in these <italic>taf12</italic> mutants.</p><p>To test for this possibility, we used bacterial cells to co-express HFD portions in the following combinations: TAF12 (amino acids 391&#x02013;539) and TAF4 (amino acids 1&#x02013;388) or TAF12 (amino acids 414&#x02013;490) and ADA1 (amino acids 259&#x02013;359). As previously described, unless HFD of TAF4 or ADA1 was co-expressed together with the HFD of TAF12, complexes were not efficiently recovered in the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c53">53</xref>). Binary complexes of TAF12 (amino acids 391&#x02013;539)-TAF4 (amino acids 1&#x02013;388) and TAF12 (amino acids 414&#x02013;490)-ADA1 (amino acids 259&#x02013;359) could be recovered by glutathione Sepharose resin via a GST molecule fused to TAF12 derivatives. Trapped complexes were eluted and visualized with CBB staining after fractionation by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f4">4</xref>). Note that GST-TAF12 (amino acids 414&#x02013;490) could form a stable complex with ADA1 (amino acids 259&#x02013;359) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f4">4</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c53">53</xref>) but not with TAF4 (amino acids 1&#x02013;388) (data not shown), suggesting that the &#x003b1;C helix of TAF12 may be crucial only for forming a complex with TAF4.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f4">4</xref>A, TAF12 (amino acids 391&#x02013;539) could form a stable complex with TAF4 (amino acids 1&#x02013;388) (lane 1). The band apparently corresponding to TAF4 (amino acids 1&#x02013;388) was not visible when it was not added to the reaction (lane 8) or when the GST molecule alone was used for the pulldown assay (lane 6). The two TAF12 mutant proteins, L420S (lane 2) and L446A (lane 4), were significantly impaired in their ability to form a complex with TAF4 (amino acids 1&#x02013;388). Additionally, the W486stop mutant could not form any detectable complex with TAF4 (amino acids 1&#x02013;388) under the same conditions (lane 3). This is not consistent with a previous study demonstrating that <italic>in vitro</italic> translated TAF4 (amino acids 1&#x02013;388) could interact with both GST-TAF12 (amino acids 330&#x02013;539) and GST-TAF12 (amino acids 330&#x02013;485) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c44">44</xref>). Although the reason for this discrepancy is uncertain, differences in experimental procedures for protein preparation (e.g., an <italic>in vitro</italic> translation system versus a bacterial co-expression system) might be responsible. In any case, the inability of the W486stop mutant to form any detectable complex with TAF4 in our assays again underscores the importance of the &#x003b1;C helix of the TAF12 protein in the formation of a binary complex with TAF4. In contrast to these three TAF12 mutants, the L464A mutant appeared to be normal in this assay (lane 5). These results are consistent with previous work demonstrating that the L446A and L464A mutants disrupt the TAF12-TAF4 and TAF12-TAF6 interfaces of the TAF octamer, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c45">45</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the interaction between TAF12 (amino acids 414&#x02013;490) and ADA1 (amino acids 259&#x02013;359) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f4">4</xref>B). Somewhat unexpectedly, all of the <italic>taf12</italic> mutants were strongly impaired in their ability to form a complex with ADA1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f4">4</xref>B). A weakly stained band apparently corresponding to ADA1 (amino acids 259&#x02013;359) was visible for only the L464A mutant (lane 5) but not for the others (lanes 2&#x02013;4). Thus, the integrity of the HFD of TAF12, except for the &#x003b1;C helix, seems to be more critical for the association with ADA1 than TAF4. Furthermore, these observations imply that the HFDs of TAF4 and ADA1 interact with the HFD of TAF12 in different ways. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether <italic>nsl</italic> phenotypes of the <italic>taf12</italic> mutants could be ascribed to these weakened interactions between TAF12 and ADA1 and&#x0002f;or TAF12 and TAF4.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we screened <italic>nsl</italic> genes that have a genetic interaction with TAND of TAF1. The <italic>NSL2</italic> gene isolated in our screen was found to be allelic to the <italic>TAF12</italic> gene encoding one of the five shared subunits between TFIID and SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c42">42</xref>). In contrast to the <italic>NSL1&#x0002f;SPT15</italic> gene encoding TBP that was previously isolated in the same screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c41">41</xref>), only a very limited number of <italic>taf12</italic> mutants have been characterized <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c60">60</xref>). Conditional (TS) <italic>taf12</italic> alleles characterized by two groups contain nonsense or frameshift mutations around W486, which generate C-terminal truncated proteins of &#x0223c;50 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c44">44</xref>). A non-conditional <italic>taf12</italic> allele characterized by another group carries a transposon insertion between amino acids 278 and 279, which generates an amino-terminal truncated 17 kDa polypeptide apparently corresponding to the 391&#x02013;539 amino acid fragment initiated at the first in frame ATG codon downstream of the inserted transposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c60">60</xref>). Phenotypes of the latter allele &#x0005b;e.g., slow growth and 3-aminotriazole (3-AT)-sensitivity on synthetic media&#x0005d; result from reduced expression of the C-terminal region of amino acids 391&#x02013;539 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c60">60</xref>). This region encoding HFD, comprises four &#x003b1;-helices (&#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;3 and &#x003b1;C) and is essential and sufficient for wild-type yeast cell growth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c67">67</xref>). The previously characterized conditional alleles, such as <italic>taf12-W486stop</italic>, encode proteins truncated for the &#x003b1;C helix, thereby affecting the stability of TFIID and transcription of a set of genes at restrictive temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c44">44</xref>). The <italic>nsl2-1&#x0002f;taf12-L420S</italic> allele we isolated here also carries a mutation in HFD, indicating that the integrity of HFD is crucial for growth when TAND is removed from TFIID. Consistent with this idea, <italic>taf12-W486stop</italic>, -<italic>L446A</italic> and -<italic>L464A</italic>, all of which harbor mutations within HFD, exhibit <italic>nsl</italic> phenotypes in our assay; however, the phenotypes of the <italic>L446A</italic> and <italic>L464A</italic> mutants were weaker than those of <italic>W486stop</italic> and <italic>L420S</italic> mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f1">1</xref>; data not shown). HFD of TAF12 was shown to be important in forming a nucleosome-like structure with TAF4, TAF6 and TAF9 in TFIID, and it can form a similar structure with ADA1, TAF6 and TAF9 in SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c45">45</xref>). Indeed, mutant proteins encoded by severe <italic>nsl</italic> alleles such as <italic>taf12-W486stop</italic> and -<italic>L420S</italic> exhibit reduced binding to both of their direct partners, i.e., TAF4 and ADA1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f4">4</xref>). However, the integrity of TFIID and SAGA complexes containing these mutant proteins appears to be unaffected, at least at lower temperatures (25&#x000b0;C), even when TAND is absent (A.Kobayashi and T.Kokubo, unpublished observations). This excludes the possibility that a weakened nucleosome-like structure in TFIID and SAGA could be stabilized by TAND.</p><p>It is important to understand whether mutations in shared TAFs result in transcriptional defects in the TFIID complex, the SAGA complex, or both. The <italic>taf12-W486stop</italic> allele was shown to yield a partially disrupted SAGA complex that lacks TAF12 and contains lower amounts of TAF5 and SPT3 when the mutant was cultured at 37&#x000b0;C for a few hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c42">42</xref>). In the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, this defective SAGA complex could not acetylate nucleosome histones nor could it stimulate transcription from chromatin templates in an acetyl-CoA-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c42">42</xref>). On the other hand, immunoblot analysis of lysates prepared from this mutant at different time periods after the temperature shift to 37&#x000b0;C showed that unique TAFs are more quickly degraded than TAFs shared between TFIID and SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c44">44</xref>). This suggests that the <italic>taf12-W486stop</italic> mutation probably destabilizes TFIID more substantially than SAGA at higher temperatures. Four sets of 10 genes were recently listed as representative of TFIID-dependent, SAGA-dependent, TFIID- and SAGA-dependent, and either TFIID- or SAGA-dependent genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c35">35</xref>). The expression of these genes was examined to assess TFIID and SAGA specificities for various <italic>taf10</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c69">69</xref>). We employed the same approach to determine which function of TFIID and&#x0002f;or SAGA was impaired in <italic>taf12</italic> mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>). The results showed that the <italic>W486stop</italic> mutation affects the function of these two complexes, whereas it appears to impair TFIID more extensively than SAGA. This confirms previous results of immunoblot analyses as described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c44">44</xref>). On the other hand, the effect of the <italic>L420S</italic> mutation on transcription of these representative genes was not evident (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>). Intriguingly, the effects of the <italic>W486stop</italic> and <italic>L420S</italic> mutations on SAGA function appeared to be different since only the former decreased the expression of <italic>PHO84</italic> and <italic>YPL019C</italic> genes and only the latter increased the expression of <italic>PHO5</italic> and <italic>YHB1</italic> genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>). Although the reason for this differential effect on SAGA function remains unknown, the interaction between TAF12 and TBP might be related to this effect since only the W486stop mutant protein was severely defective in TBP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c44">44</xref>) (A.Kobayashi and T.Kokubo, unpublished observations).</p><p>Previously, we conducted an artificial recruitment assay to determine which step, i.e., pre- or post-TBP recruitment step, is more severely damaged by <italic>nsl1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c41">41</xref>). The results showed that <italic>nsl</italic> phenotypes were closely correlated to the defects in a post-TBP recruitment step. This is consistent with our two-step hand-off model in which TAND may be involved in the initial step of activation, i.e., stable binding of TFIID to the promoter (pre-TBP recruitment step) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c41">41</xref>). The combined defects of the pre- and post-TBP recruitment steps can be expected to yield the lowest activation and thereby inhibit cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c41">41</xref>). In contrast, a similar approach, in which TAF12 instead of TBP was recruited to the promoter by a GAL4 DNA binding domain, revealed that the post-TAF12 recruitment step was not impaired for any of the <italic>nsl2</italic> mutations we tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f2">2</xref>). Thus, we speculate that the pre-TAF12 recruitment step must be impaired in the <italic>nsl2</italic> mutants. It is known that TFIID as well as SAGA can be recruited to the promoter by activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c70">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c72">72</xref>). In fact, GCN5, a HAT component of SAGA, can activate transcription when it is artificially recruited to the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c73">73</xref>). At present, it is not yet clear whether both the pre-TFIID and SAGA recruitment steps are affected by <italic>nsl2</italic> mutations. Nevertheless, the fact that a post-TFIID (and SAGA) recruitment step was intact in the <italic>nsl2</italic> mutants is in stark contrast to the results obtained for the <italic>nsl1</italic> mutants. Consistently, the expression of TAND-dependent genes was changed similarly in the <italic>nsl2</italic> mutants and in the <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic> mutant but not in the <italic>nsl1</italic> mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg180f3">3</xref>). Taken together, these observations indicate that <italic>nsl1</italic> and <italic>nsl2</italic> mutations affect distinct steps of activation, and only the step(s) targeted by the latter should overlap with those that require TAND function. We conclude that TAND may be involved in, but is not essential for, the pre-TFIID recruitment step; however, the combined defects of &#x00394;<italic>TAND</italic> and <italic>nsl2</italic> mutations debilitate transcriptional activation, thereby preventing yeast cell growth.</p><p>Recently, non-classical activators connecting components of the mediator complex with the Zif DNA binding domain were demonstrated to work much better on <italic>CYC1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> promoters in the <italic>taf1</italic>-&#x00394;<italic>TAND1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c74">74</xref>). At present, this effect is hard to explain since both promoters are believed to be TAF-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c75">75</xref>). In fact, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that TBP and several mediator components, but not TAF1, are recruited to the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter during activation by GAL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c76">76</xref>). However, to achieve any stimulatory effect on transcription, TAND1-deleted TFIID must be recruited on the promoter together with non-classical activators. Thus, one possibility is that non-classical activators (i.e., artificially recruited mediator complexes) could stimulate TFIID binding to the promoter, especially when TAND1 is removed. Consistently, such cooperative recruitment between TFIID and the mediator was observed for human factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c77">77</xref>). If this is the case, TAND1 might negatively regulate such a cooperative interaction, thereby minimizing the function of non-classical activators in normal cells. Alternatively, TAND1-deleted TFIID might increase the amount of free TBP and thereby help non-classical activators to overcome a critical rate-limiting step in transcription, e.g., TBP binding to the TATA element. The latter possibility is supported by recent observations demonstrating that TBP quite dynamically associates with the 14-subunit holo-TAF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg180c33">33</xref>). The TAND1 deletion may move this equilibrium dramatically to favor the TBP-free state. In either case, it is of significance that the presence or absence of TAND1 in TFIID could effectively change the function of non-classical activators. Isolation of other <italic>NSL</italic> genes and their characterization may provide additional insight with regards to the function of TAND during transcriptional activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_31_4_1261__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_31_4_1261__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg180f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Positions of <italic>nsl2&#x0002f;taf12</italic> mutations and their <italic>nsl</italic> phenotypes.
