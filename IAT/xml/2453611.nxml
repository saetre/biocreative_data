Although many factors contribute to depressed cardiac function in diabetes, innate disturbances within the diabetic heart contribute importantly to progressive dysfunction, which often leads to irreversible failure and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). Alterations in substrate metabolism and increased levels of oxygen free radicals have been observed in diabetic tissues. Inflammatory cytokines may exert direct negative inotropic effects on cardiac myocytes and contribute to aberrant remodeling in the failed heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). The pathophysiology of diabetes-associated cardiac complications is complex and involves a host of factors linked to metabolic and immune/inflammatory cell activation.</p><p>The accumulation of late-stage glycoxidation adducts of proteins, termed advanced glycation end products (AGEs), occurs in diabetic tissues. AGEs modify long-lived molecules in the blood vessel wall and structural tissues of the heart considerably earlier than symptomatic cardiac dysfunction occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>). A major way in which AGEs exert their cellular effects is by ligation of the multiligand receptor for AGE (RAGE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>).</p><p>We tested the role of RAGE in rodent models of type 1 diabetes, and we show that pharmacological blockade of ligand-RAGE interaction or genetic modulation of RAGE suppresses ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in the isolated perfused heart, at least in part secondary to critical contributions evoked from RAGE-expressing endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes in the diabetic heart.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>All animal studies were performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Columbia University and conform with the <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> published by the National Institutes of Health. Male diabetic Bio Bred (BB/W) rats, a model of type 1 diabetes (Biomedical Models, Worcester, MA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>), were used. Rats became diabetic between 69 and 80 days of age and were entered into study at diagnosis of hyperglycemia. Age-matched nondiabetic BB/W rats were controls. Diabetic rats were maintained on human insulin (3&#x02013;5 units/dose) (Humulin; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) twice daily. Insulin was discontinued 12 h before isolated heart perfusion studies. Rats were killed after 2 weeks of established diabetes. Murine soluble RAGE (sRAGE; 500 &#x003bc;g/day) or equal volumes of its diluent, PBS, were administered by intraperitoneal route beginning immediately at the diagnosis of hyperglycemia (serum glucose &#x02265;250 mg/dl) and continued for 14 days. sRAGE was prepared in a baculovirus expression system, and the material was purified and devoid of contaminating lipopolysaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>).</p><p>Male BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were rendered diabetic by 55 mg/kg i.p. streptozotocin (STZ) per day in fresh citrate buffer (0.05 mol/l; pH 4.5) for 5 consecutive days. Mice displaying serum glucose &#x02265;250 mg/dl were considered diabetic.

Male RAGE-KO and littermate mice were used. In other studies, two sets of transgenic mice were prepared to express signal transduction&#x02013;deficient RAGE, or dominant-negative (DN) RAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>) in endothelial cells (driven by the preproendothelin-1 &#x0005b;PPET&#x0005d; promoter; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>) or cells of mononuclear phagocyte lineage (driven by the macrophage scavenger receptor type A &#x0005b;MSR&#x0005d; promoter; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>).

After probing with the primary antibodies, membranes were stripped of bound immunoglobulins and reprobed with anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;-actin IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). All antibodies were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis of band density was performed using Image Quant/Molecular Dynamics software (Foster City, CA). Results are reported as relative units based on the ratio of test antibody densitometry units/&#x003b2;-actin densitometry units.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry.</title><p>Hearts were retrieved, and sections were prepared for immunohistochemistry. The following antibodies were used: anti-RAGE IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>), anti-AGE IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>), anti-S100/calgranulin IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>), and anti-nitrotyrosine IgG (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY). To localize cell-specific expression of RAGE, additional antibodies were used: anti-Mac 3 IgG (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and anti-CD31 IgG (Pharmingen). Immunostaining with nonimmune IgGs of the relevant species were negative.</p></sec><sec><title>Levels of total nitrite and nitrate and cGMP.</title><p>Hearts were retrieved and rapidly snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen after I/R. Lysates were prepared and levels of total nitrite and nitrate and cGMP were measured using a kit from Oxis Research Products (Portland, OR).</p></sec><sec><title>Isolated perfused heart and measurement of cardiac function.</title><p>Experiments were performed using an isovolumic isolated heart preparation and modified, as indicated, for mice hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>). Mice and rats were anesthetized using a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (80 and 10 mg/kg, respectively). After deep anesthesia was achieved, hearts were rapidly excised, placed in iced saline, and retrogradely perfused at 37&#x000b0;C in a nonrecirculating mode through the aorta. In mice, the perfusion rate was 2.5 ml/min, and in rats, the perfusion rate was 12.5 ml/min. Rat and mice hearts were perfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 118 mmol/l NaCl, 4.7 mmol/l KCl, 2.5 mmol/l CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mmol/l MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mmol/l NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 5 mmol/l glucose, 0.4 mmol/l palmitate, 0.4 mmol/l BSA, and 70 mU/l insulin. The perfusate was equilibrated with a mixture of 95&#x00025; O<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>, which maintained perfusate PO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;600 mmHg. Left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and left ventricular end diastolic pressure were measured using a latex balloon in the left ventricle. LVDP, heart rate, and coronary perfusion pressure were monitored continuously on a four-channel Powerlab (AD Instruments, Grand Junction, CO).</p><p>The ischemia/perfusion protocol was as follows: Hemodynamic function was monitored throughout the protocol. Mice hearts were paced at 420 beats/min with the use of pacing electrodes placed on the right atrium. Rat hearts were paced at 300 beats/min. Hearts were subjected to 30 min of global (zero-flow) ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion. Perfusate temperature was maintained at 37&#x000b0;C at all times during the protocol (i.e., during baseline, ischemia, and reperfusion). After an equilibration period of 30 min, both groups of hearts were perfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer throughout ischemia and reperfusion.</p><p>LDH release, a marker of I/R injury, was measured in the effluents for the entire 60 min of reperfusion in each heart. The levels of LDH were assayed using commercially available kits from Sigma-Aldrich. LDH release is expressed as international unit per gram dry weight of tissue. Caspase-3 activity was assayed in hearts using reagents provided in the caspase-3 activity kit from R&#x00026;D Systems. Briefly, caspase-3 activity is based on cleavage of the synthetic caspase substrate linked to the color reporter molecule <italic>p</italic>-nitroaniline. The amount of hydrolyzed substrate was measured as absorbance at 405 nm. Recombinant human caspase-3 was used as a positive control and to generate a standard curve. The results are expressed as caspase activity relative to that of wild-type control animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of ATP.</title><p>ATP was measured in the neutralized perchloric acid extracts of hearts according to previously published procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of AGEs in heart tissue.</title><p>Heart tissue (25&#x02013;100 mg wet wt) was extracted with 10 ml 2:1 chloroform-methanol for 24 h, washed with 10 ml methanol, and rehydrated in water. Samples were homogenized for 60 s with a Brinkmann Polytron in 2 ml Chelex-treated PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1 mmol/l diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) using one tablet per 10 ml buffer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1,600 rpm for 20 min using a Sorvall RT 6000D centrifuge. Pellets were washed three times with water while supernatants were exhaustively dialyzed versus water. All samples were freeze-dried and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further processing. Three milligrams of lyophilized tissue was weighed and placed into Eppendorf tubes on ice. Samples were solubilized with 100 &#x003bc;l PBS and 900 &#x003bc;l 1&#x00025; HCl/Acetone kept at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C to remove heme, vortexed, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C. This procedure was repeated twice. Pellets were then washed with ice-cold 1 mmol/l DTPA, freeze-dried, and acid hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl for 19 h. AGE analysis (carboxymethyl-lysine &#x0005b;CML&#x0005d;, carboxyethyl-lysine &#x0005b;CEL&#x0005d;, fructose-lysine &#x0005b;furosine&#x0005d;, and 2-aminoadipic acid) was by gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>).

First, we examined epitopes for CML AGEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>). CML AGEs are specific AGE ligands of RAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). In nondiabetic hearts, CML epitopes were not detected (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). In contrast, heart tissue retrieved from hyperglycemic rats displayed immunoreactive epitopes for CML AGE (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). In addition to AGEs, although expression of RAGE ligand S100/calgranulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>) was not demonstrated in the hearts of nondiabetic BB/W rats (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>), S100/calgranulin epitopes were evident in diabetic BB/W rat heart (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>), in both vascular cells and cardiomyocytes.</p><p>Diabetic BB/W hearts displayed increased RAGE antigen compared with nondiabetic hearts by immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>F</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>, respectively) and Western blotting (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>M</italic></xref>). We examined the hearts to detect nitrotyrosine epitopes, markers of oxidative injury. Compared with nondiabetic hearts in which virtually no nitrotyrosine epitopes were evident, immunohistochemistry demonstrated extensive nitrotyrosine epitopes in the hearts of diabetic BB/W rats (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>G</italic> and <italic>H</italic></xref>, respectively).</p><p>To specifically localize the cells expressing RAGE in the diabetic heart, additional studies were performed. Immunohistochemistry using anti-RAGE IgG and anti-CD31 IgG showed that RAGE was expressed in endothelial cells in the diabetic heart (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>I</italic> and <italic>J</italic></xref>, respectively). Immunohistochemistry using anti-RAGE IgG and anti&#x02013;Mac-3 IgG demonstrated that RAGE was expressed in mononuclear phagocytes in the diabetic heart (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>K</italic> and <italic>L</italic></xref>, respectively). Together, these studies indicated that RAGE expression was increased in the type 1 diabetic heart, particularly in endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes.</p><p>To test the impact of diabetes on expression of RAGE and the effects of RAGE blockade, we first administered sRAGE, the extracellular ligand-binding domain of RAGE. sRAGE was administered to diabetic rats commencing at the diagnosis of hyperglycemia once daily for 14 days. In diabetic rats treated with sRAGE, significantly lower levels of RAGE antigen in the heart were observed compared with vehicle-treated diabetic rats (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>M</italic></xref>). This observation is consistent with the concept that ligand-RAGE interaction sustains enhanced expression of RAGE; once interrupted, cellular expression of RAGE was significantly lower than that observed in the hearts of vehicle-treated diabetic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Diabetes increases expression of iNOS in the rat heart: impact of RAGE.</title><p>To explore the potential impact of the ligand-RAGE axis in modulating perturbation and oxidant stress in the heart, we assessed levels of iNOS in the heart in the basal state.

Two indexes of cardiac recovery were assessed: LVDP and release of LDH on reperfusion, the latter an index of myocardial injury. Diabetic rats displayed a marked decrease in LVDP recovery on reperfusion compared with nondiabetic rats subjected to the same degree of I/R (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>).

We rendered wild-type BALB/c mice diabetic with STZ and examined the impact of hyperglycemia on expression of RAGE and its ligands in the heart. After 14 days of diabetes, we examined levels of specific AGE species, CML, CEL, furosine (glycated lysine), and pentosidine in BALB/c mouse hearts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). As expected, we found that levels of CML, furosine, and pentosidine were significantly higher in the diabetic BALB/c mice hearts compared with their nondiabetic controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). In diabetic mice, treatment with sRAGE prevented the increases in CML and pentosidine levels, but there was no effect on furosine levels, suggesting an effect independent of tissue glucose levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Levels of argpyramidine, CEL, and 2-aminoadipic acid, a marker of metal catalyzed oxidation, were similar in all of the groups studied (data not shown). Consistent with increased AGE ligand levels in the diabetic heart, a significant increase in RAGE antigen by Western blotting was observed in diabetic compared with nondiabetic hearts (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>).

In diabetic Tg DN PPET RAGE, and Tg DN MSR RAGE mice hearts, concentrations of CML, furosine, and pentosidine were similar to those in diabetic wild-type hearts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>).

Pentosidine was significantly attenuated in diabetic RAGE-KO and Tg DN MSR RAGE versus diabetic wild-type or Tg DN PPET RAGE hearts after I/R. I/R increased CML by 20&#x00025; in wild-type diabetic hearts but not in RAGE-KO D and Tg DN MSR D. These data indicate that CML, pentosidine, and furosine are significantly reduced in diabetic RAGE-KO hearts under all perfusion conditions, whereas in Tg DN PPET RAGE and Tg DN MSR RAGE hearts, only CML levels are attenuated under all perfusion conditions. Thus, these data indicate that suppressive effect of DN RAGE on pentosidine is cell specific, i.e., expression of DN RAGE reduced pentosidine in Tg DN MSR but not in Tg DN PPET mice hearts. Furthermore, data indicate that most of CML effects appear to be associated with the endothelial cells, whereas pentosidine effects are pronounced in the mononuclear phagocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of RAGE deletion on apoptosis in diabetic mice hearts after I/R.</title><p>To determine whether the RAGE-ligand interaction mediates cell death in the diabetic heart consequent to I/R, we performed analyses to probe apoptotic signals, such as cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation.

The generation of a potent longer-lived oxidant peroxynitrite, due to interaction of NO and superoxide, has deleterious consequences, such as inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport, oxidation of sulfhydryl groups in proteins, initiation of lipid peroxidation, nitration of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>), and uncoupling of endothelial NO synthase by peroxynitrite leading to amplification of oxidant stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>). Peroxynitrite induces formation of CML-modified adducts by cleavage of Amadori products and the generation of glucosone and glyoxal from glucose, thus providing a &#x0201c;refueling mechanism&#x0201d; by which diabetes-mediated generation of CML leads to oxidant stress and, in part, regeneration of CML epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>).</p><p>It is likely that inhibition of the synthesis of NO by iNOS plays an important role. Our results are consistent with previous studies of acute ischemia and reperfusion in which administration of semi-selective inhibitors of iNOS or iNOS-null mice enhanced cardiac performance and/or reduced myocardial infarct size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>). Previous studies showed that iNOS played critical roles in diabetes and I/R in the heart, because iNOS-null mice displayed protection from the adverse effect of this injury, especially in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>). Our findings definitively link RAGE and RAGE signaling in endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocyte to generation of NO and pathogenic oxidant stress species in the diabetic heart. The impact of DN RAGE in both endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocyte is likely explained, in part, by the fundamental interplay and cross-talk between the molecular and biochemical consequences of endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocyte activation.</p></sec><sec><title>RAGE and myocardial energy metabolism.</title><p>Our studies indicate that RAGE influenced myocardial energy metabolism. At the end of global ischemia, levels of cardiac ATP were reduced significantly in all hearts; however, higher levels of ATP were observed in diabetic RAGE signaling mutant Tg mice or RAGE-KO mice compared with diabetic littermates. In global ischemia, ATP production results primarily from anaerobic glycolysis. Nitrosylation of GAPDH is a potential mechanism by which NO is likely to mediate inhibition of anaerobic glycolysis during global ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>). Recent findings from our laboratory demonstrated reduced myocardial GAPDH activity and levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate at the end of the ischemic period and normalization of these changes by inhibition of iNOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). Higher iNOS expression and NO production have been shown, in part, to impair glycolysis and to reduce ATP levels in ischemic hearts. Our data demonstrating reduced iNOS expression, total nitrite and nitrate levels, and improved ATP levels in RAGE-inhibited ischemic hearts are consistent, in part, with RAGE blockade improving anaerobic glycolysis.</p></sec><sec><title>RAGE and cardiac ischemic injury.</title><p>Our findings stress the impact of RAGE in generation of iNOS and nitrite and nitrate and cGMP, especially consequent to I/R. In rats rendered diabetic with STZ, the impact of diabetes and NOS in the heart was demonstrated by the beneficial effects of <sc>l</sc>-NAME (<sc>l</sc>-<italic>N</italic><sup>G</sup>-nitro-<sc>l</sc>-arginine methyl ester) in improvement of ventricular performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>). Our findings extend these concepts to link RAGE in the diabetic rat heart and RAGE signaling in either mononuclear phagocyte or endothelial cells in the diabetic mouse heart to iNOS expression and enhanced injury in I/R, as measured by LDH release. The finding that levels of ATP are restored in diabetic RAGE-KO mice or Tg mice expressing signaling-deficient mutant RAGE mice in I/R provides a direct link between oxidant stress, NOS, and energy metabolism.</p><p>Our studies in diabetic rats definitively showed that pharmacological blockade of RAGE protected the isolated perfused heart from damage and dysfunction, the latter measured by LVDP. In parallel, release of LDH was attenuated by RAGE blockade. In mice, pharmacological blockade of RAGE or genetic manipulation (RAGE-KO) attenuated the release of LDH and improved LVDP and ATP recovery. Although RAGE signaling significantly affected I/R injury and iNOS expression in diabetes, there was no effect on functional recovery in DN RAGE Tg mice. However, studies in mice globally deficient in RAGE displayed improvement in functional recovery consequent to I/R. These findings suggest a number of possibilities. First, it is plausible that distinct cell types expressing basal levels of RAGE, such as cardiomyocytes or T lymphocytes, may contribute to the findings on functional recovery observed in RAGE-KO mice. Second, the interplay between inflammatory cell and endothelial RAGE signaling may be a critical component of the biochemical and molecular events that, taken together, augur impairment in functional recovery in the I/R diabetic heart. Thus, future studies must address distinct signal transduction mutants of RAGE to broadly probe the potential effects of RAGE signaling in alternative cell types.</p><p>These studies support that the ligands of RAGE, upregulated in the diabetic heart, play important roles in transducing the long-term impact of hyperglycemia. Certainly, basally increased levels of AGEs in the hyperglycemic heart may set the stage for amplification of injury, via RAGE, on superimposed I/R. Distinct RAGE ligands, such as S100/calgranulins may also play important roles in the I/R heart. In the isolated perfused heart, ischemic rat hearts release S100b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>). Studies have linked S100b to maladaptive remodeling after experimental infarction in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>). Our recent studies, performed in the absence of diabetes, demonstrated that a primary stimulus to release and recruitment of the RAGE axis ensues primarily from the ischemic insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>). Ischemic insult induces increases in AGE-RAGE expression and leads to increased injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that diabetes increases AGEs such as CML, pentosidine, and furosine under baseline and I/R conditions. Levels of CML, pentosidine, and furosine were significantly reduced in diabetic RAGE KO mice hearts. Targeted expression of DN RAGE in endothelial cells or mononuclear phagocytes attenuated CML accumulation in these diabetic hearts under all perfusion conditions, whereas pentosidine was attenuated in diabetic Tg DN MSR RAGE after I/R and furosine was attenuated in diabetic Tg DN PEET RAGE hearts after I/R. These data indicate that CML is a key AGE that is linked to RAGE-dependent injury after I/R in diabetic hearts. Taken together, our findings highlight potential roles for the RAGE axis at multiple stages of injury in the diabetic, ischemic heart.</p><p>We observed that in diabetic RAGE KO, Tg DN PPET RAGE, and Tg DN MSR RAGE mice hearts, protection from injury due to I/R was also associated with reductions in caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release. These experiments are consistent with our and other earlier studies that have linked protection of ischemic hearts to reduced apoptosis in mice models of I/R including in the setting of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>)</p><p>In conclusion, these studies definitively link RAGE to myocardial ischemic injury and dysfunction in the diabetic heart. We propose that blockade of RAGE may provide a novel means to exert cardioprotection in the vulnerable diabetic heart, particularly consequent to I/R injury.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>A.M.S. is a recipient of a Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Scholar Award.
