ATP-induced dimerization of CFTR's two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) has been shown to reflect the channel open state, whereas hydrolysis of ATP is associated with channel closure. Pyrophosphate (PPi), like nonhydrolytic ATP analogues, is known to lock open the CFTR channel for tens of seconds when applied with ATP. Here, we demonstrate that PPi by itself opens the CFTR channel in a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner long after ATP is removed from the cytoplasmic side of excised membrane patches. However, the short-lived open state (&#x003c4; &#x0223c;1.5 s) induced by MgPPi suggests that MgPPi alone does not support a stable NBD dimer configuration. Surprisingly, MgPPi elicits long-lasting opening events (&#x003c4; &#x0223c;30 s) when administrated shortly after the closure of ATP-opened channels. These results indicate the presence of two different closed states (C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>) upon channel closure and a state-dependent effect of MgPPi on CFTR gating. The relative amount of channels entering MgPPi-induced long-open bursts during the ATP washout phase decreases over time, indicating a time-dependent dissipation of the closed state (C<sub>2</sub>) that can be locked open by MgPPi. The stability of the C<sub>2</sub> state is enhanced when the channel is initially opened by N<sup>6</sup>-phenylethyl-ATP, a high affinity ATP analogue, but attenuated by W401G mutation, which likely weakens ATP binding to NBD1, suggesting that an ATP molecule remains bound to the NBD1 site in the C<sub>2</sub> state. Taking advantage of the slow opening rate of Y1219G-CFTR, we are able to identify a C<sub>2</sub>-equivalent state (C<sub>2</sub>*), which exists before the channel in the C<sub>1</sub> state is opened by ATP. This closed state responds to MgPPi much more inefficiently than the C<sub>2</sub> state. Finally, we show that MgAMP-PNP exerts its effects on CFTR gating via a similar mechanism as MgPPi. The structural and functional significance of our findings is discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The CFTR, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riordan et al. 1989</xref>), is a phosphorylation-activated but ATP-gated chloride channel in epithelial cells. Mutations of the CFTR gene resulting in malfunction of this channel cause the lethal genetic disease cystic fibrosis. The CFTR protein incorporates two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), NBD1 and NBD2, which serve as the gating machinery to drive the conformational changes during gating transitions (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gadsby et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen and Hwang, 2008</xref>). Each NBD holds the Walker A and Walker B motifs that form the major constituents for interactions with ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walker et al., 1982</xref>). There is compelling evidence that, similar to other ABC transporters (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Higgins and Linton, 2004</xref>), once ATP binds to the nucleotide-interacting motifs, the two NBDs of CFTR approach each other to form a head-to-tail dimer with two ATP molecules sandwiched at the dimer interface, and this intramolecular interaction in turn leads to opening of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vergani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mense et al., 2006</xref>). Because a biochemically stable NBD dimer formation in other ABC transporters is observed only when ATPase activity is abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moody et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2002</xref>), it is proposed that ATP hydrolysis causes fast separation of the two NBDs and thus results in closing of the CFTR channel.</p><p>The idea that ATP hydrolysis precedes channel closing is further supported by the observations that CFTR mutations whose ATPase activity is abrogated (e.g., K1250A and E1371S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramjeesingh et al., 1999</xref>) can remain open for minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gunderson and Kopito, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zeltwanger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vergani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bompadre et al., 2005b</xref>), and that channel closure is markedly delayed in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hwang et al., 1994</xref>), or of inorganic phosphate analogue orthovanadate, which presumably forms a stable complex with the hydrolytic product ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baukrowitz et al., 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gunderson and Kopito (1994)</xref> reported that, similar to AMP-PNP or vanadate, pyrophosphate (PPi), although it fails to open the channel by itself, can &#x0201c;lock&#x0201d; the CFTR channel into a prolonged open state in the presence of ATP. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carson et al. (1995)</xref> confirmed and expanded this observation by showing that PPi also strongly potentiates cystic fibrosis&#x02013;associated mutations &#x00394;F508 and G551S.</p><p>Data from several laboratories have suggested that PPi exerts its effect via binding to the ATP-binding site at NBD2. First, several NBD2 mutations, but not corresponding NBD1 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gunderson and Kopito, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cotten et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berger et al., 2002</xref>), abolish PPi stimulation. Second, PPi fails to enhance the activity of mouse CFTR, and replacing human NBD2 with the equivalent region of mouse CFTR also abolishes the effect of PPi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lansdell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scott-Ward et al., 2007</xref>). However, the idea that NBD2 determines the PPi sensitivity cannot explain several other findings. For example, PPi, when applied in the absence of ATP, fails to lock open the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gunderson and Kopito, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carson et al., 1995</xref>). Biochemical studies show that PPi paradoxically produces a concentration-dependent increase in 8-N<sub>3</sub>ATP photolabeling of CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carson et al., 1995</xref>). Furthermore, several results suggest an involvement of NBD1 in PPi's action on CFTR gating. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Csanady et al. (2005)</xref> reported that deletion of the N-terminal regulatory insertion in NBD1 somewhat weakens PPi's effect. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cai et al. (2006)</xref> showed that PPi cannot potentiate G1349D, a mutation at the signature sequence of NBD2, which forms the ATP-binding pocket with the nucleotide-interacting motifs of NBD1. These observations can be nicely explained if one hypothesizes that ATP binding at NBD1 primes the CFTR channel into an activated state that can be locked open by PPi (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gunderson and Kopito, 1995</xref>). This hypothesis, however appealing, is short of direct evidence.</p><p>Because most of the experiments described above were performed when ATP and PPi were applied together, it is difficult to assess whether PPi acts on an open state (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hwang et al., 1994</xref>) or a closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gunderson and Kopito, 1995</xref>). We reasoned that if the open state reflects a stable NBD dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vergani et al., 2005</xref>), it seems unlikely that PPi would have access to the nucleotide-binding site buried at the dimer interface in an open-channel configuration. Thus, it is more likely that PPi acts on a closed state. Indeed, in the current study, we provide evidence that once leaving the ATP-induced open state, closed channels respond to PPi in a Mg-dependent manner. We demonstrate that shortly after channel closure, MgPPi alone locks open a closed state (C<sub>2</sub>), where one ATP molecule is not yet dissociated from the NBD1 site. This result echoes the hypothesis that ATP primes the channel by binding to NBD1.</p><p>There are multiple closed states in the gating cycle of CFTR. Here, we are able to differentiate two more closed states (C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>*) based on their different responses to MgPPi. The C<sub>1</sub> state exists long after channel closure, and the binding of MgPPi to this state induces relatively short openings. The C<sub>2</sub>* state is present before the channel is opened from the C<sub>1</sub> state by ATP. Although this C<sub>2</sub>-equivalent state likely has one ATP molecule in the NBD1 site, it has a weaker response to MgPPi compared with the C<sub>2</sub> state. Functional and structural implications of our results will be discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transient expression system</title><p>Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Patch clamp pipettes were made from borosilicate capillary glass using a two-stage vertical puller (Narishige). The pipette tips were fire polished with a homemade microforge to &#x0223c;1-&#x000b5;m external diameter, resulting in a pipette resistance of 2&#x0223c;4 M&#x02126; in the bath solution.</p><p>CFTR channel currents were recorded at room temperature with an EPC-10 patch clamp amplifier, filtered at 100 Hz with an eight-pole Bessel filter (Warner Instrument Corp.) and captured onto a hard disk at a sampling frequency of 500 Hz.

However, when Mg<sup>2+</sup> and NaPPi were mixed slowly, the formation of precipitations was much slower, allowing us to test the effects of a wider range of [PPi] (2&#x0223c;15 mM) on CFTR gating. To minimize a decrease of effective [PPi] due to precipitations, PPi solutions were used no more than 4 h after preparation.

We first tested whether PPi has a similar effect in supporting CFTR gating. Macroscopic current was activated by cytoplasmic application of PKA catalytic subunit plus 2 mM ATP in inside-out patches containing hundreds of WT channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Subsequent withdrawal of ATP resulted in a fast current decay that can be fitted with a single-exponential function with a time constant of 0.42 &#x000b1; 0.03 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 12). 3 min after ATP removal, patches were exposed to a range of [PPi] supplemented with the same concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. MgPPi could increase the current in a concentration-dependent manner in the complete absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The dose&#x02013;response relationship for the effect of MgPPi is obtained by normalizing the macroscopic currents induced by different concentrations of MgPPi to that by 2 mM ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, red line).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The effect of Mg PPi on WT-CFTR.

The relaxation time courses can be fitted with a single-exponential function with a similar time constant (&#x003c4; &#x0223c;1.5 s) for all MgPPi concentrations tested, suggesting that the open time for MgPPi-activated channels is longer than that of ATP-opened channels. However, because the channel open time is independent of [MgPPi], a higher concentration of MgPPi should increase the channel open probability mainly by increasing the opening rate. It is noted here that compared with ATP, which maximally activates CFTR at low millimolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zeltwanger et al., 1999</xref>), 15 mM MgPPi, the highest concentration tested, was still not able to saturate the current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). These results indicate that although MgPPi can increase the open probability of CFTR, its potency is far lower than ATP.</p><p>Our observation that MgPPi alone can support CFTR gating contradicts previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gunderson and Kopito, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carson et al., 1995</xref>) that PPi by itself is unable to open CFTR channels. We suspect that [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] in the PPi solution may be the culprit because, unlike the current study, it is unclear if additional Mg<sup>2+</sup> was added to the PPi solution in those reports. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref> shows a continuous current trace demonstrating that PPi's ability to increase channel activity is dependent on Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The current induced by 10 mM PPi with 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> is significantly higher than that with 10 mM PPi and 2 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (P &#x0003c; 0.01). In fact, when [Mg<sup>2+</sup>] in 10- and 15-mM PPi solutions was reduced to 2 mM, the ability of PPi in supporting channel gating was dramatically attenuated to that of 2 mM MgPPi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, blue line), suggesting that it is MgPPi, not PPi, that activates CFTR. The observed difference is not due to the difference in total salt concentration because the result is essentially the same after adjusting all test solutions to the same salt concentration with NMDG-Cl (not depicted). Unfortunately, the Mg<sup>2+</sup> dependence we identified in the current study also prevents us from testing the effect of higher concentrations of MgPPi (e.g., &#x0003e;20 mM) due to the formation of precipitates (see Materials and methods).</p></sec><sec><title>Different closed states of WT-CFTR revealed by MgPPi</title><p>It has been known for years that PPi, in the presence of ATP, &#x0201c;locks&#x0201d; the channel in an open state with a macroscopic relaxation time constant in tens of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Csanady et al., 2005</xref>).

It should be noted here that this scheme may be oversimplified because there are likely other closed states in the channel closure process that we fail to identify due to the limitation of the current experimental design.</p><p>Assuming that MgPPi can efficiently lock open all channels in the C<sub>2</sub> state, in theory the lifetime of the C<sub>2</sub> state can be approximated by exponential fitting of the slow component of the current induced by MgPPi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>, red line). Unfortunately, because of the slow current rise upon the application of MgPPi (probably due to a low binding affinity of MgPPi), many channels in the C<sub>2</sub> state already dissipate without being locked open during the rising phase of MgPPi-induced current increase. Therefore, the time constant of 27.4 s derived from a single-exponential fit of data points (red squares) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> can only be considered a rough estimate of the lifetime of the C<sub>2</sub> state.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible biochemical basis of the stable C<sub>2</sub> closed state</title><p>What makes C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> different closed states? We noticed that although a long washout of ATP finally results in a complete transition of the C<sub>2</sub> state to the C<sub>1</sub> state, reapplication of ATP can once again bring channels back to the O state and subsequently the C<sub>2</sub> state (not depicted). Thus, the channel seems to have an ability to remember the gating history for tens of seconds and if so, this long-lasting &#x0201c;memory&#x0201d; likely comes from a prior exposure of the channels to ATP.</p><p>It has been shown that although the NBD2 of CFTR has a high nucleotide turnover rate, presumably due to its ATPase activity, ATP can be &#x0201c;trapped&#x0201d; in NBD1 for a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Szabo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aleksandrov et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basso et al., 2003</xref>). Using these biochemical data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vergani et al. (2003)</xref> proposed that once ATP binds to the NBD1 site, it is occluded there; therefore, during a gating cycle, when the channel closes, the ATP molecule remains bound at the NBD1 site. We wondered if the C<sub>2</sub> state described above may represent this elusive state, defined based on biochemical data. If the C<sub>2</sub> state indeed has a bound ATP in NBD1, the effect of MgPPi on the C<sub>2</sub> state should meet two key predictions. First, with the NBD1 site occupied by ATP, MgPPi likely binds to NBD2 to lock open the channel. Reports from several different groups have already suggested that is the case (see Introduction). Thus, when MgPPi and ATP (or other nucleotides such as ADP) are applied together, they may compete for the NBD2 site. Second, the binding affinity of ATP or ATP analogue in NBD1 may affect the lifetime of the C<sub>2</sub> state.</p><p>To test whether MgPPi and ATP, when applied together, compete for a common binding site, we prepared solutions containing 2 mM MgPPi with various concentrations of ATP. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>, WT-CFTR channels in inside-out patches were first activated by PKA and 2 mM ATP. After the macroscopic current reached the steady state, subsequent application of 10 mM ATP plus 2 mM MgPPi further increased the current. Washout of this mixed solution resulted in a bi-exponential current decay with a fast component reflecting ATP-induced open state (&#x003c4; &#x0223c;400 ms) and a slow component (&#x003c4; &#x0223c;30 s) representing channels in the lock-open state (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vergani et al., 2003</xref>). After the current reached the baseline, PKA and 2 mM ATP were applied again to ensure full phosphorylation of the channels. Once the channels were fully activated, 2 mM ATP and 2 mM MgPPi were applied. Note that not only is the steady-state current with 2 mM ATP plus 2 mM MgPPi higher than that with 10 mM ATP plus 2 mM MgPPi, the current increase is also faster. In addition, the biphasic current decay after the removal of 2 mM ATP plus 2 mM MgPPi shows a noticeably smaller faction of the fast phase, indicating that more channels enter the lock-open state (see the arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Thus, although MgPPi only locks open CFTR after the channel is primed by ATP, a higher [ATP] actually exerts an inhibitory effect. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref> (red symbols), the fraction of the slow component decreased as the concentration of ATP was elevated. On the other hand, when [ATP] was fixed at 2 mM, an increased concentration of MgPPi led to a larger fraction of the slow component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>, blue symbols). These results are consistent with the idea that ATP and MgPPi compete for a common binding site.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>ATP and MgPPi compete for a common binding site. (A) Steady-state macroscopic current of WT-CFTR activated by 2 mM ATP and PKA was further increased by the application of 2 mM MgPPi plus 2 mM ATP (right) or 2 mM MgPPi plus 10 mM ATP (left). With lower [ATP] in the PPi solution, the current increase proceeds more rapidly (right). Fitting the current relaxation yields two time constants after the removal of 2 mM ATP plus 2 mM PPi (&#x003c4;<sub>1</sub> = 0.55 &#x000b1; 0.06 s and &#x003c4;<sub>2</sub> = 26.9 &#x000b1; 1.56 s; <italic>n</italic> = 12) or after 2 mM MgPPi plus 10 mM ATP (&#x003c4;<sub>1</sub> = 0.34 &#x000b1; 0.03 s and &#x003c4;<sub>2</sub> = 30.4 &#x000b1; 3.1 s; <italic>n</italic> = 4).

(C) Effects of PPi on Y1219G-CFTR. 2 mM ATP plus PKA activated a small amount of current due to a reduced apparent affinity for ATP by the mutation. Upon application of 2 mM PPi plus 2 mM ATP, the current was greatly enhanced. The current decays monotonically with &#x003c4; = 30.7 &#x000b1; 4.5 s (<italic>n</italic> = 5).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JGP_200810186_RGB_Fig5"/></fig><p>It seems counterintuitive that not all channels in the membrane patches are locked open in the presence of equal concentrations of ATP and MgPPi when one considers the fact that the lock-open state (&#x003c4; &#x0223c;30 s) is &#x0003e;50-fold more stable than the regular open state (&#x003c4; &#x0223c;400 ms). This phenomenon, however, can be readily explained by a proposition that ATP out-competes MgPPi in opening the channel. For example, when MgPPi and ATP are both at 2 mM, the slow component has a time constant of &#x003c4;<sub>s</sub> = 26.9 &#x000b1; 1.56 s (<italic>n</italic> = 12), whereas the time constant of the fast component (&#x003c4;<sub>f</sub>) is 0.55 &#x000b1; 0.06 s. From the fractional amplitude of the slow component (70.2 &#x000b1; 3.7%), we estimated that only 1 in every &#x0223c;20 openings results in a lock-open event. This conclusion is probably not surprising as results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al. (2006)</xref> suggested that the ring&#x02013;ring stacking interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>; but compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lewis et al., 2004</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thibodeau et al., 2005</xref>), which MgPPi is lacking, between the side chain of aromatic residues in NBDs (W401 in NBD1 or Y1219 in NBD2) and the adenine ring of ATP may play an important role in nucleotide binding. In fact, we have already shown above that MgPPi has a lower potency than ATP to open channels from the C<sub>1</sub> state.</p><p>If NBD2 is indeed the common binding site for ATP and MgPPi, one expects that removal of the side chain of Y1219 should diminish ATP's advantage in competing for the binding pocket. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref> shows that 2 mM MgPPi, when added to 2 mM ATP solution, dramatically increased the Y1219G-CFTR macroscopic current. Unlike the data for WT-CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>), the current relaxation upon the removal of ATP and MgPPi follows a monotonic decay with a time constant of &#x003c4; = 30.7 &#x000b1; 4.5 s (<italic>n</italic> = 5), indicating that almost all Y1219G-CFTR channels have been locked open under this experimental condition. As a control, when a similar experiment was performed for W401G, ATP still out-competes MgPPi as demonstrated by a large fraction of the fast component during current relaxation (not depicted).</p><p>Although <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="sc1">Scheme 1</xref> depicts the first step of channel closure as a single step, as described above, this is likely an oversimplification. If this step indeed involves ATP hydrolysis and dissociation of the hydrolytic products as we speculated above, there must exist other closed state configurations. For example, one can imagine one closed state with ADP remaining bound and the other closed state with an empty binding pocket. These two possible states can be differentiated by adding MgPPi in the presence of ADP. If ADP inhibits the effect of MgPPi as ATP, one can argue that the closed state where MgPPi acts should have an unoccupied NBD2. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref> (<italic>n</italic> = 5), we show that a direct solution switch from 2 mM ATP to 2 mM MgPPi (a deadtime of &#x0223c;20 ms) resulted in fast channel closure, followed by a reopening of the channels. However, when the MgPPi solution was mixed with 5 mM ADP, the second-phase current rise was mostly abolished (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>), indicating that ADP indeed inhibits the effect of MgPPi. It is known that ADP inhibits the ATP-dependent WT-CFTR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson and Welsh, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gunderson and Kopito, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Winter et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schultz et al., 1995</xref>) mainly by competing for NBD2 of CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bompadre et al., 2005a</xref>). Our results thus suggest that regardless of whether the NBD2 binding site is occupied by ATP that leads to channel opening, or by ADP that keeps the channel in a closed state with a bound ADP at the NBD2 site, MgPPi fails to exert its effects. We therefore propose that NBD2 is vacant when the channel is in the C<sub>2</sub> state.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>ADP inhibits the reopening of WT-CFTR by MgPPi.

This hypothesis predicts that a high affinity ATP analogue in NBD1 should slow down the dissipation of the C<sub>2</sub> state. To test this prediction, we used P-ATP, which is 50-fold more potent than ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>), to activate WT-CFTR. After macroscopic current was first elicited by the nucleotide at a saturating concentration (i.e., 2 mM ATP or 50 &#x000b5;M P-ATP), changing the perfusion solution directly to 2 mM MgPPi alone caused a rapid current decline due to channel closure through ATP hydrolysis and a subsequent current rise from the lock-open channels by MgPPi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). We measured the ratio of the peak current induced by MgPPi (I<sub>PPi</sub>) to the original nucleotide-activated current (I<sub>N</sub>). It should be noted that because the open probabilities of WT-CFTR in the presence of ATP or P-ATP are 0.45 and 0.65, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zeltwanger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>), a fair comparison of the two ratios (I<sub>PPi</sub> /I<sub>ATP</sub> and I<sub>PPi</sub> /I<sub>PATP</sub>) requires normalization of the open probability. We recalibrated the ratio using the following strategy. First, we obtained the current level (I<sub>N</sub>) reflecting all channels being in the open state by dividing I<sub>ATP</sub> (or I<sub>P-ATP</sub>) with the open probability (0.45 for I<sub>ATP</sub>, and 0.65 for I<sub>P-ATP</sub>). Then, we divided the current generated by MgPPi (i.e., I<sub>PPi</sub>) with I<sub>N</sub> (the left-hand y axis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref>). This type of analysis more accurately portrays the actual number of channels entering the lock-open state under different conditions.

Treating the channels that have been closed for a long time (thus in the C<sub>1</sub> state) with a low concentration of ATP should favor an accumulation of the C<sub>2</sub>* state because the transition rate from C<sub>2</sub>* to O is significantly decreased by the Y1219G mutation, whereas a high concentration of ATP opens the channel more frequently and thus brings more channels to the C<sub>2</sub> state. If the two closed states respond to MgPPi in a similar manner, the subsequent addition of MgPPi to ATP solutions should result in a very similar response regardless of the proportion of channels in the C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>* state.</p><p>After PKA and ATP activation and a 1-min washout, we first treated Y1219G channels with 500 &#x000b5;M ATP, which only elicited minimal current.

These effects have been demonstrated for MgPPi (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Similar experiments as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref> were performed for MgAMP-PNP with W401G-CFTR and P-ATP, and virtually identical results were obtained (not depicted). Interestingly, however, we found that MgAMP-PNP, when applied minutes after the removal of ATP (thus acting on the C<sub>1</sub> state), activates WT-CFTR with a maximally effective concentration of &#x0223c;2 mM, which is significantly lower than that of MgPPi (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). When MgAMP-PNP acts on the C<sub>2</sub> state, there is also very little difference between 2 and 10 mM MgAMP-PNP, as the currents induced by these two concentrations of MgAMP-PNP immediately after ATP washout are 66.2 &#x000b1; 3.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and 77.9 &#x000b1; 4.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) of the original ATP-induced current, respectively. These results are consistent with those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vergani et al. (2003)</xref>, who showed that the effect of MgAMP-PNP, similar to ATP, is saturated at millimolar concentration. Therefore, the low efficacy of MgAMP-PNP in opening the channel by itself seems to reflect its intrinsic property as a poor ligand rather than its having a lower binding affinity than ATP.</p><p>If the ring&#x02013;ring stacking interaction between the side chain of Y1219 and the adenine ring of ATP (or AMP-PNP) is indeed critical in determining the affinity of nucleotide binding at the NBD2 site, removing the side chain of Y1219 is expected to lower the binding affinity for ATP as well as MgAMP-PNP. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 10 (B and C)</xref>, when [ATP] = [MgAMP-PNP] = 2 mM, the fractional amplitudes of the slow component upon current relaxation are 73 &#x000b1; 3% (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and 71 &#x000b1; 4% (<italic>n</italic> = 6) for WT-CFTR and Y1219G-CFTR, respectively. Thus, although the Y1219G mutation alters the competition between ATP and MgPPi for the NBD2 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>), the same mutation does not significantly affect the competition between ATP and MgAMP-PNP, suggesting that the Y1219G mutation decreases the binding affinity of ATP to a similar extent as it lowers the affinity for MgAMP-PNP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, using MgPPi as a probe, we identify three distinct closed states (C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, and C<sub>2</sub>*) of the CFTR chloride channels and propose a multistep channel-closing scheme after ATP hydrolysis. Three novel findings are reported. First, MgPPi alone can open CFTR despite having a much lower apparent affinity than ATP. Second, MgPPi locks open ATP-primed channels that are already closed. Third, MgPPi affects CFTR gating in a state-dependent manner. The functional significance and potential structural implications of our results will be discussed.</p><sec><title>MgPPi as a ligand to support CFTR gating</title><p>Although it is generally agreed that ATP-dependent gating of WT-CFTR is predominantly controlled by ATP binding/hydrolysis events in NBD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gadsby et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen and Hwang, 2008</xref>), how ATP interacts with NBD2 to open the channel remains unclear. Nevertheless, a few clues for this question have already been provided by previous studies testing the effects of different nucleotides on CFTR. First, it was reported that CFTR channels can be opened efficiently by a wide range of nucleoside triphosphates, including ATP, GTP, ITP, CTP, and UTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al. 1991</xref>). These results indicate that the base of the nucleoside triphosphate may not be critical in opening CFTR. In sharp contrast, the observation that ADP acts as a competitive inhibitor of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson and Welsh, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gunderson and Kopito, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Winter et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schultz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bompadre et al., 2005a</xref>) points to the crucial role of the phosphate group in triggering channel openings. That nucleotides with an altered bridging structure between &#x003b2;-&#x003b3; phosphates, such as AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP, and ATP&#x003b3;S, only induce minimal channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nagel et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hwang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aleksandrov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vergani et al., 2003</xref>) also corroborates this idea.</p><p>The importance of the phosphate group of ATP in triggering CFTR channel opening is further supported by this study where we have demonstrated that PPi, which preserves the &#x003b2;-&#x003b3; phosphate conformation (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clark and Morley, 1976</xref>), elicits opening events in the complete absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). To explain early failure in observing PPi's effect on CFTR, we found that PPi opens CFTR in a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). This result is probably not surprising, as the crystal structures of CFTR NBD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lewis et al., 2004</xref>) have revealed that Mg<sup>2+</sup> is coordinated by &#x003b2;-&#x003b3; phosphates of ATP. The functional importance of this interaction between Mg<sup>2+</sup> and &#x003b2;-&#x003b3; phosphates is established by the observation that omission of Mg<sup>2+</sup> can severely impair channel opening by ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schultz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aleksandrov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ikuma and Welsh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dousmanis et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>More recent studies suggest a critical role of the evolutionarily conserved signature sequence (LSGGQ) in the signal transduction from ATP binding in NBDs to the gate of CFTR. First, several high resolution crystal structures of ABC transporter proteins show that the oxygen atom in the &#x003b3; phosphate of ATP forms hydrogen bonds with residues of the signature sequence once two NBDs establish a head-to-tail dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hopfner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zaitseva et al., 2005</xref>). Second, the observation that the G551D mutation at the signature sequence completely abolishes ATP-dependent gating of CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bompadre et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2008</xref>) points to the functional significance of this interaction. Third, although G551D-CFTR cannot be opened by ATP, this mutant channel can be gated by Cd<sup>2+</sup>. Interestingly, when a cysteine residue, which is known to bind avidly to soft metals like Cd<sup>2+</sup>, is engineered into the signature sequence of CFTR's NBD1, the mutant channels can also be gated by Cd<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). This latest result suggests that the interaction between the ligand (ATP or Cd<sup>2+</sup>) and the signature sequence is essential in transducing the molecular events in NBDs to the channel gate. If MgPPi is capable of binding to the same site occupied by the &#x003b2;-&#x003b3; phosphates of ATP to interact with the signature sequence, it is not surprising that MgPPi by itself can gate CFTR.</p><p>The new result that MgPPi by itself can gate CFTR also offers clues for the role of the adenine ring of ATP in the gating process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al. (2006)</xref> reported that Y1219G-CFTR, which presumably loses the &#x003c0;-electron&#x02013;stacking interaction between the aromatic side chain of the tyrosine residue and the adenine ring of ATP, has a far lower ATP binding affinity compared with WT-CFTR. In addition, P-ATP, an ATP analogue with an extra benzene ring attached to adenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2006</xref>), activates WT-CFTR at micromolar concentration. Collectively, these results suggest that the adenine ring, although not essential for ATP-dependent gating of CFTR, may help stabilize the binding of ATP molecules onto the NBD site. This idea predicts that a ligand without the base will have a lower binding affinity. Indeed, 15 mM MgPPi has yet to saturate the current response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), whereas the maximal current of WT-CFTR can be attained by 2.75 mM ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zeltwanger et al., 1999</xref>). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that MgPPi has a low binding affinity simply because it does not bind to the Walker A domain as well as ATP, the observation that MgAMP-PNP elicits a maximal effect on CFTR at low millimolar concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vergani et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 10 A</xref>), and that the binding affinity of MgAMP-PNP is weakened by Y1219G mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 10 C</xref>), suggests that a lack of the ring&#x02013;ring interaction may have a greater impact on the ligand binding affinity than a slight structural alteration of the phosphate group.</p><p>In addition to the difference in apparent affinity, another difference between ATP and MgPPi in channel gating is the burst duration. The current relaxation after MgPPi removal yields a time constant of &#x0223c;1.5 s, whereas it yields only &#x0223c;400 ms after MgATP washout for WT-CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). As PPi was reported to be hydrolyzed by many enzymes, including glucose-6-phosphatase in rat liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nordlie et al., 1999</xref>), alkaline phosphates of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Anderson and Nordlie, 1967</xref>), and PPi-dependent phosphofructokinase in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carnal and Black, 1979</xref>), we first considered the possibility that MgPPi has a lower hydrolytic rate than ATP in the NBD2 composite site, and thus the opening events are terminated more slowly. This hypothesis can be tested by comparing the gating kinetics of MgPPi in WT-CFTR and E1371S-CFTR, a mutant whose ATPase activity is abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moody et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tombline et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vergani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stratford et al., 2007</xref>). We reasoned that if MgPPi elicits longer open bursts due to a slower hydrolysis rate, E1371S mutation should further prolong the burst duration induced by MgPPi. However, as can be seen in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200810186/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>, although the E1371S mutation dramatically increases the relaxation time constant of the ATP-gated channels (&#x003c4; = 126.1 &#x000b1; 24.2 s; <italic>n</italic> = 5), the lifetime of MgPPi-induced openings for E1371S channels (1.65 s, ensemble current relaxation from five data) is very close to that of WT-CFTR (&#x0223c;1.5 s in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). This result suggests that both MgPPi-opened WT-CFTR and E1371S-CFTR channels close through a nonhydrolytic pathway. MgPPi elicits longer opening events in WT channels than ATP because ATP-induced openings are terminated by rapid ATP hydrolysis. Finally, the data also indicate that MgPPi is a poor ligand for CFTR channels because, unlike ATP, it fails to induce a stable open state with E1371S-CFTR.</p></sec><sec><title>MgPPi locks open CFTR channels when an ATP is bound in NBD1</title><p>The second novel finding presented here is that when the WT-CFTR channels are first opened by ATP, MgPPi applied within seconds after ATP withdrawal locks open the channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). The lifetime of this lock-open state (&#x0223c;30 s) is much longer than that opened by MgPPi alone after a 3-min ATP washout (&#x0223c;1.5 s) as described above. These results indicate the presence of two different closed states, C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>, which respond to MgPPi differently. It should be noted that this conclusion is model independent. It is solely based on the experimental observation that MgPPi exerts different effects when applied at different times during which the channels are closed.</p><p>Because the longer the washout the fewer the channels capable of entering the lock-open state and the more the channels poorly responsive to MgPPi, we postulate a dissipation of the C<sub>2</sub> state and an accumulation of the C<sub>1</sub> state over time during the ATP washout phase. Because the C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>1</sub> transition can be slowed down when the channel is first opened by a high affinity ATP analogue, P-ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), we propose that there is at least one ATP molecule remained bound in the C<sub>2</sub> state. We envisage that the dissociation of this bound ATP in the C<sub>2</sub> state is associated with the transition from the C<sub>2</sub> state to the C<sub>1</sub> state. Thus, a more tightly bound P-ATP can stabilize the C<sub>2</sub> state more strongly than ATP.</p><p>Two lines of evidence suggest that NBD1 is occupied by ATP during the C<sub>2</sub> state. First, biochemical studies showed that NBD2 is a site with a high nucleotide turnover rate due to rapid ATP hydrolysis, whereas NBD1 is a site of more stable nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Szabo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aleksandrov et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basso et al., 2003</xref>). Second, W401G mutation, which likely reduces ATP binding affinity in NBD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>), decreases the stability of the C<sub>2</sub> state. The fact that this mutational effect on the stability of the C<sub>2</sub> state can be at least partially overcome by P-ATP suggests that this mutational effect can be attributed to a lower binding affinity rather than some nonspecific allosteric effects.</p><p>If the NBD1 site of the C<sub>2</sub> state is occupied by ATP, the likely site for MgPPi's action is the presumably vacated NBD2 site after ATP hydrolysis and dissociation of the hydrolytic products. This idea is supported by the results that both ATP and ADP can compete with MgPPi for a common binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Furthermore, the fact that MgPPi alone can open and lock open CFTR also corroborates this proposition because the NBD2 site plays a critical role in ligand-dependent opening of CFTR. Thus, the MgPPi-induced lock-open configuration of CFTR's two NBDs is composed of one MgPPi molecule in NBD2 and one ATP molecule in NBD1. Because essentially the same data were obtained for MgAMP-PNP&#x02013;induced lock-open state, we propose a similar configuration of NBDs for the action of MgAMP-PNP (i.e., MgAMP-PNP in NBD2 and ATP in NBD1; see Results; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 10</xref>).</p><p>So far, we have discussed how MgPPi locks open CFTR in the absence of ATP, whereas in the literature, PPi is reported to exert this effect on CFTR when applied together with ATP. It is important to note that channels opened by MgPPi or ATP plus MgPPi have a similar relaxation time constant upon washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>), suggesting a common lock-open state under these two conditions. However, when ATP and MgPPi are applied together, it becomes difficult to tell if MgPPi acts on the open state or the closed state. To differentiate these two scenarios, we measured the fractional amplitude of the slow component in the macroscopic current decay phase after washout of ATP plus MgPPi at different concentrations of ATP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). A larger slow component indicates that the lock-open bursts occur more frequently. If MgPPi binds to the closed state to exert its effect, an increase of [ATP] should compete for binding and thus decreases the fraction of the slow component. In contrast, if MgPPi acts on the open state, the frequency of long-opening events should not be altered by varying [ATP] at the millimolar range. Our results showing that the frequency of lock-open bursts is inversely dependent on [ATP] suggest that MgPPi indeed binds to the closed state to exert its effects, even when it is applied with ATP.</p><p>For channel closure from the MgPPi-induced locked-open state, in theory, dissociation of either ATP in NBD1 or MgPPi in NBD2 may be associated with the closing step. In <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200810186/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>, when the channels opened by ATP are constantly exposed to MgPPi after ATP removal, the macroscopic current can remain at a constant level for &#x0003e;2 min. The current decay upon subsequent MgPPi withdrawal yields a single time constant of &#x003c4; = 35.7 &#x000b1; 6.4 s (<italic>n</italic> = 3), indicating that once the locked-open channels close, they are readily locked open again by MgPPi. This result thus suggests that it is MgPPi dissociation from NBD2, but not ATP from NBD1, that is associated with channel closing from the locked-open state. This idea again is consistent with the critical role of ligand binding/unbinding at NBD2 in CFTR gating.</p></sec><sec><title>Structural/biochemical implications of these results</title><p>A puzzling question is why the C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> states respond to MgPPi so differently. As the fundamental difference between the two closed states is whether ATP remains bound at NBD1 or not, it appears that ATP binding in NBD1 can help stabilize the open state induced by MgPPi. Echoing this observation, the lock-open duration of MgPPi is reduced by mutations that decrease the ATP binding affinity to NBD1, K464A, and W401G, but can be partially restored by a high affinity ATP analogue, P-ATP (unpublished data; compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Because the open state of CFTR represents a dimerization of its two NBDs, we ask whether the dimer completely separates when ATP-opened channels close to the C<sub>2</sub> state. If there is a strict coupling between NBD dimerization and opening of the CFTR channel gate, the NBD dimer has to undergo some kind of dissociation upon this O&#x02192;C<sub>2</sub> transition. A complete separation of the NBD dimer for the closing step of WT-CFTR will leave one bound ATP at NBD1 well exposed to the bulk water, as seen in the monomeric ATP-NBD1 crystal structure of CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lewis et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2005</xref>). It seems difficult to envisage that this ATP can remain tightly bound for tens of seconds. Therefore, we speculate that the NBD dimer may only partially separate once the ligand (ADP and Pi after ATP hydrolysis, or MgPPi) dissociates from NBD2. Another ligand in NBD1 will remain trapped by the partial dimer until a complete separation of the two NBDs. Supporting this hypothesis, we demonstrated that the C<sub>2</sub> state dissipates much faster when residues at either NBD1 (W401G; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>) or the signature sequence of NBD2 were mutated (S1347G; Fig. S1).</p><p>One assumption behind the partial dimer hypothesis is that the ligand in NBD1 will undergo fast binding/unbinding if not trapped in the dimer interface. Here, using the Y1219G mutation to slow down the channel opening rate, we identify another closed state (C<sub>2</sub>*) that exists before the channel is opened by ATP from the C<sub>1</sub> state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figs. 8 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). This closed state either fails to respond to MgPPi or responds to MgPPi much more inefficiently than the C<sub>2</sub> state. We speculate that because the NBD dimer structure is not yet formed in the C<sub>2</sub>* state as the channel is yet to open, the rather unstable binding of ATP in NBD1 results in a slower lock-open rate of MgPPi.</p><p>As described in the Results, the configuration of the C<sub>2</sub> state proposed here seems consistent with biochemical results demonstrating that NBD1 is a site of stable nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Szabo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aleksandrov et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basso et al., 2003</xref>). A careful reexamination, however, reveals two significant disagreements. First, it was shown that 8-azido-ATP can be occluded in NBD1 for tens of minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basso et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleksandrov et al., 2008</xref>). However, our results suggest that the ATP molecule retained in NBD1 after channel closure can almost completely dissociate within 1 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). More importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleksandrov et al. (2008)</xref> recently reported that the occlusion of 8-azido-ATP occurs even when NBD2 is deleted. This latest result indicates that the intrinsic high binding affinity of NBD1 per se is sufficient to trap the nucleotide without a need of a partial dimer as we postulated above. Although one may attribute these discrepancies to very different materials and experimental procedures used in different laboratories, it is of great interest for us to understand how to reconcile functional and biochemical results in the near future.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material Index</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200810186_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jgp.200810186_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Cindy Chu and Shenghui Hu for technical assistance.</p><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants NIHR01DK55835, NIHR01HL53455, and CFFT CLARKE06XX0 (to T.-C.
