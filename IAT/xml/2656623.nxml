Here we have investigated medulloblastoma tumors (MBs), which arise from an early impairment of developmental processes in the cerebellum, where Notch signaling is involved in many cell-fate-determining stages. MBs occur bimodally, with the peak incidence seen between 3&#x02013;4 years and 8&#x02013;9 years of age, although it can also occur in adults. Notch regulates a subset of the MB cells that have stem-cell-like properties and can promote tumor growth. On the basis of this evidence, we hypothesized that miRNAs targeting the Notch pathway can regulated these phenomena, and can be used in anti-cancer therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In a screening of MB cell lines, the miRNA miR-199b-5p was seen to be a regulator of the Notch pathway through its targeting of the transcription factor HES1. Down-regulation of HES1 expression by miR-199b-5p negatively regulates the proliferation rate and anchorage-independent growth of MB cells. MiR-199b-5p over-expression blocks expression of several cancer stem-cell genes, impairs the engrafting potential of MB cells in the cerebellum of athymic/nude mice, and of particular interest, decreases the MB stem-cell-like (CD133&#x0002b;) subpopulation of cells. In our analysis of 61 patients with MB, the expression of miR-199b-5p in the non-metastatic cases was significantly higher than in the metastatic cases (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.001). Correlation with survival for these patients with high levels of miR-199b expression showed a positive trend to better overall survival than for the low-expressing patients. These data showing the down-regulation of miR-199b-5p in metastatic MBs suggest a potential silencing mechanism through epigenetic or genetic alterations. Upon induction of de-methylation using 5-aza-deoxycytidine, lower miR-199b-5p expression was seen in a panel of MB cell lines, supported an epigenetic mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, two cell lines (Med8a and UW228) showed significant up-regulation of miR-199b-5p upon treatment. Infection with MB cells in an induced xenograft model in the mouse cerebellum and the use of an adenovirus carrying miR-199b-5p indicate a clinical benefit through this negative influence of miR-199b-5p on tumor growth and on the subset of MB stem-cell-like cells, providing further proof of concept.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Despite advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of MB, one-third of these patients remain incurable and current treatments can significantly damage long-term survivors. Here we show that miR-199b-5p expression correlates with metastasis spread, identifying a new molecular marker for a poor-risk class in patients with MB. We further show that in a xenograft model, MB tumor burden can be reduced, indicating the use of miR199b-5p as an adjuvant therapy after surgery, in combination with radiation and chemotherapy, for the improvement of anti-cancer MB therapies and patient quality of life. To date, this is the first report that expression of a miRNA can deplete the tumor stem cells, indicating an interesting therapeutic approach for the targeting of these cells in brain tumors.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded RNAs of &#x0223c;22 nucleotides in length, and they constitute a novel class of gene regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004998-Bartel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

From a clinical point of view, current multimodal treatments include radical surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy.

Thus, we looked for potential cell-cycle alterations in these clones. FACS analysis on the 199bSC1 clone showed a 31&#x00025; decrease in S-phase fractions, and an increase in cells in G0-G1 of 15&#x00025;, as compared to the empty vector clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004998-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). This suggested that exit from the cell cycle has a role in the reduced proliferation rate of the Daoy cell 199bSC1 clone. In contrast, the 199bMC1 clone did not show significant changes in its cell cycle. We believe these findings to be due to an overall lower efficiency of 199bMC1 for reducing HES1 protein levels. These cell-cycle phenotypes translated into decreased proliferation rates <italic>in vitro</italic>, as evaluated by <italic>in-vitro</italic> proliferation assays comparing the 199bSC1 and 199bMC1 clones with an empty-vector clone and a transient transfectant for 2-OM designed against miR-199b-5p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004998-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).

At the same time, the transfection of HES1 cDNA into the 199bSC1 clone decreased induction of pro-neural bHLHs and differentiation markers, and increased levels of proliferation genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004998-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).

The effects of restored expression of HES1 on the SP of the stable 199bSC1 clone were also evaluated. When the HES1 transfected cells (GFP positive) were evaluated for their ability to exclude Hoechst dye, they showed a minimum increase in SP, of up to 1.3&#x00025;.

This is probably due to the short time of re-expression of HES1 after transient transfection, which might not be enough to allow for complete phenotype rescue. We then tried to rescue the effects on the CD133 compartment; however, transient transfection of HES1 in the 199bSC1 clone did not result in a significant increase in CD133&#x0002b; cells.

The distribution of miR-199b-5p expression between non-metastatic (M0) and metastatic (M1, M2 and M3) cases showed that miR-199b-5p expression in the non-metastatic cases was significantly higher than in the metastatic cases (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.001, Pearson Chi-Square test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004998-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).

Indeed, two cell lines (Med8a and UW228) showed significant up-regulation of miR-199b-5p, thus supporting the hypothesis of epigenetic control of miR-199b-5p expression. Further studies need to be performed to identify this tuned regulation mechanism of action through epigenetic inactivation of miR199b-5p expression during tumor development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The interconnections between the signaling pathways altered in MB remain largely unknown, and it is still difficult to define specific patient stratification according to risk classes that would lower therapy-linked mortality and morbidity. In the present study, we have identified a mechanism of HES1 gene regulation via the miRNA miR-199b-5p. HES1 is a key regulator of cerebellum development, as indicated by recent findings that treatment of cerebellar granule cells with Shh increases the levels of HES1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004998-Solecki1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that HES1 is a transcriptional target of both the Shh and Notch2 signaling cascades.</p><p>We report here a novel level of regulation of HES1 expression that is driven by miR-199b-5p, which binds to the HES1 3&#x02032;UTR and leads to unproductive translation. Of note, we have also investigated the actions of miR-199b-5p on a reporter construct fused with the 3&#x02032;UTR of NHLH2, cyclin L1 and Nanog (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004998.s001">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004998.s003">Fig. S2D</xref>). Among the predicted targets for miR-199b-5p, which were obtained using two different algorithms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004998.s001">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004998.s008">Table S1</xref>), these genes were possible candidates related to the phenotype obtained after miR-199b over-expression. Nonetheless, we did not obtain down-regulation of reporter activity when tested under the same conditions where we obtained effects on HES1 3&#x02032;UTR. Furthermore, the stable 199bSC1 clone has a GSK3-&#x003b2; protein level comparable to the control. Of note, when analyzed according to the Pita algorithm, the value of &#x00394;&#x00394;G for the binding of miR-199b-5p to the 3&#x02032;UTR of GSK3-&#x003b2; is very high, indicating poor accessibility to the 3&#x02032;UTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004998-Kertesz1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004998.s001">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004998.s008">Table S1</xref>). Recently it has also been shown that miR-199a&#x0002a;, which has the same sequence as miR-199b-5p, is involved in caspase activation by potentially acting through Met proto-oncogene down-regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004998-Kim1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.

While the effects of miR-199b-5p could be explained by triggering of apoptosis, our cytofluorimetric assays suggested that impairment of MB cell proliferation is not linked to extensive apoptosis of cells over-expressing miR-199b-5p (see cell cycle assay on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004998-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

This will allow identification of a subset of patients who should develop an aggressive tumor and have future metastasis formation, noting that disseminated disease is the most powerful independent factor associated with poor survival. Despite the correlation with M status, the over-expression of miR-199b-5p did not lead to a decrease in cell motility of Daoy cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004998.s001">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004998.s003">Fig. S2E</xref>). This may well be due to the extremely high motility of Daoy cells, indicating that to overcome this phenotype, a further step beyond regulation of the Notch pathway needs to take place.

The absence of significant differences in survival rates between patients with total or subtotal excision of MB supports the view that the total excision of MB can be avoided when the risk for potential neurological deficits is high. Recent trials have demonstrated a beneficial effect of chemotherapy, although this was not universally seen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004998-Grill1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004998-Grill2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.

Combined with chemotherapy, and with the potential to abrogate radiotherapy and avoid brain damage due to total tumor excision, this should provide an overall improvement in the present treatments for MB. Thus we foresee the possibility of treating MBs with the use of encapsulated stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALP).

How these gene-therapy approaches will progress further will be an issue for future pre-clinical animal studies.</p><p>As illustrated in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004998-g006">Fig. 6E</xref>), we picture two different expression levels of miR-199b-5p in M0 and M&#x0002b; patients, which might be due to epigenetic regulation during carcinogenesis. In our &#x02018;moderate high&#x02019; model, an increase in miR-199b-5p expression represses HES1, which then leads to an increase in pro-neural bHLHs gene expression, driving the cell towards differentiation processes. In the &#x02018;moderate low&#x02019; model, miR-199b-5p expression is lowered due to epigenetic control mechanisms, and then HES1 is over-expressed, leading to cell proliferation and induction of the SP and hence an increase in CD133&#x0002b; cells. As for many other transcription factors, HES1 is a point of integration between and among different signal transduction pathways, and its balance of expression determines fundamental cell decisions, such as whether or not to start a differentiation program. With this scenario, miR-199b-5p can be seen as part of the complex Notch signal-transduction pathway, as a fine tuner of the levels of expression of the HES1 bHLH transcription factor. These phenomena could be considered to occur in a variety of tissues and cancers where an activated Notch pathway is involved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal work have been conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines.

The D283MED cells transfected with 199b-5p (blue diamonds) show appreciable reduction in cell proliferation, as compared to the control, empty vector, transfection (green triangles). ONS76 cells show a higher proliferation rate that is nonetheless affected by the 199b-5p transfectant (compare orange crosses of empty vector transfection to purple squares). The data shown are means&#x000b1;SD from two independent experiments, each carried out in triplicate G) Silencing of endogenous expression of miR-199b-5p via transfection of a 2-O-methyl oligoribonucleotide antisense (2-OM-a) leads to an increase in Daoy cells proliferation, probably relieving the control of endogenous miR-199b-5p on HES1 3&#x02032;UTR.

The Daoy stable clone with the empty vector (Ctl) and the Daoy stable clone over-expressing miR-199b-5p (199b) were transfected with a luciferase expression vector (Luc), generating, respectively, the Ctl-Luc#4 clone, and the199bLuc-1 and 199b-Luc-3 clones. These were all evaluated for their expression of bioluminescence when incubated with the enzyme substrate, luciferin. A) Light emission of serial dilutions of the cells indicated in a microplate. The bioluminescence signal was acquired by an IVIS 200 Imaging System (Xenogen Corp. Alameda, CA). B) Correlation between cell number and photon emission.
