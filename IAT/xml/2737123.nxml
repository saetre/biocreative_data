Within the embryonic nervous system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneuron dendrites are organized topographically as a myotopic map that reflects their pattern of innervation in the muscle field. Here we reveal that this fundamental organizational principle exists in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where the dendrites of leg motoneurons also generate a myotopic map. A single postembryonic neuroblast sequentially generates different leg motoneuron subtypes, starting with those innervating proximal targets and medial neuropil regions and producing progeny that innervate distal muscle targets and lateral neuropil later in the lineage. Thus the cellular distinctions in peripheral targets and central dendritic domains, which make up the myotopic map, are linked to the birth-order of these motoneurons. Our developmental analysis of dendrite growth reveals that this myotopic map is generated by targeting. We demonstrate that the medio-lateral positioning of motoneuron dendrites in the leg neuropil is controlled by the midline signalling systems Slit-Robo and Netrin-Fra. These results reveal that dendritic targeting plays a major role in the formation of myotopic maps and suggests that the coordinate spatial control of both pre- and postsynaptic elements by global neuropilar signals may be an important mechanism for establishing the specificity of synaptic connections.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>During development the axons of sensory neurons generate highly ordered &#x0201d;sensory maps&#x0201e; within the nervous system that represent specific qualities of the environment.

The precise targeting of dendrites along the mediolateral axis is controlled by the signaling molecules Slit and Netrin, which are secreted by midline cells. These proteins act as global guidance cues and exert their effects via distinct signaling pathways using receptors called Roundabout and Frazzled, respectively. Previous studies have shown that Slit also helps to position the termini of axons (sites of synaptic output), independent of their synaptic partners. We suggest that the coordinated targeting of both input and output elements of a neural system into a common space using shared global guidance cues could be a simple way of establishing the specificity of synaptic connections within neural networks.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The fidelity with which connections are made between neurons is a striking feature of nervous system design and essential for proper function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Nassi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Two very different modes of growth can generate a dendritic tree of the same basic shape: neurons can either profusely elaborate dendrites across a wide field and then selectively remove branches from inappropriate territories, or alternatively, dendrite growth can be targeted into distinct territories using guidance mechanisms similar to those found in axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Polleux1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

The neurons of lineage 15 form stereotyped projection patterns, dependent on their birth-order within the lineage. Early-born cells innervate proximal muscle targets and elaborate dendrites from medial to lateral territories, whereas late-born cells innervate more distal muscle groups within the leg and establish dendritic arborizations that are largely confined to lateral territories in the neuropil. Here we show how two subtypes, within this lineage, generate their distinct dendritic arborizations by targeting growth into specific territories using the midline signalling systems of Slit-Robo and Netrin-Fra. These data suggest that cell intrinsic blends of guidance molecules marshal the dendrites of this lineage into appropriate territories in a coordinated fashion to generate a myotopic map.

For lineage 15 motoneurons the most proximal targets are a series of body wall muscles that control the leg, including the extracoxal leg depressor (unpublished data). Axons from the remainder of lineage 15 then travel through the coxa and trochanter to the femur, where they establish connections proximally with the long tendon muscle 2, ltm2 (the pretarsal flexor), and distally with tibia reductor muscle, tirm (the accessory tibial flexor muscle) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g001">Figure 1A and 1D</xref>).

The remaining axons pass the femoral-tibial joint and innervate all muscles in the tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g001">Figure 1A and 1D</xref>). To gain insight into the central organization of this population, we visualized the projections of lineage 15 clones within the prothoracic neuromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g001">Figure 1H and 1K</xref>) of nervous systems counterstained with anti-neuroglian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). Neuroglian is a transmembrane protein that is enriched on the fasiculated primary neurites of adult-specific neurons. In the adult CNS, anti-neuroglian staining reveals a stereotyped scaffold of neurite bundles and tracts that allows us to define positions relative to the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g001">Figure 1H and 1I</xref>). Neuroblast clones of lineage 15 insert their primary neurites into the anterior region of the leg neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g001">Figure 1E and 1I</xref>) and then arborize extensively within it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g001">Figure 1E and 1H</xref>).

The induction of single-cell MARCM clones during larval life not only allowed us to reveal single cells but also enabled us to ask whether there was a sequential generation of neuronal subtypes. Focusing on the periphery first, we found that the progeny of lineage 15 innervate the proximo-distal axis of the leg in a birth-order-dependent fashion, with the first-born neurons targeting body wall muscles (unpublished data) and subsequent neurons innervating more distal targets within the leg. The neurons born following a heatshock at 48 h AH (after hatching) make synapses on ltm2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Soler1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. This cell appears to be a member of a subtype of neurons, of which &#x0223c;4 innervate this muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g001">Figure 1A, 1B, and 1D</xref>). This observation is based on comparisons of the axonal arbors of neuroblast clones versus single neuron clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>), along with data from a detailed clonal analysis (Brierley et al., unpublished). The neurons generated by heatshocks at 72 h AH innervate tirm in the distal femur; this neuron is also likely to be a member of a pool of &#x0223c;4 neurons (unpublished data). The remaining neurons within lineage 15 innervate the distal most leg segment containing muscles, the tibia. The cell induced at 96 h AH is a member group of &#x0223c;3 neurons that innervates the tarsal depressor muscle of the tibia (tadm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g001">Figure 1A, 1C, and 1D</xref>). The observation of multiple isomorphic neurons innervating muscles in the leg is supported by a recent independent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Baek1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and consistent with data from larger insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Sasaki1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Single-cell clones allowed us to visualize the dendritic projections of lineage 15 neurons with unprecedented detail. The arborizations of the first-born neurons in this lineage, labelled by heatshocks of newly hatched larvae, cover much of the leg neuropil with branches extending from the anterior medial territories (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) through to the lateral edge (unpublished data). The neurons generated from a 48 h AH heatshock also span a large part of the leg neuropil running from medial territories to the lateral edge, with the majority of dendrites in an intermediate position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g001">Figure 1F and 1H</xref>). The cells generated following a heatshock at 72 h AH span the intermediate and lateral territory but do not send branches to the midline (unpublished data). Contrasting with earlier born cells, neurons generated at 96 h AH have dendrites that are located in lateral neuropil, with some branches in the intermediate territory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g001">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>We focused our studies on the neurons generated by heatshocks 48 h and 96 h AH as these are representative of two subtypes of leg motoneurons that cover clearly distinct territories within the map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). A more detailed description of our studies of the developmental origins and architecture of leg motoneurons will be published elsewhere (Brierley et al., in prep). We used a plot profile tool to perform quantitative analysis on the dendrites of single-cell clones. The distances along the medio-lateral (<italic>x</italic>) axis were first scaled from the interval 0 (midline) to 100 (lateral edge), and then weighted means were computed (using average pixel intensity as weights). These weighted means (i.e., centres of mass) were then used to compute statistical significance between profiles. We also computed the location of the mean 33<sup>rd</sup> percentile pixel intensity, which was chosen as a proxy for the spread and asymmetry of the intensity profiles. Each histogram presents the accumulated data of 16 neurons (two groups of eight) and is divided into medial (M), intermediate (I), and lateral (L) neuropil territories. Analysis of 48 h AH and 96 h AH single-cell clones show how these neurons distribute their dendritic processes in a stereotyped manner across the medio-lateral axis of the leg neuropil. The mean centre of arbor mass is significantly different between the two groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.00003), and the 33<sup>rd</sup> percentile of the 48 h AH neurons is closer to the midline than the 96 h AH neurons (51&#x00025; versus 64&#x00025;).</p><p>These data revealed to us the existence of a birth-order-dependent organization of projection patterns generated by lineage 15. We have found four subtypes within this lineage based on the morphology of the dendritic arborizations and the target areas they innervate. Early-born cells innervate proximal muscle targets and elaborate dendrites from medial to lateral territories, whereas late-born cells innervate distal muscle groups within the leg and position dendrites in the lateral neuropil. Cells born between these two extremes generate dendrites that occupy intermediate positions. Taken together these data show that lineage 15 generates a myotopic map in the medio-lateral axis of the leg neuropil by birth-order-based developmental mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>An Adult Myotopic Map Is Built by Dendritic Targeting</title><p>To gain insight into the developmental mechanisms that control the formation of myotopic maps, we looked at the way that the 48 and 96 h AH subtypes establish their dendritic arborizations. Two quite different modes of dendritic elaboration could be envisaged: dendrites could grow exuberantly initially and then eliminate branches from inappropriate territories; alternatively, they could restrict their growth to within appropriate target territories throughout their development.

At 30 h APF the two neurons begin to show differences in their coverage of the neuropil, with the 48 h AH neuron generating filopodia and small branches that extend into the intermediate territory, and large numbers of filopodia and small branches appear at sites where the anterior and posterior branches will form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

We wanted to establish what molecules could control subtype-specific programs of dendritogenesis and patterning in relation to the midline. Previous work has demonstrated the role of Slit-Robo signalling in the positioning of <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory axon terminals into distinct medio-lateral domains of the embryonic ventral nerve cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Zlatic1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Slit-Robo mediated repulsion is balanced by Netrins. The Netrins are evolutionary conserved molecules, released from midline, and act as attractants when signalling through the Frazzled(Fra)/DCC receptor, also enriched on growth cones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Kolodzieji1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

A role for these signalling systems in positioning dendrites into discrete territories to generate a neural map has not been described before.</p><p>We first established that these signalling molecules are indeed present in the leg neuropil when leg motoneuron dendritogenesis takes place. Antibodies against Slit and Robo were used to determine the localization of these proteins during the pupal to adult transition. Robust expression of Slit was detected in the midline cells of each thoracic neuromere using detergent-based immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We also visualized extracellular Slit using a detergent-free immunohistochemical method, where only secreted Slit should be revealed. In this case we not only found staining at the midline but also observed low levels of Slit throughout the neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). To confirm that the staining in the neuropil was genuine, we reduced the levels of Slit in the developing CNS by expressing RNAi against Slit from the beginning of the third instar. We then stained using the detergent-free immunohistochemical method and found a robust loss of immunoreactivity at the midline and in the neuropil, indicating that the staining observed in the wild-type condition was bona fide extracellular Slit protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Staining with an antibody against Robo revealed the receptor to be present throughout the whole leg neuropil, with an absence of staining at the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). To visualize Netrin we used a myc-tagged allele of NetrinB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Brankatschk1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and saw staining in midline cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Although the Robo antibody data clearly revealed robust staining in the neuropil, we wanted to establish whether Robo could be localized to the dendrites of leg motoneurons. To do this we expressed a myc-tagged version of Robo in a single-cell clone induced at 96 h AH. Anti-myc staining revealed the localization of the Robo fusion protein in the dendrites of this cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Similarly, when we used a myc-tagged version of Frazzled, we also found it in dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). Taken together these data reveal that a number of the components required for midline signalling are present in the leg neuropil at the time when motoneurons are undergoing dendritogenesis and could potentially play a role in targeting dendrites into the appropriate territories during map formation.</p><fig id="pbio-1000199-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000199.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Localization of midline signalling molecules in the thoracic nervous system during the pupal-adult transition.</title><p>(A) Detergent based antibody staining against Slit shows expression in midline cells at 48 h APF.

Using this tool we were able to knock down Slit protein (Slit-GAL4&#x0003e;UAS Slit RNAi) and simultaneously visualize the dendrites of the motoneuron labelled by VGN9281-GAL4. We found that when we removed Slit, the dendrites of the motoneuron shifted into intermediate and medial neuropil territories with several branches projecting to and terminating at the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). As a control we expressed UAS-Slit RNAi in VGN9281-GAL4 alone and found the distribution of the dendrites the same as wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio-1000199-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000199.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Slit and Netrin are required for motoneuron dendritic targeting.</title><p>(A) VGN9281-GAL4 expressing CD8::GFP.

Firstly, we expressed NetrinB in the midline cells and found the dendrites of the motoneuron labelled by VGN9281-GAL4 had a wild-type distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). We were able to remove both NetrinA and NetrinB using the mutant NetAB&#x00394; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Brankatschk1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> as a small number of NetAB&#x00394; males eclose (Alex Mauss pers comm.). We found that the loss of both Netrins did not affect the placement of dendrites within the medio-lateral axis compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g006">Figure 6A and 6E</xref>). This result appears consistent with the earlier observation of the loss of the Netrin receptor Fra on the late-born cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g005">Figure 5E and 5H</xref>). We next wanted to establish whether the dendrites of cells that project to the midline were disrupted in the NetAB&#x00394; mutant. To do this we used E49-GAL4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Gordon1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, which appears to label most motoneurons in the prothoracic neuromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g006">Figure 6F and 6F</xref>'), including the subtype that innervates the pretarsal muscles, whose dendrites project to and across the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g006">Figure 6F</xref>'). We found that these distinctive midline-projecting dendrites were missing in the NetAB&#x00394; male escapers, as well as more medially projecting dendrites in the anterior regions of the neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g006">Figure 6G and 6G</xref>'). It would therefore appear that Slit is important for the correct targeting of the dendrites of late-born motoneurons within lineage 15, whereas the levels of Netrin are important for targeting medially projecting dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s2c5"><title>e) The role of Slit-Robo signaling in dendritic growth and complexity</title><p>When we removed Robo or ectopically expressed Comm, the arborizations of leg motoneurons appeared larger and more complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g004">Figure 4F and, 4H</xref>). We wanted to know whether this increase in size could be the reason why we observed a shift in dendrite distribution along the medio-lateral axis, i.e., that an increase in growth (i.e., dendrite mass) causes dendrites to &#x0201c;spill over&#x0201d; into medial territories. This is quite a different scenario to one where dendrites remain the same mass but occupy a different spatial coordinates due to a change of guidance cue signalling.</p><p>To test this idea we next set out to establish if an induced increase in dendrite mass alone would result in dendrites &#x0201c;spilling over&#x0201d; into medial territories. We predicted that the cell autonomous activation of the insulin signalling pathway would allow us to change the global size of the cell whilst leaving other features of the environment the same. To do this we expressed the active subunit of PI3-Kinase, Dp110, which is sufficient to enlarge many different cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Britton1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. To first determine how Dp110 changes neuronal morphology, we expressed it in the class IV dendritic arborizing sensory neuron ddaC, as the dendrites of these cells have a nearly two-dimensional organization, making them very amenable to morphometric analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Williams1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Using Volocity Acquisition software (version 4.2, Improvision), we imported raw data stacks and reconstructed 3D projections of the cell bodies of ddaC neurons from both control and experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). We then used the lasso tool to capture the cell body and subsequently measure the volume and found that control ddaC neurons had a mean soma volume of 2760.9&#x000b1;149.9 &#x000b5;m<sup>3</sup> whereas the mean soma volume in the Dp110 group was 5702.2&#x000b1;142.3 &#x000b5;m<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).

The number of intersections between dendritic processes and Sholl-rings were counted in Photoshop using a template of 12 concentric circles (each 22 &#x000b5;m apart) centred on the cell body. We found the Dp110 expressing neurons distributed their branches in much the same manner as wild-type neurons, but had a two-fold increase in branch number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g007">Figure 7A, 7B, and 7D</xref>).

We performed quantitative analysis using the plot profile tool to establish if the increase in dendrite mass had changed the medio-lateral distribution of dendrites. This comparison revealed a few Dp110 expressing neurons increased the quantity of dendrites in the intermediate territory, but overall there is no major shift to the midline and no statistical difference in the mean centre of arbor mass between groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.93; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g007">Figure 7I</xref>).

In summary these data suggest that increasing the mass of the dendrites alone did not result in significant medial shifts of motoneuron dendrites.</p><p>We wondered whether the apparent increase in dendrite complexity seen in the RoboLOF and CommGOF 96 h AH clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g004">Figure 4F and 4H</xref>) could be due to a redistribution of the dendrites in another axis. To address this we projected our datasets through 90 degrees and looked at the distribution of dendrites in a dorso-ventral plane. We found that wild-type clones cover a large area of the dorso-ventral axis of the leg neuropil with a bias towards the anterior region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g007">Figure 7K</xref>). The RoboLOF clones showed a shift towards the posterior neuropil and a slight loss in the ventral neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g007">Figure 7L</xref>). The CommGOF clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g007">Figure 7M</xref>) showed a redistribution of dendrites into posterior and very dorsal neuropil, whilst arbor was entirely lost from ventral domains (also seen in FraGOF 96 h AH neurons, unpublished data). In contrast the Dp110 expressing neurons were more complex but covered much the same territory as wild-type clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g007">Figure 7N</xref>). In summary changes in the distribution of the dendrites of 96 h AH neurons along the medio-lateral axis correlate with changes in distribution along the dorso-ventral axis of the neuropil.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Neural maps are emergent, highly ordered structures that are essential for organizing and presenting synaptic information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Kaas1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Schreiner1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

Perhaps the most striking feature of this lineage is its birth-order-based pattern of innervation along the proximo-distal axis of the leg. Using mosaic analysis we observed the sequential production of four neuronal subtypes during larval life, each elaborating stereotyped axonal and dendritic projections in the adult. The axon of the first-born neuron innervates a muscle in the body wall and subsequent neurons innervate more distal targets in the leg.

The myotopic map we see in the leg neuropil could be generated by two distinctly different mechanisms. Neurons could elaborate their dendrites profusely across a wide field and then remove branches from inappropriate regions or, alternatively, they could target the growth of dendrites into a distinct region of neuropil throughout development. Both mechanisms can generate cell-type-specific projection patterns as seen in the vertebrate retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Daan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Mumm1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Nevin1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. To reveal which mechanism is deployed in the leg motor system of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we imaged single-cell clones of motoneuron subtypes generated by heatshocks at 48 and 96 h AH, as their final dendritic arborizations cover clearly distinct territories within the map. The dendrites of both elaborate branches only in territories where the mature arborizations eventually reside, which strongly supports the notion that this myotopic map is generated by targeting and not large-scale branch elimination. Importantly, this developmental timeline also revealed that the motoneurons elaborate their dendrites synchronously, regardless of the birth date of the cell. This observation suggests that a &#x0201c;space-filling/occupancy based&#x0201d; model, where later-born neurons are excluded from medial territories by competitive interactions is unlikely. Similarly, heterochronic mechanisms where different members of the lineage experience different signalling landscapes due to differences in the timing of outgrowth are not likely either. With synchronous outgrowth dendrites experience the same set of extracellular signals, suggesting that the intrinsic properties of cells, defined by their birth order, may be more important for the generation of subtype-specific projections. Such intrinsic properties could include cell-cell recognition systems such as adhesion molecules, e.g., Dscams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Millard1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> or classical guidance receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-TessierLavigne1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Kim1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, that could interpret extracellular signals.

The medio-lateral organization of leg motoneuron dendrites within the leg neuropil prompted us to ask whether the midline signalling molecules Slit and Netrin and their respective receptors Roundabout and Frazzled could be involved in targeting growth to specific territories.</p><p>Using mosaic analysis we found that both the 48 and 96 h AH motoneuron subtypes require Robo to generate their appropriate shape and position within the medio-lateral axis. When we removed Robo from the 48 h AH subtype the mean centre of arbor mass was shifted toward the midline. The dendrites of 96 h AH neurons showed a shift in distribution in the absence of Robo but still failed to reach the midline, suggesting that only part of this cell's targeting is due to repulsive cues mediated by the Robo receptor. We predicted that if Robo levels played an instructive role in dendrite targeting we would be able to shift dendrites laterally by cell autonomously increasing Robo. We found this to be the case in both subtypes. Taken together these data suggest that differences in the level of Robo signalling may provide a mechanism by which Slit could be differentially interpreted to allow subtype-specific targeting along the medio-lateral axis.</p><p>The Robo receptor is part of a larger family of receptors that includes Robo2 and Robo3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Simpson1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Rajagopalan1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

We cell autonomously expressed Comm in both lineage 15 subtypes and found shifts to the midline in both 48 and 96 h AH neurons. For the 48 h AH neurons, Robo LOF data and CommGOF data are comparable, suggesting that Robo alone plays a major role in the positioning dendrites of these cells. In contrast, in the 96 h AH subtype we found RoboLOF and CommGOF effects to be significantly different, suggesting that the 96 h AH subtype may not only use the Robo receptor but additional Robos as well. Our knockdown of Slit also supports this idea, as we occasionally find the branches of late-born neurons reaching the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), something we never see in RoboLOF clones. Thus, one way of establishing differences in the medio-lateral position could be through a dendritic &#x0201c;Robo code&#x0201d; where early-born cells express Robo and late-born cell express multiple Robo receptors.</p><p>With Netrin being expressed in the midline cells during the pupal-adult transition we wondered whether attractive Netrin-Fra signalling could also contribute to positioning dendrites in the leg neuropil. When Fra was removed from the 48 h AH subtype we found that the arborization was shifted laterally, whereas removing it from the 96 h AH subtype had little effect, neither did the removal of Netrin A and B from the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000199-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that Netrin-Fra signalling may not play a role in dendritic targeting in the later-born cell. It may be that Fra is expressed in early-born cells within the lineage and then down-regulated, although we cannot exclude that Netrin-Fra signalling masked by the repulsion from Slit-Robo signalling. These data are consistent with Fra being a major player in targeting the dendrites of the 48 h AH cell. The fact that both Fra and Robo are required for normal morphogenesis of 48 h AH neurons raises the possibility that members of lineage 15 could use a &#x0201c;push&#x02013;pull&#x0201d; mechanism for positioning their dendrites, where the blend of receptors within a cell dictates the territory within the map that they will innervate.</p><p>How could such subtype-specific blends of receptors be established?

It is possible that the temporal transcription factors Broad and Chinmo could control the subtype-specific expression of different Robo receptors or the Netrin receptor Frazzled in leg motoneurons. There is a precedent for this in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, where motoneuron axon guidance decisions to distal (dorsal) versus proximal (ventral) targets are orchestrated by Even-Skipped, a homeobox transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Landgraf3">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, which in turn controls the expression of distinct Netrin receptor combinations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Labrador1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Studies focusing on the growth of olfactory projection neuron dendrites in <italic>Drosophila</italic> reveal that they elaborate a glomerular protomap prior to the arrival of olfactory receptor neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Jefferis2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting that target/partner-derived factors may not be necessary for establishing coarse patterning of synaptic specificity. The global nature of the signals we describe here and their origin in a third-party tissue is a fundamentally different situation to that where target-derived factors instruct partner cells, such as presynaptic amacrine cells signalling to retinal ganglion cell dendrites in the zebrafish retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Mumm1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, although we show that Slit and Netrin control the positioning of dendrites across the medio-lateral axis of the CNS in this study, it may be that other similar guidance signals are important for patterning dendrites in other axes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Zlatic2">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. There is a striking conservation of the molecular mechanisms that build myotopic maps in the embryo and pupae &#x0005b;see article by Mauss et al.&#x0005d;. Understanding the similarities and differences between these myotopic maps, from an anatomical, developmental, and functional perspective, may give us insight into the evolution of motor systems and neural networks in general.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>The Role of Slit-Robo Signalling in Dendrite Growth and Complexity</title><p>In our study we found that individual leg motoneurons that lacked Robo signalling appeared to have more complex dendritic arborizations. Our working hypothesis, that dendrites invaded medial territories because of a failure of Slit-Robo guidance function, did not take into account the possibility that cells may generate more dendrites due to a change in a cell-intrinsic growth program. Thus the changes we see in dendrite distribution relative to the midline could formally be a result of &#x0201c;spill-over&#x0201d; from that increase in cell size/mass. To determine whether this was the case we generated larger cells by activating the insulin pathway in single motoneurons. We found the dendrites of these &#x0201c;large cells&#x0201d; remained within their normal neuropil territory, supporting the idea that the removal of Robo-Slit signalling results in a disruption in guidance, not growth. These data underline the fundamental importance of midline signals in controlling the spatial coordinates that these motoneuron dendrites occupy, i.e., that a neuron twice the size/mass of a wild-type cell is still marshalled into the same volume of neuropil.</p><p>When we reconstructed our image stacks to look at the distribution of the dendrites in the dorso-ventral axis, we found that the apparent increase in size was in fact a redistribution of the dendrites from ventral territories into more dorsal medial domains. This was unexpected and suggests that changes in midline signalling can also impact the organization of dendrites in the dorso-ventral axis. So CommGOF 96 h AH neurons may not only encounter novel synaptic inputs by projecting into medial territories, but they may also lose inputs from the ventral domains of neuropil they have vacated. Our observations suggest that motoneurons within lineage 15 have a fixed quota of dendrites and where it is distributed in space depends on cell-intrinsic blends of guidance receptors. Taken together these data support the idea that growth and guidance mechanisms are genetically separable programs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Parrish2">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Ou1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. In identified embryonic motoneurons where Slit-Robo and Netrin-Fra signalling has been disrupted, quantitative analysis reveals dendrites also show no measurable difference in their total number of branch tips or length &#x0005b;see accompanying article Mauss et al.&#x0005d;. Moreover, recent computational studies in larger flies reveal that dendritic arborizations generated by the same branching programs can generate very different shapes depending on how their &#x0201c;dendritic span&#x0201d; restricted within the neuropil <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Cuntz1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>.

This could be interpreted to mean that connectivity is promiscuous and that the major requirement for the generation of synaptic specificity is the proximity of axons and dendrites. This is particularly interesting in light of our dendrite targeting data and the observation that both sensory neurons and interneurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> use the same midline cues to position their pre-synaptic terminals in the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Zlatic1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Godenschwege1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Taken together these observations suggest that during development the coordinated targeting of both pre- and postsynaptic elements into the same space using global, third-party guidance signals could provide a simple way of establishing the specificity of synaptic connections within neural networks. This idea is akin to &#x0201c;meeting places&#x0201d; such as the traditional rendezvous underneath the four-sided clock at Waterloo railway station where two interested parties organize to meet. Understanding how morphogenetic programs contribute to the generation of synaptic specificity is likely to be key to solving the problem of neural network formation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly Stocks</title><p>The following stocks were used for this study:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Oregon-R</p></list-item><list-item><p>OK371-GAL4, UAS-mCD8::GFP,FRT<sup>42B</sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>hsFLP, UAS-mCD8::GFP; tubGAL80, FRT<sup>42B</sup>/CyO</p></list-item><list-item><p>OK371-GAL4, UAS-mCD8::GFP, FRT<sup>42B</sup>, robo<sup>GA2875</sup>/CyO;&#x0002b;/TM6B</p></list-item><list-item><p>OK371-GAL4, UAS-mCD8::GFP, FRT<sup>42B</sup>, robo<sup>ZI772</sup>/CyO;&#x0002b;/TM6B</p></list-item><list-item><p>OK371-GAL4, UAS-mCD8::GFP, FRT<sup>42B</sup>, fra<sup>3</sup>/CyO;&#x0002b;/TM6B</p></list-item><list-item><p>OK371-GAL4, UAS-mCD8::GFP, FRT<sup>42B</sup>, fra<sup>4</sup>/CyO;&#x0002b;/TM6B</p></list-item><list-item><p>NetrinB-myc</p></list-item><list-item><p>FM7iGFP/FRT<sup>19A</sup>;Bc/CyO</p></list-item><list-item><p>FM7iGFP/FRT<sup>19A</sup>;&#x0002b;;TM3,sb/TM6B</p></list-item><list-item><p>hsFLP<sup>122</sup>,tub-PGAL80,FRT<sup>19A</sup>/FM7iGFP;OK371-GAL4,UAS-mCD8::GFP/Cyo</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sco/CyO,wglacZ;UAS-Robo::myc</p></list-item><list-item><p>UAS-HA::Robo/TM3,UbxlacZ</p></list-item><list-item><p>UAS-Fra::myc/CyO;sb/TM2</p></list-item><list-item><p>UAS-Comm::GFP</p></list-item><list-item><p>FRT<sup>19A</sup>;&#x0002b;;C161-GAL4, UAS-mCD8::GFP/TM6B</p></list-item><list-item><p>ppk-GAL4,UAS-mCD8::GFP/CyO</p></list-item><list-item><p>hsFLP;UAS-DP110</p></list-item><list-item><p>Slit-GAL4,UAS-mCD8GFP/Cyo</p></list-item><list-item><p>Slit-GAL4</p></list-item><list-item><p>UAS-mCD8GFP;;VGN9281-GAL4</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>UAS-Slit RNAi (VDRC Trans ID 20210)</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Dietzl1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>E49-GAL4</p></list-item><list-item><p>NetrinAB&#x00394;</p></list-item><list-item><p>UAS-NetrinB</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generation of MARCM Clones</title><p>The MARCM system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Lee1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> was used to fractionate the GAL4 enhancer trap line OK371, which strongly labels excitatory motoneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000199-Mahr1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.
