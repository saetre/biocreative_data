A regulatory element, E&#x003bc;, lying just downstream of the J segments, was initially discovered as a transcriptional enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), but E&#x003bc; deletion studies subsequently demonstrated that it was essential for promoting efficient VDJ recombination as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). A model emerged in which E&#x003bc; promoted heavy chain variable region (V<sub>H</sub>) gene assembly and then served to enhance transcription of the newly formed IgH gene.</p><p>Although recombination can theoretically occur on either or both <italic>Igh</italic> alleles, only one allele is expressed in individual B cells, a phenomenon which is termed &#x0201c;allelic exclusion&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Allelic exclusion insures that individual B lymphocytes express antigen receptors (Ig) of a single antigen specificity, which is a fundamental requirement of the clonal selection theory put forth by MacFarlane Burnet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) over 50 yr ago.</p><p>Several models have been proposed to explain allelic exclusion. In all models, it is assumed that VDJ recombination occurs at a low frequency and that two-thirds of such rearrangements result in a nontranslatable reading frame (nonfunctional rearrangement). Although these assumptions predict that cells with functional rearrangements on both alleles will be rare, they do not explain their almost complete absence from the normal B lymphocyte repertoire. Models to explain the absence of such cells fall into two general groups: those that invoke selective processes acting at the level of the cell and those that invoke feedback mechanisms affecting VDJ recombination itself. An early model in the former group proposed that expression of &#x003bc; chains derived from both <italic>Igh</italic> loci would lead to toxic heavy chain levels resulting in cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Gene targeting experiments in which both <italic>Igh</italic> loci were modified to carry preassembled V<sub>H</sub> genes contradicted this model; in almost all B cells of these animals, both <italic>Igh</italic> alleles were expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>Studies of transformed precursor B cells and of Ig&#x003bc; transgenic mice supported an alternate regulated model of V-DJ recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). In this regulated model, it was proposed that &#x003bc; chain expression from a productive <italic>Igh</italic> allele prevents V-DJ recombination on the other, precluding development of allelically included B lineage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). In Ig&#x003bc; transgenic mice, DJ assembly is common on the endogenous <italic>Igh</italic> loci of mature B cells, but full VDJ assembly is rare, suggesting that early expression of the Ig&#x003bc; transgene suppresses the second step (V-DJ recombination) in V<sub>H</sub> gene assembly within the endogenous loci. Although allelic exclusion is rarely perfect in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), it has been thought that this results from the variable levels and/or timing of transgene expression as compared with IgH genes lying in their natural position within the <italic>Igh</italic> locus. Consistent with the &#x0201c;level&#x0201d; hypothesis, doubling a multicopy Ig transgene by mating led to both higher transgene expression levels and greater allelic exclusion than when the same transgene multimer was left hemizygous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Allelic exclusion appeared virtually complete when a preassembled variable region gene was inserted into one allele of the natural <italic>Igh</italic> locus by gene targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>The &#x003bc; heavy chain encoded by a newly formed Ig&#x003bc; gene assembles with surrogate light chain (composed of VpreB1/2 and &#x003bb;5) and with the signaling molecules Ig&#x003b1; and Ig&#x003b2; to form a pre-B cell receptor (BCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>; for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). It is through components of the preBCR that developing B cells sense successful assembly of an Ig&#x003bc; gene on one allele and signal arrest of any further assembly on the other allele (for review see references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Even within the context of this feedback regulation, however, there would be opportunity for cells to arise with two functional Ig&#x003bc; alleles, if gene assembly and Ig&#x003bc;-mediated signaling were sufficiently separated in time.</p><p>In the present study, we provide evidence that a breach of allelic exclusion occurs quite regularly at the level of V<sub>H</sub> gene assembly in developing B cells but, under normal circumstances, this results in few, if any, detectable double producers. When the first allele to assemble a V<sub>H</sub> gene lacks E&#x003bc;, however, there is a dramatic increase in double producers both within the BM and among peripheral B cells. This striking effect is not the result of a failure to inhibit V<sub>H</sub> assembly on the second chromosome; rather, the change takes place at the pre-B to immature B cell transition. One of E&#x003bc;'s functions, subsequent to VDJ recombination, is to facilitate the survival of newly generated B cells expressing a single <italic>Igh</italic> allele. In its absence, a second checkpoint for allelic exclusion is breached.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Generating a mouse strain that carries an E&#x003bc;-deficient V<sub>H</sub>-assembled Igh<sup>a</sup> allele</title><p>Because VDJ recombination is rare on an allele lacking E&#x003bc;, B cell development is dramatically impaired in mice homozygous for this deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). This has made it difficult to assess E&#x003bc;'s functions subsequent to V<sub>H</sub> gene assembly, particularly because it is possible that special circumstances (e.g., compensatory mutations) are required to generate the assembled IgH genes found in such animals. To circumvent this problem and also to study the behavior of an E&#x003bc;-deficient allele in competition with a WT one, we generated mice bearing an <italic>Igh</italic> allele that lacked E&#x003bc; but included a fully assembled V<sub>H</sub> upstream of the constant region (C<sub>H</sub>) gene cluster. Both core E&#x003bc; and flanking matrix attachment regions were deleted, each of which has been shown necessary for the expression of Ig&#x003bc; transgenes in developing B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).</p><p>A 3.7-kb region (including the most proximal D<sub>H</sub> gene segment, DQ52, all the J<sub>H</sub> gene segments, and E&#x003bc;) was replaced with a loxP-flanked neomycin resistance gene (neo<sup>R</sup>) and a fully assembled V<sub>H</sub> gene (neo<sup>R</sup>V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, gene targeting strategy).

The total number of B lineage cells in the BM of these homozygous mutant mouse lines was reduced with respect to WT (&#x02265;50% WT; Table S1) but was the same for the two mutant lines, indicating that the difference from WT was a function of the V<sub>H</sub> gene knockin by itself and was not affected by the presence/absence of E&#x003bc;. We conclude that an assembled IgH gene can be expressed in an E&#x003bc;-independent manner early in B cell development, allowing for the normal developmental progression of B lineage cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Allelic exclusion is dramatically compromised in the absence of E&#x003bc;</title><p>It was shown previously that B cells in mice heterozygous for the V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup> (knockin) allele expressed only that allele, displaying what appeared to be perfect allelic exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Because Ig&#x003bc; from the E&#x003bc;-deficient V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup> allele could drive normal B cell development in homozygotes, we expected that B cells from mice heterozygous for this locus (V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice) would similarly express only the V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup> allele and not the alternate WT<sup>b</sup> allele.</p><p>As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, IgM-positive BM cells from WT<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice expressed either IgM<sup>a</sup> or IgM<sup>b</sup> but not both.

Semiquantitative PCR was used to quantify VDJ rearrangements on the WT<sup>b</sup> allele of IgM<sup>a&#x0002b;b&#x02212;</sup> splenic B cells (single producers) using V<sub>H</sub> family primers and the <italic>WT Igh</italic>-specific primer described earlier.

Pre-B cells comprise the pool that has just ceased IgH rearrangement and is beginning the process of Ig light chain gene assembly. Semiquantitative PCR assays of DNA from these cells showed that this pool had undergone D-J joining on the WT<sup>b</sup> allele at the same frequency as pre-B cells from normal WT<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref>). V-DJ joins were also evident on the WT<sup>b</sup> alleles of pre-B cells from both V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> and V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice.

The reduction, relative to WT mice, was greater for the more distal V<sub>H</sub>J558 family than for the more proximal V<sub>H</sub>7183 family. We conclude that the V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup> and V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup> alleles were inhibiting, but not entirely prohibiting, V-DJ recombination on the allelic chromosome, and the feedback inhibition was largely, if not entirely, E&#x003bc; independent.

Assuming that some of these rearrangements were productive (confirmed by cloning as described in the next paragraph), both populations of pre-B cells included precursors to double-producing cells.</p></sec><sec><title>An E&#x003bc;-dependent checkpoint for allelic exclusion at the pre-B to immature B cell transition</title><p>Because the phenotypic outcome of gene assembly on the WT<sup>b</sup> allele was so dramatically different in the V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> and V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice (double producers evident in the immature and mature B cells of the former but not the latter mouse strain), we asked whether the V<sub>H</sub> gene rearrangements in the pre-B cells of these two mouse lines differed in some fundamental way. Pre-B cells were harvested from mice of both genotypes, their DNA was isolated, and assembled V<sub>H</sub> genes from the WT<sup>b</sup> allele were cloned and sequenced. 15/36 unique V<sub>H</sub>7183-DJ rearrangements cloned from pre-B cells of the V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> genotype were both in frame and lacked a stop codon (productive rearrangements), as were 12/36 unique V<sub>H</sub>7183-DJ rearrangements cloned from V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> pre-B cells. Closer examination of these productive rearrangements showed no fundamental differences among them in the D<sub>H</sub> segments used, the 7183 V<sub>H</sub> family members used, or the overall size of the junctions (Table S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081202/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081202/DC1</ext-link>). N nucleotides were found in the V-D junctions in &#x0003e;70% of the sequences, and 40% of these had three or more N nucleotides at this junction (mean length, 3.5 nt in V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice and 4.3 nt in V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice). Notably, this contrasts with light chain genes where N nucleotides are much more rare (&#x0223c;10% of cells) and are found in much lower numbers/junction (generally 1 or 2 nt/junction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). We conclude that the precursors to double producers can be found in BM from both V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> and V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice and that V<sub>H</sub> assembly on the WT<sup>b</sup> allele has likely occurred before the pre-B cell stage (see Discussion).</p><p>In an attempt to understand the mechanism through which E&#x003bc; might influence the development and selection of precursor B cells, we compared levels of &#x003bc; mRNA generated from the V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup> and V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup> alleles in pre-B cells.

In both of the resulting strains, B cell development was arrested at the pre-B cell stage because Ig light chain gene assembly was blocked. Age-matched mice of each genotype were killed and B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> BM cells isolated (see Materials and methods). As expected, no IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were present in these BM cells, and the bulk of cells were smaller and expressed lower levels of CD43 than comparable cells from WT<sup>b/</sup>WT<sup>b</sup> Rag1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> littermates, which is consistent with their having progressed to the pre-B cell stage (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>).

We also examined hemizygous V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/&#x00394;J<sub>H</sub> mice (the &#x00394;J<sub>H</sub> allele lacks all J<sub>H</sub> gene segments, prohibiting V<sub>H</sub> assembly on this allele) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). The hypothesis was that both the V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> and V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/&#x00394;J<sub>H</sub> mice would have increased numbers of Ig&#x003bb;-expressing B cells because most of the B cells of the former and all B cells of the latter would have arisen from precursors expressing only the V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup> allele. Consistent with this hypothesis, the frequency of Ig&#x003bb; producers among V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> splenic B cells was significantly higher than that in V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice (mean of 16 vs. 10%; P &#x0003d; 0.01; Ig&#x003bb; expressers were higher in both knockin strains relative to WT, presumably because of constraints imposed by predominant expression of a single structure heavy chain; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>).

In V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup> mice, biallelic expression of the V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup> allele would be expected to equal expression of one allele with E&#x003bc;.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study has shown that the intronic enhancer E&#x003bc; serves a critical function even after V<sub>H</sub> gene (VDJ) assembly is complete. In mice heterozygous for an E&#x003bc;-deficient but productively rearranged IgH gene (V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup>), large numbers of IgH double-producing cells arose in peripheral tissues, breaking the rules of allelic exclusion. In contrast, a matched mouse line with the same V<sub>H</sub> knockin but with E&#x003bc; present (V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup>) lacked these double-producing cells. In both animals, there was evidence that the Ig&#x003bc; product of the assembled IgH gene was signaling a shutdown of V<sub>H</sub> assembly on the <italic>Igh</italic><sup>b</sup> allele, which is the primary mechanism postulated to ensure IgH allelic exclusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). There was no measurable difference in the efficiency of this feedback inhibition whether E&#x003bc; was present or absent.</p><p>This latter finding was unexpected. E&#x003bc; was initially discovered as a transcriptional enhancer and believed to serve as such in newly formed IgH genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). In that capacity, E&#x003bc; could dictate preBCR levels and, thereby, signaling strength in a developing B lymphocyte. Even in E&#x003bc;'s absence, however, pre-B cells were dominated by those that had undergone D-J, but not V-DJ, rearrangement on their <italic>Igh</italic><sup>b</sup> alleles, demonstrating that feedback signals inhibiting this last step in recombination were no less efficient in the absence of E&#x003bc;.</p><p>Both V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> and V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice contained rare pre-B cells with V-DJ rearrangement on their <italic>Igh</italic><sup>b</sup> alleles. Sequence analyses of these rearrangements revealed abundant N nucleotides in the V-D junction (Table S2), suggesting that they occurred in pro-B cells, the only developmental stage at which terminal transferase (TdT) is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Chromatin remodeling studies have documented that pro-B cells are the only developing B cells with contracted <italic>Igh</italic> alleles facilitating V-DJ rearrangements, especially those involving distal V<sub>H</sub> gene segments (e.g., V<sub>H</sub>J558) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). V<sub>H</sub> J558-DJ rearrangements on the <italic>Igh</italic><sup>b</sup> allele were easily detected in pre-B cells of both V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> and V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice. These results suggest that subsequent to V<sub>H</sub> gene assembly, there is sufficient delay in the assembly of, or signaling through, the preBCR to allow RAG-mediated rearrangements on the second allele in a minority of cells before transition to the pre-B cell stage.</p><p>Signaling through the preBCR is required not only to down-regulate the RAG genes (terminating V-DJ recombination) but also to promote cell proliferation and differentiation to the pre-B cell stage (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). If the reduced Ig&#x003bc; chain level in V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> pro-B cells resulted in preBCR signals that were suboptimal for promoting this transition, we might expect that precursors to double producers (expressing Ig&#x003bc; from two alleles, one with E&#x003bc; present) would be enriched in the pre-B cell population of V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice. Similarly, if expression of the V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup> were delayed relative to expression of the V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup> allele, a higher proportion of pre-B cells in V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice would carry a functionally assembled V<sub>H</sub> gene on the WT<sup>b</sup> allele, as this would be required in the absence of V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup> allele expression for transit to the pre-B cell stage. This was not the case, however; these precursors were present at the same or close to equal numbers in V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> and V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and Fig. S4). Quantitative comparisons of V-DJ assembly on the WT<sup>b</sup> allele showed no significant difference between V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> and V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> pre-B cells, and cloned V<sub>H</sub> gene sequences from the WT<sup>b</sup> allele had the same ratio of productive to nonproductive rearrangements in both pre-B cell populations. In RAG-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the bulk of B-lineage cells in both mice assumed a pre-B cell phenotype, further supporting the idea that signaling through the Ig&#x003bc; chain (preBCR) to promote the pro- to pre-B cell transition was largely unaffected by loss of E&#x003bc; and lower Ig&#x003bc; levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p>The transition from pre-B to immature B cell requires successful assembly of a functional Ig light chain gene, resulting in replacement of the preBCR with a BCR. The BCR on immature B cells serves two opposing purposes. On the one hand, it is required for survival (BCR ablation at any B cell stage tested leads to cell death), and it has been suggested that this BCR-transmitted tonic signaling is antigen independent (positive selection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). On the other hand, if the BCR signal is too strong (e.g., autoreactive BCR), the cell is induced to modify the antigen specificity of the BCR through receptor editing and, failing that, is induced to die (negative selection) (for review see references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). The nature and strength of the BCR signal in immature B cells, therefore, profoundly affects cell fate. We propose that reduced Ig&#x003bc; levels in emerging immature BM B cells of V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice result in BCR signaling that is generally below the threshold for positive selection. In these animals, the rare cells that express both <italic>Igh</italic> alleles (double producers) would have a selective advantage because the increased tonic signaling through the BCR could then reach the required threshold for survival.</p><p>If, in the absence of E&#x003bc;, BCR density is generally not optimal for effective tonic signaling, then how do the single producers in V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> animals reach the immature B cell stage? Both density and signaling strength can be affected by light chain through its effects on BCR stability (the strength of heavy/light chain association) and Ag specificity. B cells starting with a disability (low &#x003bc;-chain levels) would have more stringent light chain requirements than normal, needing either light chains that form a stronger and more stable association with the V<sub>H</sub>B1-8-&#x003bc; chain or those that form an innocuous antigen specificity with stronger basal signaling properties. Analyses of these cells were consistent with that prediction. The IgM<sup>a&#x0002b;b&#x02212;</sup> cells in V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> and V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/&#x00394;J<sub>H</sub> mice showed greater use of downstream J&#x003ba; gene segments (evidence of successive V-J rearrangements on a single Ig&#x003ba; allele) and included a larger subpopulation of Ig&#x003bb;-producing cells as compared with IgM<sup>a&#x0002b;b&#x02212;</sup> cells from V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Also consistent with this model was the finding that light chain editing was increased neither in the IgM<sup>a&#x0002b;b&#x0002b;</sup> cells from V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> animals (&#x003bc;-chain emanates from both a WT allele and the V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup> allele) nor in the B cells of V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup> mice (&#x003bc;-chain emanates from two copies of the V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup> allele).</p><p>As described in the previous paragraph, we predicted that inferior BCR signals caused by reduced Ig&#x003bc; in IgM<sup>a&#x0002b;b&#x02212;</sup> cells from both V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> and V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/&#x00394;J<sub>H</sub> mice would lead to light chain editing. Unable to sense that a light chain gene has been successfully assembled, the cell would continue to accumulate V-J rearrangements. A correlation between underexpressed BCRs and light chain editing has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Reciprocally, strong autoreactive BCR signals can also lead to light chain editing. In this case, the cell uses light chain editing to replace the light chain component of an undesirable BCR.</p><p>A corollary to this model is that in V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice, neither single producers nor double producers have a below-threshold signaling problem. Rather, in these mice, threshold signaling is achieved whether expression is monoallelic (single producers) or biallelic (double producers). Cells producing two different heavy chains at equally high levels, however, would be at greater risk of creating a receptor with unacceptable autoreactive properties, placing double-producers in V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice at a selective disadvantage (i.e., subject to clonal deletion) relative to single producers. It has been estimated that &#x0223c;75% of newly arising immature B cells harbor an autoreactive BCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). A cell producing two different heavy chains, each combining with a single unique light chain would have, on average, only a 6% chance (as compared with the usual 25%) of avoiding expression of an autoreactive BCR. Moreover, autoantibody silencing through formation of an alternate light chain (light chain editing) would be compromised in such a cell because a new light chain might solve the problem with one of the heavy chains and yet create a new autoreactive receptor with the other.</p><p>In summary, feedback inhibition of V-DJ rearrangement on the WT<sup>b</sup> allele is evident in the pre-B cells of both V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> and V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice. Despite this inhibition, V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> and V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice have equal or close to equal numbers of pre-B cells that harbor two functionally assembled <italic>Igh</italic> alleles. Potential antigen specificity for both single and double producers is exactly the same in both animals after assembly with randomly generated Ig light chains. Nevertheless, the newly arising B cells differ significantly between these two animals, with allelic exclusion compromised only in the V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice. The ultimate effect on the mature B cell pool is profound. As described and shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> (and Fig. S2), the &#x0223c;5% double producers among immature B cells in V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice expanded to comprise &#x0223c;20% of splenic B cells and &#x0223c;50% of B cells in the peritoneal cavity. We suggest that the difference in outcome in the V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> and V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice (the immature B cells arising/surviving from the precursors) is a result of selection pressures, both positive and negative, that favor double producers only in V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice. Allelic exclusion with respect to the <italic>Igh</italic> locus, therefore, can be viewed as, at minimum, a two-step process involving both a largely E&#x003bc;-independent (feedback inhibition of V-DJ recombination) and an E&#x003bc;-dependent (pre-B to immature B selection) phase. More generally, these results suggest that one of E&#x003bc;'s important functions is to ensure that monoallelic expression of most newly assembled IgH genes is sufficient to support both B cell development and entry into the mature B cell pool. Anything that reduces that expression (variants in promoter sequences, enhancer sequences, or signaling components) puts the system at risk for promoting the development of allelically included cells with potentially autoreactive properties.</p><p>Unlike cells expressing two different light chains in which one is generally expressed on the surface to the exclusion of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), the mature B cells expressing two different heavy chains in V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup>/WT<sup>b</sup> mice can be expected to express both types of receptor on the cell surface at comparable levels. It is likely of significance to issues of autoimmunity that expression of the V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup> allele is low at the time of selection but high once cells reach the mature B cell compartment. Notably, many of the IgM<sup>a&#x0002b;b&#x0002b;</sup> double producers in these animals occupy the marginal zone of spleen and constitute most, if not all, CD5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B1 B cells in the peritoneal cavity. It is not clear at this point how precursors of IgM<sup>a&#x0002b;b&#x0002b;</sup> double producers are selected into these mature B cell compartments. One possibility is that expressing the WT<sup>b</sup> allele fulfills the antigen-specificity requirements associated with B1 B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). As CD5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B1cells have been shown to require unusually strong and often autoreactive BCR signals for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>), it is also reasonable to speculate that monoallelic expression of the V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394;<sup>a</sup> allele, even with the assistance of light chain editing, is insufficient to signal development and/or maintenance of this B cell subset, leading to selective expansion of the double producers into this B cell pool.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Generating V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394; mice</title><p>To generate the B1-8VDJ&#x00394;E&#x003bc; targeting vector, K.

Genomic DNA template was isolated from sorted cells, either by conventional procedures or by the following method: cells were lysed in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mM EDTA (50 &#x003bc;l/10<sup>5</sup> cells), proteinase K was added to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and the mixture was incubated for 2.5 h at 50 and 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Serial dilutions of the purified DNA (or cell lysates) were used as a template to specifically amplify D-J and V-DJ rearrangements derived only from WT <italic>Igh</italic> alleles. Allele specificity was achieved by using a 3&#x02032; primer that derived from sequences 3&#x02032; of J<sub>H</sub>4 and that were missing on the targeted <italic>Igh</italic><sup>a</sup> allele of both V<sub>H</sub>E&#x003bc; and V<sub>H</sub>&#x00394; mice.
