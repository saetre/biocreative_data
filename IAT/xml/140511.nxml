In general, cellular IRESs require non-canonical <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors for their activity, however, very few of the proteins that act on cellular IRESs have been identified. Proteins that interact with viral IRESs have also been shown to stimulate the activity of cellular IRESs and therefore the ability of a range of known viral <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors to stimulate the Bag-1 IRES was tested. Two proteins, poly r(C) binding protein 1 (PCBP1) and polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB), were found to increase the activity of the Bag-1 IRES <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The regions of the Bag-1 IRES RNA to which they bind have been determined, and it was shown that PCBP1 binds to a short 66 nt section of RNA, whilst PTB interacts with a number of sites over a larger area. The minimum section of the RNA that still retained activity was determined and both PCBP1 and PTB interacted with this region suggesting that these proteins are essential for Bag-1 IRES function.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The human Bag-1 gene (Bcl-2 associated athanogene) encodes three major isoforms generated from a single transcript, p50, p46 and p36 (BAG-1L, BAG-1M and BAG-1S respectively) that differ at their N-termini. BAG-1L, which initiates from a non-canonical CUG codon, contains an SV40-like nuclear localisation signal (NLS) at its N-terminus, and this is thought to be responsible for the mainly nuclear distribution of this isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c1">1</xref>). The AUG-initiated isoforms, BAG-1M and BAG-1S, lack this NLS and as such are localised predominantly cytoplasmically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c2">2</xref>). The variation in the N-termini of the Bag-1 proteins also leads to different protein binding specificities and the isoforms have diverse cellular roles. Bag-1 was originally identified as RAP46 (receptor associated protein) through its interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c3">3</xref>) and has been found to associate with numerous other members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily. It was also documented as HAP46 (Hsc70&#x0002f;Hsp70 associated protein) through its interaction with the 70 kDa heat-shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c5">5</xref>) where it has a role as a co-chaperone in the protein folding response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c8">8</xref>). The murine homologue, Bag-1, was identified through its interaction with Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c9">9</xref>). Bag-1 has been shown to interact with Bcl-2 and to promote the anti-apoptotic properties of this protein, blocking a step in the apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c10">10</xref>).</p><p>It was originally suggested that the three main isoforms of Bag-1, in addition to a minor isoform, p29, are translated by leaky scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c1">1</xref>), however, expression of Bag-1 <italic>in vivo</italic> does not support this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c11">11</xref>). Recently we have demonstrated that the p36 isoform of Bag-1 can be translated by internal ribosome entry through use of an internal ribosome entry segment (IRES) in addition to the cap-dependent scanning mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c11">11</xref>). IRES elements are used to initiate translation under conditions where cap-dependent scanning is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c12">12</xref>) and our data suggest that the IRES of Bag-1 is required to maintain translation of the p36 isoform following heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c11">11</xref>).</p><p>The internal ribosome entry mechanism of translation was first identified in picornaviruses and these have been widely studied in terms of structure, mechanisms and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c13">13</xref>). Viral IRESs vary widely in their dependence on <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. For example, some viral IRESs such as the encephalomyocarditis virus are able to function well <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c15">15</xref>), in contrast, other viral IRESs such as polio virus or the human rhino virus (HRV) require the addition of extracts derived from HeLa cells to <italic>in vitro</italic> systems before they are active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c18">18</xref>). In the case of HRV, two proteins that are required have been identified, upstream of N-ras (unr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c19">19</xref>), and polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c20">20</xref>). A number of additional viral IRES binding&#x0002f;activating proteins have been identified, including the La autoantigen which is used by polio virus IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c21">21</xref>), and poly r(C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) which binds to polio virus IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c22">22</xref>) and has been shown to activate entero&#x0002f;rhino virus IRESs <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c23">23</xref>). These proteins are thought to act as RNA chaperones to either maintain or aid the RNA to form a structure that is competent for ribosome recruitment.</p><p>Recently, a large number of cellular IRESs have been identified but the mechanisms by which they initiate translation are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c12">12</xref>). The protein factor requirements for cellular IRESs are much less well defined although data produced thus far would suggest that each IRES has a requirement for a specific set of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. First, cellular IRESs show considerable cell tropism and this would suggest that levels of endogenous <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors vary between cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c26">26</xref>). Secondly, the proteins that interact with two cellular IRESs studied so far are different, thus the Apaf-1 IRES requires PTB and unr for function <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c27">27</xref>), whilst the XIAP IRES has a requirement for La (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c28">28</xref>).</p><p>In this study the protein factor requirements for efficient Bag-1 IRES activity has been investigated. We demonstrate a direct and specific interaction of PTB and poly r(C) binding protein 1 (PCBP1) with the Bag-1 IRES, which stimulates IRES function both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>The plasmids pRF and pRBF harbouring deletion segments of Bag-1 are described in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f1">1</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f2">2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f4">4</xref>A. The plasmid pSKL is based upon the vector pSK&#x0002b;bluescript (Stratagene); the Bag-1 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR) or deletions were cloned into this vector in frame with the firefly luciferase gene (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f3">3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f5">5</xref>A).

This is presumably because the expression of specific IRES <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors varies between cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c26">26</xref>). The ability of the Bag-1 IRES to function in a variety of cell lines was tested by transfecting HeLa, COS7, HEK293, MCF7, CAL51, CALU1 and CAMA1 cell lines with the dicistronic construct pRBF or the control construct pRF. The expression from both <italic>Renilla</italic> and firefly luciferase cistrons was assayed and normalised to the transfection control &#x003b2;-galactosidase. The efficiency of the IRES is represented as a ratio of firefly luciferase to <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase expression from pRBF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f1">1</xref>A). As expected, the Bag-1 IRES showed a wide range of activities in different cell types and firefly luciferase activity was found to vary considerably according to cell line (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f1">1</xref>B). The Bag-1 IRES was highly active in CAMA-1 and active in HeLa cells, COS7 and HEK293 cells, yet relatively inactive in MCF7, CAL51 and CALU1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f1">1</xref>B). The expression of the Bag-1 IRES in these cell lines differed from that observed with the c-<italic>myc</italic> IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c25">25</xref>) and the Apaf-1 IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c30">30</xref>), which would again suggest that cellular IRESs have different requirements for <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors.</p></sec><sec><title>PCBP1 and PTB bind to the Bag-1 IRES</title><p>EMSAs were performed to identify putative Bag-1 IRES <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors by using a range of known IRES interacting proteins including PCBP1 and PCBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c22">22</xref>), PTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c20">20</xref>), DAP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c32">32</xref>), La (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c28">28</xref>) and unrip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c19">19</xref>). Radiolabelled Bag-1 IRES RNA was generated from <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reactions primed with DNA derived from the monocistronic constructs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f2">2</xref>A); the resulting RNA was incubated with protein and the products separated on 0.5&#x00025; TBE agarose gels. Only when BAG-1 IRES RNA was incubated with PTB or PCBP1 was a decrease in the mobility of the RNA observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f2">2</xref>B and B.M.Pickering and A.E.Willis, unpublished data), suggesting both of these proteins bind the IRES directly. No difference in mobility of Bag-1 IRES RNA was observed with the other proteins tested, for example La (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f2">2</xref>B, i, lane b). To test the specificity of this interaction, the proteins were also incubated with a non-specific RNA segment from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) of approximately the same size. No alterations in mobility of this RNA were observed with any of the proteins tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f2">2</xref>B, iii). To confirm this interaction, UV-crosslinking analysis was performed. Thus, radiolabelled Bag-1 IRES RNA was incubated with PCBP1 and&#x0002f;or PTB, samples were exposed to UV light, any RNA not bound to protein digested with RNases and the products separated by PAGE. Both PTB and PCBP1 either singly or in combination interacted with Bag-1 IRES RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f2">2</xref>C). Crosslinking analysis was also undertaken with cell extracts made from HeLa or placenta. Thus, radiolabelled Bag-1 IRES RNA was incubated with HeLa or placental extracts, exposed to UV light and unbound RNA was digested with RNases. The products were separated by PAGE. A number of proteins that interact with the Bag-1 IRES were identified in both extracts with sizes of approximately 150, 55, 45, 37, 30 and 29 kDa in addition to some extract-specific proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f2">2</xref>D). The 55 and 37 kDa proteins are the same size as PTB and PCBP1, respectively. The other proteins remain to be identified.</p><p>To determine the specificity of the interaction between the Bag-1 IRES and these proteins, UV-crosslinking experiments were performed in the presence of excess unlabelled Bag-1 IRES RNA or G3PDH mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f2">2</xref>E). Both proteins bind specifically to the Bag-1 IRES. Hence, there was a reduction in the binding of protein to the radiolabelled transcripts with a 1-fold molar excess of unlabelled BAG-1 IRES RNA, but not with a 10-fold molar excess of G3PDH RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f2">2</xref>E, i and ii). Crosslinking analysis was also performed with La, unrip, DAP5 and PCBP2 but no protected RNA was detected (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>PCBP1 and PTB stimulate the Bag-1 IRES <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>In general, cellular IRESs work very inefficiently (if at all) <italic>in vitro</italic>, but we have shown that it is possible to stimulate certain cellular IRESs by the addition of known viral <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c27">27</xref>). The activity of the Bag-1 IRES in a dicistronic RNA (generated from pRBF and pRF; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f1">1</xref>A) was tested in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system with the addition of PCBP1 and PTB. The Bag-1 IRES functioned very inefficiently <italic>in vitro</italic> and no appreciable luciferase activity was detected over that produced from RNA derived from the vector pRF which does not contain an IRES (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f1">1</xref>A). However, activation was observed with PTB and PCBP1, when added singly, each stimulating IRES activity to 1.4-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f3">3</xref>A). Moreover, addition of PCBP1 and PTB had an additive effect in combination producing 3-fold stimulation of the IRES (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f3">3</xref>A).</p><p>To test whether these proteins could stimulate the function of the Bag-1 IRES <italic>in vivo</italic>, co-transfections were carried out using pRBF with plasmids expressing PCBP1 or PTB either singly or in combination into the cell lines which showed low Bag-1 IRES activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f1">1</xref>). Thus, transfection of CAL51 and CALU1 with either PTB or PCBP1 alone had a stimulatory effect, which was additive when the plasmids containing DNA encoding these proteins were transfected in combination (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f3">3</xref>C, i and ii). In contrast, transfection of MCF7s with PTB and&#x0002f;or PCBP1 did not significantly stimulate Bag-1 IRES activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f3">3</xref>C, iii). To test whether there was a correlation between the expression of PTB&#x0002f;PCBP1 and IRES function western analysis was performed and cell lysates were immunoblotted for PTB, PCBP1 or actin as a loading control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f3">3</xref>D). There is a good correlation between endogenous protein levels and activation of the IRES by these proteins. For example, MCF7s which are not stimulated by co-transfection with PTB and&#x0002f;or PCBP1 have comparatively high levels of these proteins. In contrast, CALU1 or CAL51 cell lines which are stimulated by these proteins have lower expression of PTB and PCBP1 than MCF7 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f2">2</xref>D).</p><p>A comprehensive deletion analysis was then performed to identify the minimal element that harboured IRES activity to determine whether PTB or PCBP1 were essential for Bag-1 IRES function.</p></sec><sec><title>The minimum active fragment of the Bag-1 IRES is 186 nt</title><p>Regions of the Bag-1 5&#x02032;-UTR DNA were obtained by PCR and subcloned into the dicistronic reporter vector pRF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f4">4</xref>A and B). Deletions were transfected into HeLa cells and cell lysates assayed for luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f4">4</xref>C). A region of 218 nt from 225 to 411 was identified as the minimal element since this region of RNA retained 100&#x00025; IRES activity. The 5&#x02032; end of this section of RNA must be critical for function of the IRES since deleting a further 25 nt at the 5&#x02032; end reduced the activity of the 258&#x02013;441 fragment to 25&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f4">4</xref>C). It is possible to delete an additional 107 nt from the 3&#x02032; end and retain 50&#x00025; of the IRES function with the 225&#x02013;358 fragment, but the removal of a further 46 nt to generate the 225&#x02013;312 fragment resulted in an inactive IRES (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f4">4</xref>C). These data would suggest that the first 225 nt are not required for an active IRES, but this section of RNA may bind other, perhaps regulatory, proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>PCBP1 and PTB bind to the minimal active fragment</title><p>EMSAs were then performed to identify the regions of Bag-1 IRES RNA that could be bound by PCBP1 and PTB. Fragments of the DNA encoding Bag-1 IRES RNA were obtained by PCR and inserted into the vector pSKL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f5">5</xref>A). Radiolabelled RNAs were generated from these plasmids by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription reactions and these were incubated with PTB or PCBP1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f5">5</xref>B, i). The minimum active fragment 225&#x02013;411 binds both PTB and PCBP1 as efficiently as the full-length RNA (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f5">5</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f2">2</xref>B). To refine the binding sites further, RNA was generated from additional deletion constructs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f5">5</xref>A) and these were used in EMSAs. Thus, incubating the 258&#x02013;358 segment of radiolabelled Bag-1 IRES RNA with increasing amounts of PCBP1 showed that PCBP1 bound directly to this region of the IRES. A decrease in mobility of the radiolabelled 292&#x02013;358 fragment was also observed and this would imply that PCBP1 binds to a 66 nt fragment. The 3&#x02032; end of this fragment is important for binding since no protein&#x02013;RNA complexes were observed with the RNA generated from either 258&#x02013;312 or 274&#x02013;312 segments of the 5&#x02032;-UTR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f5">5</xref>B, i).</p><p>Incubating increasing amounts of PTB with the 258&#x02013;358 and 292&#x02013;358 segments of RNA shows that this protein binds to these RNA segments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f5">5</xref>B, ii). Interestingly, addition of a 2-fold molar excess of PTB to RNA gave rise to a shifted band of a position that would correspond to a dimer of PTB. PTB also interacts with the 258&#x02013;312 fragment and the 274&#x02013;312 fragment, but this only occurs at a 2-fold molar excess of the protein and may be non-specific. Thus, this analysis refined the PCBP1 binding site to the 292&#x02013;312 region of the 5&#x02032;-UTR, whilst PTB appeared to bind at multiple sites along the 258&#x02013;358 region.</p><p>Thus, both proteins interact strongly with the fragment that retains 50&#x00025; of the activity (225&#x02013;358) suggesting that these are indeed <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors for the Bag-1 IRES.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>To obtain a better understanding about the function and mechanisms of action of cellular IRESs it is essential that the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that mediate internal ribosome entry are elucidated. This is a complex task since the data suggest that each cellular IRES has a distinct set of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor requirements (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c28">28</xref>). However, it would appear that some of the proteins that mediate internal ribosome entry on viral IRESs are also used by cellular IRESs. Thus, both the Apaf-1 IRES and HRV IRESs require unr and PTB for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c27">27</xref>) and the XIAP and polio virus IRESs require La for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c28">28</xref>). In order to identify some of the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that are used by the Bag-1 IRES, known viral IRES <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors were tested to determine which could interact with the Bag-1 IRES RNA. Of the seven proteins that were tested, only two, PTB and PCBP1, could bind in EMSAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f2">2</xref>B). UV-crosslinking studies showed that both PCBP1 and PTB interact directly and specifically with Bag-1 IRES RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f2">2</xref>C and D). Interestingly, these proteins would appear to work in concert since a combination of these two proteins stimulated the Bag-1 IRES 3-fold <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f3">3</xref>B). Moreover, it was possible to increase the activity of the Bag-1 IRES in the cell lines that had low Bag-1 IRES activity by co-transfection of pRBF with plasmids containing cDNAs encoding these proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f3">3</xref>C, i and ii).</p><p>PCBP1, which is a member of the KH domain family of single-stranded nucleic acid binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c33">33</xref>), was found to bind strongly to a 66 nt fragment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f5">5</xref>). The proteins in the KH domain family generally bind to cytidine-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c33">33</xref>), however, there is not a cytidine-rich stretch in the linear sequence to which PCBP1 binds. It is likely, therefore, that this protein is recognising secondary or tertiary structural motifs in the Bag-1 IRES. Computer predictions have been carried out using the mfold program, although, in the absence of experimentally derived data it is difficult to predict the structure of RNA that is being recognised. It is of interest to note that PCBP2, which has 90&#x00025; amino acid similarity to PCBP1, does not bind to Bag-1 IRES RNA (data not shown). Therefore, these proteins must recognise distinct structural motifs. In this regard, it has been shown that PCBP2, but not PCBP1, is able to restore the activity of entero&#x0002f;rhinoviruses in PCBP-depleted extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c23">23</xref>). In addition, PCBP1 and PCBP2 have been found to bind to different structural motifs of the polio virus IRES and mediate stability of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c34">34</xref>).</p><p>PTB contains four RNA recognition motifs and has been shown to interact with both cellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c35">35</xref>) and viral IRESs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c13">13</xref>). The PTB binding site on the Bag-1 IRES was less well defined than the PCBP1 site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f5">5</xref>), although it was found to bind strongly to segments of the minimal Bag-1 IRES element (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f5">5</xref>). The EMSA data would suggest that PTB is able to bind to the RNA as a dimer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f5">5</xref>B) and it is thought that PTB exists in solution as a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c36">36</xref>). The binding of PTB to viral IRESs is consistent with the notion that this protein interacts with multiple structures and brings them into the correct conformation for ribosome binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg146c13">13</xref>) and it is likely that the same is true for the Bag-1 IRES.</p><p>Both the binding sites for PCBP1 and PTB are located within the minimum element of the IRES that has full activity (from 225 to 411) and indeed both bind within the region which has 50&#x00025; activity of the full-length IRES (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg146f5">5</xref>). Since the activity of the Bag-1 IRES <italic>in vitro</italic> is enhanced by the addition of both PTB and PCBP1, and given that PTB seems to have multiple contact points on the RNA, we suggest that these proteins act as RNA chaperones and allow the Bag-1 IRES to attain the correct structure that is competent for 40S ribosomal subunit entry. To test this theory, work is being carried out to obtain a secondary structural model for the Bag-1 IRES in the presence of these proteins.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg146f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> A comparison of the efficiency of Bag-1 IRES-mediated translation in cell lines of different origin.
