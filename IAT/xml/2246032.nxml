Western Blot analysis of human tumor cells showed that VILIP-1 expression was undetectable in several types of human tumor cells, including 11 out of 12 non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines. The down-regulation of VILIP-1 was due to loss of <italic>VILIP-1</italic> mRNA transcripts. Rearrangements, large gene deletions or mutations were not found. Hypermethylation of the <italic>VILIP-1</italic> promoter played an important role in gene silencing. In most VILIP-1-silent cells the <italic>VILIP-1</italic> promoter was methylated. <italic>In vitro</italic> methylation of the <italic>VILIP-1</italic> promoter reduced its activity in a promoter-reporter assay. Transcriptional activity of endogenous <italic>VILIP-1</italic> promoter was recovered by treatment with 5&#x02032;-aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine (5&#x02032;-Aza-dC). Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, potently induced VILIP-1 expression, indicating that histone deacetylation is an additional mechanism of VILIP-1 silencing. TSA increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation in the region of the <italic>VILIP-1</italic> promoter. Furthermore, statistical analysis of expression and promoter methylation (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;150 primary NSCLC samples) showed a significant relationship between promoter methylation and protein expression downregulation as well as between survival and decreased or absent VILIP-1 expression in lung cancer tissues (p&#x0003c;0.0001). VILIP-1 expression is silenced by promoter hypermethylation and histone deacetylation in aggressive NSCLC cell lines and primary tumors and its clinical evaluation could have a role as a predictor of short-term survival in lung cancer patients.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1), a member of the visinin-recoverin neuronal calcium-sensor protein family, has an important role in regulating cAMP levels, cell signaling and differentiation in central nervous system. VILIP-1 has been implicated in pathological processes of the nervous system such as Alzheimer's disease and Schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Braunewell1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Burgoyne1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Our group identified VILIP-1 to be differentially expressed in chemically-induced murine skin cancer cells of high and low invasive ability by differential display, indicating a new function of VILIP-1 in cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Mahloogi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-GonzalezGuerrico1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. VILIP-1 was expressed in normal basal epidermal keratinocytes, while its expression was markedly decreased or undetectable in aggressive and invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Conversely, less aggressive SCCs showed expression of VILIP-1 protein. Ectopic overexpression of VILIP-1 resulted in a cAMP-mediated decrease of <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> growth and invasiveness of SCC cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Mahloogi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Reduced invasiveness and elevated cAMP levels were accompanied by decreased MMP-9 as well as lowered RhoA activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-GonzalezGuerrico1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, enforced expression of VILIP-1 led to inhibition of cell adhesion and migration by down-regulating fibronectin receptors, suggestive of a tumor suppressor function for VILIP-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-GonzalezGuerrico1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, a similar tumor suppressor role for VILIP-1 has been reported recently in two other tumor cell types. Wickborn et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Wickborn1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> found that VILIP-1 expression was completely lost or significantly reduced in esophageal SCC compared with normal squamous epithelium of the same site. Lower VILIP-1 protein expression was correlated with clinical-pathological features including deeper tumor invasion and increased local lymph node metastases. In another study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Fan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, xenotransplanted neuroblastoma cells in which the expression of the pro-tumorigenic gene <italic>MIF</italic> was suppressed by antisense oligonucleotides a significant reduction in tumor growth together with VILIP-1 upregulation was observed, suggesting that VILIP-1 loss is associated with tumor development.</p><p>Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world, is known to result from tobacco carcinogen-induced abnormalities in several critical genes.

Since VILIP-1 is involved in the progression of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-induced experimental skin SCCs, we decided to determine whether genetic and epigenetic changes of this gene in tobacco-associated human non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) would lead to protein expression alterations and whether these changes could affect clinical outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (NSCLC) A549, NCI-H522, NCI-H460, NCI-H226, NCI-H520, NCI-H23, Calu1, Calu6 were obtained from American Type Culture Collections (Manassas, VA).

Informed consent was obtained from the patients for tissue procurement prior to accrual and their medical records and databases were maintained according to institutional guidelines and in conformance with HIPPA regulations. The overall survival data on all patients were censored on the date of the last follow-up visit or death from causes other than lung cancer. All patient information was derived from a de-identified database approved by the FCCC Institutional Review Board. A total of 10 normal lungs, 10 lung adenocarcinomas and 69 SCCs were analyzed. In addition to these samples, TMAs containing additional cases of NSCLC were used to evaluate VILIP-1 expression by IHC. To construct the TMAs, small core biopsies were taken from representative areas of the donor paraffin-embedded lung cancer blocks and assembled onto a 3&#x02013;4 mm thick paraffin recipient block. This was done with a tissue arrayer (Beecher Instruments, Silver Spring, MD, USA) Two 1mm diameter cores from the same tumor were arranged side by side onto the recipient block to minimize any heterogeneity during the acquisition of the samples with the arrayer. In addition, normal tissue blocks from liver, kidney, colon, lung, etc were placed in all peripheral columns and rows.

Thus, it is possible that methylation of the <italic>VILIP-1</italic> promoter mediates gene silencing by blocking the binding of Sp-1 and other transcription factors to the <italic>VILIP-1</italic> promoter.</p><p>Another epigenetic regulatory mechanism in human cancer is related to the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes through the post-transcriptional modification of the N-terminal histone tails that protrude from the nucleosome core <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Jones1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Baylin1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Feinberg1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The promoters of silenced genes contain localized regions of transcriptional-silencing marks that include the deacetylation of lysines 9 and 14 and the methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3. Transcriptional-activation marks such as hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 and methylation of lysine 4 at H3 allow gene transcription. These marks form the histone code <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Baylin1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Acetylation and deacetylation of histones by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) alter chromatin structure in a way which dynamically affects transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Liu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Rice1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Inhibition of HDACs by HDAC inhibitor causes accumulation of hyperacetylated histones and acetylation of transcription factors, leading to transcriptional activation of genes involved in cancer cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, migration and invasion. Accumulating data show that one of these HDAC inhibitors, TSA, can cause the reactivation of a number of tumor suppressor genes such as TGF-beta receptor type II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Osada2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, death-associated protein kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Toyooka1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein &#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Tada1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and MYO18B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Tani1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> in lung cancer. Re-expression of tumor suppressor genes via induced acetylation of histones H3 and H4 by TSA could induce apoptotic cell death in human lung cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Zhu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, Zhong et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-Zhong1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> recently used expression profiling to analyze novel targets for epigenetic modification in human lung cancer and revealed that silencing by histone deacetylation was nearly as common as silencing by DNA methylation in a panel of nine genes. Five tumor suppressors or suppressor candidates including NRIP3, CYLD, CD9, ATF3 and OXTR were strongly induced by TSA alone. In the present study we found that TSA treatment with concentrations ranging from 50 to 500 ng/ml potently reactivated VILIP-1 expression in all the lung cancer cell lines tested. Further analysis of the TSA action mechanism indicated that TSA enhanced the binding of acetylated histones H3 and H4 at the <italic>VILIP-1</italic> promoter, therefore reaching the transcriptional-activation mark of the histone code. Acetylated lysines could recruit the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF which in turn, via its ATPase activity, displaces and twists nucleosome exposing VILIP-1 promoter for interaction with the transcription machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001698-SantosRosa1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A percentage of early bronchial precursor lesions show decreased levels of VILIP-1 expression, indicating that this protein may be starting to decrease early during carcinogenesis. Additional studies with larger numbers of <italic>in situ</italic> lesions will be required to confirm this impression. The study of primary lung tumor specimens showed clearly that a statistically significant difference in survival was associated with VILIP-1 expression. High levels of VILIP-1 expression were seen in NSCLC patients that had a longer survival whereas, absent or low levels of expression were seen in patients with poorer outcomes. This relationship was assessed in the specimens studied by immunohistochemistry either in TMAs or in regular paraffin block sections. Furthermore, this significant difference was evident not only in the entire group of NSCLC patients but also when the population was further stratified into SCC and adenocarcinoma patient subgroups. Irrespective of histological type, VILIP-1 expression was significantly reduced in more advanced stages of NSCLC than in stages 1&#x02013;2, another indication that VILIP-1 silencing is associated to tumor progression. Overall, the statistical analysis of the data showed that VILIP-1 is a promising prognostic outcome predictor that could be used in the clinic.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that the VILIP-1 is down-regulated in the most common human lung cancer histotypes. Decreased expression of VILIP-1 was associated with poorer outcomes in the NSCLC patients that showed a statistically significant reduction in survival. Epigenetic regulations including promoter hypermethylation and histone modification rather than genetic alterations are responsible for VILIP-1 silencing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001698.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>(5.44 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001698.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001698.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>(0.38 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001698.s002.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001698.s003"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>MSP analysis of representative primary lung adenocarcinomas and SCCs.
