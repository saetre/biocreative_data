Since chemokines are critical in leukocyte trafficking, we hypothesized that chemokines play essential roles in inflammation-associated cancers. Screening for 37 chemokines in prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts revealed CXCL16, the ligand for the receptor CXCR6, as the most consistently expressed chemokine. Immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence and confocal imaging of 121 human prostate specimens showed that CXCL16 and CXCR6 were co-expressed, both on prostate cancer cells and adjacent T cells. Expression levels of CXCL16 and CXCR6 on cancer cells correlated with poor prognostic features including high-stage and high-grade, and expression also correlated with post-inflammatory changes in the cancer stroma as revealed by loss of alpha-smooth muscle actin. Moreover, CXCL16 enhanced the growth of CXCR6-expressing cancer and primary CD4 T cells. We studied expression of CXCL16 in an additional 461 specimens covering 12 tumor types, and found that CXCL16 was expressed in multiple human cancers associated with inflammation. Our study is the first to describe the expression of CXCL16/CXCR6 on both cancer cells and adjacent T cells in humans, and to demonstrate correlations between CXCL16 and CXCR6 vs. poor both prognostic features and reactive changes in cancer stoma. Taken together, our data suggest that CXCL16 and CXCR6 may mark cancers arising in an inflammatory milieu and mediate pro-tumorigenic effects of inflammation through direct effects on cancer cell growth and by inducing the migration and proliferation of tumor-associated leukocytes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent mouse models have made a functional link between cancer and inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006695-Pikarsky1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006695-Maeda1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, providing evidence for a tumor-promoting activity for leukocytes as originally suggested by Rudolf Virchow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006695-Coussens1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006695-Balkwill1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

The samples were taken from the archives with all identifiers removed after review and approval by the Tissue Bank and Data Base for Urologic Diseases of the National Cancer Institute, and the University of Texas, San Antonio IRB, which granted a waiver for obtaining informed consent.</p><p>Elutriated lymphocytes were obtained from healthy donors by the Department of Transfusion Medicine, under a protocol (99-CC-0168) approved by the IRB of the Clinical Center, NIH. All blood components collected under this protocol are used for research purposes, to which donors provide written consent. Some tissue arrays were from the Tissue Array Research Program (TARP), Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute and some were purchased from Imgenex, San Diego, CA. The TARP is a biobank. For the TARP arrays, tissues were obtained retrospectively and anonymously from surgical pathology specimens. Patients consented to donation, and samples were transferred to TARP without identifiers. This use was considered exempt from IRB review by the NIH Office of Human Subjects Research. The numbers of samples (as presented also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006695-g007">Figure 7</xref>) and the sources for each tumor type were: head and neck cancer - 19 cases, TARP array; thyroid cancer - 25 cases, TARP array; renal cell carcinoma (RCC)- 28 cases, TARP array; melanoma- 29 cases, TARP array; lymphoma- 28 cases, TARP array; lung cancer - 84 cases total - 70 cases from TARP array and 14 cases from University of Virginia; glioblastoma (GBM) &#x02013; 20 cases, TARP array; ovarian cancer &#x02013; 62 cases total - 50 from TARP array and 12 from University of Virginia; breast cancer - 42 cases total- 30 cases from TARP array and 12 cases from University of Virginia; colon cancer - 69 cases total- 60 cases from TARP array and 9 cases from University of Virginia; prostate cancer -121 cases total- 75 from TARP array, 13 from University of Texas, 13 from University of Virginia, and 20 from Imgenex commercial array; liver cancer - 55 cases, Imgenex commercial array.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Antibodies and Cytokines</title><p>All antibodies were against human antigens. For immunohistochemistry the following antibodies were used: goat anti-CXCL16 (biotinylated and non-biotinylated, R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), rabbit anti-CXCR6 (GeneTex, San Antonio, TX), rabbit anti-CD3, mouse anti-CD3 (F7.2.38), mouse anti-alpha smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;SMA) (1A4), and mouse anti-Ki-67 (MIB-1) (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). For each of these antibodies, the corresponding control antibodies, goat, rabbit or mouse IgG were used (R&#x00026;D Systems). For FACS sorting and/or analysis the following antibodies were used: mouse anti-CXCR6-PE (R&#x00026;D Systems), mouse anti-CD4-APCCy7 and mouse anti-CD45RO-PECy5 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). For CD4 proliferation experiments the following antibodies were used: mouse anti-CXCR6 and rat anti-CXCL16 and the corresponding control mouse or rat IgG's (R&#x00026;D Systems).

Frozen tissue was fixed in formalin prior to staining. Paraffin embedded sections were treated for antigen retrieval (Target Retrieval Solution, DakoCytomation). If necessary, endogenous peroxidase was inactivated using Peroxidase Blocking Reagent, followed by blocking endogenous biotin using the Avidin-Biotin Blocking kit (both from DakoCytomation). In some cases, biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG secondary antibody was used, and detection was done using a standard avidin&#x02013;biotin horseradish peroxidase procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA). 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) or 3,3&#x02032;-diaminobenzedine (DAB) (DakoCytomation) was used for color development, and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For negative controls, sections were stained using rabbit IgG or biotinylated goat IgG (R&#x00026;D Systems) as appropriate. Staining for CXCL16, CXCR6 and &#x003b1;SMA were scored separately by a single pathologist (J.W.G) blind to clinical data and to results with other stains. For CXCL16 and CXCR6, expression was scored from 0&#x02013;3, with 0 being negative and 3 the highest level of staining intensity.
