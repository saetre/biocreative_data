Oxidant stress alters many functions of the endothelium which, associated with traditional risk factors, triggers early vascular inflammation and a predisposition to atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are susceptible to oxidative damage. Oxidative stress-mediated LDLs modification (ox-LDLs) has a key role in initiation of the atherosclerotic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Ox-LDLs are taken up via different scavenger receptors. The CD36 scavenger receptor constitutes the major ox-LDL receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Studies employing transgenic and knock-out mice have demonstrated that CD36 is proatherogenic according to observations that targeted disruption of the gene was protective against atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Components of ox-LDL activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) resulted in an up-regulation of the CD36 scavenger receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are PPAR&#x003b3; agonists that improve insulin sensitivity, reduce triglyceride levels and decrease the risk of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. TZDs also exert direct effects on vascular wall cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. TZDs treatments inhibit intimal lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], suppress monocyte elaboration of inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], macrophage activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and the expression of cell adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. TZDs also increase the mRNA expression of the proatherogenic CD36 gene. PPAR&#x003b3; seems to be determinant in the CD36 gene regulation as deduced from macrophages derived from mice in which the PPAR&#x003b3; gene has been "floxed out" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, most authors suggest that the CD36-increasing effects of TZDs might be overwhelmed by the antiatherogenic effects of other factors. Rosiglitazone (RG) is a TZD that possesses several anti-inflammatory properties demonstrating a protective action in regulating atherosclerosis development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a member of the Cap 'n' Collar family of basic region-leucine zipper transcription factors. Transcription factor Nrf2 is a major regulator of genes encoding phase 2 detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant stress protein in response to electrophilic agents and oxidative stress. Evidence that ox-LDLs and some lipid hydroperoxides contained in ox-LDL enhanced nuclear levels of Nrf2 in macrophages has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This increase results in an up-regulation of the scavenger receptor CD36 and antioxidant stress proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, Nrf2 appears as an additional transcription factor regulating CD36 gene expression.</p><p>Adipocyte differentiation seems to be linked to an improvement of insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Sharma et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] proposed the hypothesis that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system prevents diabetes by promoting the recruitment and differentiation of adipocytes. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies further demonstrate that several angiotensin receptor blockers or their metabolites induce PPAR&#x003b3; activity and opposite, ligand activated-PPAR&#x003b3; suppressed AT<sub>1</sub>R gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Paradoxically, studies reveal that a moderate reduction of PPAR&#x003b3; activity as observed in heterozygous PPAR&#x003b3;-deficient mice, or the Pro12Ala polymorphism in human PPAR&#x003b3; gene, prevent insulin resistance and obesity induced by a high-fat diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This reduction is thought to occur because PPAR&#x003b3; expression is regulated by nutritional state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Oxidative and inflammatory mediators as those produced in long-term high-fat high-cholesterol (HFHC) diets are known to be inducers of different responses that regulate PPAR&#x003b3; gene activity. The activity of PPAR&#x003b3; can be finely tuned through integration of diverse phosphorylation events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study was to show that RG and losartan (LST) treatments preserved the liver PPAR&#x003b3; activity in mice that were fed with a HFHC diet. On the contrary, a loss of PPAR&#x003b3; activity was observed instead of an increase of the PPAR&#x003b3; gene expression in the untreated hypercholesterolemic control mice. Lipid hydroperoxides levels and the relative expression values of the inflammatory mediators inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) genes were diminished in mice treated with RG with respect to LST treated mice. These findings were suggestive of RG additional properties independent of its metabolizing actions. A difference in the CD36 gene expression level between treated groups was observed. Because oxidative stress activates Nrf2 responses and recently has been described as the essential contribution of Nrf2 to the CD36 gene expression, we also investigated whether Nrf2 mediates the CD36 gene up-regulation observed in the LST group. A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that in the RG prevents Nrf2-dependent CD36 up-regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Two-month old female inbred strain C57BL/6J and C3HeJ/6J mice that differ strikingly in aortic fatty streak development when fed a high-fat diet were housed at 25&#x000b0;C on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and provided with food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.

Also, lower levels of LOOH were observed in the RG group with respect to mice treated with LST or even with respect to the C3HeJ control group.

Increase in apoA-I gene, a main determinant of HDL concentration levels, might occur after RG treatment because of its ability to act on PPRE elements located at the apoA-I gene which might also preserve HDL-associated antioxidant properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, these two possibilities were analyzed as follows. First, we tested the ability of isolated HDL to inhibit the oxidation of PACP by HPODE by the DCF cell-free assay. Fluorescence signal comparisons between HDL obtained from either C57BL/6J mice on a chow diet and C57BL/6J that fed a HFHC between day 1 and day 100 were significant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Therefore, both time elapsed and hypercholesterolemic diet were associated with a reduction of the HDL antioxidant properties. As deduced from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>, we observed that both RG and LST treatment preserved the antioxidant properties of HDL. Interestingly, no differences in the HDL-linked Paraoxonase and arylesterase activities as well as in the PON1 gene expression were observed between pharmacological treated groups (not shown). Second, the Apo A-I proximal promoter levels were evaluated after PPAR&#x003b3; ChIP assay as described in our methods. As depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, experiments demonstrated respectively a 63.5% and a 92.5% of DNA amplified after ChIP in the LST and RG treated mice groups with respect to mice fed on HFHC diet. The difference between both pharmacological treated animal groups was not significant. This finding suggested that the PPAR&#x003b3;-mediated transcription of apo-A-I was not different in treated groups and interestingly that a preserved PPAR&#x003b3; activity was also present in the LST group.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Treatments preserve HDL antioxidant properties and apolipoprotein A-I-(apo A-I)-PPAR&#x003b3;-mediated gene expression.</bold> (<bold>a</bold>).

No difference was observed in the PPAR&#x003b3; expression levels between LST and RG treated mice. Gene expression levels of the PPAR&#x003b3; response gene SCARB1 were next evaluated. At day 100 a significant decrease in SCARB1 gene expression in mice fed on HFHC diet with respect to mice fed on chow diet (p = 0.02) was observed. SCARB1 expression levels were significantly higher in hypercholesterolemic mice treated with LST in respect to untreated HFHC fed mice. Jointly considered PPAR&#x003b3; and SCARB1 expression data are suggestive of a preserved PPAR&#x003b3; activity in both pharmacological treated groups. To specifically evaluate this PPAR&#x003b3; preserved activity, ChIP assays were conducted. Following PPAR&#x003b3;-mediated immunoprecipitation assays revealed that there was a 38% reduction in the amplified level of SCARB1 promoter region that was accessible to PPAR&#x003b3; in mice fed with a HFHC diet compared to mice fed a control low-fat diet (p = 0.109) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). It seems that in mice fed on HFHC diet, in spite of a significant increase in the PPAR&#x003b3; expression levels, this nuclear receptor seems to be unable to efficiently bind to the PPRE site in the SCARB1 gene. In this context, we observed that in those animals fed on HFHC diet that were also treated with LST or RG, the amplified values of SCARB1 DNA were respectively 162% and 265% higher than those in C57BL/6J fed a HFHC diet.

Studies have established the role of Nrf2 as a novel signalling pathway involved in the regulation of the CD36 gene. Evidence that ox-LDLs and certain oxidized lipids of LDL particles are inducers of Nrf2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] has been reported. Thus, we next explored the possibility that Nrf2 could be playing a pivotal role in the observed diminished total plasma LOOH levels in mice that fed a HFHC diet treated with RG with respect to either LST treated and untreated hypercholesterolemic mice as well as in the observed diminution in the relative expression levels of CD36 gene in the RG mice group with respect to the mice LST group. To address this possibility, ChIP assays using an antibody against Nrf2 followed with real-time analysis of the ARE site at the CD36 gene promoter identified as described in the methods were performed. A significant Nrf2-dependent increase in the amplified CD36 gene promoter region was observed in animals fed with a HFHC diet with respect to control chow mice (p &#x0003c; 0.05) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>); similarly, mice treated with LST showed increased amplification levels of the CD36 promoter region regarding chow mice (p &#x0003c; 0.05 for both).

However, lessons obtained from murine models of atherogenesis with or without diabetes should be viewed with caution given the known differences between vascular lesions from those animal models compared to those seen in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Interestingly, we find that in spite of the similarly preserved PPAR&#x003b3; activity, RG administration was associated with a better "antiatherogenic" profile than this found in animals treated with LST exposed to the same diet. Thus, we found that hypercholesterolemic mice treated with RG showed inferior levels of total peroxidized lipids than those measured in hypercholesterolemic mice treated with LST. Moreover, when the relative gene expression levels of the iNOS and IL-6 genes were evaluated, we found lower expression levels in mice treated with RG with respect to those obtained in LST treated mice. Values reached significance for iNOS gene expression. Further enhancements of iNOS expression in mice that fed a HFHC diet treated with RG with respect to LST treated mice was not due to PPAR&#x003b3;-mediated transcriptional activity as deduced from ChIP assays.</p><p>Because there is a second target of PPAR&#x003b3; activation, the liver X receptor &#x003b1; whose activity was not analyzed in our work, care must taken with the interpretation of our results. Nevertheless, we suggested possible additional antioxidants and anti-inflammatory effects of the RG that seem to be partially independent of its action on PPAR&#x003b3; activity. It is important to note that in our experimental model, we also observed a difference in the HDL-cholesterol concentration level. Values were higher in mice treated with RG compared to those found in the LST treated group. Besides the key role of HDL particles in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by enhancement reverse cholesterol transport, it is known that HDL also exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that participate in its general antiatherogenic effect. The antioxidant ability of HDL is due to the apoprotein moiety and to the presence of associated enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The apoA-I has also been shown to be capable of removing seeding molecules from LDL, thus preventing the oxidation of LDL-derived phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Therefore we considered if this observed HDL increase would justify by itself the best antioxidant profile obtained in mice treated with RG as compared to LST treated mice. We showed that the HDL particles isolated from both treated animal groups exhibited similar characteristics regarding their capacity to avoid the oxidation of PACPC by HpODE. However, these experiments do not exclude the fact that perhaps this difference in the HDL levels could be relevant by itself. The determinant role of apo A-I in increasing HDL levels has been clearly established in apoE-knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. According to this, it could be possible that non-evaluated differences in apo A-I concentrations, and therefore differences in HDL concentrations and activities, were justified by other transcriptional regulators that were not analyzed in our work. Interestingly, because of the existence of a peroxisome proliferator-responsive element (PPRE) at the apo A-I gene, it also could be possible that as suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] the apo A-I gene might be positively regulated by PPAR&#x003b3;. This possibility was analyzed in our work. Thus, because we observed similar of PPAR&#x003b3;-mediated apo A-I gene transcription we concluded that the apo A-I is certainly positively regulated by PPAR&#x003b3; agonists but also indirectly we concluded that the PPAR&#x003b3; activity was preserved in both treated animal groups.</p><p>The role of PPAR&#x003b3; as a transcriptional regulator of CD36 gene expression has been previously established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Surprisingly, we observed a statistical difference in the relative expression levels of the CD36 gene between both treated animal groups while no difference was observed in the relative expression levels of PPAR&#x003b3;-responsive gene SCARB1. Our results suggested differences at inflammatory and oxidative levels between both treated animal groups being less harmful in mice treated with RG than in mice treated with LST. Studies have demonstrated PPAR&#x003b3; induction in human monocytes following exposure to oxLDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Notably new evidence has been provided that Nrf2 plays an essential role in regulating CD36 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Moreover, ox-LDLs are known to activate Nrf2-mediated gene responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore, we thought that in our experimental model some similar situation would justify the observed difference in the CD36 gene relative expression levels where Nrf2 could be important. Thus, we performed gene expression analysis and ChIP experiments and concluded that in HFHC-fed mice treated with RG the smaller expression levels of the hepatic CD36 gene were observed as opposed to HFHC-fed mice treated with LST because RG prevents Nrf2-mediated CD36 up-regulation. It has been reported that PPAR&#x003b3; ligands, 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (PGJ(2)), and troglitazone inhibits Nrf2-induced expression of the tromboxane synthase gene in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Because Nrf2 also regulates CD36 gene expression, authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] suggested that the transcriptional regulators PPAR&#x003b3; and Nrf2 may interact functionally to modulate CD36 gene expression. As has been previously noted, we demonstrated similarly preserved PPAR&#x003b3; activity in hypercholesterolemic mice treated with RG or LST. Therefore we deduced that RG seems to afford some additional antiaterogenic properties that prevent Nrf2-depedent CD-36 up-regulation which are partially independent of its metabolizing properties as a PPAR&#x003b3; agonist.</p><p>We did not find statistically significant differences in the eNOS relative gene expression levels between treated groups with similarly preserved PPAR&#x003b3; activity. Authors suggest that TZDs protective effects on vascular wall cells are mediated by its ability to up-regulate eNOS gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. This effect of TZDs may explain its <italic>in vivo </italic>vasodilating and blood pressure-lowering effects and, at least for some TZDs, seems to be independent of their PPAR&#x003b3; metabolizing effects. However, although the molecular mechanisms by which TZDs increase NO release are not completely worked out, they are likely to depend on each particular TZD. For example Troglitazone, has an alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) moiety that is not present in other TZDs, and treatment of hepatocytes with vitamin E and Troglitazone but not with RG led to an inhibition of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expression suggesting a PPAR&#x003b3;-independent, antioxidant-related mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Goya et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] suggested that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties observed following troglitazone administration to cells were linked to the 6-hydroxychromonanes structure of troglitazone. Jiang et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] proved that &#x003b3;-tocopherol diminished prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis in macrophages. Therefore, some TZDs share common anti-inflammatory properties with PPAR&#x003b3; independency, which are partially mediated by its structural relations with tocols. Gonon et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] recently provide evidences that RG results in protection against myocardial contractile dysfunction induced by ischemia reperfusion in mice receiving RG by mediating eNOs protein phosphorilation without increasing total eNOS concentration.</p><p>Our work has concentrated in analyzing the hepatic expression of PPAR&#x003b3; and Nrf2 target genes and the valuation of some serum markers. Although it is important to go deep in the in vivo situation it is also important to recognize the differences of regulation of the expression of genes regulated by PPAR and Nrf2 are tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and context-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Thus, caution is required in the interpretation of our results. Particularly, further in vivo studies should be necessary to explore the role of Nrf2 transcription factor in modulating the progression of foam cell formation and atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion and Clinical Perspective</title><p>The present study indicates that the administration of RG or LST to diet-induced atherosclerosis susceptible mice fed a HFHC diet preserves in both groups the PPAR&#x003b3; activity. RG seems to have antioxidant effects in addition to its main metabolic activity in a manner that actually diminishes rather than increases the expression of the gene CD36 by inhibiting its Nrf-2-dependent up-regulation. Despite the favourable effects of RG observed in this study, it must be acknowledged that the meta-analysis of Nissen et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] on RG and cardiovascular risk raises the hypothesis that TZDs treatments may increase the risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular events. However, the general consensus is that this hypothesis needs further evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Currently, animal and human studies suggest that PPAR&#x003b3; ligands have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and vasculo-protective protective effects. However, though there are similarities in TZD-induced improvement in insulin sensitivity between experimental models and humans, there are also substantial differences. Studies have focused on the role of adipocytokines in metabolic control and their regulation by TZDs. Nevertheless, growing evidence suggests that the vasculo-protective effects of PPAR&#x003b3; ligands can be dissociated from its metabolizing actions. Thus, there may be important implications for the development of improved anti-atherogenic and antidiabetic drug treatments. Additionally, the identification of potential benefits associated with the common molecular structure among these drugs will have interesting clinical repercussions.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AT<sub>1</sub>R = Angiotensin Type 1 Receptor; ChIP = Chromatin immunoprecipitation; eNOS (NOS3) = Nitric Oxide Synthase 3; HDL = High Density Lipoprotein; HFHC = high-fat high-cholesterol; IL-6 = Interleukin 6; iNOs (NOS2) = Nitric Oxide Synthase, inducible; LOOH = Lipid Hydroperoxide; LST = Losartan; NO = Nitric Oxide; Nrf2 = Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Like 2; PPAR&#x003b3; = Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-Gamma; RG = Rosiglitazone.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grant PI/06 from the Fundaci&#x000f3;n Canaria de Investigaci&#x000f3;n y Salud (FUNCIS) with an extension.
