Here, we describe a new method for generating mouse ESC-derived platelets (ESPs) that can contribute to hemostasis in vivo. Flow cytometric sorting of cells from embryoid bodies on day 6 demonstrated that c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> integrin &#x003b1;IIb (&#x003b1;IIb)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, but not CD31<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells or vascular endothelial cadherin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, are capable of megakaryopoiesis and the release of platelet-like structures by day 12. &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3-expressing ESPs exhibited ectodomain shedding of glycoprotein (GP)Ib&#x003b1;, GPV, and GPVI, but not &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 or GPIb&#x003b2;. ESPs showed impaired &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation and integrin-mediated actin reorganization, critical events for normal platelet function. However, the administration of metalloproteinase inhibitors GM6001 or TAPI-1 during differentiation increased the expression of GPIb&#x003b1;, improving both thrombogenesis in vitro and posttransfusion recovery in vivo. Thus, the regulation of metalloproteinases in culture could be useful for obtaining high-quality, efficacious ESPs as an alternative platelet source for transfusions.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; EB, embryoid body; ESC, embryonic stem cell; ESP, ESC-derived platelet; Flk, fetal liver kinase; GC, glycocalicin; GP, glycoprotein; HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PC, platelet concentrate; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; TIMP, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase; TPO, thrombopoietin; VE, vascular endothelial; VWF, von Willebrand factor.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>Platelet concentrates (PCs) from donated blood are required to treat severe thrombocytopenia in patients with various hematological diseases, such as those who have undergone cancer chemotherapy or are recovering from hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Frequent transfusion of PCs is clinically necessary because the half-life of transfused human platelets is 4&#x02013;5 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Platelets cannot be stored frozen, thus the ability to generate platelets in vitro would provide significant advances for platelet replacement therapy in clinical settings. A novel culture method to generate human platelets from cord blood CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells was recently developed as an alternative source for PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). However, technical difficulties in expanding ex vivo&#x02013;cultured cord blood CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells on a large scale have limited this as a reasonable in vitro approach for generating platelets.</p><p>Human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be forced to differentiate along a megakaryocytic lineage and represent a promising in vitro source for platelets. Owing to their pluripotency, ESCs can potentially proliferate indefinitely in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Platelets, as anucleate fragments of cytoplasm, can be irradiated before transfusion to effectively eliminate any contaminating cell, such as an undifferentiated ESC. The possibility of irradiation is important, as ESCs can potentially form teratomas or, if present at high numbers, elicit an immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Thus, although ESCs represent a potentially safe and unlimited source of platelets in vitro, there are technical obstacles that remain.</p><p>First, culture methods for efficient in vitro generation of platelets have not been established. Second, appropriate in vivo function of the in vitro&#x02013;produced platelet must be achieved. In addition, contamination with nonhuman antigens resulting in immunological reactions must be prevented. We and other groups have developed a method to generate large numbers of megakaryocytes and platelets from mouse ESCs grown on OP9 stromal cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). However, these methods have not consistently produced ESC-derived megakaryocytes or platelets in sufficient quantity or quality to be considered as an alternative platelet source. No pre-selection for megakaryocyte progenitors was included in these previous reports. Studies have shown that the in vitro generation of large numbers of mature megakaryocytes depends on increased numbers of ESC-obtained progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Therefore, the identification and selection of megakaryocyte progenitors might increase the efficiency of megakaryopoiesis.</p><p>The functional platelet paradigm in hemostasis and thrombosis is the initiation of platelet adhesion to the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). One key event in this process is the interaction between glycoprotein (GP)Ib&#x003b1; (the platelet receptor) and von Willebrand factor (VWF) present in the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Simultaneously, platelets can interact with surface-bound collagen via platelet receptors GPVI and integrin &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). The net result is an activation of integrin &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 to become a competent fibrinogen receptor leading to the formation of platelet aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). A recent report has also suggested that GPIb&#x003b1; contributes to arterial thrombosis in vivo independently of binding to VWF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Indeed, other studies have demonstrated that GPIb&#x003b1; associates with thrombin, kininogen, coagulation factors XI and XII, and thrombospondin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). In addition, the GPIb&#x02013;V-IX complex, consisting of GPIb&#x003b1;, GPIb&#x003b2;, GPIX, and GPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), can bind integrin &#x003b1;M&#x003b2;2 on macrophages/monocytes or P-selectin on endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Of note, aged human and mouse platelets shed GPV and an extracellular domain of GPIb&#x003b1;, which contains the binding sites for VWF and thrombin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). This process involves the action of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)17 (also referred to as tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; converting enzyme) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). This leads to decreased platelet function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> integrin &#x003b1;IIb (&#x003b1;IIb)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells isolated from ESCs differentiate with high efficiency into megakaryocytes and ESC-derived platelets (ESPs) in the presence of thrombopoietin (TPO) and stromal cells. We also show that ESPs shed extracellular domains of GPIb&#x003b1;, GPV, and GPVI in culture, reducing &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 activation and actin polymerization. Consequently, these ESPs are functionally impaired in thrombus growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). However, the inhibition of metalloproteinases restores platelet function, making ESPs from induced pluripotent stem cells a source of platelets with therapeutic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Markers defining megakaryocyte differentiation from ESCs</title><p>The cell markers defining the megakaryocytic lineage in a culture system of ESCs or HSCs are not understood. It is known that megakaryocyte progenitors are highly enriched in the CD9<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x003b1;IIb subunit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (&#x003b1;IIb<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>)Fc&#x003b3;R<sup>lo</sup>c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Sca-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup> fraction of bone marrow cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). The &#x003b1;IIb integrin subunit is an early primitive and definitive marker of hematopoiesis in the mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) and a lineage-specific marker for postnatal megakaryocytes and platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). We reasoned that CD31<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, &#x003b1;IIb<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, or c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were candidates for megakaryocyte progenitors derived from ESCs because postnatal HSCs, mature megakaryocytes, and platelets all express CD31 and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3, and postnatal megakaryocyte progenitors express both c-Kit and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>).</p><p>To determine which cells actually contribute to megakaryopoiesis, we chose to induce a liquid culture system of ESCs for embryoid body (EB) formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Sorted cells were then applied onto OP9 stromal cells to differentiate along the megakaryocytic lineage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This two-stage approach was used because EB formation has been reported to be more suitable than co-culture with OP9 cells in producing hematopoietic progenitors in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Indeed, liquid culture for EB formation resulted in reproducibly higher expression of the &#x003b1;IIb integrin subunit than the use of the OP9 co-culture system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>).

Reduced GPIb&#x003b1; expression of ESPs was not detected at day 8 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2 C</xref>, i and ii), consistent with a longer time in culture leading to a loss of GPIb&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells or shedding of GPIb&#x003b1; from the cell. Unlike ESPs, ESC-derived megakaryocytes did not exhibit reduced GPIb&#x003b1; expression, even when cultured for &#x0003e;8 d (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, i).</p><p>ADAM17 can cleave the extracellular domain of GPIb&#x003b1; on human and mouse platelets abrogating platelet function by its metalloproteinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Thus, we investigated whether a metalloproteinase supported the shedding of GPIb&#x003b1; in culture. Two potent metalloproteinase inhibitors, GM6001 (Ilomastat) or TAPI-1, were added to the co-culture system to evaluate the potential involvement of a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). Because both inhibitors also inhibit MMP9, which has been reported to facilitate megakaryopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), the drugs were administered only after day 10 (day 4 of co-culture) when megakaryocyte polyploidy is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Indeed, we found that the addition of GM6001 at the co-culture start impaired megakaryopoiesis (not depicted). GM6001 and TAPI-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, 1 and 10 &#x003bc;M) increased GPIb&#x003b1; expression on released ESPs at day 12 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). This increased expression did not affect the total number of &#x003b1;IIb<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ESPs (&#x003b1;IIb<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>GPIb&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> plus &#x003b1;IIb<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>GPIb&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) at days 12 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>) or 14 (not depicted). But the reduction of GPIb&#x003b1; was not observed on megakaryocytes during the culture (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2 C</xref>, i, and 3 A). Similarly, GM6001 addition to the culture restored expression of GPV and GPVI in &#x003b1;IIb<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ESPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>) as reported for aged blood platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). These results suggest that metalloproteinase(s) impairs the retention of GPIb&#x003b1;, GPV, and GPVI on ESPs. Biochemical analysis confirmed that ESPs in culture shed the extracellular domain of GPIb&#x003b1;, referred to as &#x0201c;glycocalicin&#x0201d; (GC), in the absence of GM6001 but not in the presence of GM6001 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>).

A link between metalloproteinase regulation and &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3-mediated signaling has not been reported previously. Preventing shedding of the &#x003b1;-subunit of the GPIb&#x02013;V-IX complex retains key binding sites for VWF, thrombin, coagulation factors, P-selectin, and Mac-1, all potentially important for normal platelet function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). The N-terminal motif of GPIb&#x003b1; is essential for arterial thrombosis independent of VWF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), and the signaling cascade from the GPIb&#x02013;V-IX complex to &#x003b1;IIb&#x003b2;3 is well known to regulate integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). However, the mechanisms whereby metalloproteinase activity regulates integrin signaling remain to be identified.</p><p>Metalloproteinases are functionally regulated by endogenous inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). When we considered the reason why megakaryocytes maintained GPIb&#x003b1; in culture, as opposed to ESPs, we hypothesized that TIMP-3, also known to inhibit ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>), might be highly expressed in megakaryocytes but not in platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). We therefore determined TIMP-3 expression in ESC-derived megakaryocytes and ESPs, but found no significant difference by RT-PCR (unpublished data). Alternatively, receptor shedding may be occurring with megakaryocytes but is not detectable owing to their gene and protein expression potential, which differs from the anucleate platelet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>).</p><p>Another interesting observation was that an administration of GM6001 or TAPI-1 from the beginning of culture impaired the production of c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x003b1;IIb<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells by day 6 of the liquid culture (unpublished data). We observed that the use of inhibitors to metalloproteinases, which cover both MMPs and ADAMs, is advantageous for the production of efficacious platelets only after day 10 of co-culture. Nonspecific inhibition to metalloproteinases may affect the early phase of hematopoiesis from ESCs as demonstrated in postnatal hematopoiesis through MMP9-mediated mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). In addition, it has been reported that MMP2 or MMP9 may have an effect on platelet function. MMP2 activates platelet aggregation through an increase in phospholipase C, protein kinase C, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> mobilization, and phosphatydylinositol 3 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). MMP9 blocks phospholipase C, protein kinase C, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> mobilization, and thromboxane A2 production leading to the inhibition of the effects of MMP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). Integrins share some of these pathways and therefore might explain how both metalloproteinases and integrin activation might influence each other. In a search for specific MMPs regulating platelet function, we analyzed mice deficient in MMP9 and found comparable platelet numbers, integrin activation, and platelet spreading on fibrinogen comparing wild-type and MMP9-deficient mice (Fig. S2, A, C, and D, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071482/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071482/DC1</ext-link>).

These results indicate that MMP9 per se is not implicated in thrombopoiesis and platelet function.</p><p>Our results suggest that the administration of metalloproteinase inhibitors prolongs the half-life of circulating ESPs in vivo (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), presumably by maintaining the repertoire of membrane receptors, such as GPIb&#x02013;V-IX and GPVI. In patients with thrombocytopenia, platelet destruction is proportional to plasma concentrations of GC, a shedding product that includes the N-terminal domain of GPIb&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). The ectodomain of GPIb&#x003b1;, GPV, and GPVI is easily shed in stocked human PCs possibly due to increased activities of ADAM17 and ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>). Consistent with our study, GM6001 has been recently shown to prevent inactivation of refrigerated platelets by inhibiting ADAM17 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). Specific inhibition to ADAM17 (and ADAM10) with spatial-temporal regulation not affecting hematopoiesis in ESCs may increase generation and storage of efficacious ESPs.</p><p>In conclusion, the inhibition of metalloproteinases in murine cultures of ESC-derived c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x003b1;IIb<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> primitive cells represents an improvement in the production of efficacious ESPs.
