Elongation of very long chain fatty acids-4 (ELOVL4) belongs to a family of 6 members of putative fatty acid elongases that are involved in the formation of VLCFA. Mutations in ELOVL4 were found to be responsible for an autosomal dominant form of Stargardt's-like macular dystrophy (STGD3) in human. We have previously disrupted the mouse <italic>Elovl4</italic> gene, and found that <italic>Elovl4<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice were developmentally normal, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of ELOVL4 is not a cause for the juvenile retinal degeneration in STGD3 patients. However, <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice died within several hours of birth for unknown reason(s). To study functions of ELOVL4 further, we have explored the causes for the postnatal lethality in <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Our data indicated that the mutant mice exhibited reduced thickness of the dermis, delayed differentiation of keratinocytes, and abnormal structure of the stratum corneum. We showed that all <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited defective skin water permeability barrier function, leading to the early postnatal death. We further showed that the absence of ELOVL4 results in depletion in the epidermis of ceramides with &#x003c9;-hydroxy very long chain fatty acids (&#x02265;C28) and accumulation of ceramides with non &#x003c9;-hydroxy fatty acids of C26, implicating C26 fatty acids as possible substrates of ELOVL4. These data demonstrate that ELOVL4 is required for VLCFA synthesis that is essential for water permeability barrier function of skin.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ELOVL4</kwd><kwd>lipid</kwd><kwd>epidermis</kwd><kwd>keratinocyte differentiation</kwd><kwd>stratum corneum</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Mammalian skin consists of a dermis and an epidermis. Keratinocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis are epidermal precursor cells that undergo both continuous proliferation to maintain their population and differentiation when they migrate in the direction of the skin surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>. The sequential differentiation of keratinocytes results in the formation of several anatomically distinct layers, including the stratum basale, the stratum spinosum, the stratum granulosum and the stratum corneum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>. The stratum corneum (SC) is the outermost layer of the epidermis and serves as a barrier for transepidermal water loss that is essential to prevent dehydration. Ceramides, a class of sphingolipids with a sphingoid base in amide linkage with a fatty acid, are major and essential components of the water barrier in epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>. A substantial portion of epidermal ceramides contain &#x003c9;-hydroxy long chain fatty acids (C&#x02265;28), which can be in the form of linoleic acid acyl esters or bound to protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>.</p><p>Elongation of very long chain fatty acids-4 (ELOVL4) belongs to a family that consists at least 6 putative fatty acid elongases in mouse and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>.

ELOVL4 is expressed in brain, retina, skin, lens, and testis in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>. Mutational analysis of the <italic>ELOVL4</italic> gene in patients suffering Stargardt's macular dystrophy 3 (STGD3) detected a 5 bp deletion, which results in a frame-shift that truncates 51 aa from the C-terminal end of ELOVL4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>. STGD3 is an autosomal dominant juvenile retinal disease characterized by progressive accumulation of lipofuscin, atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, and degeneration of macular photoreceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>. Consistent with a view that the 5-bp deletion of the <italic>ELOVL4</italic> gene is responsible for the STGD3, mice either over expressing a 5-bp <italic>ELOVL4</italic> deletion transgene in retina driven by a human photoreceptor-specific promoter of the gene encoding interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (<italic>IRBP-ELOVL4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, Li and Deng unpublished data), or carrying a targeted 5-bp <italic>ELOVL4</italic> deletion in heterozygous state (<italic>Elovl4<sup>+/del</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref> recapitulate major features of the retinal pathogenesis in STGD3 patients.</p><p>To study function of ELOVL4, we have generated a candidate null mutation by inserting of a neo cassette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref> into the exon 2 of the <italic>Elovl4 </italic>locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>. Our analysis indicated that mice heterozygous for the mutation (<italic>Elovl4<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) were developmentally normal and did not exhibit apparent photoreceptor degeneration up to 11 months of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>. Because the <italic>Elovl4<sup>+/del</sup></italic> mice and <italic>IRBP-ELOVL4</italic> transgenic mice develop early onset of photoreceptor ultrastructural abnormalities, while the <italic>Elovl4<sup>+/- </sup></italic>mice are normal, this observation suggests that a dominant negative effect, rather than haploinsufficiency, is the primary mechanism of juvenile retinal degeneration in STGF3 patients.</p><p>Notably, we also found that <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice, while exhibiting normal retinal development, died several hours after birth due to unknown causes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>. These data suggest that ELOVL4 is indispensable for the early stages of postnatal survival. Here we have further analyzed <italic>Elovl4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and found that they all displayed profound skin atrophy and impaired water insulation function. The mutant mice also lacked ceramides with &#x003c9;-hydroxy very long chain fatty acids (&#x02265;C28) indicating that ELOVL4 is critical for the formation of epidermal-specific sphingolipids with essential permeability barrier function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>2.

Tissue was washed again with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, serially dehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide and embedded in Eponate 12 resin (Ted Pella, Redding, CA, USA). Thin sections, approx. 80 nm, were obtained by utilizing the Leica ultarcut-UCT ultramicrotome (Leica, Deerfield, Ill., USA) and placed onto 300 mesh copper grids and stained with saturated uranyl acetate in 50% methanol and then with lead citrate. The grids were viewed in the Philips 410 electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 80 kV and images were recorded on Kodak S0-163 film.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of ceramids in epidermis by nanoESI-MS/MS</title><p>Sphingolipid extraction and mass spectrometric analysis were performed according to Jennemann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>. In brief, skins were trypsinized over night at 4 &#x000b0;C to separate epidermis from dermis. Lyophilized tissue was extracted once with chloroform/methanol/water in a ratio of 30:60:8 by vol. and twice in a ratio of 10:10:1 by vol., each for 15 at 50 &#x000b0;C in an ultra-sound bath. Combined extracts were desalted using reversed phase RP-18 columns. In order to cleave esterified sphingolipids, aliquots of these free extractable lipids were further saponified with 0.1 M KOH in methanol for 2 hours at 50 &#x000b0;C, neutralized and desalted using reversed phase RP-18 columns. In order to remove residual free lipids, the remaining protein pellets were treated 3 times with methanol at RT for 10 min and 2 times with 95 % methanol at 60 &#x000b0;C. From these &#x0201c;washed&#x0201d; protein pellets, protein bound lipids were released with 1 M KOH in 95 % methanol at 60 &#x000b0;C for 2 hours. Supernatant was neutralized with 1 M acetic acid, dried and desalted using reversed phase RP-18 columns. Quantification of sphingolipids was performed by nanoESI-MS/MS using a precursor ion scan of m/z +264 for ceramide- and GlcCer-detection (collision energy: 50 eV) as described by Sandhoff et al. 2002 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref> with slight modifications: Starting with 35 V at m/z = 500, the cone voltage was increased in a linear way up to 65 V at m/z = 1300 during the measurement.

Results</title><sec><title>ELOVL4 deficient mice showed defective epidermis permeability barrier function</title><p>To investigate the causes that are responsible for early postnatal lethality of the <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, we carefully monitored the newborn <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and found that all mutant mice were alive at the birth and presented a Mendelian ratio (<italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic>: 31, <italic>Elovl4<sup>+/+</sup></italic>: 58, <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic>: 32). These mice were initially slightly smaller than wild type controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A), and became more obviously smaller prior to their death within 5 hours after birth. Meanwhile, the skin <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice appeared dark/purple in color and less smooth than the skin of control (<italic>Elovl4</italic> wild type and heterozygous) mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). These phenotypes became progressively more severe and all mutant mice exhibited remarkable wrinkled skin a few hours after birth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). The skin serves as a permeability barrier for body water loss. Therefore, we checked speed of water loss during a given period of time by measuring body weight every 30 min up to 3 and half hours. The <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice lost body water at a rapid rate (~12% in 210 min), in contrast to all control mice, which maintained consistent body weight during the same period of time, suggesting the wild type skin could prevent water evaporation, but the mutant skin could not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C).</p><p>Next, we performed a skin permeability assay by soaking newborn mice into 0.5% hematoxilin for 30 minutes. We found that the <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were quickly stained by hematoxilin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D), while the dye could not penetrate the skin of control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E). These data indicate that ELOVL4 deficiency impaired the permeability barrier function of the skin, leading to the early postnatal lethal of the <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Consistent with this, we have supplied body lotion, which reduces water loss from the skin, to 3 mutant mice and found that they all survived beyond 24 hours, although died before 36 hours after birth.</p></sec><sec><title>ELOVL4 deficient mice showed impaired epidermis keratinocyte differentiation</title><p>Next, we performed histological analysis of the skin of newborn mice. In wild type mice, the SC is a multi-layer, loosely packed structure that is in the outermost of the skin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A-C). However, in the mutant mice the SC appeared thinner than control SC, and presented as split layers with varying severity in all mutant pups examined (n&#x0003e;10) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D-F, G-I), instead as a cohesive multi-layer structure in control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). The thickness of stratum basal (Bl), spinosum (Sp), and granulosum (Gr) layers were increased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C, F). In addition, thickness of the dermis of the <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was reduced than that of the control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B, E, H).</p><p>To further characterize the abnormalities of mutant skin, we performed immunohistochemical staining using various lineage markers for the epidermis. The K14 marked the basal layer of keratinocytes, which are arranged as a one- or two-cell layer in the control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A), whereas in the <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, K14 expression domain was expanded to multi-cell layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). Keratinocytes located in the basal layer are precursor stem cells for the epidermis. These cells maintain their population through proliferation, and also undergo continuous differentiation to generate cells for other layers above. The expansion of basal layer keratinocytes in mutant epidermis could be caused by increased cell proliferation, and/or reduced differentiation. Using BrdU incorporation assay, we did not detect an obvious increase of BrdU positive cells in the basal layer of the mutant epidermis relative to control epidermis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C, D). In the control basal layer, BrdU positive cells maintained, in most case, within the single cell layer (arrows, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). In contrast, the BrdU labeled mutant cells appeared in different layers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D), which is corresponding to the expanded K14 expression domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). In addition, the basal layer in the mutant epidermis was positively stained by an antibody against K6, a marker for abnormal differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>F), while control epidermis was negative (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>E). These data indicate that the absence of ELOVL4 caused abnormal keratinocyte differentiation.</p><p>The SC is formed by the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. During this process, cells sequentially incorporate precursor proteins, involucrin and loricrin, while filaggrin promotes aggregation and packing of keratin filaments to form a dense cell matrix. Our data indicated that the expression of these proteins was on primarily in the SC and upper granular in control mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>G, I, K). However, in the ELOVL4 knockout mice, these proteins remained in the spinous layer, and the granular layer, in addition to the SC layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>H, J, L). These data indicated that ELOVL4 deficiency interfered with the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, leading to the impaired formation of the SC.</p><p>We have noticed that, unlike the control pups, the mutant animals showed very little movement and had no desire to find the nipple and to suck milk from their mothers. Initially, we had considered whether starvation could also serve as a cause for the lethality. However, after feeding 4 mutant pups with milk purchased from supermarket through gavaging, we found it did not extend the time of survival of the mutant mice. We have also checked many other organs of mutant mice, including the brain, esophagus, heart, liver, lung, intestine, pancreas, spleen, and stomach, and did not find a consistent defect that could be responsible for the early postnatal lethality (not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>ELOVL4 deficiency resulted in abnormal ultrastructure in the SC</title><p>Next, we investigated if there were any ultrastructural abnormalities in the mutant epidermis using electron microscopy. The wild type SC appeared as a loosely packed basket weaved structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). In contrast, the SC of the <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was much more compact than control SC (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). Our histological analysis performed earlier revealed that the SC in the <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was often presented as split sub-layers from the skin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D, G). Altogether, these data suggest that although the mutant SC is more compact, sub-layers within the SC fail to adhere, and, in most cases, peel off from the skin. No difference in the lamellar membrane at the stratum spinosum and the stratum granulosum interface was found between mutant mice and wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C, D). The basement membrane in <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice had fewer hemidesmosomes, the attachment sites of epithelial cells to basal lamina, with shortened or missing tonofilaments (arrowheads, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>E, F). Collagenous fibrils were also sparse and shorter in the mutant mice than controls (arrows, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>E, F).</p></sec><sec><title>Depletion of ceramides with &#x003c9;-hydroxy very long fatty acids in the <italic>ELOVL4</italic> deficient mice</title><p>Ceramides containing &#x003c9;-hydroxy very long chain fatty acids are essential components of the epidermal permeability barrier. These can be expressed as free (OS), linoleic acid esterified (EOS) and in protein bound (POS) forms. In the <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/- </sup></italic>epidermis, mass spectrometric analysis revealed that ceramides containing fatty acids longer than C28 (C30-36) were absent, and those with C28 fatty acids were substantially reduced compared with controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These included &#x003c9;-hydroxyceramides (OS, POS and EOS) that were found in wild-type and heterozygote epidermis with fatty acid lengths equal or longer than C28 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/- </sup></italic>epidermis contained predominantly non-hydroxy (NS)-, &#x003b1;-hydroxy (AS)-ceramides with C26 as longest fatty acid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Interestingly, the amount of these ceramides with C26 fatty acids was nearly double the amount in <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/- </sup></italic>mice compared with the wild-type and heterozygous mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), while the amounts of ceramides with C16-25 fatty acids were similar in the three genotypes, indicating that the absence of ELOVL4 caused an accumulation of NS- and AS-ceramides with C26 fatty acids.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>EVOVL4 is highly expressed in the human retina and was initially discovered as the causal gene of STGD3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>. Consistently, mutant mice carrying the dominant negative form of human <italic>ELOVL4 </italic>gene that was either introduced through a knock-in approach (<italic>Elovl4<sup>+/del</sup></italic>), or transgenic approach (<italic>IRBP-ELOVL4</italic>) developed early onset of progressive photoreceptor degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, Li and Deng unpublished data). In contrast, mice heterozygous for a conventional knockout of ELOVL4 developed normally and exhibited no symptoms mimicking human STGD3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice died unexpected shortly after birth, suggesting that ELOVL4 may play additional functions in other organs/tissues that are critical for early postnatal survival. In addition to the eye, ELOVL4 is also presented at high levels in the skin and brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>. Our analysis of <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice revealing the abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes, and malformation of the SC of the skin indicate that ELOVL4 indeed have critical functions in other organs in addition to the eye.</p><p>The SC of the skin serves as a permeability barrier for protecting the internal milieu against the external environment. Previous investigations indicated that mutant mice with malformation of the SC died of dehydration shortly after birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, establishing that the water barrier function of the SC is critical for postnatal survival. Our data revealed that the SC of <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice failed to protect against body water evaporation and dye penetration. The mutant SC is thinner and more compact than that of control mice. It also displayed ultrastructural abnormalities and detached from the mutant mice. These observations are consistent with a view that that the <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/- </sup></italic>mice died of dehydration.</p><p>Despite the high level of ELOVL4 expression in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, our examination failed to reveal an obvious histological/morphological difference between mutant and control mice. Of note, we found that the <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/- </sup></italic>mice showed no desire to find the nipple and to suck milk of their mothers. Consequently, all the mutant mice did not drink any milk until their death. Our study ruled out that starvation could be a cause for the lethality, as feeding of mutant mice with milk does not extend their life beyond 6 hours. Meanwhile, the <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/- </sup></italic>mice also had very little body movement. We suspect these phenotypes reflect a neurological behavior abnormality due to the absence of ELOVL4 in the brain. Studies using lineage and molecular markers should be performed in the future to detect alterations in cellular and molecular levels to provide an explanation for these abnormalities.</p><p>A key finding to explain the early death of the <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/- </sup></italic>mice was the absence of ceramides with &#x003c9;-hydroxy very long chain fatty acids in the epidermis of the mutant mice. This finding uncovered an indispensable role for ELOVL4 in the formation of the very long chain fatty acids that serve as constituents of sphingolipids in the epidermal barrier. The lipid barrier that is found on the surface of corneocytes in stratum corneum provides epidermal permeability barrier function, and is required for terrestrial life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>. The lipid barrier expresses ceramides as major components, with ceramides containing &#x003c9;-hydroxyl very long chain fatty acids comprising a significant fraction of epidermal ceramides. Together with a deficiency of ceramides containing fatty acids longer than C28, was the relative accumulation of ceramides containing C26 fatty acids. These results suggest that C26 fatty acids are substrates for ELOVL4 and that &#x003c9;-hydroxylation probably occurs on fatty acids of chain length C28 or longer. It is plausible that the absence of &#x02265;C28 fatty acids in ELOVL4 null epidermis blocked the synthesis of ceramides with &#x003c9;-hydroxy fatty acids and, consequently, and their linkage to linoleic acid and protein.</p><p>So far six members of ELOVL (ELOVL1-6) have been identified and these enzymes exhibit spatially and temporally specific expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>. It was reported that <italic>Elovl3</italic> gene expression in mouse skin was restricted to the sebaceous glands and the epithelial cells of the hair follicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>. The disruption of the <italic>Elovl3</italic> gene in mouse resulted in a sparse hair coat, the hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands, and the increased level of eicosenoic acid (20:1) in hair lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>. The result showed that ELOVL3 participates in the formation of neutral lipids bound with fatty acids longer than C20 that are necessary for skin function. These studies revealed that ELOVL3 and ELOVL4 have distinct functions in the skin.</p><p>While our work is completed, a study using the skin of <italic>Elovl4<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mice was published online <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>. In that study, Basireddy et al. revealed a similar defect in skin permeability due to the depletion of fatty acids &#x02265;C28 in the mutant SC. However, immunofluorescence using epidermal markers did not detect any obvious differences between the <italic>Elovl4<sup>del/del</sup></italic> and control mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>. A plausible explanation is that the <italic>Elovl4<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mice still express the mutant form of ELOVL4 that is 51aa shorter than the full-length protein (314aa). The dominant-negative nature of this mutant form of ELOVL4 might be a cause for the observed differences between the <italic>Elovl4<sup>del/del</sup></italic> and <italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. This issue deserves further investigations in the future.</p><p>Similar phenotypes were found in mice carrying either a null mutation of ELOVL4 (<italic>Elovl4<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) or a truncation of ELOVL4 at 270aa (<italic>Elovl4<sup>270X/270X</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, which appears in the same issue of the International Journal of Biological Sciences.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of
