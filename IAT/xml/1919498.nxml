The likely nucleation site is the highly conserved &#x02212;11A base in the non-template strand of the &#x02212;10 promoter region. Amino acid residues Y430 and W433 on the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> subunit of the RNA polymerase participate in the strand separation. The roles of &#x02212;11A and of the Y430 and W433 were addressed by employing synthetic consensus promoters containing base analog and other substitutions at &#x02212;11 in the non-template strand, and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> variants bearing amino acid substitutions at positions 430 and 433. Substitutions for &#x02212;11A and for Y430 and W433 in &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> have small or no effects on formation of the initial RNA polymerase-promoter complex, but exert their effects on subsequent steps on the way to formation of the open complex. As substitutions for Y430 and W433 also affect open complex formation on promoter DNA lacking the &#x02212;11A base, it is concluded that these amino acid residues have other (or additional) roles, not involving the &#x02212;11A. The effects of the substitutions at &#x02212;11A of the promoter and Y430 and W433 of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> are cumulative.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transcription in bacteria is catalyzed by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP). In order to form an initiation-competent promoter complex, the multi-subunit bacterial RNAPs require the participation of sigma factors. This class of initiation factors binds to the RNAP in solution prior to any DNA interaction. For historic reasons, the bacterial RNAP is referred to as the &#x02018;core&#x02019; enzyme, while the complex of core and sigma is called the &#x02018;holo&#x02019; enzyme. Studies with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNAP have indicated that formation of the initiation-competent, stable &#x02018;open&#x02019; complex (RP<sub>o</sub>), in which a 14 base pair (bp) region of the promoter DNA spanning positions <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 to +3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) has been melted, is a multi-step process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The initial, unstable, &#x02018;closed&#x02019; complex (RP<sub>c</sub>) between holo RNAP and promoter DNA isomerizes to the open complex in a reaction that includes two kinetically significant intermediates (I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>) and involves conformational changes in both the promoter DNA and the RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4 B5">2&#x02013;5</xref>): <disp-formula id="M1"><label>Scheme 1</label><graphic xlink:href="gkm431m1.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><p>Here both RP<sub>c</sub> and I<sub>1</sub> have short half lives, of the order of seconds in transcription compatible buffers, while I<sub>2</sub> and RP<sub>o</sub> are much longer lived (half lives of minutes or hours) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Sigma factors are involved in both the recognition of specific promoter elements and the initiation of the promoter DNA strand separation, which enables the template strand to base pair with nucleoside triphosphates, the precursors of the RNA. Highly conserved aromatic amino acids, positioned on one side of an alpha helix in region 2.3 of the sigma factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>) have been implicated in the melting process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13">10&#x02013;13</xref>). Of these, especially the Y430 and W433 (<italic>E. coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> numbering) have been extensively studied. Both the Y430 and the W433 have generally been assumed to interact with the highly conserved <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A residue in the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>10 region. Substitutions at both positions have been found to be deleterious for promoter DNA melting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), but remarkably, the Y430A substitution was also found to facilitate formation of complexes of RNAP with short model templates at low temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), suggesting an inhibitory role for the Y430 residue under some circumstances. The effects of substitutions for Y430 and W433 have been found to be cumulative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). A substantial amount of experimental evidence supports a crucial role for the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A base on the non-template strand in initiating the process of promoter DNA strand separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23">17&#x02013;23</xref>), but not in formation of the closed complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). It is thought that flipping the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A out of the DNA helix and into a hydrophobic pocket on the sigma factor, nucleates DNA melting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24 B25 B26">24&#x02013;26</xref>). Consistent with such a role for the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A, mismatches at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 were found to partially compensate for the deleterious effects on open complex formation of non-template strand substitutions at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). From studies of the effects of base analog substitutions at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11, it was concluded that the N1 of the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A is important in the nucleation of promoter DNA melting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>In much of the previous work different assay conditions and promoter DNAs were used, making some of the results difficult to compare. Thus the roles of Y430 and W433 have remained unclear. Here we revisit and extend the prior work using uniform assay conditions and template DNAs. Our results have led to the following novel insights: (i) The Y430 and W433 residues have important functions beyond any direct interaction they may have with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A. (ii) Substitutions for the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A and the Y430 and W433 have similar effects in directly inhibiting the rate limiting step in the formation of an open RNAP-promoter complex. (iii) The effects of substitutions at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A and at Y430 and W433 are cumulative.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen, Integrated DNA Technologies [2AP (2 amino purine) and Oligonucleotides abasic at positions <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 or <bold>&#x02212;</bold>8], or TriLink (Nebularine oligos).

As in our hands, there was no significant difference between purified sigma factors before and after ion-exchange chromatography, we routinely omitted this step. However, buffer and salt content of the storage buffer for all purified sigma factors is similar regardless of whether this step was included. The final concentrations of the dialysis buffer components are 10% glycerol, 50&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1&#x02009;mM EDTA, 0.1&#x02009;mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100 and 350&#x02009;mM NaCl.

Our approach has been to combine &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> containing substitutions of A, L, F, W or H for Y430 and of A, L, F, Y or H for W433 with promoter DNAs bearing substitutions for the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A. The DNA substrates used in this work are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A. We have carried out most experiments using a promoter (&#x02018;Duplex&#x02019;) that is truncated in the downstream direction at position +1, the start site of transcription. In the non-template strand these DNAs had the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A or substitutions of 2AP, G, purine, or an abasic nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Another template (&#x02018;Mismatch&#x02019;) had an A at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 in the template strand, leading to a mismatch in the templates that contained A, 2AP, or purine at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 in the non-template strand. Duplex templates containing a G at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 of the non-template strand had a <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11C in the template strand, and a G at this position for the Mismatch DNA. The promoter used has consensus <bold>&#x02212;</bold>35 and <bold>&#x02212;</bold>10 regions [the latter includes the upstream TG element, and is thus an extended <bold>&#x02212;</bold>10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>)], to ensure tight RNAP binding in the closed complex, so that effects of substitutions would mostly be on DNA melting rather than closed complex formation. Our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) showed that substitutions at the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>10 and <bold>&#x02212;</bold>35 that decreased the similarity of these regions to their consensus sequences, greatly reduced binding affinity for RNAP in the closed complex. The rationale for the use of truncated templates is that the effects of substitutions in both promoter DNA and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> are more pronounced, as compared to a longer DNA template (to position + 20) of the same sequence (data not shown). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>DNA templates used and sample EMSA.

In this experiment, prior to loading binding reactions consisting of RNAP and labeled DNA on the gel, they were challenged for 10&#x02009;min by added heparin. Heparin binds tightly to free RNAP and is a competitor with DNA for the binding to the enzyme. Due to the fact that the heparin is added in great excess, it will sequester any free RNAP that forms because of dissociation of RNAP promoter-complexes. Thus only stable complexes survive the heparin challenge. Stable complex formation between RNAP and Duplex DNA is seen to be greatly affected by the identity of the base at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 of the non-template strand. The gel image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C shows that stable complex formation is decreased for WT RNAP-DNA complexes containing the 2AP substitution at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 compared to the Duplex DNA (A at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> summarize the results collected for all experiments carried out with various combinations of DNA templates and RNAP bearing substitutions in &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>.

Here the destabilization of the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 base pairing would (partially) compensate for any loss of contacts due to the removal of the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Formation of a stable complex was inhibited considerably by both the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP, and the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11&#x02009;G. The latter two had the greatest effect of any single change in either promoter DNA or &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> tested in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A: compare bars within the Duplex group with the first bar of the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP and <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11G groups). This is likely due to steric hindrance by substituents not present at the same positions in the canonical <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A (the NH<sub>2</sub> at the 2 position of 2AP and G, and the additional carbonyl O at the 6 position of G). The absence of the 6 amino group may not be as important, as despite its absence, the promoter with <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 purine behaved similarly to that with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A. The <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11G substitution may have been particularly detrimental due to the presence of an H at the N1, absent at the N1 of both A and 2AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), which had previously been shown to be important for open complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Consistent with prior observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), a mismatch at position <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 for some of the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> variants slightly improves stable complex formation with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A, <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP and, to a lesser extent, <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11G Duplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). This effect can be interpreted to reflect the greater ease of rotation of a <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A out of the helix if it is not base paired to a T. Interestingly, the Abasic Duplex DNA with an A at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 of the template strand (called &#x02018;Abasic Mismatch&#x02019;) was more impaired in stable complex formation than the Abasic Duplex with a T at the same position. One possible interpretation of this result is that the template strand <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11T of the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 AT base pair is recognized by the RNAP, another, that the abasic substitution has sequence-dependent structural and thermodynamic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p><p>When RNAP mutants are used containing substitutions for Y430 of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, small defects are seen with the Duplex or Purine Duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), particularly for Y430F and Y430W. These defects become much more pronounced when paired with DNA containing other substitutions at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A, particularly with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP. The effects of the substitutions at 430 of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> on stable complex formation by RNAP with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP Duplex can be summarized as follows: (i) the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> with the Y430A (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) and Y430L substitutions tolerate the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP to a greater extent than does WT &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, (ii) the Y430H substitution has a small effect and (iii) the Y430F (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) and Y430W substitutions are deleterious. Unexpectedly, a very similar pattern is seen for the DNA containing the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 abasic substitution for Duplex DNA. This indicates that the Y430 residue could not have as its sole function a role dependent on the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11&#x02009;A base. Results with the same <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 substitutions for Mismatch DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B) are similar to the results obtained with WT RNAP, in that a slight improvement in stable complex formation is seen for most templates. All Y430 RNAP mutants, as well as WT RNAP, show large defects in stable binding to the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11G Duplex and Mismatch DNA and are therefore difficult to compare.</p><p>In a similar series of experiments to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B, the effects of substitutions at residue W433 were studied with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A substituted DNA templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B). For stable binding to Duplex DNA, W433A and W433L are slightly defective, while W433F, Y, and H behave similarly to WT RNAP under our conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Like the Y430 mutant RNAP, these defects became more pronounced when paired with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 substituted DNA templates. The amino acid preferences for the 433 position are different from those at the 430 position in that an aromatic amino acid is preferred in the former, while a small to medium sized aliphatic amino acid for the latter. As with the Y430 mutant RNAP, a range of effects for substitutions at W433 was observed even when the DNA used was abasic for <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 in the non-template strand. Thus, like Y430, W433 must have a role other than that involving the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A. The results for stable binding to the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 Purine Duplex, the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11G Duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), and the Mismatch DNA templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) by the W433 mutant RNAP are similar to those obtained for the Y430 RNAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B).</p><p>Our results clearly demonstrate RNAP's preference for certain base analogs over others at the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 position of non-template DNA. To verify the unique properties of the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 base, experiments similar to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> for substitutions at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 of Duplex were also carried out with Duplex containing substitutions for the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>8A (data not shown). The <bold>&#x02212;</bold>8 position is conserved to a lesser extent in <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) than the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 (56% versus 76%), and would therefore be expected to be more tolerant to base substitutions. Based on modeling, the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>8A is also positioned in the DNA helix far enough away from the Y430 and W433 amino acids such that we would not expect an interaction to occur between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In contrast to the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, it was found that for every substitution except <bold>&#x02212;</bold>8G, the results were very similar to those seen with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>8A Duplex and Mismatch. The <bold>&#x02212;</bold>8G substitution had deleterious consequences, but not as severe as the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11G. Thus, stable complex formation was largely insensitive to substitution at the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>8 position on the non-template strand. These results confirm the important role of the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 base on this strand. All of the above substitutions at the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 and <bold>&#x02212;</bold>8 position were also introduced in fork DNA (non-template strand to +1 and template strand to <bold>&#x02212;</bold>12), but no significant differences between DNA templates or RNAP mutants were found at room temperature. The one exception was for substitution of <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11G, which showed similar RNAP binding patterns as described before but just a 1.5 to 2-fold decrease in overall binding compared to <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A fork DNA.</p><p>For comparison, we have also carried out experiments with different promoter DNAs. With longer DNA sequences identical to the Duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) through position +1, but with an extension to +20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), under the same conditions, no effects of substitutions at 430 and 433 of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> on stable complex formation at room temperature were observed. When a 2AP was introduced at the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 position, the effect of the substitution was also slight, and substitutions in &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> had small effects. This is in sharp contrast to the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. With a similar, long template containing a total of three non-consensus substitutions in regions <bold>&#x02212;</bold>10 and <bold>&#x02212;</bold>35, some differential effects of the substitutions were seen, although the overall binding was much reduced even for the WT RNAP (data not shown). To determine whether the presence of the extended <bold>&#x02212;</bold>10 TG sequence affected our results, a version of the Duplex DNA without the TG sequence was also employed. It displayed diminished binding of wt RNAP under the standard conditions used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, but the patterns of the substitutions tested (W433L, Y430A and Y430F), with Duplex, and <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11Ab Duplex (both with CA instead of TG) was not altered, including Y430A binding better than WT to the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11Ab Duplex (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Little or no effect of substitutions in promoter DNA or &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> on complex formation in the absence of a heparin challenge</title><p>In order to try and pinpoint the step(s) in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M1">Scheme 1</xref> at which the substitutions in promoter DNA or &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> exert their effects, we performed binding experiments in the absence of a heparin challenge to determine whether complex formation in general (i.e. both closed and open complexes) was affected. The experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> as well as those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> were carried out with a subset of promoter DNAs and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>.

If the RNAP and DNA are incubated for 30&#x02009;s instead of 10&#x02009;min, similar amounts of total complex formation are detected (data not shown). Thus defects in stable complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) cannot be explained by invoking effects of the promoter&#x02014;or &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> substitutions on DNA binding. Total complex formation was also not affected for RNAP binding to <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 Abasic Duplex DNA (data not shown). For the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11&#x02009;G Duplex, small (less than 2-fold) differences among the various RNAP in total complex formation became apparent (data not shown), although any correlation between binding and stable complex formation is difficult to assess in view of the very low extents of stable complex formation seen with this template. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Complex formation in the absence of a heparin challenge.

To quantify the effects of the substitutions, we determined the equilibrium binding constants for formation of stable complexes (i.e. after incubation of RNAP and promoter DNA, the complexes were subjected to a 10&#x02009;min challenge with heparin prior to loading of the reaction mixture on a non-denaturing gel). An example experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and the quantification of the data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A.

More pronounced effects of the substitutions became evident with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP Duplex: the binding affinity of the W433L and Y430F RNAP was so weak that only a lower limit of about 25 nM could be established for <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>.

Within the error of our experiments, neither the 2AP substitutions in promoter DNA nor the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> substitutions in RNAP significantly affect <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub>. However, they lead to an increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> by as much as a factor of 15. The experimental conditions for the equilibrium and kinetic experiments differed: the glycerol concentration was greater in the former. Thus the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values determined cannot be compared to the <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> ratio (and the similarities of the extents of complex formation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> are fortuitous). Even so the effects of the substitutions would be expected to be comparable. However, from the kinetic results, some substitutions would be anticipated to cause an approximately 15-fold increase in <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, but direct measurements only show a 3-fold increase, in agreement with the supposition that we were operating near the lower limit of detectable values for <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>. For the truncated promoter DNAs used here, the effects of the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> substitutions were most notable from the <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> values for complexes formed with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP Duplex: compared with the WT RNAP, the RNAP with the W433L and Y430F had a greater <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> and shorter half life by factors of 3.5 and 2.4, respectively, while the Y430A substitution resulted in complexes with a smaller <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> and greater half life, by a factor of 2.8. We conclude that the substitutions at Y430 and W433 of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> affect the stability of RNAP-promoter complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of the presence of a G or lack of a base at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11</title><p>We additionally performed kinetic experiments using WT RNAP and both <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 Abasic Mismatch and <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11G Duplex promoter DNA, as well as WT and W433L RNAP with <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 Abasic Duplex. We were unable to detect any significant differences in on&#x02014;or off rates for the interaction of WT and W433L RNAP with <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 Abasic Duplex DNA, as compared to Duplex DNA (data not shown), despite slightly reduced levels of overall heparin resistant binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). Complexes of WT RNAP and <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 Abasic Mismatch DNA were slightly more stable than those of <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP Duplex DNA (Half-life of 11.3&#x02009;min for <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 Abasic Mismatch compared to 5.4&#x02009;min for <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP Duplex) (data not shown), while both are less stable than complexes containing the Duplex or <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 Abasic Duplex DNAs. Thus the reduced extent of stable binding seen with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 Abasic Mismatch DNA compared to the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 Abasic Duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) is due to the decreased stability of the former complex. Consistent with the slow on-rate observed in prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), we were not able to determine a meaningful <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> for the interaction of WT RNAP and the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11G Duplex due to the low amounts of heparin resistant binding and for the same reason, no <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> either.</p></sec><sec><title>Substitutions in the promoter or &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> do not affect the extent of strand separation in stable complexes</title><p>In <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M1">Scheme 1</xref> there are two types of stable complexes: the intermediate I<sub>2</sub> with, at most, a few melted base pairs at the upstream edge of the DNA region that becomes single stranded in the open complex, and the fully strand-separated open complex RP<sub>o</sub>. Under most conditions the equilibrium between these complexes heavily favors the open complex. In order to determine whether the substitutions in the Duplex DNA or &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> might have shifted the complex towards the I<sub>2</sub> form, we determined their effects on the relative extents of promoter strand separation by subjecting RNAP-promoter complexes to KMnO<sub>4</sub> probing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) both with and without a prior challenge with heparin. A sample gel for the determination of the extent of strand separation of complexes surviving a 10&#x02009;min heparin challenge is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A. As a measure of RNAP-induced promoter DNA melting, the intensity of the band generated by piperidine-induced cleavage at the oxidized <bold>&#x02212;</bold>1T in single stranded regions was quantified, and expressed as percent of the amount of radioactivity in uncleaved DNA. The values are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B for samples that were heparin-challenged, and in 7C for samples that were not. The presence of the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP does not affect strand opening in the absence of a heparin challenge, but the extent of strand opening is reduced after incubation with heparin prior to loading the samples on the gel. The presence of the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP only affects the extent of strand separation when the equilibrium is skewed to the left by the addition of heparin, which binds to free RNAP and inhibits promoter binding. These results are similar to those obtained by EMSA with and without heparin challenge (compare left bars of the Duplex and <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP Duplex in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A, with left bars of the same DNAs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B).</p><p>Just as was observed by EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A Duplex the differential abilities of the RNAP with substitutions in their &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> to orchestrate heparin-stable strand separation of promoter DNA are masked under our conditions (see left-hand clusters of bands and bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref>A and B, respectively). Again the use of the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP Duplex allows better differentiation among the &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> with substitutions at 430 and 433: For the complexes formed with the W433L mutant, a smaller fraction of the radioactivity is in cleaved DNA bands than for complexes formed with WT &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, while with the Y430A a larger fraction of the radioactivity is found in the KMnO<sub>4</sub> generated bands. The Y430F is similar to the WT &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> in this regard. This substitution's lack of deleterious effects here, as compared to the EMSA assays, may be partially due to the lower concentrations of heparin used (100&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml in the KMnO<sub>4</sub> experiments versus 200&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml for the EMSA). For W433L and Y430A, the results closely parallel those obtained with the EMSA assay, which monitored formation of stable RNAP-promoter complexes. In the absence of a heparin challenge, no significant differences were seen in the KMnO<sub>4</sub> patterns between W433L, Y430A and Y430F for either the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A or the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP Duplexes. This is in agreement with the results from the EMSA experiments on the extent of formation of complexes in the absence of a heparin challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). We have no data that, for any combination of substitutions in &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and Duplex DNA tested, would support the accumulation of complexes that survive a heparin challenge, but yet are not fully strand separated (e.g. I<sub>2</sub>). Indeed we also have observed that stable complexes, even if containing both mutant &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and a 2AP substitution at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11, can initiate RNA synthesis. When tested on a template that is extended in the downstream direction compared to that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, the complexes were able to make the abortive product UpApU from UpA and UTP in proportion to their ability to form heparin resistant complexes (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Amino acid sequence preferences at positions 430 and 433, and the roles of the Y430 and W433 residues</title><p>The observation that the Y430F substitution is deleterious to formation of a stable complex between RNAP and promoter DNA containing <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP, would suggest that the tyrosine OH group plays an unknown but important role in formation of a stable RNAP-promoter complex. With the consensus promoter that extends to +20, at low temperatures, the RNAP containing the Y430A substitution (but not Y430L) is deficient in open complex formation (data not shown): the same is the case for a similarly long promoter with non-consensus <bold>&#x02212;</bold>10 and <bold>&#x02212;</bold>35 regions at room temperature. Such behavior had previously been observed with the long non-consensus promoter for Y430A RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Similarly, Juang and Helmann (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) found that for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>A</sup>, both the Y189A and Y189L (Y 189 is the ortholog of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> Y430) substitutions had detrimental effects on open complex formation with a full sized promoter. With the short Duplex promoter sequence, the RNAP containing &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> substitutions Y430A and Y430L are better than the WT sequences of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> at forming a stable complex. In this respect, our results on stable complex formation at room temperature, are consistent with those from Gralla's group, who investigated total complex formation (no heparin challenge) near 0&#x000b0;C; under these conditions the vast majority of the complexes are expected to be unstable, closed, complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The latter group concluded that for their short DNA templates, the Y430 had an inhibitory effect, which would be relieved when the Y430 residue was substituted by A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This would also be the case for the Y430L substitution. We speculate that Y430's role is to be inserted between the bases of the DNA to initiate promoter bending. Then, for the Duplex promoter which would be difficult to bend as it lacks any sequence downstream of +1 to serve as a handle for the bending, it might be less detrimental to form a stable complex with RNAP containing &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> with an A or L at position 430. As they are smaller and more flexible they would be less likely to be forced into the DNA helix, than the Y430 of WT &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>. The OH of Y430 conceivably could aid in this process by engaging in H-bond formation. It has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) that RNAP may compete with, and weaken, the hydrogen bonding between the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A-T pair prior to base flipping. Because the Y430 substitutions to A or L facilitate open complex formation with Duplex DNA, it is not likely that the hydroxyl of Y430 is engaging in such a competing hydrogen bond interaction with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A.</p><p>It had been assumed that the Y430 and W433 residues played a direct role in flipping the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 base out of the DNA helix and into a pocket on the RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The fact that we see a range of activities for the various substitutions at positions 430 and 433, even with a DNA that is abasic at the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 position of the non-template strand, sets limits on models for the roles of each of the residues W433 and Y430. <italic>A priori</italic>, there are multiple possibilities, including the following: (i) No interactions with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A; (ii) interaction(s) only to <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A; (iii) interaction(s) only to <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A, with other amino acids also interacting with this base; (iv) interactions to both <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A, and to another group of the DNA; (v) novel interactions with the DNA due to adaptation of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) to the DNA site that lacks the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A. Our results with DNAs that are abasic for <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 in the non-template strand rule out (ii) and (iii), above: If the only roles of Y430 and W433 were to recognize and flip the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A, in the absence of this base the actual residue present at positions 430 or 433 of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> would not matter, and a constant (low) level of strand separation would be expected regardless of the particular amino acid side chain at these positions. The simplest explanations for the results with the abasic DNA are possibilities (i) or (iv), but we cannot exclude (v) based on the available data. The adaptabilty of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> may in fact be of crucial importance for the recognition of a variety of non-consensus promoters by RNAP.</p><p>For comparison we have also investigated the effect of an alanine substitution for R588 of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, which is involved in recognition of the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>35 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) and would be a highly unlikely interacting partner of the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A. It is found (data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, and data not shown) that RNAP containing WT and R588A &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, bind the following percentage of input DNA, respectively, at room temperature subsequent to a 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml heparin challenge: Duplex, 66 &#x000b1; 7 and 46 &#x000b1; 1; <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP Duplex, 28 &#x000b1; 7 and 3 &#x000b1; 0.4; <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11Ab Duplex, 51 &#x000b1; 2 and 22 &#x000b1; 2. These numbers for R588A are very similar to those for W433L with the same DNAs, and also qualitatively similar to those for Y430F, consistent with the possibility that Y430 and W433, like R588, would not interact with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A either.</p><p>The finding that with the short Duplex DNA at position 430 small (A) or medium sized (L) aliphatic side chains are preferred, but at position 433, aromatic amino acids [this work and also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>)], must reflect the different roles these two residues play in the process of open complex formation. Perhaps the W433 is involved in stacking onto another aromatic residue. Consistent with the conclusion that amino acids 430 and 433 of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> have other (or additional) roles than interacting with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 base, it is found that substitutions at 430 and 433, and at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 in the DNA (e.g. the 2AP or the G) exacerbate each others&#x02019; deleterious effects, indicating that different processes may be affected by the DNA&#x02014;and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> substitutions. Also, a mismatch at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11, expected to facilitate removal of the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 base out of the helix as shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) to improve open complex formation on Duplex DNA, results in only a small improvement of stable complex formation with the templates for which the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11&#x02009;A has been substituted by 2AP. This suggests that there is sequence recognition subsequent to removal of the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 base out of the helix and thus constitutes another demonstration that nucleation of strand separation is, at least, a two-step process.</p></sec><sec><title>The steps in the kinetic scheme affected by base analog substitutions at position <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 of Duplex DNA and amino acid substitutions at positions 430 and 433 of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup></title><p>Our results show that substitutions at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 in Duplex DNA, and Y430 and W433 of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> both increase the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> and the <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> for the stable complex. Ten-fold effects on the off-rate were seen for the substitution of the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A with 2AP, for the WT RNAP. However, for amino acid substitutions in &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> the effects on the <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> of complexes formed with either Duplex DNA or <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP Duplex are more modest (up to 4 fold). Interestingly, the Y430A (and L) RNAP tolerates substitutions at <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A better than the WT RNAP (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Both the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP substitution in Duplex DNA, and the three amino acid substitutions investigated had little, if any, effect on the <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> for stable complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) using a promoter with non-consensus <bold>&#x02212;</bold>10 and <bold>&#x02212;</bold>35 regions and on a longer piece of DNA with extensions in both directions, we found order of magnitude effects of single substitutions in &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> on the rates of formation of stable complexes, monitored just as in the experiments described here, by using EMSA subsequent to a heparin challenge. Here we did not detect such effects on <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub>, even though our experimental conditions should have readily allowed detection of both increases and decreases in its value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), as well as countless prior ones [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>)] also found significant effects on <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> of base substitutions in promoter DNA. A possible explanation for the discrepancy between our data and other work is the difference in length (Duplex is truncated at +1) and the fact that A and its base analog, 2AP, both have an unsubstituted N1 that may be important in the strand separation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Therefore, non-consensus <bold>&#x02212;</bold>35 and <bold>&#x02212;</bold>10 elements, as well as substitution of <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A with another base or base analog that changes the hydrogen bonding capabilities of the N1 position could affect on-rate. With regard to an abasic site at the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 position, our work confirms prior data suggesting that such a site causes a local disruption of the DNA helix in the surrounding area, thus aiding in RNAP-induced strand separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In any case, effects on the &#x02018;on&#x02019; and &#x02018;off&#x02009;&#x02019; rates would both be exerted at the rate limiting step, which is the I<sub>1</sub> to I<sub>2</sub> conversion in either direction. As I<sub>1</sub> is in rapid equilibrium with RP<sub>c</sub> and I<sub>2</sub> with RP<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), it is also possible that the mutations in either DNA or RNAP skew these equilibria towards RP<sub>c</sub>, thus decreasing the <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> on the one hand, or towards I<sub>2</sub>, thereby increasing the <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>, on the other.</p><p>We have no information on the equilibrium between RP<sub>c</sub> and I<sub>1</sub> (although the DNA bending step may not occur for our short Duplex promoter lacking DNA downstream of the +1 site), but our experiments did address whether the substitutions might lead to increased formation of stable complexes that are not strand separated (e.g. I<sub>2</sub>). In view of the good correlation between the EMSA (determination of stable complexes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and the KMnO<sub>4</sub> (determination of strand opening; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>) studies, there is no evidence for accumulation of I<sub>2</sub>, and consequently not for inhibition of the I<sub>2</sub> to RP<sub>o</sub> step, due to any substitutions in &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> or promoters. This is in contrast to published data, which showed that stable complexes of WT RNAP and a <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP containing promoter could still form, but that no strand separation could be detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Likely the actual promoter sequence plays a role as our group previously showed that strand separation could occur at another <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11 2AP-substituted promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) as well.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Substitutions at both <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A of promoter DNA, and Y430 and W433 of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> affect the I<sub>1</sub> to I<sub>2</sub>, and possibly also the RP<sub>c</sub> to I<sub>1</sub> step. This conclusion agrees with published work concerning the effects of the substitutions at Y430 and W433 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Our study of the roles of the Y253 and W256 residues of Taq &#x003c3;<sup>A</sup> (orthologs of Y430 and W433, respectively) also led to the conclusion that these amino acid residues participated in a step beyond the closed complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). We have additionally shown that the effects of substitutions in &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> (for Y430 and W433) and promoter DNA (for <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A) are cumulative, and that the Y430 and W433 may not participate in interactions with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A. While these conclusions are pertinent to the particular promoter used here, they are likely to be relevant to other promoters as well, although it is probable that exceptions will be encountered. The next task is to determine which amino acids interact with the <bold>&#x02212;</bold>11A, and which DNA bases, if any, interact with the Y430 and W433 residues of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>. Establishing the contacts between &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and promoter DNA that are necessary for open complex formation will be an important step towards understanding the mechanism of transcription initiation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank members of the deHaseth laboratory for advice and Dr Vernon Anderson, Dr Mark Caprara and Dr Mike Harris for their comments and suggestions.
