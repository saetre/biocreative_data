Changes in the enteric nervous system (ENS) observed during IBD include, modifications in morphology (neuronal hyperplasia and large internodal fiber tracts), neuromediator content of enteric neurons and changes in the function of enteric neurons (impaired release of neuromediators) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003304-Woolf1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. These changes in enteric neurons are likely to play a role in alterations in motility and secretory functions of the gastrointestinal tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003304-Vasina1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Neurotrophins such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) increase in inflamed tissues and NGF have been shown to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003304-diMola1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanisms by which dysregulated immune response initiates and perpetuates inflammatory intestinal injury are not entirely known. There is evidence that gastrointestinal inflammation is related to an imbalance in the function of peptidergic neurons, including Substance P (SP), Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) and NPY <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003304-Okajima1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003304-OConnor1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Neuropeptides like SP are up regulated in DSS model of experimental colitis, and there is increased expression of SP binding sites in UC and CD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003304-Mantyh1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The NPY family of neuropeptides, including NPY, peptide YY (PYY), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP), has been shown to elicit diverse biological functions including hypothalamic control of food intake, anxiety and sedation. These polypeptides are coupled to heptahelical G-protein coupled receptors. NPY receptor co localizes with NPY-producing nerve cells and is widely distributed in the enteric and the central nervous system (CNS).</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that neuropeptide Y (NPY) increases the number of nNOS (neuronal nitric oxide synthase) containing neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> and in NPY knock out (<italic>NPY<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) mice there is a reduction in nNOS neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003304-Anitha1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The nNOS produces nitric oxide (NO), a major Non-adrenergic Non-cholinergic (NANC) neurotransmitter, which mediates relaxation responses of smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. nNOS has been identified to play a role in a variety of enteric neuropathies like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, Chagas disease, diabetic gastroparesis, achalasia and pyloric stenosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003304-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The role and expression of NPY from enteric neurons in intestinal inflammation are not known.

Our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies now demonstrate that enteric neuronal cultures treated with NPY had increased nitrite levels, which indicates increased nitric oxide production.</p><p>Colonic oxidative stress is a hallmark of IBD and colonic nitrite levels serve as a sensitive marker of disease activity in colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003304-Rachmilewitz2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> . It has been demonstrated that increase in nitric oxide in colon in ulcerative colitis is from myenteric neurons and not epithelium or endothelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003304-Tomobuchi1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. There was further evidence of increased oxidative stress in the DSS-treated WT mice as seen by the significant increase in catalase activity and reduced GSH levels. Inflammatory cells may also contribute to elevated nitrite levels and catalase activity due to increased neutrophil infiltration (as evidenced by increased myeloperoxidase activity) that occurs in presence of NPY.</p><p>In order to validate the observation that NPY-mediated increase in nNOS is responsible for increased oxidative stress and subsequent damage in colitis, we used <italic>S.T.</italic> model to study the effect of the absence of nNOS as well as absence of both NPY and NOS in inflammation. We observed that inflammation was significantly reduced in <italic>nNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice as well as <italic>NPY<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/nNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>double knockouts. The presence of NPY in the <italic>nNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> could not help restore the <italic>S.T.</italic> induced inflammatory response. Isometric muscle recording data support reduced relaxation response in <italic>NPY<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, <italic>nNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>NPY<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/nNOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. This supports our hypothesis that NPY-nNOS induced nitric oxide is a major determinant of oxidative stress -induced damage in colitis.</p><p>It is known that post ganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers terminate in lymphoid organs and secrete NPY which regulates multiple physiological processes in the body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003304-Lundberg1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. NPY can also activate macrophages and immune cells, Th1 responses, and stimulate the production of various cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003304-Wheway1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003304-Dimitrijevic1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. TNF <italic>&#x02013;&#x003b1;</italic> production from the spinal cord neurons has been demonstrated in inflammatory central nervous system diseases like experimental allergic encephalomyelitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003304-Villarroya1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study has demonstrated that NPY has the capacity to stimulate TNF-&#x003b1; production from enteric neurons in culture. This observation highlights the fact that enteric neurons are additional sources of cytokines during inflammatory processes and that NPY-containing neurons make a significant contribution during an inflammatory process.</p><p>The increased severity of inflammation in the WT mice was also noted by functional impairment of neuronally-mediated muscle contractions and relaxations even after 5 weeks of DSS withdrawal. This indicates that neuronal damage secondary to inflammation can lead to long term gastrointestinal motility problems.</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrates that NPY from enteric neurons is up regulated during colitis and it can regulate the expression of nitric oxide synthase and subsequent nitric oxide production. Possible mechanisms of NPY-mediated inflammation are via increased oxidative stress and cytokine release. The inflammation in turn results in chronic impairment of GI motility. Taken together our data reveal that enteric neurons producing NPY play an important role in modulating inflammation in colitis. NPY-dependent mechanisms participate in the adaptive changes of neurons in response to injury/inflammation. We show that the enteric nervous system not only participates in the pathophysiology of inflammation, but also is affected as a consequence of inflammation. Persistence of the changes in enteric neurons in the recovery phase can explain some of the motility disturbances seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease even in the absence of inflammation. Hence targeting this neuropeptide may have a therapeutic value in managing inflammatory bowel disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Simon Mwangi, Ph.
