The last step, establishment of macroscopic tumors at distant sites, is the least well understood. Four isogenic mouse breast cancer cell lines (67NR, 168FARN, 4TO7, and 4T1) that differ in their ability to metastasize when implanted into the mammary fat pad are used to model the steps of metastasis. Only 4T1 forms macroscopic lung and liver metastases. Because some miRNAs are dysregulated in cancer and affect cellular transformation, tumor formation, and metastasis, we examined whether changes in miRNA expression might explain the differences in metastasis of these cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>miRNA expression was analyzed by miRNA microarray and quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR in isogenic mouse breast cancer cells with distinct metastatic capabilities. 4T1 cells that form macroscopic metastases had elevated expression of miR-200 family miRNAs compared to related cells that invade distant tissues, but are unable to colonize. Moreover, over-expressing miR-200 in 4TO7 cells enabled them to metastasize to lung and liver. These findings are surprising since the miR-200 family was previously shown to promote epithelial characteristics by inhibiting the transcriptional repressor Zeb2 and thereby enhancing E-cadherin expression. We confirmed these findings in these cells. The most metastatic 4T1 cells acquired epithelial properties (high expression of E-cadherin and cytokeratin-18) compared to the less metastatic cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Expression of miR-200, which promotes a mesenchymal to epithelial cell transition (MET) by inhibiting Zeb2 expression, unexpectedly enhances macroscopic metastases in mouse breast cancer cell lines. These results suggest that for some tumors, tumor colonization at metastatic sites might be enhanced by MET. Therefore the epithelial nature of a tumor does not predict metastatic outcome.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>miRNAs are small &#x0223c;22 nucleotide RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally in a sequence-specific manner to influence cell differentiation, survival and response to environmental cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Bartel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Dykxhoorn1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The former suggests that just as tumor-initiating cells with stem cell properties may be responsible for initiating a primary tumor, they also play an important role in initiating a metastasis. The latter suggests that in epithelial tumors, cells on the periphery of the tumor receive signals from the surrounding stroma, which confer mesenchymal properties allowing cells to detach from neighboring cells and become motile. These two competing theories may actually be complementary, since breast cancer stem cells have mesenchymal features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Yu1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-BenPorath1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Karnoub1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The EMT plays an important role in tissue remodeling during embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Baum1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. One of the hallmarks of EMT is loss of E-cadherin expression. E-cadherin is a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent transmembrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in the maintenance of cell polarity by mediating cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion. In addition, the intracellular domain of E-cadherin interacts with the cytoskeleton through its association with the catenins. The EMT involves the loss of cell-cell adherence through the repression of E-cadherin (Cdh1) expression and the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. This causes the cells to adopt a more elongated appearance resembling fibroblasts and facilitates cellular motility, a key event in tumor invasiveness. The EMT can be triggered by the expression of various transcription factors, including the E-box binding factors Snai1 (snail) and Snai2 (slug), in response to soluble factors present in the tumor microenvironment, such as TGF&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Peinado1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-MorenoBueno1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The transcriptional repressors, Zeb1 (TCF8 or &#x003b4;EF1) and Zeb2 (ZFXH1b or SIP1), suppress the epithelial phenotype by inhibiting E-cadherin expression. During normal development, the EMT can sometimes be reversed (referred to as the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET)) as a necessary step in tissue construction (for example, the formation of kidney epithelium from the nephric mesenchyme). Some recent studies suggest that a reversion of the mesenchymal phenotype of malignant cells may facilitate the establishment of macroscopic metastases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Berx1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Baum1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Wells1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The development of metastases requires that primary tumor cells acquire genetic or epigenetic variations that allow them to complete the required steps in metastasis - intravasation, survival in the circulatory system, extravasation, and survival and growth in distant tissues. Although miRNAs have been identified that regulate the formation of metastases, these studies have principally examined the early stages of metastasis and not the formation of macroscopic metastatic nodules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Ma1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Tavazoie1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. To begin to address factors that regulate the final step of metastasis (colonization of distant tissues), we took advantage of four well-characterized mouse mammary tumor cell lines derived from a single spontaneously arising, mammary tumor in a BALB/c mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Aslakson1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Although each of these tumor cells (67NR, 168FARN, 4TO7 and 4T1) is able to form primary tumors when implanted into the mammary gland of BALB/c mice, they have different metastatic properties. 67NR cells form primary tumors readily, but tumor cells do not intravasate. 168FARN cells can be detected in lymph nodes but rarely in other tissues, suggesting that they can enter the vasculature, but extravasate inefficiently. 4TO7 cells can disseminate from primary mammary tumors into the lungs but don't form visible lung nodules. Moreover, disseminated 4TO7 cells in the lungs rapidly disappear when the primary tumor is removed, suggesting that they are unable to colonize distant sites. 4T1 cells are fully metastatic and form macroscopic lung nodules from primary mammary tumors. Implantation of syngeneic breast tumor cells within the mammary gland of immunocompetent mice may more accurately mimic in vivo tumor formation in the context of all stromal factors than models involving xenotransplantation in immunodeficient mice.</p><p>Since 4TO7 cells can perform all of the steps in metastases except forming macroscopic metastatic nodules, we compared miRNA expression in 4TO7 cells with the highly metastatic 4T1 cells to determine if miRNAs might play a role in this important transition. Expression of some members of the miR-200 family of miRNAs (miR-429, miR-200b, and miR-200c) was increased more than 100-fold in 4T1 cells compared to 4TO7 cells. Although highly homologous, the miR-200 family members (miR-141, miR-429, miR-200a, miR-200b and miR-200c) can be divided into two functional groups based on their seed sequences, nucleotides 2 to 7 of the miRNA, which play an important role in target recognition. The 2 groups differ by a single seed nucleotide - miR-200b, miR-429 and miR-200c share the <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-AAUACU-3&#x02032;</named-content>seed sequence and miR-200a and miR-141 have the <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-AACACU-3&#x02032;</named-content> seed. In addition, they are encoded from 2 gene clusters in mice - miR-200c and miR-141 on chromosome 6 and miR-200b, miR-200a and miR-429 on chromosome 4. In agreement with recent papers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Bracken1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Peter1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, we found that the miR-200 family members target the transcriptional repressor Zeb2. As a consequence of Zeb2 silencing, E-cadherin levels increase, leading to the adoption of a more epithelial phenotype. However, unlike the published reports, we found that Zeb2 suppression and the resulting increase in E-cadherin enhanced the metastasis of 4TO7 cells, allowing them to form macroscopic lung nodules. These results suggest that reestablishing an epithelial-like phenotype may be important for effective colonization of distant tissue sites by some tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The miR-200 family is up-regulated in 4T1 cells</title><p>The most prominent change in miRNA expression by microarray analysis between the three cell lines not able to colonize distant sites (67NR, 168FARN and 4TO7 cells) and 4T1 cells was up-regulation of several members of the miR-200 family in 4T1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007181-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007181.s003">Table S1</xref>).

These microarray results were verified by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007181-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Higher expression of the miR-200 family in the cell line capable of forming distant metastases was unexpected since the miR-200 family has been linked to epithelial differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Bracken1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Hurteau1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> that is normally associated with decreased metastatic potential. In fact, expression of miR-429, miR-200b and miR-200c was elevated in the highly metastatic 4T1 cells but absent from 4TO7 cells, which can perform all of the steps leading up to the establishment of lung metastases except establishing the secondary tumor. Neither miR-200a nor miR-141 expression was detected in any of the cell lines, which is surprising since they would be expected to be co-expressed on the same primary transcript with the other clustered miRNAs. This suggests that either the specific probes for these miRNAs on the microarrays are not efficient at detecting these family members or that these isoforms might be differentially processed compared to the other family members, as has been recently shown to be the case for miR-181 family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Liu1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

Zeb2 mRNA levels were significantly higher in 67NR cells than in the other cell lines, which had similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007181-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The low expression of Zeb2 protein in 4T1 cells relative to 168FARN and 4TO7 cells is consistent with inhibition of Zeb2 translation by miR-200. However, other post-transcriptional mechanisms (including other miRNAs) might explain the lack of difference in Zeb2 protein between 67NR and 168FARN and 4TO7 cells. Consistent with the known repressive role of Zeb2 on E-cadherin transcription, 4T1 cells, which have low endogenous levels of Zeb2, have high E-cadherin mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007181-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>).

These data suggest that contrary to the EMT hypothesis, the nonmetastatic 67NR cells have a mesenchymal phenotype, while the metastatic cell lines have features of both mesenchymal and epithelial cells.

Although both of these cell lines can form primary tumors, intravasate, survive in the circulation and extravasate into the lungs, only the 4T1 cells form macroscopic metastases. The members of the miR-200 family of miRNAs (miR-200b, miR-200c and miR-429) were highly expressed in 4T1 cells but undetectable in 4TO7 cells. These miRNA were shown to target the transcriptional regulator, Zeb2. Zeb2, a master regulator of the mesenchymal state, exerts its effect by binding to E-box elements upstream of many genes, including E-cadherin, and repressing their transcription. As a consequence of miR-200 expression, 4T1 cells have reduced Zeb2 expression and high E-cadherin expression compared to 4TO7 cells. Consistent with this effect, 4T1 cells have an epithelial morphology with extensive cell-cell contacts while the 4TO7 cells looked more fibroblastic. Over-expression of miR-200b and/or miR-200c in 4TO7 cells, either by transient transfection of miRNA mimics or infection with a miR-141-200c cluster-expressing retrovirus, led to a loss of Zeb2 expression, an increase in E-cadherin expression and the acquisition of an epithelial-like morphology. This miRNA-mediated silencing of Zeb2 was the result of the directed targeting of the Zeb2 3&#x02032;UTR by the miR-200 family, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Bracken1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Peter1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies also showed that miR-200 expression enforces an epithelial phenotype in tumor cells, as we confirmed here in these mouse breast cancer cells. Based on the EMT hypothesis of cancer metastasis, it is expected that miR-200 expression would lead to a decrease in metastasis. Surprisingly, our results with this series of isogenic mouse mammary tumor cells showed the opposite effect - expression of miR-200 family members either endogenously in 4T1 cells or by retroviral transduction in 4TO7 cells enhanced both in vitro motility and in vivo metastases. In fact, in the 4 related cell lines that arose from the same spontaneously arising cancer cell clone, mesenchymal gene expression (N-cadherin, vimentin) was greatest in the nonmetastatic cell line (67NR) and decreased with increased metastatic potential, while epithelial gene expression of E-cadherin, CK-18 and EGFR followed the opposite trend. However, the 4T1 and miR-200-expressing 4TO7 cells retained some vimentin expression, suggesting that they may have some characteristics of both epithelial and mesenchymal cells.</p><p>Our results suggest that, at least in some tumors, epithelial properties may enhance the ability of tumor cells to colonize both primary and metastatic tissue sites. 4T1 cells and miR-200-expressing 4TO7 cells did not differ from parental 4TO7 cells in proliferative rate in vitro or growth in soft agar, but they both established primary tumors more rapidly and were capable of colonizing distant tissues. Although there was a delay in detecting 4TO7 primary tumors relative to 4T1 or miR-200-expressing 4TO7 tumors, once tumors became palpable, mathematical modeling did not show any significant change in their doubling times (data not shown). This suggests that epithelial characteristics enhanced colonization, but did not offer a growth advantage once a tumor had established itself.</p><p>Although the hypothesis that EMT is an important feature of metastasis has many compelling features and experimental support, other data suggest that metastasis by some tumors can be governed by processes other than EMT. The morphology and E-cadherin expression of metastatic tumors generally resembles that of the primary tumor. This has been interpreted as a potential requirement for EMT to accomplish the first steps of metastasis and a reversion (MET) to accomplish the final step of colonization. However, in this breast cancer model, the epithelial-like 4T1 cells could efficiently accomplish all the steps of metastasis, including the early steps. In fact, the more epithelial 4T1 and miR-200-expressing 4TO7 cells were better able to traverse an artificial basement membrane in vitro than their more mesenchymal relatives. However, the epithelial/mesenchymal properties of a tumor cell in vivo are not fixed. Properties of some tumor cells, particularly those at the periphery of the cancer that are closely associated with the tumor stroma, are plastic and can be modulated by response to stromal cytokines or binding to stromal receptor ligands. We cannot rule out that some of the 4T1 or miR-200-expressing 4TO7 cells transiently became E-cadherin- and more mesenchymal in vivo under the influence of local stromal factors. However, the more economical explanation of our surprising findings is that a complete EMT is not required for any of the metastatic steps in this tumor model. It may well be that these transformed cells are hybrid cells with some mesenchymal properties, as evidenced by their expression of vimentin mRNA and protein, that confer motility and invasive capability.</p><p>Although an inverse correlation between E-cadherin and invasiveness has been found for many cancers, abundant examples are inconsistent or contrary to this general assumption.

In each of these cases, the acquisition of epithelial characteristics enhanced the metastatic potential of the cells allowing for the transition from micrometastases to overt secondary tumors.</p><p>Several miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of early steps of breast cancer metastasis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Bracken2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>). miR-10b promoted metastatic transformation of breast cancer cells, while miR-373 and miR-520c enhanced extravasation and metastatic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Ma1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Huang1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. miR-21 has also been shown to inhibit the expression of multiple metastasis suppressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Yan1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Wickramasinghe1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. miR-29a has also been shown to promote mesenchymal properties and promote metastasis of Ras-transformed mouse mammary epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Gebeshuber1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, miR-335 and miR-126 inhibited metastatic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Tavazoie1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study, some of these miRNAs (miR-10b, miR-373, miR-520c and miR-29a) were not probed in our microarrays and others (miR-21, miR-126 and miR-335) showed no significant differences in expression amongst the 4 isogenic cell lines. There was a steady increase in miR-182 expression between the 67NR cells and the 4T1 cells with a 3.8-fold increase overall. These findings suggest that alterations in different miRNAs can regulate metastasis in different tumors. It is likely that multiple combinations of transforming mutations and alterations in miRNA expression can contribute to a metastatic phenotype. In particular, it would be worthwhile to examine whether the miR-200 family might have a role in regulating the metastasis of different human breast cancer subtypes.</p><p>Although this paper is the first to show the direct enhancement of metastasis by the miR-200 family, changes in miR-200 family levels have been associated with enhanced tumorigenesis. Croce and colleagues found that the miR-200 family (miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c and miR-141) were upregulated in human ovarian cancers compared to normal ovarian tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Iorio2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. This up-regulation of miR-200 family members was particularly pronounced in serous and endometroid histotypes. A subsequent study confirmed this result in serous ovarian cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Nam1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, over-expression of the miR-200 family significantly correlated with decreased survival. Patients with ovarian tumors with high miR-200a expression had an approximately 50&#x00025; decrease in median survival time compared to those lacking significant miR-200a expression (27.5 months vs. 61 months, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Nam1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>). The region on chromosome 1 from which the human miR-200a-429 cluster is encoded was also found to be amplified in several epithelial cancers - ovarian cancer, breast cancer and melanoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Zhang1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. This same region was found to undergo chromosomal gain in serous ovarian carcinoma samples when examined by high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Zhang1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Kim1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, members of the miR-200 family of miRNAs, miR-141 and miR-200b, were found to be over-expressed in malignant cholangiocarcinoma cells compared to non-malignant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Meng1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. The chromosomal locus (12p13.31) from which miR-141 and miR-200c are encoded is associated with chromosomal gain in biliary tract cancers. Over-expression of miR-141 or miR-200b is associated with an increase in proliferation, while inhibition of these miRNAs impairs cell proliferation. In addition, over-expression of miR-141 and miR-200b correlates with resistance to gemcitabine treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007181-Meng1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The formation of metastases requires the acquisition of genetic or epigenetic changes that allow for the detachment of cells from the primary tumor, transport and survival in the circulation and the establishment of macroscopic tumors in distant organs. Given the heterogeneity of oncogenic changes associated with different tumor subtypes, it is likely that more than one pathway can promote metastases. It is clear from this work and that of others that miRNAs play an important role in regulating metastasis, the ultimate cause of death of most cancer patients. Approaches that alter miRNA expression levels, either inhibiting miRNAs that promote the development of metastases or mimicking miRNAs that promote differentiation and apoptosis, may prove to be therapeutically beneficial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>67NR, 168FARN, 4TO7 and 4T1 cells, a kind gift of Fred Miller (Wayne State University) were grown in complete medium, DMEM (Gibco) containing 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented with 1 mM L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin and non-essential amino acids (Gibco).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>miRNA microarray and data analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) and size fractionated using an YM-100 Microcon filter (Millipore).
