Moreover, the phenotypes we observe reflect decreased epithelial Shh signaling, yet increased mesenchymal Shh signaling. For example, the latter contributes to exuberant hair follicle (HF) induction, while the former depletes the resulting follicular stem cell niches. This disruption of the niche apparently also allows the remaining stem cells to initiate hair formation at inappropriate times. Thus, the temporal structure of the hair cycle may depend on the physical structure of the niche. Finally, we find that the ablation of epithelial Shh signaling results in unexpected transformations: the follicular outer root sheath takes on an epidermal character, and certain HFs disappear altogether, having adopted a strikingly mammary gland-like fate. Overall, our study uncovers&#x000a0;a multifaceted function for Shh in sculpting and maintaining the integrity and identity of the developing HF.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DEVBIO</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mature HF is a complex organ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). Postnatally, it consists of an ectodermally derived hair shaft surrounded in its sub-epidermal portion by an inner root sheath (IRS). The shaft and IRS are formed through terminal differentiation of transiently proliferating cells of the hair matrix. The outer root sheath (ORS) encases the entire HF and is continuous with the basal layer of the epidermis. The companion layer separates the IRS from the ORS. The HF mesenchyme consists of a dermal papilla (DP), which is crucial for proliferation of matrix cells (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Jahoda and Reynolds, 1993</xref>), and the connective tissue sheath (CTS). The epithelium of a follicle cycles through sequential phases of rapid growth (anagen), apoptotic regression (catagen), and quiescence (telogen). In response to signals from the DP, stem cells located in a nested area of the ORS, the bulge, give rise to transiently proliferating keratinocytes (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Costarelis et&#x000a0;al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>A myriad of molecules belonging to several signaling pathways interact in a tightly controlled manner to assist HF formation (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt-Ullrich and Paus, 2005</xref>). Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is crucial for hair development and cycling, and the deregulated function of members of the Shh signaling cascade alters HF formation and generates epidermal neoplasia (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">McMahon et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Lack of Shh impinges upon HF growth and morphogenesis (<xref rid="bib32 bib4" ref-type="bibr">St-Jacques et&#x000a0;al., 1998; Chiang et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). Whether this is a primary defect intrinsic to the epithelium or results from abnormal epithelial-mesenchymal interaction could not be addressed in that model. Despite strong evidence suggesting a major role for epithelial Gli2 in controlling HF morphogenesis, some types of HF develop normally in <italic>Gli2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> skin, indicating different requirements for Gli2 function depending on HF type (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Mill et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). The conditional ablation of <italic>Smoothened</italic> (Smo; an obligatory component for all Hedgehog signaling) in the HF epithelium allows this issue to be investigated. In contrast to <italic>Gli2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> skin (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Mill et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>), our findings indicated that loss of epithelial Smo activity leads to severely altered growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation of all HF and to hyperplasia of the interfollicular epidermis (IFE). Further, dorsal and ventral mesenchymal cells have been shown to differ not only in their embryonic origin but also in their ability to respond to environmental cues (<xref rid="bib20 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Mauger, 1972; Lowe et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). We have examined these differences with respect to Hedgehog (Hh) signaling following epithelial Smo removal. Finally, we provide insight into the consequences of absence of Shh signaling on the follicular stem cell niche.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Removal of Smo Activity in the Ectoderm and Its Derivatives</title><p>To determine the specific role of Shh in the epithelium of the developing HF, we abrogated Shh responsiveness in skin keratinocytes by K14-Cre-mediated inactivation of a conditional <italic>Smo</italic> allele (<italic>floxed; [K14-Cre; Smo <sup>f/f</sup>]</italic>) or by Shh-dependent removal using a <italic>Shhgfp-Cre</italic> knockin allele.

By 1 dpp, mutants showed abnormal epithelial invaginations associated with dc or DP instead of typical HF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>E).

Starting at 7 dpp, epithelial buds resembling early HF as they were underlain by dc or encased a DP developed from the ORS of pre-existing follicles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>H and 1J). The number of follicles exhibiting these features as well as the size and number of follicles emanating from pre-existing ones increased progressively with age. In control mice aged 2&#x02013;3 months, HF were at the resting telogen phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>K). At this stage, the mutants displayed huge follicles, many of which exhibited as many as 5&#x02013;7 new follicles that emanated from their ORS. The new follicles were associated with dc or DP and formed rudimentary hair shafts, indicating de novo folliculogenesis, i.e., late postnatal development of HF that are normally established only during embryogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>L). New follicles also emerged from pre-existing de novo-formed ones. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>M). Furthermore, epithelial invaginations associated with dc/DP were detected in the IFE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>N), indicating de novo follicular formation from the IFE, with the first ones initiating at 12 dpp (data not shown). The mutant follicles converted progressively into cysts filled with cornified debris (remnants of degenerated keratinocytes).</p><p>Throughout all stages in mutants, the IFE was hyperplastic and the dermis showed hypercellularity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B&#x02013;1O).

Only a few follicles exhibited sebaceous glands.</p><p>Some of the above phenotypes, such as the failure of hair follicle morphogenesis, are consistent with known requirements for Shh signaling. However, the presence of ectopic dc/DP and associated HF, and the hyperplasia of the IFE, are phenotypes that one might have expected from increased Shh signaling rather than a loss of Shh responsiveness. We therefore entertained the hypothesis that the loss of epithelial Shh signaling, and thus epithelial Ptc expression, would lead to decreased Shh turnover and thus to increased steady-state levels of Shh available to signal to the mesenchyme.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Altered Shh Signaling in the Absence of Smo Activity</title><p><italic>Smo</italic> is expressed in both the epithelium and mesenchyme of HF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2B).

Many others were underlain by dc that clearly diluted the label, indicating rapid proliferation, a feature that was not observed in control HF.

Statistical analysis was made by using Student's t test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="app1" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplemental Data</title><p>Supplemental Data include Supplemental Results, Supplemental Experimental Procedures, Two Tables, and Eight Figures and are available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.developmentalcell.com/cgi/content/full/12/1/99/DC1/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.developmentalcell.com/cgi/content/full/12/1/99/DC1/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="app2" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplemental Data</title><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc1"><caption><title>Document S1.

The hair matrix consists of proliferating cells (green) encasing the dermal papilla (magenta). Upon differentiation, matrix cells produce the concentric rings of cells that generate the hair shaft (dark brown) and inner root sheath (IRS; light brown). The upper matrix contains melanocytes (black). The outer root sheath (ORS; red) is continuous with the basal layer (blue) of the epidermis. The companion layer (orange) separates the ORS from the IRS. The ORS contains follicular stem cells nested in the bulge niche underneath the sebaceous gland (yellow). The HF is surrounded by connective tissue sheath cells (CTS; violet). Dermal cells are shown as dots. In contrast to the HF permanent segment, the cycling lower segment undergoes phases of growth and degeneration.</p><p>(B&#x02013;O) Skin sections from control (B, D, F, I, and K) and <italic>K14-Cre; Smo<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mutant (C, E, G, H, J, and L&#x02013;O) mice stained with Ladewig's (B&#x02013;G) or Alcian Blue-van Gieson (H&#x02013;O) stains.
