This disorder is characterized by excessive day time sleepiness, inappropriate triggering of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and cataplexy, which is a sudden loss of muscle tone during waking. It is still not known how HCRT regulates REM sleep or muscle tone since HCRT neurons are localized only in the lateral hypothalamus while REM sleep and muscle atonia are generated from the brainstem. To identify a potential neuronal circuit, the neurotoxin hypocretin-2-saporin (HCRT2-SAP) was used to lesion neurons in the ventral lateral periaquaductal gray (<italic>vl</italic>PAG). The first experiment utilized hypocretin knock-out (HCRT-<italic>ko</italic>) mice with the expectation that deletion of both HCRT and its target neurons would exacerbate narcoleptic symptoms. Indeed, HCRT<italic>-ko</italic> mice (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;8) given the neurotoxin HCRT2-SAP (16.5 ng/23nl/sec each side) in the <italic>vl</italic>PAG had levels of REM sleep and sleep fragmentation that were considerably higher compared to HCRT<italic>-ko</italic> given saline (&#x0002b;39&#x00025;; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7) or wildtype mice (&#x0002b;177&#x00025;; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9). However, cataplexy attacks did not increase, nor were levels of wake or non-REM sleep changed. Experiment 2 determined the effects in mice where HCRT was present but the downstream target neurons in the <italic>vl</italic>PAG were deleted by the neurotoxin. This experiment utilized an FVB-transgenic strain of mice where eGFP identifies GABA neurons. We verified this and also determined that eGFP neurons were immunopositive for the HCRT-2 receptor. <italic>vl</italic>PAG lesions in these mice increased REM sleep (&#x0002b;79&#x00025; versus saline controls) and it was significantly correlated (r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.89) with loss of eGFP neurons. These results identify the <italic>vl</italic>PAG as one site that loses its inhibitory control over REM sleep, but does not cause cataplexy, as a result of hypocretin deficiency.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons containing the neuropeptide hypocretin (HCRT), also known as orexin are located in the lateral hypothalamus and hypothesized to inhibit REM sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Peyron1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Thannickal1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The benefits of using mice are that a murine model of narcolepsy exists and it provides a valuable tool to identify the circuitry underlying the disease. Moreover, transgenic mouse models exist where a reporter gene, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), marks a specific phenotype of neurons and these could be used to ferret out the pharmacology of the <italic>vl</italic>PAG neurons. Therefore, the present study tests the hypothesis that <italic>vl</italic>PAG neurons are inhibitory to REM sleep by destroying these neurons and determining whether there is an increase in REM sleep. To destroy the <italic>vl</italic>PAG neurons a novel neurotoxin, hypocretin-2 conjugated to saporin (HCRT2-SAP), is used. The results reveal that <italic>vl</italic>PAG lesioned mice have a significant increase in REM sleep thereby identifying a hypocretin-to-<italic>vl</italic>PAG circuit that inhibits REM sleep.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Experiment 1: Effects of <italic>vl</italic>PAG lesions in HCRT-null mice</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice (20&#x02013;35 g) homozygous with respect to the deletion of the hypocretin gene on both alleles (HCRT<italic>-ko</italic> n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;18) were identified through PCR of tail snips.

HCRT-ko mice were obtained from Dr. Masashi Yanagisawa and Dr. Takeshi Sakurai and a breeding colony was established in our facility at the VA Boston Healthcare System in West Roxbury. The mice have been backcrossed for more than 20 generations on a C57BL/6J line and are congenic with respect to the C57BL/6J strain. Our recently published data from wildtype (C57BL/6J) mice (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9) were also used and provided a record of the normal sleep-wake pattern in this strain for comparison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Liu1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The WT mice were recorded at the same time and under the same conditions as the other mice in this study. The methods used to record and analyze the sleep data were the same for all mice. All animals were maintained on a 12&#x02236;12 h light-dark cycle with ad- libitum access to water and food. All experiments were conducted as per the guidelines of the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) and approved by the VA Boston Healthcare System's Institution Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>Mice were implanted with sleep recording electrodes under isofluorane (4&#x00025; for induction; 1.5&#x00025; for maintenance) anesthesia as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Shiromani1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, four jeweler's screws were inserted into the skull (two each atop the frontal and occipital cortex) and were used to record the electroencephalogram (EEG). Two flexible wires were inserted into the nuchal muscles and recorded the electromyogram (EMG). These electrodes were inserted into a plastic plug and secured to the skull with dental cement. The head of the mouse was adjusted on the nose bar so that bregma and lambda were at level height. At this time a single glass pipette (10&#x02013;15 &#x000b5;m, tip diameter) was lowered into the <italic>vl</italic>PAG target area (relative to bregma)(anterior-posterior&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x02212;5.0; medial-lateral&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x000b1;0.8 mm; ventral to dura&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x02212;2.5 mm) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Franklin1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and either HCRT2-SAP (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;11; 16.5 ng/23 nl/sec each side; Advanced Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA) or saline (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7; 0.9&#x00025;, 23 nl/sec each side) were injected by a nanoliter pump (Nanoliter 2000, World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, Fl). The glass pipette was left in place for a minute and then slowly withdrawn. Once outside the brain the patency of the pipette was confirmed by the appearance of a small droplet of either HCRT-SAP or saline at the tip of the pipette. HCRT2-SAP or saline were applied bilaterally to the <italic>vl</italic>PAG.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>Recording of sleep and analysis of sleep data</title><p>After surgery all mice were housed singly in plastic cages with corn bedding. A week after surgery the mice were connected to flexible cables for recording sleep. Fifteen days after the injection the animal's sleep-wake patterns were recorded for 48 h.</p><p>The temperature in the sleep recording room was 22&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C and a 12&#x02236;12 h light-dark cycle (7AM-7PM lights on; 100 lux) was maintained. Contralateral frontal-occipital EEG screw electrodes were used for EEG acquisition. The EEG data was filtered at 70 Hz (low pass filter) and 0.3 KHz (high pass filter) using a Grass polygraph and continuously sampled by the data acquisition program (Icelus software, developed by Mark Opp, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) at sampling rate of 128 Hz.</p><p>The EEG and EMG recordings were scored manually on a computer (Icelus software; Mark Opp, Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) in 12 second epochs for wake, non-REM sleep and REM sleep by staff blind to the treatment. Wakefulness was identified by the presence of desynchronized EEG and high EMG activity. Non-REM sleep consisted of high amplitude slow waves together with a low EMG tone relative to waking. REM sleep was identified by the presence of regular EEG theta activity coupled with low EMG relative to slow wave sleep. After the EEG data were scored, the code was broken to reveal the identity of each mouse. The percent of time spent in wakefulness, non-REM and REM was determined for each hour. Two way-ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak post-hoc test for multiple comparisons was used to compare changes in sleep parameters within the genotypes for the different treatment groups. Statistical significance was evaluated at the P&#x0003c;0.05 level.</p><p>The EEG and EMG recordings were also examined for signs of cataplexy, which is defined as a sudden loss of muscle tone during an awake episode.

Cataplexy was identified if the mouse was awake for more than 2 minutes and then experienced a sudden loss of muscle tone. During these bouts, the EEG had diminished delta activity and predominant theta activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2a4"><title>Immunohistochemistry to identify site of lesion</title><p>At the end of the experiment, the mice were euthanized (overdose of pentobarbital) and perfused transcardially with 20 ml phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature followed by 50 ml paraformaldehyde (4&#x00025;) in phosphate buffer. The brains were removed and post fixed overnight in the same fixative and then transferred to 30&#x00025; sucrose until it equilibrated. The brains were cut in a cryostat and 40 &#x000b5; thick coronal sections obtained (1 in 4 series). The free floating sections were immunostained for NeuN (mouse anti-NeuN, MAB377, 1&#x02236; 1K; Millipore, MA), followed by biotinylated-secondary antibodies.

The brains were cut as mentioned above in experiment 1 and the free floating sections were immunostained for GFP (rabbit anti-GFP, 1&#x02236; 20K; Millipore, MA) and NeuN (mouse anti-NeuN, MAB377, 1&#x02236; 1K; Millipore, MA), followed by the respective biotinylated-secondary antibodies. The secondary reaction for the GFP was then visualized using the ABC-DAB and for visualizing the NeuN, we used ABC-AP Vector Red (SK-5100, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Extent of lesion was marked by the boundary of the neuronal loss as seen by the NeuN staining and loss of the GFP neurons. The spread of the GFP neurons in the <italic>vl</italic>PAG area were plotted using a drawing tube and counted in both the lesion and control groups.

However, cataplexy, wakefulness, or non-REM sleep were unaffected. When only the <italic>vl</italic>PAG neurons were lesioned REM sleep increased at night, but cataplexy was not triggered. This suggests that the lesioned neurons in the <italic>vl</italic>PAG inhibit REM sleep but not cataplexy. Since the effects were exacerbated in HCRT-ko mice, the vlPAG neurons receive other excitatory inputs, besides HCRT which serves to inhibit REM sleep.</p><p>In the present study HCRT2-SAP was used to lesion <italic>vl</italic>PAG neurons. Previously, we demonstrated that the neurotoxin binds to HCRT receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Gerashchenko1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing either HCRT-1 or HCRT-2 receptors were exposed to HCRT2-SAP. As negative control, we used KNRK cells (Kirsten murine sarcoma virus transformed Normal Rat Kidney cells) expressing the substance-P receptor. This control tested binding of the HCRT2-SAP to bind to other peptide receptors. Fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was used and determined that, indeed, HCRT2-SAP bound to the HCRT receptor but not the substance-P receptor. As a positive control we determined that substance-P-saporin bound to its receptor. We have also demonstrated that HCRT2-SAP kills neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus that contain the HCRT-2 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Gerashchenko3">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas the neurons in the locus coeruleus, which contain the HCRT-1 receptor are relatively resistant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-BlancoCenturion1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Even in the lateral hypothalamus, some neurons are spared <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Gerashchenko1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. There is no evidence that HCRT2-SAP is transported retrogradely or anterogradely to kill neurons distal to the target site. Moreover, in the present study we did not find any observable evidence of loss of neurons in areas adjacent to the <italic>vl</italic>PAG such as the LC or DRN. Unconjugated saporin did not produce a degree of loss of neurons relative to the conjugated saporin.</p><p>The vlPAG area has been lesioned in the cat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Petitjean1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and rat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Lu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> but this is the first study to lesion it in mice. Considering that in the present study the lesions produced a similar effect on REM sleep in two separate strains of mice, we suggest that the lesioned pontine area inhibits REM sleep. In the present study, the extent of the lesioned area was based on the boundary of loss of NeuN immunoreactivity and encompassed the vlPAG. The lesioned area in the present study in mice was much smaller compared to the vlPAG lesions in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Lu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> indicating that a small pontine area inhibits REM sleep. Another area lateral to the vlPAG called the lateral pontine tegmentum (LPT) by one group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Lu1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and the deep mesencephalic reticular nucleus (DPMe) by another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Luppi1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> is also implicated in inhibiting REM sleep and cataplexy. In the present study, lesions may have encroached into the LPT, but more complete lesions of this area need to be made in HCRT-ko mice to fully understand its role in REM sleep.</p><p>In experiment 1 HCRT<italic>-ko</italic> mice were used. These mice have cataplexy, increased REM sleep at night, and more fragmented sleep architecture compared to WT mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Chemelli1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. We reasoned that if the <italic>vl</italic>PAG neurons are important regulators of REM sleep and muscle tone then deletion of both the ligand and the target neurons in the <italic>vl</italic>PAG should have an additive effect on REM sleep and cataplexy. <italic>vl</italic>PAG lesion in the HCRT<italic>-ko</italic> mice increased REM sleep (&#x0002b;39&#x00025; compared to HCRT<italic>-ko</italic>; &#x0002b;177&#x00025; compared to WT), number of bouts of REM sleep, and further fragmented sleep architecture. The lesions did not affect cataplexy, non-REM sleep or wakefulness.</p><p>Experiment 2 determined the effects in a system where HCRT was present but the neurons in the <italic>vl</italic>PAG were deleted. The effects of deletion of neurons in the <italic>vl</italic>PAG on sleep in mice are unknown. The HCRT<italic>-ko</italic> mice used in experiment 1 have a C57BL/6J background. Rather than lesion the <italic>vl</italic>PAG in C57BL/6J wildtype mice, which we reasoned would only incrementally advance our understanding of the network we chose a different strain of mice, the FVB strain. This strain like the C57BL/6J is also an inbred strain, but it is preferred for transgenic analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Taketo1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. We chose an FVB strain where eGFP is expressed in GABA neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Oliva1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. We reasoned that another strain of mice, one where the phenotype of underlying neurons could be more easily identified with reporter genes such as eGFP, would facilitate tract-tracing and pharmacology. For instance, in electrophysiology studies the eGFP neurons could be recorded in a slice preparation to identify the pharmacology of these neurons. Therefore, we selected the FVB strain, since in these transgenics eGFP is driven by a murine Gad-1 gene (one of the Gad isoforms) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Oliva1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>First, we verified that virtually all of the eGFP neurons in the <italic>vl</italic>PAG were also GABA positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006346-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), and then determined that these neurons were also immunoreactive for the HCRT-2 receptor antibody. A previous report identified HCRT receptor mRNA in the <italic>vl</italic>PAG of rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Marcus1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, but in the present study immunohistochemistry determined that HCRT-2 receptor was present in eGFP/GABA neurons in the mouse <italic>vl</italic>PAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006346-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). The HCRT-receptor 2 antibody that was used has recently been tested to be specific to HCRT-2 receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Brischoux1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study HCRT-2 receptor immunoreactivity was not found in the locus coeruleus where instead the HCRT-1 receptor is present. These verifications are a necessary first step because now these transgenic mice can be used in electrophysiology or anatomical tract tracing studies to identify the role of the GABA vlPAG neurons in the REM sleep circuit.</p><p>The second step was to determine the effects of lesion of the <italic>vl</italic>PAG in the FVB strain of mice. <italic>vl</italic>PAG lesion in the FVB-GFP transgenic mice produced a 79&#x00025; increase in REM sleep at night, and a 43&#x00025; increase over the 24 h period compared to non-lesioned transgenic mice. The loss of the GFP neurons in the <italic>vl</italic>PAG was positively correlated (r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.889) with REM sleep. The lesioned mice also slept more at night compared to non-lesioned mice. Lesions of the <italic>vl</italic>PAG produced a significant increase in the number of REM sleep bouts and decrease in the length of wake bouts during the night phase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006346-t001">Table-1</xref>). No bouts of cataplexy were evident. Thus, use of the GFP transgenic line bolstered the results from experiment 1. More importantly, this study demonstrates the benefits of these transgenic mice in sleep studies.</p><p>Experiment 3 was performed to identify inputs to the <italic>vl</italic>PAG. There was a prominent input from the wake active areas such as the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), posterior lateral hypothalamus (pLH), lateral hypothalamus (LH), tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) and lateral pontine tegmentum (LPT). Additionally, neurons from the central nucleus of the amygdala, and perirhinal cortex project to the <italic>vl</italic>PAG.</p><p>What is the significance of this input to the vlPAG? The perirhinal cortex plays an important role in memory especially with the novelty and familiarity of objects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Holscher1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, and it interacts with the hippocampus to strengthen memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Muir1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The input from the central nucleus of the amygdala would be relevant for emotion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-LeDoux1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Both of these may help direct the animal to a familiar food source. The inputs from the VMH and LH would arouse the animal because glucosensing neurons in these regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Levin1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> respond to a very narrow range of glucose levels (0.1 to 2.5 mmol/l). A lower glucose level, which is likely at the end of a rodent's sleep period (during the day in nocturnal rodents), would activate arousal neurons so that the animal can forage for food and restore energy balance. Indeed, the HCRT neurons are activated by low glucose levels and shut-off when the glucose levels increase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Yamanaka1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, we suggest that the projections from areas associated with memory, emotion, glucosensing and arousal neurons would have an excitatory influence on the <italic>vl</italic>PAG GABA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006346-g015">Figure 15</xref>). We suggest that the activation of the <italic>vl</italic>PAG GABA circuit prevents the animal from entering into REM sleep thereby enabling it to maintain the proper posture and vigilance required for foraging and feeding.</p><fig id="pone-0006346-g015" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006346.g015</object-id><label>Figure 15</label><caption><title>Model of neuronal populations that regulate wake, non-REM sleep and REM sleep (9, 13, 16).</title><p>There are several neuronal populations that are considered to generate wakefulness and these are identified in yellow. Neurons that are considered to generate non-REM sleep are identified in blue. Both of these neuronal populations act on neurons in the pontine brainstem (red) and influence the generation of rapid-eye movement sleep (REM sleep). Wake-on neurons inhibit REM sleep by activating pontine GABA neurons in the pons. The strength of the excitatory input to the pontine GABA neurons influences REM sleep. A strong input will inhibit REM sleep while a weakened input will facilitate it. During non-REM sleep the excitatory input to the pontine GABA neurons is lost and is replaced by a strong inhibitory input. This enables REM sleep generator neurons (green) to become active and when sufficient numbers of these are activated then REM sleep ensues. In the present paper we tested this model by lesioning the neurons in the ventral lateral periaquaductal gray area (vlPAG), and found that REM sleep was significantly increased. When these neurons were lesioned in the hypocretin knockout mice (HCRT-<italic>ko</italic>) then the REM sleep increase was exacerbated compared to HCRT-ko mice without vlPAG lesion. The SLD has been lesioned in rats (12,16) but not mice and there is an increase in REM sleep supporting the hypothesis of PAIRS.

Together these inputs excite the <italic>vl</italic>PAG GABA neurons to inhibit REM sleep. Considering that REM sleep was further increased after vlPAG lesions in HCRT-ko mice is evidence that other non-HCRT input to the <italic>vl</italic>PAG acts to inhibit REM sleep. The neurotoxin may have also destroyed non-HCRT receptor bearing neurons, and this may also have had an additive effect.</p><p>An important finding of this study was that lesions of the <italic>vl</italic>PAG area increased REM sleep but not cataplexy. The HCRT-2 receptor is widely present on the <italic>vl</italic>PAG neurons, including the eGFP/GABA neurons and all of these neurons were likely lesioned by the neurotoxin, but only REM sleep increased. Cataplexy is a state that is distinct from REM sleep both at the behavioral and electrophysiological level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Thankachan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, and therefore the neural circuit that triggers it is also likely to be separate. Since cataplexy was not affected it is possible that neurons regulating muscle tone were not lesioned (since they do not contain the HCRT receptor) or that the cataplexy neurons are not located in the <italic>vl</italic>PAG. The second possibility is likely since in a recent study we directly monitored the electrophysiological activity of <italic>vl</italic>PAG neurons and did not find any cataplexy-on neurons in the <italic>vl</italic>PAG of HCRT<italic>-ko</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Thankachan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>What is the activity of <italic>vl</italic>PAG neurons during wake, non-REM sleep, REM sleep and cataplexy? This question has now been answered by our group in a study that directly monitored the electrophysiological activity of <italic>vl</italic>PAG neurons during sleep-wake states and cataplexy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Thankachan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. We monitored the activity of <italic>vl</italic>PAG neurons in HCRT<italic>-ko</italic> mice and found that 64&#x00025; of neurons sampled (28 of 44) were active during both wake and REM sleep, 27&#x00025; (12 of 44) were wake-active, and 9&#x00025; (4 of 44) were active during REM sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Thankachan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. No neurons were active during cataplexy. Such a study has not been done in canine narcolepsy where neuronal activity during cataplexy can also be recorded. The range of activity across sleep-wake states is consistent with data in the cat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Thakkar1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, on the basis of electrophysiology most (40/44) <italic>vl</italic>PAG neurons are either wake-active or wake-REM active. Since they are active during wake they are likely driven by HCRT, possess the HCRT receptor and lesioned in the present study. Particularly interesting and relevant to this study was that a subset (9&#x00025;) of <italic>vl</italic>PAG neurons were more active during REM sleep compared to waking, non-REM sleep or cataplexy. We suggest that these neurons may be key to REM sleep generation, but not cataplexy and their activity may underlie the increased REM sleep in the present study. Juxtacellular recording of <italic>vl</italic>PAG neurons in the FVB-GFP mice could elucidate the circuit. Moreover, it is important to determine projections of these GFP-GABA neurons.</p><p>This is the first study to find an additive effect of deletion of both HCRT and HCRT receptor bearing neurons in the pons. These results underscore the importance of <italic>vl</italic>PAG neurons in regulating REM sleep. Upon discovery of the link between HCRT and REM sleep, initial models emphasized the role of the locus coeruleus (LC) and the histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) in controlling REM sleep. Both the LC and the TMN receive among the heaviest projections of HCRT neurons. However, specific lesions of both these targets, either single lesion or in combination (triple), do not increase REM sleep <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-BlancoCenturion2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, even in mice lacking both HCRT and the norepinephrine synthesizing enzyme, dopamine beta hydroxylase, i.e., a double knockout, there is no additive effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006346-Hunsley1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The vlPAG is one pontine area that inhibits REM sleep (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006346-g015">Figure 15</xref>).

Thus, multiple pontine areas inhibit REM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006346-g015">Fig. 15</xref>). Because lesions of these areas and/or a hypocretin deficiency typically increase REM sleep at night, it will be important to determine the effects such lesions in diurnal rodents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006346.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Effect of unconjugated saporin (SAP) on vlPAG neurons in a representative wildtype C57BL/6J mouse.
