Although <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> express only a single protein corresponding to UAP56, mRNAs encoding URH49 and UAP56 are both expressed in human and mouse cells. Both proteins interact with the mRNA export factor Aly and both are able to rescue the loss of Sub2p (the yeast homolog of UAP56), indicating that both proteins have similar functions. UAP56 mRNA is more abundant than URH49 mRNA in many tissues, although in testes URH49 mRNA is much more abundant. UAP56 and URH49 mRNAs are present at similar levels in proliferating cultured cells. However, when the cells enter quiescence, the URH49 mRNA level decreases 3&#x02013;6-fold while the UAP56 mRNA level remains relatively constant. The amount of URH49 mRNA increases to the level found in proliferating cells within 5 h when quiescent cells are growth-stimulated or when protein synthesis is inhibited. URH49 mRNA is relatively unstable (T<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> &#x0003d; 4 h) in quiescent cells, but is stabilized immediately following growth stimulation or inhibition of protein synthesis. In contrast, there is much less change in the content or stability of UAP56 mRNA following growth stimulation. Our observations suggest that in mammalian cells, two UAP56-like RNA helicases are involved in splicing and nuclear export of mRNA. Differential expression of these helicases may lead to quantitative or qualitative changes in mRNA expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The production of mature mRNA in eukaryotes involves a complex series of nuclear processing reactions, including addition of the 5&#x02032; cap, removal of introns and addition of the 3&#x02032; poly(A) tail, followed by the export of the fully processed mRNA to the cytoplasm. These reactions are highly interdependent and occur co-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c3">3</xref>). In metazoans, the removal of introns results in the deposition of a protein complex (the exon junction complex) on the RNA molecule immediately upstream of the splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c4">4</xref>). Proteins in this complex play important roles in nuclear export, cytoplasmic localization and translation, as well as nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c8">8</xref>).</p><p>RNA processing and export involve multiple sequential interactions between the substrate RNA and a variety of proteins and ribonucleoprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c10">10</xref>). Remodeling of many of these RNA&#x02013;RNA or RNA&#x02013;protein complexes is facilitated by members of a conserved family of proteins that contain a DExH/D motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c12">12</xref>). Proteins in this family are believed to function as RNA helicases that disrupt RNA&#x02013;RNA or RNA&#x02013;protein complexes. Genetic and biochemical analyses have shown that at least eight different RNA helicases are required during the splicing reaction in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c11">11</xref>), and even more appear to be important in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c10">10</xref>). The specific reactions that are carried out by many of the helicases have been defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c17">17</xref>).</p><p>UAP56 (also known as Sub2p, HEL, BAT1, HLA-B-associated transcript 1, RAF-2p48 and NPI-5) is a DExD/H protein that has been shown to play important roles in the splicing reaction as well as in nuclear export of mature mRNA. In the splicing reaction, UAP56 facilitates the association of U2 snRNP with the splice branch point, presumably by dissociating U2AF65 from the polypyrimidine track downstream of the splice branchpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c19">19</xref>). This conclusion is supported by the observation that in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, SUB2 can be made dispensable by deleting the gene encoding Mud2p, the yeast homolog of mammalian U2AF65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c20">20</xref>), indicating that Sub2p and Mud2p counteract each other&#x02019;s function.</p><p>UAP56 also has a second important role in coupling mRNA splicing with nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c23">23</xref>). UAP56, one of the components of the exon junction complex, recruits the adaptor protein Aly/REF (Yra1p in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>) to the mRNA, and Aly/REF subsequently interacts with the heterodimeric export factor TAP/NXF1:p15, leading to the efficient export of the mRNA through the nuclear pore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c25">25</xref>). Inactivation of UAP56 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> leads to nuclear retention of poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mRNA, presumably because Aly is not attracted to the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c27">27</xref>). Interestingly, Sub2p is required for nuclear export of mRNA derived from intron-containing as well as intronless genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c25">25</xref>), so the association of the helicase with the mRNA molecule is not necessarily coupled with the splicing reaction. Recent studies have shown that UAP56 associates with the mRNA molecule co-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c30">30</xref>).</p><p>Although there is only a single gene encoding UAP56 in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a search for proteins similar to UAP56 revealed that there is a second protein, which we have designated URH49 (<underline>U</underline>AP56-<underline>r</underline>elated <underline>h</underline>elicase, <underline>49</underline> kDa), which is highly related to UAP56 in mouse and human cells. Since the amino acid sequences of the two proteins are highly similar, it is likely that the proteins have similar or redundant functions. However, it is possible that the two helicases have different expression profiles or interact with non-overlapping populations of mRNAs or mRNA export proteins, which may lead to quantitative or qualitative differences in mRNA production.</p><p>To begin to explore these possibilities, we have compared the regulation of UAP56 and URH49 expression in mouse and human cells. We found that URH49 interacts with Aly in the same manner as UAP56. Both UAP56 and URH49 are able to complement a yeast deletion in Sub2. However, there are large differences in the expression of the mRNAs encoding the two proteins in different tissues and following growth stimulation of cultured cells. These differences are caused (at least in part) by destabilization of URH49 mRNA in quiescent cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The human URH49 cDNA was isolated from a HeLa pMyr-cDNA library of the CytoTrap yeast two-hybrid system (Stratagene).

To determine if URH49 could also complement the <italic>sub2</italic> deletion, we placed HA-epitope-tagged versions of UAP56 (UAP56-HA) and URH49 (URH49-HA) under the control of the yeast <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter and transformed the plasmids into a yeast tester strain containing a chromosomal <italic>sub2</italic> deletion complemented by a <italic>URA3</italic>-marked plasmid carrying <italic>SUB2</italic>. A <italic>LEU2</italic>-marked plasmid that expresses <italic>SUB2</italic> from the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter was used as a control. As expected, after 5-FOA counter-selection of the <italic>URA3</italic>-marked <italic>SUB2</italic> plasmid, galactose-induced <italic>SUB2</italic> expression fully rescued the chromosomal <italic>sub2</italic> deletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh347f2">2</xref>). Consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c39">39</xref>), under the same galactose-induced conditions, UAP56-HA complemented the <italic>sub2</italic> deletion, although to a much lesser extent than <italic>SUB2</italic>. Likewise, URH49-HA allowed cells to grow in the absence of <italic>SUB2</italic> in a manner nearly identical to that of the UAP56-HA. We conclude that both URH49 and UAP56 are capable of replacing <italic>SUB2</italic>&#x02019;s function in yeast.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of UAP56 and URH49 mRNAs in tissues</title><p>Since mRNA splicing and export occur in all living tissues, UAP56 (or URH49 if it has an equivalent function) must be present in all cells. To determine if the relative expression of the UAP56 and URH49 genes varies under different physiological conditions, we measured the amount of mRNA corresponding to both proteins in human and mouse tissues using real-time PCR. To correct for differences in mRNA recovery from the different tissues, the amounts of UAP56 and URH49 mRNA were normalized to the amount of rpL4 mRNA, which was likely to be expressed at comparable levels under a wide variety of conditions. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh347f3">3</xref> shows that UAP56 and URH49 mRNAs were present at similar levels in many of the tissues examined in this study. UAP56 mRNA was usually present at a higher concentration than URH49 mRNA. However, in testes, the amount of URH49 mRNA was much greater than the amount of UAP56 mRNA. Similar observations were made with RNA isolated from human and mouse tissues, although the amount of UAP56 mRNA was generally greater in the latter. We also found that UAP56 and URH49 mRNAs are expressed at equivalent levels in exponentially growing human WI38 and mouse 3T3 fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of UAP56 and URH49 mRNA in growth-stimulated cells</title><p>To determine the effect of proliferation rate on UAP56 and URH49 gene expression, we measured the amount of mRNA corresponding to both helicases in quiescent and growth-stimulated cells using real-time PCR. The values were again normalized to rpL4 mRNA levels to correct for differences in RNA recovery. In WI38 cells, the amount of UAP56 mRNA gradually increased following growth stimulation, approximately doubling by 25 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh347f4">4</xref>A). In 3T3 cells the UAP56 mRNA level doubled by 15 h and then remained relatively constant. In contrast, the amount of URH49 mRNA increased rapidly during the first few hours following growth stimulation and then remained relatively constant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh347f4">4</xref>B). The initial increase was particularly striking in 3T3 cells, where URH49 mRNA content increased 5-fold within 5 h, and 7-fold within 10 h following growth stimulation.</p><p>The immediate increase in URH49 gene expression following growth stimulation is reminiscent of the expression of the &#x02018;immediate early&#x02019; genes that are rapidly induced under these conditions. The increase in mRNA corresponding to many immediate early genes (e.g. c-<italic>fos</italic> and c-<italic>myc</italic>) is controlled at the transcriptional level and is not blocked by the presence of inhibitors of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c42">42</xref>). To determine if the increase in URH49 mRNA is regulated in a similar manner, we measured the amount of URH49 mRNA in 3T3 and WI38 cells that were growth-stimulated for 5 h in the presence of cycloheximide. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh347f5">5</xref> (top) shows that URH49 mRNA content increased 3.5-fold in WI38 and 6-fold in 3T3 cells that were serum stimulated in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. Unexpectedly, the same increases in URH49 mRNA content were also observed when quiescent cells were treated with cycloheximide alone. (In this experiment, the inhibitor was added directly to the medium on the quiescent cells to avoid any growth stimulation that would result from adding fresh medium to the cells.)</p><p>These analyses were also performed for UAP56 mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh347f5">5</xref>, bottom). When quiescent cells were serum-stimulated in the presence of cycloheximide or treated with cycloheximide alone, the amount of UAP56 mRNA increased to a greater extent than when cells were treated with serum alone. In WI38 cells, the increases were comparable to those observed with URH49 mRNA. However, in 3T3 cells, the increases were much less than those observed with URH49 mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Stability of URH49 and UAP56 mRNA</title><p>It is well documented that inhibition of protein synthesis can decrease the rate of turnover of unstable mRNAs, thereby leading to an increase in mRNA content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c44">44</xref>). The fact that the same increase in URH49 content was observed when cells were serum-stimulated as when they were treated with cycloheximide raised the possibility that URH49 mRNA turns over with a short half-life in quiescent cells, but is stabilized following growth induction.</p><p>To explore this possibility, we measured the half-life of the URH49 mRNA in quiescent, exponentially growing and growth-stimulated cells as well as in quiescent cells treated with cycloheximide. Transcriptional elongation was blocked using 80 &#x000b5;g/ml DRB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c34">34</xref>) and the amount of URH49 mRNA was determined at various times thereafter by real-time PCR. To correct for differences in recovery, the values were normalized to the amount of rpL4 mRNA, which changed very little over the duration of the experiment. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh347f6">6</xref>A shows that URH49 mRNA turns over with a half-life of &#x0223c;4 h in quiescent cells. However, the mRNA level was stable in exponentially growing cells or in cells that were growth-stimulated for 5 h before the addition of the transcriptional inhibitor. Simultaneous treatment of quiescent cells with DRB and cycloheximide also led to mRNA stabilization. Very similar observations were made when 5 &#x000b5;g/ml Actinomycin D was used as the transcriptional inhibitor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh347f6">6</xref>B). The content of UAP56 mRNA was also determined under the same conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh347f6">6</xref>C and D). We found that UAP56 mRNA had a half-life of &#x0223c;15 h in quiescent 3T3 cells, but was stabilized following the addition of serum or cycloheximide. In addition, when these analyses of URH49 and UAP56 mRNA were performed on WI38 cells, similar results were obtained (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>URH49 is a DExD/H box protein that is 90&#x00025; identical to UAP56, a presumed RNA helicase that is considered to be essential for the splicing and export of all mRNAs in all eukaryotes. We show that URH49 and UAP56 are both able to interact with the mRNA export factor Aly. Furthermore, URH49 and UAP56 are both able to complement a <italic>Sub2</italic> deletion in yeast. Therefore, the two proteins are likely to have highly similar functions. The mRNAs for both helicases are expressed in a wide variety of mouse and human tissues and cell lines, although the relative expression of the two mRNAs varies considerably in different tissues. In cultured cells, the UAP56 mRNA is expressed at a relatively constant level while the URH49 mRNA level is closely correlated with cell proliferation. URH49 mRNA is present at low levels in quiescent cells in culture, but increases &#x0223c;5-fold within a few hours following growth stimulation. The increased content of URH49 mRNA is due at least in part to the fact that URH49 mRNA has a relatively short (4 h) half-life in quiescent cells, but is stabilized immediately following growth stimulation.</p><p>There are several reasons why URH49 may not have been identified as an RNA splicing and export factor in earlier analyses. For example, Fleckner <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c18">18</xref>) showed that UAP56 is essential for mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. However, in these analyses UAP56 function was inactivated using polyclonal antibodies that also would have inactivated URH49. In addition, a proteomic analysis did not identify URH49 as one of the constituents of human spliceosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c10">10</xref>). However, URH49 may have been missed in this analysis due to the high degree of similarity between the two proteins (Robin Reed, personal communication). Inactivation of UAP56 function has been shown to result in nuclear retention of mRNA in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>C.elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c27">27</xref>), which contain only a single protein corresponding to UAP56. However, this has not yet been demonstrated in mammalian cells. If UAP56 and URH49 carry out similar functions, it will be necessary to inactivate both helicases to observe this effect in mammalian cells.</p><p>The existence of two related helicases corresponding to UAP56 in mammalian cells raises the possibility that differential expression of the two helicases may be responsible for changes in mRNA production. Several possible scenarios can be imagined. For example, if UAP56 and URH49 have identical biological functions, increased expression of URH49 following growth stimulation may be important for the increased production of mRNA that occurs during the G<sub>0</sub> to G<sub>1</sub> transition. Alternatively, if the helicases have biological functions that do not completely overlap, changes in relative expression of the two helicases may lead to qualitative as well as quantitative changes in mRNA production. For example, URH49 may preferentially process or export mRNAs that are important in proliferating cells, but not in quiescent cells. We are currently exploring the biological functions of these two helicases by inactivating one or both helicases using RNA interference and determining the effects on mRNA production.</p><p>The high expression of URH49 mRNA in human and mouse testes suggests that URH49 may be particularly important in this tissue. This finding is not without precedent. The DEAD box RNA helicases p68, PL10, p68 and GRTH are also expressed at much higher levels in testes than in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c47">47</xref>). GRTH expression has been shown to be upregulated by gonadotropin. It would be interesting to determine if URH49 is regulated in a similar manner. In addition to these DExD/H box helicases, two export factors, NXF2 and NXF3, are mainly expressed in the testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c49">49</xref>). These data indicate that a variety of mRNA export factors may have functions that are specific to the testes.</p><p>The rapid increase in URH49 mRNA that occurs following growth stimulation is due, at least in part, to an increase in the stability of the mRNA. URH49 mRNA is highly stable in cycling cells but has a half-life of &#x0223c;4 h in quiescent cells. The mRNA is stabilized immediately after the quiescent cells are stimulated to proliferate and remains stable in proliferating cells. The turnover of URH49 mRNA in quiescent cells requires ongoing protein synthesis since the addition of cycloheximide to quiescent cells also leads to immediate stabilization of the mRNA. The mechanism responsible for the stabilization of URH49 and other mRNA species following the inhibition of protein synthesis is not known.</p><p>The rapid increase in URH49 mRNA is somewhat reminiscent of the behavior of a variety of immediate early mRNAs (e.g. c-<italic>fos</italic> mRNA) that increase rapidly following growth stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c50">50</xref>). In contrast to the situation observed with URH49 mRNA, the increase in the immediate early mRNAs is transient and regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. The half-lives of these early response mRNAs are generally much less than 1 h and do not change following growth stimulation. However, these mRNAs are stabilized when protein synthesis is blocked, similar to the situation observed with URH49 mRNA.</p><p>We are not aware of any other mRNAs that demonstrate the G<sub>0</sub>-specific turnover that we have identified for URH49 mRNA. Earlier studies have shown that the decay rates for specific mRNAs can increase or decrease in response to a variety of stimuli. In several cases, the regulatory sequences and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that are responsible for regulating the turnover of these mRNAs have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c53">53</xref>). The mRNAs that have short half-lives frequently contain AU-rich elements in their 3&#x02032; untranslated region that serve as binding sites for proteins that either stabilize or destabilize the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh347c57">57</xref>). However, there are no obvious AU-rich elements in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region of URH49 mRNA, so novel sequences and proteins may be involved. For this reason, we are currently attempting to identify the <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors that are important for the unusual turnover characteristics of URH49 mRNA.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh347f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> His-Aly interacts with UAP56 and URH49.
