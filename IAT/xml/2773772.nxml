Previously, we have demonstrated that porcine <italic>SPP1 </italic>shows breed-related differential mRNA expression during myogenesis. With the aim to identify putative contributing <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory DNA variation we resequenced the 5' upstream region of the gene in the respective breeds Pietrain and Duroc. We found two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="M84121">M84121</ext-link>]: g.1804C&#x0003e;T and g.3836A&#x0003e;G). We focused our investigation on the SNP g.3836A&#x0003e;G, because <italic>in silico </italic>analysis and knowledge about the regulation of <italic>SPP1 </italic>suggested an effect of this SNP on a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP&#x003b2;) responsive transcriptional enhancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay we demonstrated that, similar to human <italic>SPP1</italic>, the 3' terminal end of the first intron of porcine <italic>SPP1 </italic>harbors a C/EBP&#x003b2; binding site and showed that this binding site is negatively affected by the mutant G allele. Genotyping of 48 fetuses per breed revealed that the G allele segregated exclusively in Duroc fetuses with a frequency of 57 percent. Using real-time quantitative PCR we showed that, consistent with its negative effect on a transcriptional enhancer element, the G allele tends to decrease mRNA abundance of <italic>SPP1 </italic>in the fetal <italic>musculus longissimus dorsi </italic>(~1.3 fold; P &#x02265; 0.1).</p><p>Moreover, we showed that the SNP g.3836A&#x0003e;G leads to ubiquitous aberrant splicing of the first intron by generating a <italic>de novo </italic>and activating a cryptic splice acceptor site.

In line with its versatility and widespread expression SPP1 has been linked with various physiological and pathological events, amongst others development and regeneration of skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. <italic>SPP1 </italic>is regulated by the muscle regulatory factors MYOD and MYF5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and has been shown to be expressed <italic>in vitro </italic>in myoblasts and myotubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Uaesoontrachoon <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] demonstrated that soluble SPP1 stimulates proliferation of myoblasts whereas SPP1 deposited in extracellular matrix promotes their differentiation. Recently we showed upregulation of <italic>SPP1 </italic>mRNA expression in prenatal <italic>musculus longissimus dorsi </italic>(M.l.d.) at 35 and 63-77 days <italic>post conception </italic>(dpc) in pigs, i.e. at the time points of the first and second myogenic wave respectively, thus providing additional, <italic>in vivo</italic>, evidence supporting involvement of SPP1 in myogenesis. In addition we showed consistent elevation of <italic>SPP1 </italic>mRNA level during myogenesis in the pig breed Duroc compared to breed Pietrain, the latter showing higher muscularity and higher proportion of fast twitch glycolytic fibers postnatally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover we mapped quantitative trait loci for the proportion of fast twitch glycolytic fibers and pH of M.l.d. 45 minutes <italic>post mortem </italic>on porcine chromosome 8 close to <italic>SPP1 </italic>position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To detect polymorphisms that contribute to the breed-related differential mRNA expression of <italic>SPP1 </italic>and which are associated with differential microstructural and biophysical muscle properties we performed SNP screening of the upstream regulatory region. We identified and functionally characterized a SNP located in the 3' terminal end of the first intron in an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification and <italic>in silico </italic>characterization of SNP g.3836A&#x0003e;G</title><p>We resequenced ~3.8 kb of the 5'-upstream region of the porcine <italic>SPP1 </italic>including 5'-flanking region and promoter, exon1, intron1, as well as exon2 and identified two SNP: a C&#x0003e;T SNP in the 5'-flanking region ([GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="M84121">M84121</ext-link>]: g.1804C&#x0003e;T) and an A&#x0003e;G SNP in the first intron ([GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="M84121">M84121</ext-link>]: g.3836A&#x0003e;G). Phylogenetic footprinting of the 5'-upstream region indicated that the g.1804C&#x0003e;T SNP resides in an evolutionarily poorly conserved sequence of a repetitive element (Mammalian Interspersed Repeat; MIR) and thus most likely possesses no function. In contrast the g.3836A&#x0003e;G SNP is located in an evolutionarily conserved region at the 3' terminal end of the first intron (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) that has been shown to harbor a strong transcriptional enhancer in the pig and in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The SNPInspector software predicted the elimination of binding sites of four transcription factors by this SNP including CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), adenovirus E4 promoter binding protein (E4BP4), thyrotrophic embryonic factor (TEF) and fork head homologous X (FHXB). Interestingly, a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP&#x003b2;) binding site, overlapping the site corresponding to the g.3836A&#x0003e;G SNP site in the human <italic>SPP1</italic>, has been shown to be important for the activity of the intronic enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Evolutionary conservation and variation of the sequence of the upstream region of porcine <italic>SPP1</italic></bold>.

Allelic probes centered around the g.3836A&#x0003e;G SNP showed distinct differences in their ability to bind nuclear proteins from porcine fetal skeletal muscle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The labelled probe containing the wild-type allele A formed a DNA:protein complex (designated "s"; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lane 2) which was completely absent in all binding reactions containing the labelled mutant probe G (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lanes 8-12). Complex "s" was specifically competed by the addition of excess of the corresponding unlabelled probe A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lane 3) or unlabelled probe bearing consensus C/EBP binding motif (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lane 5) respectively, but was unaffected by the addition of a nonspecific competitor probe, in this case bearing consensus Sp1 binding motif (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lane 6). Addition of C/EBP&#x003b2; antibody to a binding reaction containing the labelled probe A caused disappearance of the complex "s" and caused an evident supershifted complex (designated "ss"; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lane 13). Addition of the antibody to a binding reaction containing the labelled probe bearing the Sp1 binding motif had no effect on the DNA:protein complexes (designated "I" and "II"; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lane 15) and also produced no supershifted complex in the binding reaction containing the labelled mutant probe G (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lane 14), demonstrating specificity of the supershifted complex "ss". Our EMSA experiment thus provides clear evidence that C/EBP&#x003b2; participated on the formation of the complex "s" and consequently provides evidence that the C/EBP&#x003b2; binding site present in human <italic>SPP1 </italic>is evolutionarily conserved in porcine <italic>SPP1</italic>. The heterogeneity of the complex "s" is most likely due to the presence of multiple C/EBP&#x003b2; isoforms or heterodimers with other members of the C/EBP family.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>EMSA and supershift assay using probes allelic for the g.3836A&#x0003e;G SNP and nuclear extracts from <italic>longissimus dorsi </italic>muscle of 91 day old fetuses</bold>.

To characterize the effect of the g.3836A&#x0003e;G SNP on the C/EBP&#x003b2; binding site more precisely we performed competitive EMSA using nuclear extracts from cells overexpressing N-terminally truncated bovine C/EBP&#x003b2; (&#x00394;N-C/EBP&#x003b2;; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

The complex formed between the labelled probe A and &#x00394;N-C/EBP&#x003b2; was competed away using 5-100 fold molar excess of unlabelled probe A and G respectively. The decrease in relative intensity of the complex as a consequence of increasing unlabelled competitor concentration is an indication of the efficiency of displacement, thereby reflecting the relative affinity of the respective alleles to C/EBP&#x003b2;. The efficiency of displacement of the cold competitor probe G is more than twofold lower compared to the cold competitor probe A demonstrating that the mutation reduced the affinity of the binding site to C/EBP&#x003b2; in excess of twofold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of binding affinity of the probes allelic for the SNP g.3836A&#x0003e;G by competitive EMSA using nuclear extract from cells overexpressing N-terminally truncated bovine C/EBP&#x003b2;</bold>.

The SNP turned out to be fixed for the ancestral A allele in the Pietrain fetuses, segregating only amongst the Duroc fetuses with a frequency of 57% of the mutant G allele. The analysis of the effect of the SNP on <italic>SPP1 </italic>mRNA expression was therefore performed within the Duroc breed. The data were pooled across the four stages, which was accounted for in the statistical model.

To prove whether this potential <italic>de novo </italic>3'ss is active <italic>in vivo </italic>we performed RT-PCR using the M.l.d. cDNA samples of 91 day old fetuses described in the preceding paragraph. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> carriers of the wild-type A allele expressed only one splice variant whereas multiple splice variants were detected in samples carrying the G allele. Cloning and sequencing revealed that the mutant G allele causes aberrant splicing of the first intron thus generating heterogeneity in the 5' untranslated region. Two aberrantly spliced transcript variants were identified: one variant with 10 bp longer leader sequence spliced at the <italic>de novo </italic>3'ss generated by the G allele, and another with a 36 bp longer leader sequence spliced at a cryptic 3'ss located in the first intron 24 bp upstream of the g.3836 SNP site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). The insertions do not lead to a change in the <italic>SPP1 </italic>reading frame and also do not generate open reading frames upstream of the translation start site that could reduce translational efficiency. Inspection of the 3' terminal region of the first intron revealed two additional potential 3'ss between the authentic 3'ss and a putative branch site and one additional potential 3'ss between the cryptic 3'ss and a putative cryptic branch site. To describe the splicing pattern in more detail we quantified relative amounts of the splice variants in M.l.d. across different fetal stages and across various tissues/cell types of adult animals including tonsil, intestinal lymph node, liver, spleen, pituitary, adrenal gland, M.l.d., subcutaneous fat and leukocyte by fragment analysis on MegaBACE capillary sequencer. Only heterozygous adult carriers were available. We found aberrant splicing of <italic>SPP1 </italic>mRNA across all examined tissues of the carriers of the mutant G allele. No additional splice variants were detected by the more sensitive analysis on the capillary sequencer. The relative amounts of the three splice variants were allele dosage dependent; in homozygous GG animals the proportion of native: <italic>de novo</italic>: cryptic splice variants was about 56: 19: 25 and in heterozygous AG animals the proportion was about 78: 9: 13 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

MaxEntScore revealed that the mutation weakened the 3'ss, with the ME score of the authentic 3'ss dropping from 7.86 to 3.13 for the mutated authentic 3'ss respectively. The ME score of the cryptic 3'ss (6.9) is higher than that of the <italic>de novo </italic>3'ss (1.33).

We previously discovered breed-related differences in mRNA expression of porcine <italic>SPP1 </italic>during myogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and hypothesized that this variation might be caused by <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory DNA-variation. <italic>Cis</italic>-regulatory DNA variation has been shown to affect a large proportion (~20%) of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and in fact has already been described in human <italic>SPP1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We identified an A&#x0003e;G SNP at position g.3836 at the 3' terminal end of the first intron of porcine <italic>SPP1</italic>. <italic>In silico </italic>analysis of the polymorphic sequence and knowledge about the regulation of <italic>SPP1 </italic>in pigs and human suggested an effect of the SNP on a C/EBP&#x003b2; responsive transcriptional enhancer. Using competitive EMSA and supershift assay we showed that the C/EBP&#x003b2; binding site found in human is present also in the pig and is negatively affected by the mutation. As a consequence of the reduced affinity of the C/EBP&#x003b2; binding site the activity of the transcriptional enhancer is reduced, at least in fetal M.l.d., as indicated by the downregulation of <italic>SPP1 </italic>mRNA expression by fetuses carrying the G allele. Conservation of the C/EBP&#x003b2; binding site at the 3' terminal end of the first intron of human and porcine <italic>SPP1 </italic>points to an important function of this element in the regulation of <italic>SPP1</italic>. The relevance of C/EBP&#x003b2; in positive regulation of mRNA expression of <italic>SPP1 </italic>is further emphasized by the identification of additional functional C/EBP transcriptional enhancer elements in the promoter of murine and human <italic>SPP1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. C/EBPs are a family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of diverse cell types, and play pivotal roles in a number of processes including adipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, an involvement or a precise function of C/EBPs in myogenesis has not been described so far.</p><p>We demonstrate that the SNP g.3836A&#x0003e;G is functional also on the RNA level and causes aberrant splicing of the first intron. We found that this effect is ubiquitous with regard to temporo-spatial distribution which is in accord with the fact that it creates a general splicing signal. Naturally occurring DNA-variation affecting splicing represents a valuable resource to identify sequence signals involved in the regulation of this process. The g.3836A&#x0003e;G SNP exhibits several features of <italic>de novo </italic>3'ss activating aberrant splicing identified by Kralovicova <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and Vorechovsky [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It creates an AG dinucleotide in intron in polypyrimidine tract of the authentic 3'ss by introducing a guanine residue, has an uridine in position +1 relative to the <italic>de novo </italic>3'ss and activates a cryptic 3'ss. Vorechovsky [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] has shown that authentic counterparts of <italic>de novo </italic>3'ss are intrinsically weak. In the case of the affected 3'ss of <italic>SPP1 </italic>this is likely a consequence of the two concurrent functional constraints on the sequence of the 3' terminal end of the first intron; on one hand to provide a C/EBP&#x003b2; responsive transcriptional enhancer and on the other to provide the canonical splicing acceptor signals. The <italic>in silico </italic>predicted strength of the mutated authentic 3'ss compared to the cryptic 3'ss and their utilization <italic>in vivo </italic>are reversed. An explanation for the lower utilization of the cryptic 3'ss compared to the mutated authentic 3'ss <italic>in vivo </italic>may be a suboptimal sequence of the putative cryptic branch site, in contrast to the predicted authentic branch site which perfectly matches with the consensus sequence YNYURAY (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Another explanation might be that the cryptic 3'ss is silenced by a splicing silencer or <italic>vice versa </italic>that the authentic 3'ss might be augmented by a splicing enhancer. Kralovicova and Vorechovsky [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] showed that <italic>in vivo </italic>selection of aberrant splice sites is extensively controlled by auxiliary splicing signals.</p><p>Mutations that affect hnRNA splicing account for up to 50% of disease-causing gene alterations in human and potentially represent the most frequent cause of hereditary disorders. Some 218 unique aberrant 3'ss, activated by disease-causing mutations in 131 genes, are presently known in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Our results show that about half of the <italic>SPP1 </italic>messages expressed by the G allele comprise aberrantly spliced transcripts. Considering the versatile function of SPP1 and the ubiquitous expression of the aberrant splice variants it could be speculated that the SNP g.3836A&#x0003e;G might have pleiotropic effects on various traits including growth, reproduction and immune defence. However the relatively high frequency of the G allele argues against a major negative phenotypic effect, because in that case the G allele would be quickly eliminated given the high selection pressure on commercial pigs. Furthermore, the aberrant splicing induced by the SNP g.3836A&#x0003e;G does not change primary structure of the SPP1 protein. In fact, the aberrant splicing may counteract the negative effect of the G allele on mRNA expression of <italic>SPP1 </italic>by enhancing translational efficiency or RNA stability. Aberrantly spliced mRNA isoforms of the human insulin gene with longer 5'-leader sequence, induced by a SNP in its first intron, were reported to generate more proinsulin <italic>in vitro </italic>compared to the native transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Functional characterization of the SNP g.3836A&#x0003e;G revealed that it has two effects; it negatively affects a C/EBP&#x003b2; binding site and activates aberrant splicing of the first intron. However, although the SNP g.3836A&#x0003e;G is functional it most likely does not represent the causative mutation responsible for the previously observed breed related differences in <italic>SPP1 </italic>mRNA expression. Nevertheless, the dual effect of the SNP on <italic>SPP1 </italic>function renders it as an interesting DNA-marker for association studies concerning muscle-related, growth, reproduction, and immune defence traits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Identification of SNP and splice variants</title><p>The target sequence of the porcine <italic>SPP1 </italic>gene [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="M84121">M84121</ext-link>] was amplified in six overlapping PCR fragments using standard PCR conditions and each six Pietrain and Duroc DNA samples respectively.
