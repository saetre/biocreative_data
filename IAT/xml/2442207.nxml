Podosome formation requires the function of Rho family guanosine triphosphatases and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, Src induces changes in gene expression required for transformation, in part by activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. We sought to determine whether MAPK signaling regulates podosome formation. Unlike extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), ERK5 is constitutively activated in Src-transformed fibroblasts. ERK5-deficient cells expressing v-Src exhibited increased RhoA activation and signaling, which lead to cellular retraction and an inability to form podosomes or induce invasion. Addition of the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632 to ERK5-deficient cells expressing v-Src led to cellular extension and restored podosome formation. In Src-transformed cells, ERK5 induced the expression of a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP), RhoGAP7/DLC-1, via activation of the transcription factor myocyte enhancing factor 2C, and RhoGAP7 expression restored podosome formation in ERK5-deficient cells. We conclude that ERK5 promotes Src-induced podosome formation by inducing RhoGAP7 and thereby limiting Rho activation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase; DLC-1, deleted in liver cancer 1; ERK, extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GST, glutathione&#x02013;S-transferase; MEF2, myocyte enhancing factor 2; MEK, Map and ERK kinase; MLC, myosin light chain; RBD, Rho-binding domain; ROCK, Rho kinase; ts-v-Src, temperature-sensitive v-Src.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Src is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is hyperactivated in some human cancers, often in association with an increase in metastatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lutz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Irby and Yeatman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rucci et al., 2006</xref>). In normal cells, Src can be activated by a variety of different stimuli, including adhesion to ECM proteins and the activation of growth factor receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roche et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsia et al., 2005</xref>). Many of these stimuli also result in changes in the actin cytoskeleton that require the activity of both Src and Rho GTPase family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ridley et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ridley and Hall, 1992</xref>). Like other GTPases, Rho family members cycle between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Van Aelst and D'Souza-Schorey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kjoller and Hall, 1999</xref>). GTP loading is facilitated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and GTP hydrolysis can be catalyzed by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lamarche and Hall, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cherfils and Chardin, 1999</xref>). In fibroblasts, Rho activation leads to an increase in actomyosin contractility and the formation of stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ridley and Hall, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amano et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">1998</xref>). The activation of Rac and CDC42, two other members of the Rho family, leads to membrane ruffling and the formation of filopodia, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ridley et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kozma et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Transformation of fibroblasts by retroviral Src (v-Src) or mutationally activated Src (SrcY527F) represents a model system for studying the mechanism by which Src activity leads to cell transformation and invasion. During tumor progression, cells gain the ability to invade other tissues, a process involving the coordination of cell migration and the secretion of extracellular proteases. Until recently, it was thought that the activation of Src led to an inhibition of Rho activity and that this decrease in Rho activity was responsible for the loss of stress fibers observed in Src-transformed cells. However, although expression of constitutively active Rho can suppress morphological transformation by Src, levels of Rho-GTP do not decrease in Src-transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mayer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pawlak and Helfman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berdeaux et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, cycling of Rho activation is required for migration of fibroblasts, a process controlled by Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Timpson et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, active Rho is required for Src-induced formation of podosomes, specialized adhesive structures that cause localized degradation of ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berdeaux et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase 5 (ERK5), also known as Big-MAPK1 (BMK1), is a member of the MAPK family of serine/threonine protein kinases and can only be activated by Map and ERK kinase 5 (MEK5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). It is unique in that it contains a C-terminal transactivation domain, allowing for a more direct role in the expression of gene targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kasler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sohn et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, ERK5 activates many downstream proteins including members of the myocyte enhancing factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), Myc, sap1a, serum-response element binding proteins (SREBPs), and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p90RSK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kato et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">English et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamakura et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pearson et al., 2001</xref>). Src has been shown to mediate ERK5 activation in response to a variety of different stimuli, including epidermal growth factor receptor activation, cellular exposure to asbestos, hypoxia-inducing conditions, and exposure to reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamakura et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scapoli et al., 2004</xref>). ERK5 was required for focus formation in v-Src&#x02013;transformed cells, and activated Src induced ERK5 nuclear translocation and MEF2-dependent gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barros and Marshall, 2005</xref>). Finally, activation of ERK5 in fibroblasts can lead to changes in the actin cytoskeleton, including a loss of stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barros and Marshall, 2005</xref>).</p><p>We show here that ERK5 is constitutively activated in fibroblasts transformed by mutationally activated c-Src or v-Src. ERK5 was found to be required for podosome formation and for the invasive properties of cells transformed by constitutively active Src. We found that in Src-transformed cells, ERK5 induces a RhoGAP, RhoGAP7/DLC-1, thus limiting Rho activation and Rho-dependent signaling and allowing the formation of podosomes and the generation of an invasive phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>ERK5 is activated in Src-transformed cells</title><p>NIH3T3 cells transformed by v-Src form punctate podosomes, whereas NIH3T3 cells transformed by a mutationally activated form of c-Src (Y527F) form large podosome rosettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tarone et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lock et al., 1998</xref>). Both structures are associated with cellular invasion. ERK5 activation was increased in NIH3T3 cells expressing either SrcY527F or v-Src (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Activation of Src can lead to increased ERK1/2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maudsley et al., 2000</xref>). However, unlike the activation of ERK5, which is constitutive in Src-transformed cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), the activation of ERK1/2 after Src activation is transient. Indeed, the levels of ERK1/2 activity were lower in the c-Src (Y527F)&#x02013;transformed cells than in the untransformed parental cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Although the level of ERK1/2 activity is decreased, a downstream target of MAPK signaling, Fra-1, is constitutively induced in c-Src (Y527F)&#x02013;transformed cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>MAPK signaling is required for Src induced podosome formation.</bold> (A) NIH3T3 cells stably expressing an empty vector or SrcY527F were analyzed for ERK5, ERK1/2, and Src activity using anti&#x02013;phospho-ERK5, anti&#x02013;phospho-ERK1/2, or anti-phospho-tyrosine antibodies, respectively. Parental 3T3 cells expressing an empty vector or v-Src were analyzed similarly. (B) Whole cell lysates of NIH3T3 cells expressing empty vector (lanes 1&#x02013;2) or c-SrcY527F (lanes 3&#x02013;4) were treated with DMSO (lanes 1 and 3) or 25 &#x003bc;M U0126 (lanes 2 and 4) for 24 h and subjected to immunoblot analysis against the proteins indicated.

Cells were washed to remove the inhibitor, and fresh medium with or without cycloheximide was added as indicated. 24 h after removal of U0126, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for F-actin using rhodamine-phalloidin.

Treatment of Src-transformed cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 inhibited both ERK1/2 and ERK5 activation and decreased Fra-1 protein levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Furthermore, treatment of c-Src (Y527F)&#x02013;transformed NIH3T3 cells with U0126 for 24 h prevented rosette podosome formation, which indicates that MEK activity is required for Src-induced podosome formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Rosettes were lost after a 6-h treatment with U0126, and a loss of punctate actin structures was observed after 8 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, top right). Rosette structures began to reappear 8 h after removal of U0126 (not depicted), and by 24 h, rosette structures and cell morphology were identical to those of untreated cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, untreated). The delay in podosome formation after the removal of the UO126 suggested that protein synthesis is necessary for the reformation of podosomes after MEK inhibition. We tested this using cycloheximide to block de novo protein synthesis. Cells treated with cycloheximide (10 &#x003bc;g/ml) just before removal of U0126 did not reform podosomes but instead appeared more rounded, with strong cortical F-actin staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, left), which indicates that reformation of podosomes in these cells required de novo protein synthesis. Similar results were obtained with another MEK inhibitor, PD 98059 (unpublished data). We conclude that activation of Src leads to ERK5 activation and that MEK activity and de novo protein synthesis are required for podosome formation in Src-transformed cells.</p></sec><sec><title>ERK5 is required for podosome formation in Src-transformed cells</title><p>To determine whether ERK5 was required for Src-induced podosome formation, we expressed a temperature-sensitive mutant of v-Src, ts-UP1, in ERK5 null mouse embryonic fibroblast (ERK5&#x02212;/&#x02212;) cells expressing an empty vector and in ERK5&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells reexpressing ERK5, hereinafter referred to as ERK5-FL cells (ERK5-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts stably expressing wild-type ERK5 cDNA). Pools of stable transfectants were grown for 24 h at 40&#x000b0;C to inhibit Src activity and then either kept at 40&#x000b0;C or shifted to the permissive temperature for another 24 h. Podosomes were visualized as punctate structures containing both F-actin and cortactin. Stable expression of v-Src in ERK5-FL cells caused formation of podosomes in almost 60% of the cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3 B</xref>). However, ERK5&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells stably expressing v-Src did not form podosomes and appeared rounded with strong cortical F-actin staining at the permissive temperature (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The punctate actin-rich structures detected in the ERK5-FL&#x02013;transformed cells were also stained by an antibody against the podosome component FISH/Tks5 and by an antibody that recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>), which confirms that these structures are podosomes. The appearance of some podosomes in ERK5-FL cells expressing ts-UP1 and grown at 40&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>) may be attributed to the leakiness of the ts-UP1 mutant, which retains residual kinase activity even at the nonpermissive temperature.

Thus, increased ERK1/2 activation and the expression of Fra-1 are not sufficient to induce podosome formation in the absence of ERK5.</p></sec><sec><title>The invasive phenotype associated with Src transformation requires ERK5</title><p>Proteases secreted locally at podosomes degrade the ECM, allowing for cellular invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Linder and Aepfelbacher, 2003</xref>). We monitored protease secretion by an in situ zymography assay in which cells were plated onto an Oregon green&#x02013;gelatin substrate, and protease secretion was detected by the appearance of nonfluorescent holes beneath the cell. We saw the appearance of nonfluorescent holes beneath &#x0003e;40% of the ERK5-FL ts-v-Src cells, which corresponds to the presence of punctate F-actin structures in these same cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>, bottom; and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

This decrease in protease secretion resulting from ERK5 deficiency correlates with the loss of podosome formation in these cells. To investigate the effects of ERK5 deficiency on the ability of Src-transformed cells to invade in vitro, we examined the ability of ERK5&#x02212;/&#x02212; or ERK5-FL cells expressing ts-UP1 to migrate across transwell filters or to invade through transwell filters coated with a layer of Matrigel. The migratory properties of the two cell lines were only minimally different (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>, bottom).

This results in the disappearance of stress fibers and the formation of podosomes, dynamic adhesions that degrade the underlying ECM and promote cellular invasion. Podosomes and the closely related structures known as invadopodia have more recently been observed in epithelial cells and carcinoma-derived tumor cell lines and appear to contribute to tumor cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abram et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spinardi et al., 2004</xref>). Src is a key regulator of podosome formation in vivo, and the most prominent phenotype of Src-deficient mice is osteopetrosis, a disease caused by a defect in osteoclast podosome formation. Thus, the pathways through which Src signals to induce podosome formation and cellular invasion are of considerable interest.</p><p>The results described here indicate that the small GTPase Rho is a key regulator of Src-induced podosome formation. Because the activation of Rho is known to induce the formation of stress fibers, it was previously thought that the disappearance of these structures in Src-transformed cells was caused by a decrease in the level of Rho activation. Consistent with this hypothesis, Src has been shown to phosphorylate and possibly activate p190RhoGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fincham et al., 1999</xref>). However, we and others have shown that there is no reduction in the overall level of Rho-GTP in fibroblasts transformed by SrcY527F or v-Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pawlak and Helfman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berdeaux et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, we observe a dramatic increase in Rho-GTP levels in ERK5&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells expressing v-Src, which indicates that Src can activate Rho-GTP loading. The results described here lead to the model shown in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>. In this model, Src induces Rho activation, but this activation is limited by ERK5-dependent induction of RhoGAP7/DLC-1. Thus, in the absence of ERK5, Src induces hyperactivation of Rho. Rho, in turn, is necessary for podosome formation, as we and others have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chellaiah et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berdeaux et al., 2004</xref>), but hyperactivation of Rho leads to elevated actomyosin contractility that blocks cell spreading and podosome formation. Thus, the relationship between Src, Rho, and podosome formation is complex. We propose a model (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>) in which Src promotes both Rho activation and Rho inactivation, and where Rho, depending on its level of activation, can either promote or inhibit podosome formation. It is possible that although the level of Rho-GTP remains unchanged in Src-transformed cells, Rho may be cycling more rapidly between the active and inactive states. Another possibility is that Src may promote Rho-GTP loading and GTP hydrolysis at different sites within the cell, leading to local Rho activation. Indeed, in Src-transformed cells, Rho activation appears to occur at podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berdeaux et al., 2004</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig10"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p><bold>Src activates pathways that lead to Rho-GTP loading and Rho-GTP hydrolysis.</bold> Rho regulation is a key intermediate in podosome formation. Src utilizes distinct pathways to both activate and inhibit Rho. Hyperactivation of Rho can inhibit podosome formation by increasing actomyosin contractility. However, an as yet unknown aspect of Rho function is required for podosome formation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1811195f10"></graphic></fig><p>There are several possible mechanisms by which Src induces Rho activation. Src has been shown to directly induce Rho activation through its ability to phosphorylate Rho GDP dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DerMardirossian et al., 2006</xref>). This phosphorylation causes Rho to dissociate from RhoGDI, allowing it to translocate to the membrane. In addition, activation of Rho-GEFs by Src may increase nucleotide exchange. In particular, the Rho-specific GEF Tim, a Dbl family member, is autoinhibited by an N-terminal helical motif, and phosphorylation of this motif by Src, both in vitro and in vivo, relieves this autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yohe et al., 2007</xref>). Src can also phosphorylate the Rho family GEFs Vav1 and Vav2 in vitro and is required for EGF-mediated activation of Vav2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Riteau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Servitja et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stovall et al., 2004</xref>). However, Vav proteins induce GTP loading on both Rho and Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu and Burridge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zeng et al., 2000</xref>). Many other Rho GEFs are activated directly or indirectly by receptor tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schiller, 2006</xref>), and some of these may also be regulated by Src. Finally Src down-regulates the expression of the Cdk inhibitor p27Kip1, which has been shown to inhibit Rho activation by blocking its interaction with Rho GEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Besson et al., 2004</xref>). It seems likely that phosphorylation of the RhoGDI, activation of Rho-GEFs, and down-regulation of p27Kip1 may all contribute to Src-induced Rho activation.</p><p>The phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP by Src represents one mechanism by which Src limits Rho activation. Here, we present evidence for a Src&#x02013;ERK5&#x02013;MEF2C pathway that also limits Rho activation by inducing the expression of RhoGAP7/DLC-1. Src can activate the classical MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2, and their downstream target, the transcription factor Fra-1, has been shown to regulate the invasiveness of breast cancer cells as well as colon carcinoma cells through its ability to regulate Rho signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vial et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belguise et al., 2005</xref>). However, in Src-transformed cells, ERK1/2 activation is only transient, whereas the activation of ERK5 is constitutive. ERK5 deficiency led to hyperactivation of Rho, even though both ERK1/2 activation and Fra-1 induction were observed in ERK5&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells expressing v-Src. Thus, ERK5 rather than ERK1/2 appears to be the critical MAPK in limiting the extent of Rho activation. This effect is mediated, at least in part, by activation of MEF2-dependent transcription. The MEF2 family of transcription factors comprises MEF2A, -B, -C, and -D, which can homo- and heterodimerize to induce gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Black et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">1998</xref>). MEF2-dependent signaling was enhanced in ERK5 reexpressing cells that also expressed v-Src, and the expression of MEF2C-VP16 limited Rho-GTP loading in ERK5&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells expressing v-Src. One major transcriptional target of the Src&#x02013;ERK5&#x02013;MEF2 pathway is RhoGAP7/DLC-1. RhoGAP7/DLC-1 was only induced in cells expressing v-Src; ERK5 reexpression was not sufficient to induce RhoGAP7/DLC-1 synthesis in the absence of v-Src expression. Collectively, these results indicate that one pathway that limits the extent of Rho activation in Src-transformed cells is the ERK5- and MEF2-dependent induction of RhoGAP7/DLC-1.</p><p>In the absence of ERK5, v-Src&#x02013;transformed cells are rounded, with strong cortical actin staining, and lack podosomes. Cell spreading and podosome formation could be restored by reexpression of ERK5, by expression of MEF2C-VP16 or RhoGAP7/DLC-1, or by inhibition of ROCK-mediated actomyosin contractility. Thus, the hyperactivation of Rho that results from ERK5 deficiency leads to increased actomyosin contractility, and it is this that is responsible for cell rounding and podosome loss. However, blocking Rho-mediated signaling by expression of a dominant-negative RhoA mutant or with the bacterial exotoxin C3 also prevents podosome formation in Src-transformed cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berdeaux et al., 2004</xref>). One possible explanation is that Rho signaling through some effector other than ROCK is necessary for Src-induced podosome formation. There are interesting parallels with podosome formation in osteoclasts. Mice that are deficient in Src display osteopetrosis, a disease caused by the failure of osteoclasts to resorb bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thomas et al., 1991</xref>). Recently, it was shown that in osteoclasts, podosome formation, structure, and dynamics are dependent on the activity of endogenous Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Destaing et al., 2008</xref>). Osteoclast podosome formation is dependent on Rho function, and there is evidence that one of the roles of Rho in this system is to promote the formation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, thereby modulating the activity of actin-binding proteins such as gelsolin and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chellaiah, 2006</xref>). It is possible that Rho may be playing a similar role in Src-transformed cells.</p><p>In summary, Src induces RhoGAP7/DLC-1 expression by activating the ERK5&#x02013;MEF2C pathway and thereby limiting the extent of Rho activation. The activation of this pathway is required for generation of podosomes and the invasive phenotype associated with Src transformation. Src activity is elevated in some epithelial cancers, and the extent of activation correlates with metastatic ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frame, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yeatman, 2004</xref>).
