Th1 cell development requires signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 activation, induced by type I IFN or IFN-&#x003b3;, the transcription factor T-box 21 (T-bet), and IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling, which can couple with IL-18-induced IRAK and NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factors to drive the high amounts of IFN-&#x003b3; required to eradicate intracellular pathogens (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Glimcher and Murphy, 2000</xref>). Th2 cell development, with expression of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, requires IL-4, STAT6, and the transcription factor GATA binding protein (GATA)-3 (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Glimcher and Murphy, 2000</xref>).

Furthermore, we showed that activation of ERK1 and ERK2 is a requirement for production of IL-10 by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets.

Culture with high doses of antigen for 7 days gave rise to Th1 cells expressing IFN-&#x003b3; upon restimulation (<xref rid="bib13 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Constant et&#x000a0;al., 1995; Hosken et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>), but not IL-10 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>A available online). Culture with low antigen doses under the same conditions led to the differentiation of Th2 cells, which expressed both IL-4 and IL-10 upon restimulation (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>A). Culture of naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T&#x000a0;cells in an APC-free system by stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence of IL-12 resulted in IFN-&#x003b3;-producing Th1 cells, a proportion of which coproduced IL-10, as did Th2 cells resulting from culture in IL-4 (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>B).</p><p>To investigate whether the lack of IL-10 produced by Th1 cells resulted from inhibition of IL-10 production by DCs and high antigen dose or alternatively required IL-12, we cultured naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T&#x000a0;cells with increasing doses of antigen presented by DC in the presence of IL-12. At low doses of antigen, IL-12 abrogated the development of Th2 cells and induced IFN-&#x003b3; expression but only low levels of IL-10 expression, suggesting that IL-12 per se was not sufficient to induce significant IL-10 production in Th1 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). Strikingly, as the antigen dose was increased, Th1 populations driven with IL-12 now contained higher numbers of IL-10-producing cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A) and produced more IL-10 protein upon restimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1B). Thus, the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 required both IL-12 and high doses of antigen. Th1 cells differentiated to produce large amounts of IL-10 and IFN-&#x003b3; and lost their&#x000a0;capacity to produce IL-2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B). Because the presence of IL-12 reduced the proliferation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T&#x000a0;cells at both high and&#x000a0;low antigen doses (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>), and only the former showed IL-10 production, the development of high IL-10-producing cells&#x000a0;is most likely not related to limited IL-2. Naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T&#x000a0;cells from DO11.10/recombination-activating gene 1 (Rag1)-deficient animals, cultured with high doses of antigen in the presence of IL-12, also resulted in IL-10 expression by Th1 cells, showing that this expression was not dependent on the presence of effector or memory T&#x000a0;cells or Treg cells (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>). Although it has been suggested that TGF-&#x003b2; can induce IL-10 in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T&#x000a0;cells (<xref rid="bib31 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Kitani et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Schiott et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>), we found that in developing Th1 and Th2 cells this was not the case (data not shown). In fact, neutralization of TGF-&#x003b2; led to increased IL-10 production by both T&#x000a0;cell subsets (<xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>). Thus, the development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells only depended on the presence of IL-12 together with high antigen dose and not on other soluble factors such as IL-2 or TGF-&#x003b2; or on the presence of other T&#x000a0;cell types.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>IL-10 Production by Th1 Cells Is Dependent on STAT4 but Not on STAT6, IFN-&#x003b3;, or IL-4 Signaling</title><p>To further elucidate the mechanisms required for the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10, we investigated the role of STAT4, one of the signaling pathways activated by IL-12 (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Murphy et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>).

In contrast, in the absence of STAT4, the percentage of cells expressing IFN-&#x003b3; was dramatically diminished as expected and resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells expressing IL-4, but not IL-10 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A), suggesting that STAT4 contributes to IL-10 expression by Th1 cells.</p><p>Because IL-10 expression is associated with an IL-4-induced Th2 cell phenotype, we investigated whether the differentiation of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells depended on signaling through the IL-4 receptor via STAT6 activation (<xref rid="bib19 bib37" ref-type="bibr">Glimcher and Murphy, 2000; Murphy et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). The absence of STAT6 did not impair the differentiation of IL-10-producing Th1 cells in the presence of IL-12 and OVA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A). In fact, a higher percentage of STAT6-deficient cells compared with WT cells produced both IL-10 and IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A), which may be the result of the loss of Th2 cell control over a Th1 cell response. As expected, lack of STAT6 abrogated both IL-4 and IL-10 production by T&#x000a0;cells developed with IL-4 or with low antigen dose (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2C). However, in the absence of STAT4 signaling, IL-10 and IL-4 production by Th2 cells was if anything increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2C). Thus, in contrast to what was observed under Th1 conditions, IL-10 expression by Th2 cells depended on STAT6, but not on STAT4, signaling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>B and 2C).</p><p>To investigate whether the inability of STAT4-deficient T&#x000a0;cells to produce IL-10 might be due to the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;, as suggested before (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), we differentiated DO11.10 or DO11.10 IFN-&#x003b3;-deficient naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T&#x000a0;cells in the presence of IL-12 and increasing doses of OVA. The secretion of IL-10 as induced by high antigen dose, and IL-12 was not affected by an absence of IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D), showing that the expression of&#x000a0;IL-10 by Th1 cells is independent of IFN-&#x003b3;. In the absence of IFN-&#x003b3;, we observed an increase in the secreted IL-4 as expected (data not shown).</p><p>We also tested for any potential role of IL-4 in the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 by culturing DO11.10 or DO11.10 IL-4-deficient naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T&#x000a0;cells with IL-12 and increasing doses of antigen. As observed in the absence of STAT6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A), IL-4 deficiency had no effect on the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>E), but compromised the development of Th2 cells producing IL-10 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>F). Thus, our data suggested that IL-10 production by Th1 or Th2 cells was dependent on the specific signaling pathways required for their differentiation, given that STAT4 is required for the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 cells and STAT6 for Th2 cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>High Antigen Doses and STAT4 Are Required for the In Vivo Generation of IL-10-Producing Th1 Cells</title><p>To address the mechanisms regulating IL-10 production by Th1 cells in&#x000a0;vivo, we transferred DO11.10 cells into BALB/c recipient mice and immunized the recipients with very high doses of OVA-protein with or without added lipopolysacharide (LPS).

High antigen dose and IL-12 cooperated to induce maximal IL-10 production (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>A and 4B), given that this combination resulted in the highest numbers of IL-10-producing Th1 cells. Repeated high antigen dose stimulation in the absence of exogenously added IL-12 resulted in the production of IL-10 by Th1 cells, suggesting that repeated strong TCR triggering may overcome the need for IL-12 for IL-10 induction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C and 4D). However, IL-10 induction under these conditions was abrogated when IL-12p40-deficient DCs were used as APCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>E).

Th1 cells induced in the first week to produce IL-10 by culture with high antigen doses and IL-12 lost their ability to express IL-10 when recultured with low doses of OVA, which could be compensated for, to some extent, by addition of IL-12 to the secondary cultures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>F), again suggesting that antigen dose and IL-12 signals cooperate for the induction of IL-10.

To ensure that only T&#x000a0;cell signaling was being affected by U0126, we used an APC-free system in which the T&#x000a0;cells were differentiated in the presence of increasing doses of anti-CD3 and a constant amount of IL-12.

Addition of U0126 to the cultures abrogated the production of IL-10 at all doses of anti-CD3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C).

IL-10 expression by Th1 cells has been reported to regulate the immune response in leishmaniasis and toxoplasmosis. However, in many situations, IL-10 is not produced by Th1 cells in response to antigenic stimulation. Our goal was to address the molecular signals that determine whether Th1 cells develop to produce IL-10 (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Trinchieri, 2007</xref>). Here, we showed that Th1 cells required high-antigen-dose-induced ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation and IL-12-induced STAT-4 activation to produce IL-10. Our findings that ERK1 and ERK2 activation was a common pathway required for the production of IL-10 by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets, which differentiate along distinct pathways, such that IL-10 provides a highly regulated feedback loop to avoid the extremes of excessive inflammation or chronic infections and also allow a protective response to diverse pathogens.</p><p>In certain viral or parasitic infections (<xref rid="bib2 bib9 bib15" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Brooks et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Ejrnaes et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), high amounts of stimulation may lead to the chronic nonhealing infection shown to be regulated by IL-10. During the course of infection, after initial triggering with antigen, T&#x000a0;cells migrate to the tissue encountering high doses of antigen and factors produced by the innate immune response. Under these conditions, we speculate that Th1 cells will be induced to express high amounts of IL-10, in keeping with reports that IL-10-producing Th1 cells were found in CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> clones isolated from BAL but not blood of TB patients (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gerosa et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). Similarly, the immune response to a clinical isolate of <italic>L. major</italic>, which produces heavily infected nonhealing lesions, was found to be regulated by IL-10 derived from Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Th1 cells that coproduce IL-10 and IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), and the immune response during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection was found also to be regulated by Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Th1 cells (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Jankovic et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). It is likely that IL-10 production by Th1 cells is evoked under conditions of high inflammation and antigenic stimulation, whereas regulatory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T&#x000a0;cells producing IL-10 may operate to regulate the immune response under conditions in which the pathogen is clinically controlled, such as in infection with <italic>L. major</italic> (Friedlin strain) (<xref rid="bib8 bib49" ref-type="bibr">Belkaid et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Suffia et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). We now also reported that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T&#x000a0;cells cultured with high antigen dose and IL-12 differentiate into canonical Th1 effector cells, which, in addition to expressing large amounts of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-10, lose their IL-2 expression as described before in certain chronic infection models (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Sallusto et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). Our demonstration that loss of IL-2 is accompanied by production of IL-10 offers potential additional mechanisms whereby effector T&#x000a0;cell responses may be dampened during chronic disease.</p><p>Using an in&#x000a0;vivo transfer model of DO11.10 TCR transgenic cells (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Castro et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>), we showed that IL-10-producing Th1 cells were differentiated in the presence of high doses of OVA protein and LPS. We showed here that this induction of IL-10 in&#x000a0;Th1 cells in&#x000a0;vivo was markedly, but not totally, reduced in STAT4-deficient T&#x000a0;cells as observed during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jankovic et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). A high antigenic activation during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection or high antigen doses delivered in the presence of LPS, as seen in our system, may compensate for an absolute requirement for IL-12 in the induction of IL-10 by Th1 cells.</p><p>In our in&#x000a0;vitro system, repeated stimulation of Th1 cells with high antigen doses allowed the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 in an IL-12-dependent manner. IL-10 production by Th1 cells induced by high antigen dose and IL-12 was independent of IFN-&#x003b3;, in keeping with previous findings (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jankovic et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). However, a role for IFN-&#x003b3; in mediating IL-10 reactivation by Th1 cells during secondary infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic> has been suggested (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). We have found that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T&#x000a0;cells exposed to a high dose of antigen do not express IL-10 upon restimulation, but can be induced to produce IL-10 upon re-exposure to a high dose of antigen in the recall phase in the absence of added IL-12. However, this is dependent on the induction of IL-12 by antigen-presenting DCs. The combination of both high antigen dose and IL-12 resulted in the highest levels of IL-10 production and correlated with the high levels of ERK1 and ERK2 activation. The increased expression of IFN-&#x003b3; observed during the secondary phase will induce increased IL-12 production by DCs and suggests that repeated high-level TCR activation feeds back to upregulate IL-12 production by DC. It is thus likely that in <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection in&#x000a0;vivo (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), the requirement for IFN-&#x003b3; to induce IL-10, was for feedback upregulation of IL-12 by DCs, which in turn induced IL-10 in the Th1 cells.</p><p>Although IL-10 may be differentially regulated in Th1 and Th2 cells as has been reported (<xref rid="bib12 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Chang et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), some studies suggest the existence of common pathways, but the molecular basis for these is as yet unclear. Costimulatory OX-40 signals have been shown to negatively regulate IL-10 production (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Ito et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>) both in Th1 and Th2 cells, whereas ICOS signaling has been suggested to induce IL-10 (<xref rid="bib25 bib55" ref-type="bibr">Ito et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Witsch et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>) in both Th1 and Th2 cells. However, in some cases, ICOS signaling also regulates IL-4 production and Th2 responses (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Greenwald et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). We now provide a common mechanism of ERK1 and ERK2 activation for the regulation of IL-10 production in Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, although each subset differentiates along a distinct and subset-specific transcriptional pathway. This reinforces the fact that IL-10 is not a Th cell-subset-specific cytokine, but instead is produced in a tightly regulated fashion during each differentiation pathway. Of note, a role for ERK1 and ERK2 activation in the induction of IL-10 production has already been described for macrophages and DC (<xref rid="bib1 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Hacker et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Differential transcriptional regulation of IL-10 in Th1 and Th2 cells has been suggested (<xref rid="bib12 bib53" ref-type="bibr">Chang et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), and extensive histone acetylation of the IL-10 gene is detectable in fully polarized Th2 cells, but not Th1 cells (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chang et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). We provide evidence that IL-10 is produced in canonical Th1 cells and that its expression correlates with the expression of <italic>T-bet</italic> and the highest IFN-&#x003b3; production, in keeping with our observations that high-dose antigen stimulation and IL-12 signaling are required for IL-10 and IFN-&#x003b3; expression. It has also been shown that maintenance of IL-10 expression is conditional on IL-12 or IL-4 unless the IL-10 gene is imprinted by GATA-3 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chang et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>), which can remodel the IL-10 locus, thus explaining the highest amounts of IL-10 produced by Th2 cells (<xref rid="bib12 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Chang et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Shoemaker et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). We show here that high antigen dose and IL-12 drastically downregulate <italic>Gata-3</italic> expression, suggesting that additional factors are in place to induce IL-10 expression in Th1 cells, albeit transiently. Expression of <italic>c-maf</italic> was greatly diminished by high antigen doses in T&#x000a0;cells and yet was unexpectedly maintained by IL-12 and present in Th17 cells. That <italic>c-maf</italic> expression is common to IL-10-producing Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells and, like IL-10, is dependent on ERK activation in Th1 and Th17 cells for its expression is of interest because c-Maf has been shown to be an essential transcription factor for IL-10 expression in macrophages (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cao et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we show that although Th1, Th2, and Th17 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T&#x000a0;cell subsets differentiate along distinct signaling and transcriptional pathways, they can all be induced to make IL-10. ERK1 and ERK2 activation is required for IL-10 production by all these Th cell subsets. With regard to the expression of IL-10 by Th1 cells, our data provide a mechanism for how IL-10 expression is induced and then amplified and regulated by the levels of antigen and IL-12 encountered in the environment. This provides a mechanism whereby a Th1 cell responds to extrinsic signals, reflecting increased inflammation in the tissue, to tightly regulate the production of IL-10 so as to allow a protective response to eradicate a pathogen with minimal damage to the host and also prevent chronic infection. Moreover, our findings have important implications for the regulation of IL-10 production during an inflammatory Th1 response in infection and may be of relevance for the design of vaccines and for strategies in immunotherapy in infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Mice, Cytokines, Antibodies, and Other Reagents</title><p>BALB/c DO11.10 mice transgenic for OVA-specific TCR WT or crossed back with Rag1-, IL-4-, IFN-&#x003b3;-, STAT4-, and STAT6-deficient mice were used as a source of antigen-specific T&#x000a0;cells (<xref rid="bib36 bib40 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Murphy et&#x000a0;al., 1990; Ouyang et&#x000a0;al., 1998; Shoemaker et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>) and were bred and maintained under SPF conditions at the NIMR, London, Home Office, UK, Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 or at the Washington University School of Medicine.
