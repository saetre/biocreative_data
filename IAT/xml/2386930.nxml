Glioma-associated oncogene 1 (GLI1) is a transcription factor that acts as the terminal signaling effector but also represents a pathway target gene. Here we report the identification and functional properties of novel GLI1 splice variants generated by skipping exons 2 and 3 and encoding an N-terminal truncated GLI1 protein (GLI1&#x00394;N). Analysis of the GLI1&#x00394;N mRNAs in adult human tissues revealed comparable expression levels to the full-length GLI1 (GLI1FL), whereas in tumor cell lines a generally lower and more variable expression pattern was observed. Furthermore, GLI1&#x00394;N is up-regulated by HH signaling to the same extent as GLI1FL but has a weaker capacity to activate transcription. However, in specific cellular contexts GLI1&#x00394;N may be more potent than GLI1FL in activating endogenous gene expression. Moreover, the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1 (Dyrk1) potentiates the transcriptional activity of GLI1FL but not GLI1&#x00394;N. Interestingly, GLI1FL, in contrast to GLI1&#x00394;N, is localized solely at the nucleus, in line with its increased transcriptional capacity. The negative regulator of the pathway, Suppressor of Fused (SUFU), elicits a cytoplasmic retention of the GLI1 isoforms, which is more pronounced for GLI1FL, as this contains an N-terminal SUFU binding domain. Collectively, our findings reveal that the activation mechanism of the terminal transducer of the pathway, GLI1, is mediated not only by GLI1FL but also by the GLI1&#x00394;N variant.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>Author's Choice</italic>&#x02014;Final version full access.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported in part by the <grant-sponsor>Swedish Cancer Fund</grant-sponsor>, the <grant-sponsor>Swedish Research Council</grant-sponsor>, and the <grant-sponsor>Magnus Bergvalls</grant-sponsor> and <grant-sponsor>Anders Otto Sw&#x000e4;rds/Ulrika Eklunds foundations</grant-sponsor>.

Genome-wide analysis indicates that at least 75% of human multiexon genes have alternative splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). Additionally, variations in the splicing pattern of gene products have been related to pathological states including cancer. It is now believed that a minimum of 15% of the point mutations responsible for human genetic diseases are in fact interfering with splicing regulatory events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). Alternative splice variants have the potential of being used as diagnostic markers and/or therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>).</p><p>The Hedgehog (HH)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">4</xref> signaling pathway was first reported as a major pathway involved in pattern formation during development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and embryonic developmental processes in vertebrates. Additionally, abnormal activation of the pathway has been linked to several cancers including basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, lung, prostate, and pancreatic tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as the model organism significant findings on the mechanism of this pathway have been revealed. Active signal transduction is generally associated with binding of HH ligands to the Patched (PTCH) receptor. This releases the inhibitory effects of PTCH on the signaling molecule Smoothened (SMO), thus initiating a series of molecular events that lead to up-regulation of target genes by the transcription factor, <italic>Cubitus interruptus</italic> (Ci). However, in mammals gene duplications of many signaling components have resulted in increased complexity. The three HH (Sonic, Desert, and Indian HH), the two PTCH (PTCH1 and PTCH2), and the three Ci (GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3) orthologues have different biological functions and tissue distributions. Interestingly, the negative regulator of the pathway, PTCH1, its paralogue, PTCH2, and the positive regulator, GLI1, are all up-regulated by HH signaling resulting in negative and positive feedback loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies indicate that variations in the choice of exons that are included in the mature, spliced mRNA molecules do occur in molecular components of the HH signaling pathway. PTCH1 and PTCH2 variants characterized by alternative first exons, exon skipping/inclusion, and/or alternative terminal exons have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). Interestingly, some but not all of the alternative first exon variants of PTCH1 are up-regulated by HH signaling. These up-regulated variants are the ones with the strongest capacity to inhibit signal transduction and act therefore as the main mediators of the negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). The transcription factor GLI2 is also characterized by several splice variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Moreover, the significance of such variations in pathway components is corroborated by a genome-wide RNA interference screen that identified a large number of splicing and RNA-regulatory proteins that modulate HH signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>).</p><p>Glioma-associated oncogene 1 (GLI1) is a transcription factor, which acts as a terminal effector of the HH signaling pathway, in addition to being a target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). <italic>GLI1</italic> has been characterized as an oncogene and its overexpression leads to basal cell carcinoma in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). Moreover, it also acts as a key molecule in the regulation of glioma growth and the self-renewal of cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Additionally, Wang and Rothnagel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) have identified splice variants in the 5&#x02032; noncoding region of GLI1. In this report we provide evidence for splicing variations that alter the coding sequence of GLI1. These variants lack an interaction domain with the negative regulator of the pathway, Suppressor of Fused (SUFU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>), and have unique capacities in activating transcription of target genes.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Tissue Distribution Analysis</italic>&#x02014;PCR primer pairs were designed for both alternative first exons of GLI1. Multiple tissue cDNA panels from BD Biosciences were used with the primers obtained from MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany).

Thirty-five cycles with 20 s at 94 &#x000b0;C, 20 s at 66 &#x000b0;C, and 30 s at 72 &#x000b0;C were performed on a PTC-200 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, MA). Amplifications without exogenous cDNA were used in all sets of experiments as a negative control. The PCR products were analyzed on a 4% NuSieve 3:1 agarose gel (FMC BioProducts, ME). All DNA bands were sequence verified by using BigDye Terminator version 1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kits and an ABI prism DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, CA).</p><p><italic>cDNA Expression Constructs</italic>&#x02014;For construction of the GLI1&#x00394;N expression plasmid, we first performed a PCR amplification using the Expand PCR System (Roche Diagnostics) on cDNA from HEK293 cells, which express this variant, and a GLI1 primer set (5&#x02032;-CTCAAGCTTGGCACCATGAGCCCAT and 5&#x02032;-CACAGATTCAGGCTCACGCTTC). The PCR product and a full-length 3&#x02032;-FLAG-tagged GLI1 expression plasmid in pCMV5 were digested with HindIII and XhoI restriction enzymes and then ligated resulting in a construct with deleted exons 2 and 3. Additionally, SalI- and BglII-digested FLAG-tagged GLI1FL or GLI1&#x00394;N fragments were subcloned into SalI- and BamHI-digested pBABEpuro. The 3&#x02032;-GFP-tagged GLI1FL and GLI1&#x00394;N constructs were generated from the HindIII and NdeI fragments of FLAG-tagged GLI1FL/GLI1&#x00394;N expression plasmids in pCMV5, the NdeI and NotI fragments of EGFP-tagged GLI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>), and the HindIII and NotI fragments of pEGFP-N3 (BD Biosciences). All constructs were verified by sequencing.</p><p>The other expression and reporter constructs used have been described in previous reports, the full-length 3&#x02032;-FLAG-tagged PTCH1 constructs with the alternative first exons, 1, 1B, and 1C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), 5&#x02032;-Myc-tagged PTCH1 with the alternative first exon 1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>), PTCH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), Dyrk1WT, Dyrk1KR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>), and the SUFU expression constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>), and the 12xGLIBS-luc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>), <italic>PTCH2</italic>-luc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), <italic>IL1R2</italic>-luc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>), and a mouse <italic>Ptch1</italic>-1B-luc<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">5</xref> reporter construct.</p><p><italic>Cell Culture and Transfection</italic>&#x02014;The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 and the murine fibroblast cell lines NIH3T3 and C3H10T1/2 were cultured as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Human fibroblast cell line hTERT-BJ1 (BD Biosciences), medulloblastoma cell line Daoy, which stably expresses EGFP (EGFP-Daoy), rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines RMS13 and CCA, prostate carcinoma cell lines DU145 and 22Rv1, pancreas carcinoma cell line Panc1, gastric adenocarcinoma cell line AGS, lung adenocarcinoma cell lines H22 and H522, and lung carcinoma cell line A549 were cultured according to the ATCC-LGC Promochem (Middlesex, United Kingdom) and Metalab (Bologna, Italy) recommendations. Expression constructs for the GLI1 splice variants and other pathway components, and the appropriate reporter construct were transfected into cultured cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). For selection, NIH3T3 and C3H10T1/2 cells were co-transfected with the neomycin-resistant pcDNA3.1His (Invitrogen) and then incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with 0.6 mg/ml G418 (Sigma).</p><p><italic>Reporter Assays</italic>&#x02014;Reporter assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). 12xGLIBS-luc, <italic>Ptch</italic>-1B-luc, <italic>PTCH2</italic>-luc, or <italic>IL1R2</italic>-luc reporter constructs together with the internal control, pRL-SV (Promega) were co-transfected into the appropriate cell lines. Normalized luciferase activity was determined with the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) using the Luminoskan Ascent (Thermo Electron Corporation, MA) according to the supplier's recommendations. All experiments were analyzed independently three times.</p><p><italic>Immunofluorescence Microscopy</italic>&#x02014;Transfected NIH3T3 cells were plated into the Lab-tec chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International, NY). The next day, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and cold methanol for 10 min. Nonspecific binding of the primary antibodies was reduced by first blocking the cells using a solution of phosphate-buffered saline with 5% normal goat serum for 60 min. Then anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal (1:800, Sigma), anti-hemagglutinin rabbit polyclonal (Y-11, 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-SUFU rabbit monoclonal (C81H7, 1:200, Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-PTCH1 rabbit polyclonal (H-267, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 0.3% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline were added and incubated overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C. After the cells were washed, fluorescent-tagged secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488-goat anti-mouse IgG (1:6000, Invitrogen), and Alexa Fluor 546-goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:6000, Invitrogen) were applied. Three phosphate-buffered saline washes (5 min) were also used after each treatment. The nuclei were stained with 5 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> DRAQ5 (Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland). Slides were mounted in FluorSave reagent (Carbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany). Fluorescence images were collected using a LSM510 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) confocal laser-scanning microscope with a Plan APOCHROMAT &#x000d7;63/1.4 OilDIC objective lens.</p><p><italic>Western Blotting</italic>&#x02014;48 h after transfection, proteins were extracted by lysis buffer (50 m<sc>m</sc> Tris (pH 7.4), 1%. SDS, 250 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 2 m<sc>m</sc> dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1 (Sigma), and 1% mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). After normalization based on protein concentration measured by the DC Protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), samples were run on a SDS-acrylamide gel. Thereafter, proteins were transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). GLI1 isoforms or &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-tubulin as internal control were determined by the use of anti-GLI1 rabbit polyclonal (Cell Signaling Technology) or &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-tubulin rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) was used as the secondary antibody, followed by detection of these proteins with the Western Lightning Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).</p><p><italic>RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription</italic>&#x02014;Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells, using the RNA-Bee reagent (Tel-Test Inc., TX) or the RNeasy kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol. For reverse transcription, 5 &#x003bc;g of total RNA, 4 &#x003bc;l of a 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> dNTP mixture (2.5 m<sc>m</sc> each), and 0.5 ng of oligo(dT)<sub>18</sub>(A/C/G)(A/C/G/T) primer in a total volume of 12 &#x003bc;l were denatured at 65 &#x000b0;C for 5 min. After cooling the mixture on ice, 4 &#x003bc;l of 5&#x000d7; RT buffer, 2 &#x003bc;l of 0.1<sc>m</sc> dithiothreitol, and 1 &#x003bc;l of ribonuclease inhibitor (New England Biolabs) were added. Following incubation at 45 &#x000b0;C for 2 min, 1 &#x003bc;l of SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) or water (negative control) was added. Then the mixture was incubated at 45 &#x000b0;C for 90 min. The reaction was stopped by heat inactivation at 75 &#x000b0;C for 15 min.</p><p><italic>Real-time RT-PCR</italic>&#x02014;Relative levels of the GLI1 variant RNAs or transcripts of the pathway target genes <italic>Gli1, Ptch1, Ptch2</italic>, and <italic>Sfrp</italic> were quantified by real-time RT-PCR using SYBR Green. Duplicate samples of each PCR mixture, each containing 4.7 &#x003bc;l of POWER SYBR Green PCR master mixture (Applied Biosystems), 0.3 &#x003bc;l of a 10 pmol/&#x003bc;l of primer mixture, 0.3&#x02013;1.0 &#x003bc;l of cDNA, and water to a total volume of 10 &#x003bc;l were transferred into a 96-well plate on an ABI 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The samples were initially incubated at 95 &#x000b0;C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles with 95 &#x000b0;C for 15 s, 65 &#x000b0;C for 15 s, and 72 &#x000b0;C for 30 s. Dissociation curves were generated after each PCR run to ensure that a single, specific product was amplified. The results were analyzed with the comparative Cycle threshold (Ct) method. For normalization, we used the expression level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), &#x003b2;-actin (ACTB), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1, ribosomal protein, large, P0 (RPLP0), and TATA box-binding protein for the human samples and Acidic ribosomal protein (Arp), Hprt1, and Gapdh for the mouse samples. From the results obtained the two housekeeping genes with the most scattered values were eliminated and then all data were normalized by the average Ct of the remaining housekeeping genes. Samples that were not reverse transcribed were used as negative controls. The PCR primers are shown in supplemental Table S1. The primer specificity was verified by BLAST searches and analysis of the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by sequence determination.</p><p><italic>Polysome Analysis</italic>&#x02014;GLI1 transcripts associated with polysomes were fractionated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>).

Twenty fractions were collected and the RNA was isolated using the RNA-Bee reagent and LiCl precipitation. Transcript levels were measured by real-time RT-PCR as described above but with the use of random primer 6, 5&#x02032;(dN<sub>6</sub>) (New England BioLabs). The percentage of individual transcripts in each gradient fraction was calculated from the Ct values. The isolated RNA from each fraction was also analyzed using denaturing 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis.</p><p><italic>Statistical Analysis</italic>&#x02014;The statistical significance was calculated using the PRISM software (GraphPad Software, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p><italic>Identification of Novel GLI1 Splice Variants</italic>&#x02014;We have performed <italic>in silico</italic> screening for novel splice variants in components of the HH signaling pathway, as described in a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). In a series of analyses, we found a human EST sequence (BX100365) of GLI1 with an uncharacterized splicing event. This sequence juxtaposed exon 1A directly to exon 4. Alternative splicing of GLI1 at the noncoding first exons 1 and 1A has already been reported by Wang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Therefore, to analyze in detail the splicing pattern of GLI1, we performed RT-PCR on human and mouse cDNA panels with forward primers within exons 1 or 1A and a reverse primer within exon 4. The results showed that skipping of exons 2 and 3, with exon 1 spliced directly to exon 4, occurs in several human tissues, including lung, kidney, pancreas, and ovary (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Moreover, the expression ratio of the two mRNAs was &#x0223c;1:1 and this was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (data not shown). Additionally, similar results, with exon 1A and exon 4 spliced together, were also obtained (data not shown). Unexpectedly, these splicing events do not occur in the mouse (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>, data not shown).</p><p>The deduced protein structure of both exon 1 to exon 4 and exon 1A to exon 4 splice variants lacked 128 amino acids in the N-terminal end and thus the encoded variant is termed GLI1&#x00394;N (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>).

Expression of both the full-length GLI1, GLI1FL, and GLI1&#x00394;N was observed in all cells analyzed, with the ratio of GLI1FL to GLI1&#x00394;N being about 9 times in HEK293 cells. Moreover, in the RMS13 and CCA cell lines that originate from rhabdomyosarcoma and in the Panc1 cell line originating from pancreatic tumor this expression ratio was less than 6 times. On the contrary, in the H23, H522, and A549 cell lines that originate from lung carcinoma the ratio reached and exceeded the value of 30. At this point it is difficult to determine whether these altered ratios of the GLI1 isoform expression may be relevant for HH signaling-dependent tumorigenesis. However, it is of interest to note that the relatively high GLI1 expression in the RMS13 cell line is also significantly higher than the levels observed in the human tissues analyzed before.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of GLI1FL and GLI1&#x00394;N in tumor cell lines.</bold> GLI1FL and GLI1&#x00394;N were quantified by real-time RT-PCR using SYBR Green.

To this end cytoplasmic extracts of RMS13 cells were subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation to separate the polysomal from the ribosome-free mRNA fractions. In the presence of cycloheximide, which prevents ribosome dissociation from the translating mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>), the GLI1&#x00394;N mRNA was mostly found in the heavier fractions containing the polyribosomes, as was the GLI1FL mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). In the presence of EDTA, which disrupts ribosome-mRNA associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>), there was a shift of both the GLI1&#x00394;N and GLI1FL mRNAs toward lighter fractions that contain ribosome-free mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). Thus, the polysome profiles of the GLI1&#x00394;N and GLI1FL mRNAs are quite similar, and therefore it is very likely that the GLI1&#x00394;N mRNA is also translated, even though its low expression prohibits detection of the protein by Western blotting.</p><p><italic>Biochemical Characterization of GLI1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>N</italic>&#x02014;To elucidate the functional role of GLI1&#x00394;N, this as well as GLI1FL were cloned into the three mammalian expression vectors, pCMV5, pBABEpuro, and pEGFP.

On the other hand, the transcriptional activity, as determined by the 12xGLIBS-luc reporter, was higher for GLI1FL than GLI1&#x00394;N in the FLAG-tagged pCMV5 and pBABEpuro constructs, regardless of the transfected cell lines (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>, and supplemental Fig. S2). However, in the pEGFP constructs the activity of GLI1FL and GLI1&#x00394;N was comparable, possibly indicating that the bulky EGFP tag at the C terminus may interfere with the GLI1 activity. It therefore appears that in the cellular assays used, GLI1&#x00394;N has no increased transcriptional capacity relative to GLI1FL, even though it lacks one binding domain for the negative regulator of the pathway, SUFU.</p><p>Inhibition of GLI1 activity by SUFU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>), PTCH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>), and the small molecule <underline>G</underline>li <underline>ant</underline>agonists, GANT58 and GANT61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>), has already been reported. Therefore we analyzed the sensitivity of GLI1&#x00394;N to these inhibitors. As expected, GLI1&#x00394;N, which lacks the N-terminal SUFU binding domain, had a weaker repression by SUFU in comparison to GLI1FL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>D</italic></xref>). On the other hand, PTCH1 could inhibit GLI1&#x00394;N activity to the same extent as GLI1FL, and this was not dependent on the PTCH1 splice variant used (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>E</italic></xref> and supplemental Fig. S3).

To clarify the effect of the lack of the N-terminal region and the SUFU binding domain of GLI1 on localization, we transfected the FLAG-tagged GLI1&#x00394;N and GLI1FL constructs into NIH3T3 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). GLI1FL localized in the nucleus, but GLI1&#x00394;N had a broader signal in both the nucleus and cytoplasm with a punctiform pattern, in line with its reduced transcriptional capacity. To further examine the relation between GLI1 localization and activity, we co-transfected the GLI1 constructs and SUFU into the NIH3T3 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Both GLI1FL and GLI1&#x00394;N accumulated in the cytoplasm, indicating a dramatic influence of SUFU on GLI1FL localization, which parallels its strong inhibitory effects on the transcriptional activity. PTCH1 co-transfection also resulted in cytoplasmic accumulation of both GLI1 isoforms, in line with the PTCH1 negative influence on GLI1 activity (supplemental Fig. S4).</p><p>Interestingly, the GLI1FL and GLI1&#x00394;N constructs with the EGFP tags, which have a comparable transcriptional activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>), also have a comparable localization pattern, with presence mainly in the cytoplasm (supplemental Fig. S5). Thus, inclusion of the bulky EGFP tag apparently alters the nuclear-only distribution of the GLI1FL isoform. Consequently, the GLI1 transcriptional activity is positively influenced by nuclear accumulation, with SUFU having a strong capacity for cytoplasmic sequestration of the GLI1FL isoform.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Biochemical characterization of GLI1&#x00394;N.</bold><italic>A</italic>, protein expression following transfection of FLAG-tagged pCMV5 and pBABEpuro or EGFP-tagged pEGFP constructs of GLI1&#x00394;N and GLI1FL into HEK293 cells.

When the subcellular localization of the GLI1 isoforms was examined in the presence or absence of Dyrk1WT or Dyrk1KR, no major changes were observed (supplemental Fig. S6).

Similarly to the full-length GLI1, GLI1FL, the generation of GLI1&#x00394;Nis also dependent on HH signaling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Both GLI1 isoforms can act as transcription factors, with GLI1FL being generally more potent than GLI1&#x00394;N (Figs. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8, <italic>A&#x02013;D</italic></xref>, and supplemental Fig. S2). However, in C3H10T1/2 cells the activation capacity of GLI1&#x00394;N on endogenous genes may be more pronounced than that of GLI1FL (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>E</italic></xref>). Moreover, GLI1&#x00394;N and GLI1FL are under distinct cellular controls, as exemplified by the differential effects of SUFU and the Dyrk1 kinase on their activities (Figs. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5<italic>D</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Interestingly, GLI1FL is found to be localized in the nucleus, in contrast to previous reports that predominantly detected it in the cytoplasm. This may be due, at least in part, to the fact that a bulky EGFP tag was used in these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). Additionally, the generally higher GLI1FL activity relative to GLI1&#x00394;N correlates with nuclear localization, and the GLI1 inhibitory effects of SUFU and PTCH1 with cytoplasmic sequestration. Finally, the stronger SUFU inhibition and cytoplasmic shifts of GLI1FL <italic>versus</italic> GLI1&#x00394;N are apparently due to the lack of a SUFU binding domain in the latter isoform.</p><p>GLI1 and its paralogue GLI2 recognize and bind to the same DNA sequences and activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>). However, although the target genes of GLI1 and GLI2 do overlap, there is not a complete identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). Similarly, although GLI1&#x00394;N contains the same DNA binding domain as GLI1FL, each isoform appears to be characterized by a partially independent target gene activation mechanism (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This finding strengthens the notion that alternative splicing may be a biological process, in addition to gene duplication, that is able to increase the functional diversity of gene products. In fact, in the Wnt signaling pathway, which antagonizes HH signaling, there are four transcription factors, the TCF/LEF paralogues, capable of generating a number of splice variants, and this diversity is functionally important for mediating tissue- and stage-specific Wnt regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). Thus in the HH and Wnt developmental pathways, splicing variations in the terminal transcription factors may represent an effective means for achieving a highly regulated biological cross-talk.</p><p>SAG treatment elicited a nearly equal increase of the GLI1&#x00394;N transcripts as of GLI1FL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). On the other hand the expression ratios of the two GLI1 isoforms varied greatly in the tumor cell lines analyzed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The GLI1FL/GLI1&#x00394;N ratio tends to be high in cells derived from lung carcinoma, but is significantly lower in cells from rhabdomyosarcoma. This suggests that the expression of the GLI1 isoforms may also be actively controlled by factors other than the ones implicated in HH signaling.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>FIGURE 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for regulation of expression and transcriptional activity of the GLI1 variants.</bold> Hedgehog signaling increases the transcription of both GLI1FL (<italic>blue</italic>) and GLI1&#x00394;N(<italic>yellow</italic>), with additional factors, exemplified by <italic>X</italic>, having a role in balancing their expression levels. The subcellular localization and the capacity of the two isoforms to regulate transcription are controlled by SUFU, PTCH1, and the Dyrk1 kinase, with other factors, exemplified by <italic>Y</italic>, also modulating the specificity of their transcriptional activities. <italic>Red arrows</italic> indicate inhibitory effects on the GLI1 nuclear accumulation and/or the GLI1 activity, whereas a stimulatory effect is shown by the <italic>green arrow</italic>. The <italic>long black arrows</italic> indicate transport to or from the nucleus. The <italic>line width</italic> of the <italic>red</italic> and the <italic>long black arrows</italic> represents the relative intensity of these effects.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0250838450009"></graphic></fig></p><p>In similarity with the PTCH1-1Ckid mRNA variant characterized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>), the GLI1&#x00394;N splice form was detected in the human but not in the mouse. Recent reports indicate that only 10&#x02013;20% of cassette-type alternative splicing events are conserved between human and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). It is not yet clear what the implications of these differences in splicing variations among species may be. However, splice variants have the potential to encode a larger variety of functionally different proteins than gene paralogues. It may therefore be important to pay attention to a possible influence of alternative transcription and alternative splicing in the context of developing mouse models for human diseases.</p><p>In summary our findings reveal an increased complexity in the activation process of the terminal effector of HH signaling, GLI1, and are summarized in the model of <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>. GLI1&#x00394;N and GLI1FL transcripts are up-regulated not only by HH signaling but also additional factors play a role in balancing their expression levels (Figs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Moreover, the transcriptional capacity of GLI1&#x00394;N and GLI1FL is differentially regulated by SUFU and the Dyrk1 kinase (Figs. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5<italic>D</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Additionally, other factors (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) are also likely to influence the gene activation properties of the two GLI1 isoforms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M800299200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800299200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.
