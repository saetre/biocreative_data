A conserved ORF (mDUX), embedded within D4Z4-like repeats, encoding a double-homeodomain protein, was recently identified on mouse chromosome 10. We show here that high level mDUX expression induces myoblast death, while low non-toxic levels block myogenic differentiation by down-regulating MyoD and Myf5. Toxicity and MyoD/Myf5 expression changes were competitively reversed by overexpression of Pax3 or Pax7, implying mechanistic similarities with the anti-myogenic activity of human DUX4. We tested the effect of mDUX expression on <italic>Xenopus</italic> development, and found that global overexpression led to abnormalities in gastrulation. When targeted unilaterally into blastomeres fated to become tail muscle in 16-cell embryos, mDUX caused markedly reduced tail myogenesis on the injected side. These novel cell and animal models highlight the myopathic nature of sequences within the FSHD-related repeat array.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), one of the most common inherited myopathies, is caused by a contraction within a subtelomeric array of D4Z4 repeats 4q35.2.

Together these results show that mDUX, like human DUX4, is generally toxic for various cell types when expressed at high levels. However, unlike DUX4, oxidative stress is not the principal reason for death of cells expressing mDUX. Given this toxicity, it is remarkable that transcription of mDUX has been reported in various tissues, including robust expression in CNS, lung and liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007003-Clapp1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Which cell types within those organs, and at which stages they express mDUX, was not shown, however splicing variants were suggested, and these could theoretically result in non-toxic versions of the protein. We used the whole mDUX ORF sequence (2 kb) as a template to generate <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization probes and were not able to detect any robust and convincing mDUX expression (from the sense strand) in embryonic neural tube, adult brain or muscle tissue (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>mDUX and myogenic regulators</title><p>mDUX, DUX4 and DUX4c each contain two homeoboxes of the Pax family, each with significant sequence similarity to the Pax3 and Pax7 homeoboxes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007003-Bosnakovski2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. These Pax factors are the master myogenic regulators of embryonic and adult myogenesis, respectively (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007003-Buckingham1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>). In our previous work, we demonstrated that DUX4 and DUX4c both interfere with the expression of myogenic regulators and suggested that this was due to competitive binding between DUX and Pax proteins for the same regulatory sites in these genes. The apical targets of Pax3/Pax7 in the cascade of myogenesis are MyoD and Myf5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007003-Tajbakhsh1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007003-Bajard1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. One interesting difference between DUX4 and DUX4c in this regard is that DUX4 upregulates Myf5 about two-fold in myoblasts (more in fibroblasts) whereas DUX4c represses Myf5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007003-Bosnakovski1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007003-Bosnakovski2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. For this reason we analyzed the expression of MyoD and Myf5 in mDUX-expressing myoblasts. As predicted, transcription of MyoD was rapidly downregulated (seen by 4 hours post-induction) with 500 ng/mL doxycyline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). We confirmed these rapid kinetics at the protein level using immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). For Myf5 we detected a slight downregulation after 4 hours and a more significant downregulation after 8 hours of induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). As a consequence of the MyoD suppression, some of its target genes including myogenin and m-cadherin were also downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). MyoD binds to noncanonical E boxes in the myogenin gene through interactions with Pbx1 and Meis1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007003-Maves1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In mDUX-induced cells, we detected a slight repression of Pbx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). On the other hand Pbx3, Pbx4, Meis1 and Meis2 remained unchanged (data not shown). Interestingly, we found that Pax7 was also suppressed, suggesting the possibility of interference with a Pax7 positive autoregulatory loop. Three lines of evidence suggest that these changes are not simply due to cells becoming apoptotic and downregulating gene expression generally. First, DUX4 has many upregulated targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007003-Bosnakovski2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, and we discovered at least one upregulated target of mDUX, namely MEF2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Second, genes downstream of MyoD are also repressed, but with correspondingly delayed kinetics. For example, desmin expression is not significantly affected until 12 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), suggesting a secondary effect resulting from MyoD depletion. Third, MyoD was downregulated by mDUX induced with as little as 8 ng/ml doxycyline for 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). At that level we did not observe any significant toxic effect even after 48 hours of induction. MyoD and Myf5 are critical myogenic factors. In order for progenitors to be able to undergo myogenic differentiation, they must at one point express MyoD and/or Myf5; accordingly, mice null for both MyoD and Myf5 lack all skeletal muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007003-Rudnicki1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

Differentiation was induced by culturing confluent iC2C12-mDUX cells in nutrition/growth factor-poor medium (DMEM supplemented with 2&#x00025; horse serum). During the course of differentiation, mDUX was induced with 2.5, 10 and 25 ng/ml of doxycyline. In the presence of 10 or 25 ng/ml doxycycline, differentiation was visibly impaired, while non-treated cells fused and formed typical elongated myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). At the terminal stages of the experiment (after day 6 of differentiation) some dead cells were observed at 10 and 25 ng/mL dox, but the majority were alive and still attached to the plate, and at 25 ng/mL, even sporadic myotubes were not seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Differentiation and formation of mature myotubes was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining for MyHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) and measuring the myotube fusion index (percent of nuclei within myotubes). The fusion index in the control and 2.5 ng/mL-induced cells was slightly over 50&#x00025;. However the number of the nuclei within myotubes in the 10 ng/mL-induced group was much decreased, and the myotubes that did form were smaller and shorter. Immunostaining and qRT-PCR for MyoD revealed reduced expression in the induced cells which was proportional to the levels of inhibition of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g003">Fig. 3B and D</xref>). Gene expression analyses of markers of differentiation, myogenin, MCK and desmin further confirmed diminished differentiation in the mDUX-induced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). To eliminate the influence of doxycyline by itself on myogenic differentiation we conducted the same experiments on the iC2C12 parental and C2C12 (grand-parental) cell lines. We did not find any significant doxycyline-related inhibition of differentiation by immunofluorescence for MyHC, calculation of myotube fusion index, or analysis of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g003">Figure 3E, F and G</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007003-Bosnakovski1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007003-Bosnakovski2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

All embryos expressing mDUX died prior to day 7 (stage 45) showing severe defects in morphology consistent with the initial defects in gastrulation. No large scale cell death was apparent, which suggests that at this concentration, the main deleterious effect of mDUX is to interfere with cell and tissue movements, in addition to any effects it may have on myogenesis. To bypass the effects of early mDUX expression on gastrulation movements, we then performed injections into blastomeres V2.1 and V2.2 on one side of a sixteen-cell stage embryo.

This similarity was the key factor in our hypothesis that DUX proteins, including mDUX, interfere with Pax3 and Pax7 by competing for the same DNA targets. One prediction of this hypothesis is that excess Pax3 or Pax7 in cells should block or reduce the toxicity of DUX proteins, and we found this to be the case for DUX4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007003-Bosnakovski2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore transduced iC2C12-mDUX cells with Pax3 or Pax7 using retroviral vectors bearing ires-GFP reporters (allowing identification of transduced cells) or GFP alone. Transduced cells (60&#x02013;70&#x00025; infection rate) were FACS-sorted to obtain a homogeneous cell population. Subsequent FACS analyses confirmed that almost all of the sorted, expanded cells were GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>) and immunofluorescent staining confirmed that the GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells expressed Pax3 or Pax7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).

This experiment demonstrated that cells overexpressing Pax3 or Pax7 are resistant to the toxicity of mDUX induced by 32 ng/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). The rescue was complete in the first 24 hours and still significant after 48 hours.

On the other hand, cell death was rapid in the control cells expressing only GFP. The competitive effect of Pax3 and Pax7 was also evident on the expression of myogenic regulators. MyoD and its target genes, which were rapidly downregulated by mDUX even with low levels of doxycyline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), were resistant to low levels (32 ng/ml) of mDUX in the Pax3 or Pax7 transduced populations but not in the GFP-only controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007003-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>).

Specific differences between mDUX and DUX4 were noted: mDUX downregulated Myf5 whereas DUX4 upregulated Myf5, mDUX-expressing cells did not stretch before dying whereas DUX4-expressing cells did, and mDUX-mediated death could not be rescued by antioxidants, as it could to a significant degree for DUX4. With regard to Myf5, mDUX actually behaves as DUX4c, which downregulated both MyoD and Myf5. With regard to cellular morphology and oxidative stress, it should be noted that DUX4 provokes multiple deleterious pathways, and although antioxidants could fully rescue from low levels of DUX4, it could only partially protect against high levels of DUX4, and then only for a few days. The distinction between mDUX and DUX4 in this regard may be more a distinction of the degree to which various similar pathways are affected, rather than a qualitatively different mechanism of cell death. Like DUX4, mDUX shows a biphasic response: high levels were toxic while low levels perturbed differentiation and myogenic gene expression. Considering the toxic effects of mDUX expression, its interaction with myogenic regulators and inhibition of myogenic differentiation in both cell- and organism-based assays, we propose that the mouse D4Z4-like arrays represent a genetic unit functionally orthologous to the DUX4-bearing repeats at human 4q35.2. Although the normal function of these repeats remains unknown, the abnormal expression of the double homeodomain protein they encode results in clear myopathic effects, with several lines of evidence suggesting that these effects are relevant to FSHD. We therefore propose that intervention in the normal expression or repression of mDUX through either deleting integral numbers of murine repeats, insertion of a strong enhancer into the vicinity of the repeat array, or placing sequences from the repeat array, for example the mDUX ORF, under the control of a tissue-specific, regulated promoter would represent physiologically relevant ways to model FSHD in mice.</p><p>Because the mechanism linking the D4Z4 deletion to myopathy has not been established, there is an urgent need for animal models that incorporate D4Z4 sequences. We have developed a model based on expression of the mDUX ORF during <italic>Xenopus</italic> development. This model makes evident the myopathic nature of D4Z4 itself. Furthermore, it is experimentally tractable and amenable to a medium-throughput approach. It represents an example of a vertebrate model based on sequences encoded by the repeats affected by the FSHD deletion itself, and highlights the utility of using rapidly developing lower vertebrates to model human genetic disease.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Cloning of mDUX</title><p>The mDUX ORF was amplified from 100 ng mouse genomic DNA by 0.4 uM forward (atggcagaagctggcag) and 0.4 uM reverse (tcagagcatatctagaagagtct) specific primers using FastStart High Fidelity PCR mixture ( 5 ul 10&#x000d7; buffer with 1.8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> , 200 uM of each dNTP and 2&#x00025; DMSO; all from Roche).
