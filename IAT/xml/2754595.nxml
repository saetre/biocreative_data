C3H/HeN mice were infected with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> and skin, joint, heart and bladder samples were collected following two weeks of infection.

For stable integration of the complemented construct, <italic>lp6.6</italic>, along with an antibiotic resistance cassette, was inserted into an intergenic chromosomal locus in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. As our efforts for complementation of <italic>lp6.6</italic> mutant involving the native promoter failed to yield any transformants, we sought to complement the mutant using the <italic>B. burgdorferi flaB</italic> promoter as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).

Lp6.6 is subsurface lipoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Katona <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>) that lacks a detectable antibody response in infected hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Lahdenne <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Previous studies determined that over-expression of vector-specific borrelial genes in mice, such as <italic>ospA</italic>, by genetically manipulated isolates, induces robust and specific borreliacidal antibodies that severely impact <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Strother <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Xu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, continual <italic>lp6.6</italic> expression by complemented mutants within the murine host did not significantly influence spirochete persistence (data not shown). Many of the borrelial membrane proteins that are differentially-expressed in the vector or in hosts, such as OspA/B, BmpA/B, DbpA/B and CRASP-related proteins, are members of a common operon or paralogous gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Casjens et al., 2000</xref>), and in many instances are co-transcribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Dobrikova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">El-Hage and Stevenson, 2002</xref>). Although <italic>lp6.6</italic> is a unique gene, its expression pattern mostly resembles that of <italic>ospA</italic>, and is likely regulated by similar environmental signals and genetic regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Caimano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, <italic>lp6.6</italic> does not downregulate in parallel with <italic>ospA</italic> during nymphal feeding, raising the possibility that, at least during transmission, <italic>lp6.6</italic> expression might be governed by an unknown regulatory pathway. Nevertheless, the consistent expression of <italic>lp6.6</italic> within ticks, which is analogous to other borrelial genes important in the vector, such as <italic>ospA</italic> and <italic>ospB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Neelakanta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), indicates that Lp6.6 function is likely important for the spirochete life cycle in ticks. While <italic>lp6.6</italic> mutant did not display detectable growth deficiencies <italic>in vitro</italic>, transient defects in persistence within feeding infected ticks were apparent (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). This is the phase at which spirochetes dramatically increase in number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">de Silva and Fikrig, 1995</xref>) and disseminate from feeding ticks to the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Ohnishi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Piesman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Piesman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>). The detection of lower numbers of <italic>lp6.6</italic> mutants in the tick gut due to possibly more efficient transmission is unlikely, as burdens of <italic>lp6.6</italic> mutants that exited the gut and migrated either to the salivary glands (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, right panel) or to the murine host (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>), were significantly lower than wild type and complemented isolates. Lp6.6 thus serves an unknown function during the transmission of spirochetes, which involves a series of carefully orchestrated yet poorly-defined events including timely escape through gut epithelia and potential peritrophic barriers, dissemination via the hemolymph, invasion of the salivary gland, and transfer to the mammalian dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Fikrig and Narasimhan, 2006</xref>). Spirochete proteins that are differentially produced in ticks, including Lp6.6 and other proteins regulated by the RpoN-RpoS pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Fisher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), might play a role in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> transmission from ticks as well as in establishment of early host infection.</p><p id="P15">In cellular membranes, multiple proteins assemble into distinct protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Alberts, 1998</xref>), which perform specific roles in membrane physiology and contribute to microbial virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pyndiah <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Stenberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). We show that Lp6.6, although differentially expressed in the spirochete life cycle, is one of the prominent constituent members of all OM protein complexes. Both 2D BN/SDS-PAGE and protein cross-linking analyses identified Lp6.6 as a participant in multiple protein complexes, with the highest abundance in low molecular-weight complexes. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed chemical crosslinking of Lp6.6 could be due to the abundance of antigen in the OM, and thus, opportunistic crosslinking to other membrane proteins. The appearance of Lp6.6-containing protein complexes in 2D BN/SDS-PAGE as a continual smear is commonly observed in protein complexes of other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Krall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pyndiah <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Stenberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The occurrence of protein complexes in the bacterial OM and their roles in pathogen biology vary among gram-negative bacteria. For example, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> OM contains only two multi-protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pyndiah <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), fumarate reductase and urease enzyme complexes, composed of 10 individual proteins and primarily involved in the energy metabolism, which may not be essential for <italic>H. pylori</italic> survival <italic>in vitro</italic> but are required for pathogen colonization in the host gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Ge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> OM, on the other hand, contains nine homo- or hetero-oligomeric complexes composed of a total of 12 participating proteins and each complex carries a specific function related to general diffusion, drug transport, stationary phase adaptation, and biogenesis or integrity of the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Stenberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). We have identified 7 protein complexes in the OM of wild-type spirochetes, which are also maintained in <italic>lp6.6</italic> mutants. Therefore, Lp6.6 is probably not a core member of the protein complexes required for their assembly, but may provide an auxiliary role, for example, by maintaining complex stability, as shown for a small OM lipoprotein in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R54">Sklar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Lewis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).
