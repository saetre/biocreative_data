Under nitrogen limitation, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> undergoes a dimorphic filamentous transition called pseudohyphae, which helps the cell to forage for nutrients and reach an environment conducive for growth. This transition is governed by a complex network of signaling pathways, namely cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR, which controls the transcriptional activation of <italic>FLO11</italic>, a flocculin gene that encodes a cell wall protein. However, little is known about how these pathways co-ordinate to govern the conversion of nutritional availability into gene expression. Here, we have analyzed an integrative network comprised of cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR pathways with respect to the availability of nitrogen source using experimental and steady state modeling approach. Our experiments demonstrate that the steady state expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> was bistable over a range of inducing ammonium sulphate concentration based on the preculturing condition. We also show that yeast switched from <italic>FLO11</italic> expression to accumulation of trehalose, a STRE response controlled by a transcriptional activator Msn2/4, with decrease in the inducing concentration to complete starvation. Steady state analysis of the integrative network revealed the relationship between the environment, signaling cascades and the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>. We demonstrate that the double negative feedback loop in TOR pathway can elicit a bistable response, to differentiate between vegetative growth, filamentous growth and STRE response. Negative feedback on TOR pathway function to restrict the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> under nitrogen starved condition and also with re-addition of nitrogen to starved cells. In general, we show that these global signaling pathways respond with specific sensitivity to regulate the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> under nitrogen limitation. The holistic steady state modeling approach of the integrative network revealed how the global signaling pathways could differentiate between multiple phenotypes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In diploid strains of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, transition from a nutrient-rich to a nutrient-limited growth medium is shown to control a switch from budding yeast to filamentous form called pseudohyphae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Gimeno1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, the regulation of these pathways in response to the availability of nitrogen source was not analyzed. Moreover, cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR pathways are global regulators involved in a wide range of functions and therefore, it will be interesting to study how these pathways co-ordinate and signal to achieve a desired phenotype.</p><p>cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways are shown to activate key transcriptional activators Flo8 and Ste12-Tec1 complex, respectively which binds to the distinct region present in the <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter ( see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001663-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Rupp1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Lo2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Nitrogen starvation or rapamycin treatment is shown to inactivate TOR pathway. Tor kinase phosphorylates Tap42, which complexes with phosphatase Sit4 and Pph21/22. Further, Sit4 and Pph21/22 controls Gln3 mediated NCR genes and Msn2/4 mediated STRE genes, respectively. Tor-activated Tap42 also participate in the global translational initiation.

However, Mep2, which senses the concentration of ammonium sulfate, functions upstream of cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways was not included in the previous model. Therefore, we began our analysis by analyzing these two pathways with respect to Mep2. The upstream regulation of cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways by Mep2 were integrated into our existing steady state model of these pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001663.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

The profile demonstrated a highly sensitive response with a Hills coefficient of 8 and K<sub>0.5</sub> of 24 nM.

A Hill type equation including inhibition by ammonium sulphate was used to relate the concentration of ammonium sulphate to Mep2 (see Equation 4). The values of nH8, nH9 and K<sub>9</sub> were obtained by fitting the experimental data, while the value of K was obtained from the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Lorenz2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

The comparison of the predicted dose response curve with the experimental data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001663-g003">Figure 3b</xref> (solid line). It can be seen that when cells from a medium containing higher concentration of nitrogen was introduced into the medium containing limiting concentration of nitrogen, the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> increased with Hills coefficient of 2 and remained activated in the range of 6 &#x000b5;M&#x02013;300 &#x000b5;M. However, the experiments indicated a range of 25 &#x000b5;M&#x02013;300 &#x000b5;M in which <italic>FLO11</italic> was fully expressed. The predicted response matched the concentration of ammonium sulphate at which the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> was switched on, but did not match the concentration required for switching off. A steady state response curve was obtained by neglecting the first term of Equation 4 and it was observed that the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> did not drop at low concentration of ammonium sulphate (see dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001663-g003">Figure 3b</xref>).

This analysis indicated that the drop in the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> depended on the first term of Equation 4, which essentially functions as a mechanism to restrict the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> under starvation. However, it is not clear regarding the molecular mechanism involved in decreasing the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>. We also simulated the condition wherein cells precultured on nitrogen starved medium were introduced into medium containing various limiting concentrations of ammonium sulphate. Simulation results showed that the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> was reversible and did not depend upon the preculturing condition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001663-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). This indicated that the signaling structure present in the network comprising of cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways do not contribute to the bistable behavior as observed in our experiments.</p><p>The other relevant pathway involved in regulating the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> depending on the availability of nitrogen was TOR pathway. Therefore, we also modeled the TOR pathway at steady state to evaluate the influence on the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>. The Tor activity is shown to be higher under nitrogen rich and lower under nitrogen starvation condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Cooper1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Crespo1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the variation of TOR pathway with the availability of nitrogen source has not been analyzed before. Further, loss of Tor activity resulted in a complete loss of G1 cyclins by translational repression and degradation, which led to G1 arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Barbet1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, filamentous growth observed under nitrogen limiting condition required the activity of G1 cyclins Cln1/2 and the removal of inhibitory function of Cln3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Loeb1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, Tor activity was also needed for the translation of specific mRNAs involved in the filamentous growth indicating a positive role in this phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Cutler1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggested that filamentous growth might still require a signal confirming the limited presence of nitrogen only through partial loss of Tor activity. In order to understand such a variation in Tor activity with availability of nitrogen source, we simulated the possible solution space under which Tor kinase can function to regulate the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>. We assumed a Hill type dependence between fractional Tor activation and ammonium sulphate concentration as given by Equation 5. We performed a parametric sensitivity analysis to evaluate the feasible values for nH and K<sub>0.5</sub> in Equation 5.</p><p>In our experiments, the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> was maximum over a wide concentration range of ammonium sulphate, i.e 25 &#x000b5;M&#x02013;300 &#x000b5;M. Since certain level of Tor activity was essential for the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>, the activity of Tor should be maintained in this range. This implied that the variation in the activity of Tor on ammonium sulphate concentration between 25 &#x000b5;M&#x02013;300 &#x000b5;M should not be drastic. Further, the activity of Tor should be high under normal growth promoting condition, while should be low under complete starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Cooper1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Crespo1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, the parameter values should be such that it yields a partial Tor activity in the range where <italic>FLO11</italic> was completely expressed. Based on the above criteria, we simulated a surface plot for the ammonium sulphate concentration of 50 &#x000b5;M and 200 &#x000b5;M at varying nH and K<sub>0.5</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001663-g004">Figure 4a and 4b</xref>). For both 50 &#x000b5;M and 200 &#x000b5;M concentration of ammonium sulphate, there existed three distinct regions comprising of fractional activity of Tor greater than 80&#x00025; (region-1, red zone), lesser than 20&#x00025; (region-2, blue zone) and in between 30-70&#x00025; (region-3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001663-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). A comparison between these two surface plots yielded a common region of nH and K<sub>0.5</sub> values, where the difference in the activity of Tor was minimum and also not a part of a region with high or low Tor activity. We observed that such a common region existed for nH value lesser than 0.3 and K<sub>0.5</sub> greater than 0.01mM, where the difference in Tor activity was less than 10&#x00025; (region below the white line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001663-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Such a region represented the possible range of nH and K<sub>0.5</sub> values over which Tor kinase can function to regulate the filamentous growth.

Dotted, dashed and solid lines indicated the response curve for 90&#x00025;, 50&#x00025; and 10&#x00025; of the total concentration of Clb2, respectively. For a minimum concentration of Clb2 (less than 10&#x00025;), the dose response shows a subsensitive response with a Hills coefficient of 0.3 and the fractional Cln1/2 concentration was at a higher steady state for higher concentration of ammonium sulfate (solid line). However, with increase in the concentration of Clb2, the fractional Cln1/2 concentration decreased to a lower steady state value (dashed and dotted line). Furthermore, the fractional Cln1/2 concentration was low irrespective of Clb2 concentration at lower concentration of ammonium sulphate due to the limitation in the activity of Tor. This analysis indicated that the concentration of Cln1/2 strongly depended on the activity of Tor and the concentration of Clb2. Moreover, in the concentration range wherein filamentous growth was induced, Cln1 concentration was at a higher steady state only if the concentration of Clb2 was at a minimum (solid line in region-1). Studies have shown that the activity of mitotic cyclin Clb2 decreases during filamentous growth to induce mitotic delay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Rua1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Ahn1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, such a decrease in mitotic cyclin activity can also account for the high activity of G1 cyclin Cln1/2 observed during the filamentous growth.

To study the effect of TOR pathway on Msn2/4 translocation, input from the cAMP-PKA pathway was held constant (i.e. the term Tpk in Equation 6). This resulted in a higher export rate from the nucleus with 90&#x00025; of Msn2/4 accumulating in the cytoplasm. The nuclear accumulation of Msn2/4 occurred with loss in the activity of Tor under nitrogen starvation. Tor kinase mediated this effect through negative regulation of the phosphatase Pph21/22 as given by Equation 7. We have analyzed the sensitivity with which TOR pathway regulated the phosphatase Pph21/22 and thereby the export rate of Msn2/4. The sensitivity for the negative regulation of phosphatase Pph21/22 by Tor kinase is given by Hills coefficient &#x02018;nH13&#x02019; in Equation 7.

Further, in this range, the nuclear accumulation of Msn2/4 should be less than 10&#x00025; for a high Tor activity of 90&#x00025;. The plot clearly showed that with 90&#x00025; Tor activity, the nuclear accumulation of Msn2/4 was less than 10&#x00025; for the values of nH11 and nH13 between 3&#x02013;4 and 0.8&#x02013;3, respectively (region-2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001663-g006">Figure 6b</xref>).

This analysis indicated that with the inclusion of TOR pathway, the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> with respect to changes in the concentration of ammonium sulphate was unchanged (i.e. reversible). Thus, TOR pathway essentially integrated the STRE response controlled by Msn2/4 without any effect on the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>. This was in sharp contrast with experimental observations which had demonstrated a bistable behavior with both expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> and accumulation of trehalose based on the preculturing conditions. However, these phenotypes are strongly linked to the activity of Tor and therefore, any variation in the activity of Tor with preculturing conditions might bring about the difference in the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>. For example, nitrogen starved cells which are shown to be depleted of G1 cyclins needed to synthesize the degraded cyclins when transferred to a media containing inducing concentration of filamentous growth. However, the cells grown on nitrogen rich media had higher activity of G1 cyclins. The experiments carried out with cells precultured in nitrogen rich and starved medium had this difference with regard to the protein level of G1 cyclins. We hypothesized this difference in cyclin concentration might bring about a differential expression in <italic>FLO11</italic>, as G1 cyclin Cln1/2 was shown to be a transcriptional activator of <italic>FLO11</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Loeb1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. This difference resulted only if we assumed that there was a difference in the activity of Tor under these two conditions. TOR pathway mediated negative regulation of phosphatase Pph21/22 involved phosphorylation of Tap42, which formed a complex with Pph21/22 to downregulate its activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-DiComo1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Jiang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In turn, Pph21/22 was shown to dephosphoryate Tap42, thereby function negatively with respect to activity of Tor. These results indicated the presence of a negative feedback on the activity of Tor. Hence, we postulated that complete activation of Pph21/22 under nitrogen starvation condition might antagonize the activity of Tor with re-addition of nitrogen source. Under these circumstances, higher concentration of nitrogen source was required to overcome the antagonism.

The network behavior was evaluated in terms of fractional expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> using Equation 1. The simulated dose response matched well with the experimental values for a Hills coefficient of 4 and K<sub>0.5</sub> of 2.5 nM with respect to the concentration of Cln1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001663-g008">Figure 8b</xref>). This indicated that the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> was highly sensitive to the concentration of Cln1, which in-turn depended on the fractional activation of TOR pathway. Moreover, the simulated dose response for the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> shows a bistable behavior over the inducing concentration range of ammonium sulphate. Depending upon the direction of the simulation, the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> switched between stable steady states, with higher state favored only under downshift from high to inducing concentration of ammonium sulphate. Similarly, the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> failed to respond under upshift from starvation to inducing concentration of ammonium sulphate, which resulted in an irreversible response (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001663-g008">Figure 8b</xref>). However, the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> can be achieved provided the cells are again precultured in a medium containing higher concentration of nitrogen and later exposed to the inducing concentration of nitrogen. This indicated that cells are responding to the downshift in the nitrogen availability, which was required to trigger the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>. The observed bistability in expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> can be directly related to the bistable behavior of the TOR pathway. Under vegetative growth conditions (i.e., concentration of ammonium sulphate greater than or equal to 1mM), the activity of Tor was high and demonstrated a subsensitive response with respect to the concentration of ammonium sulphate (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001663.s003">Figure S3</xref>). However, in the region between 25 &#x000b5;M to 1mM concentration of ammonium sulfate, the activity of Tor demonstrated a bistable response, which remained subsensitive to the lowering of nitrogen concentration, but was switched off in response to the increasing nitrogen concentration. For concentration of ammonium sulphate below 25 &#x000b5;M, the activity of Tor remained switched off, which helped the cells in activating the STRE responses under nitrogen starvation. Thus, the activity of Tor shifted from a subsensitive response to a bistable response when cells are precultured in nitrogen rich condition and exposed to varying concentration of nitrogen. However, when cells are precultured in nitrogen starved medium, the activity of Tor switched on only after remaining switched off in both starvation and filamentous growth regions (i.e., beyond 1mM of ammonium sulphate concentration). As expected when the feedback of Pph21/22 on Tor was removed, the bistability vanished and only a subsensitive response was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001663.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001663-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001663.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Simulated dose response for a network comprising of cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR pathways with negative feedback on Tor included.</title><p>(a) A simplified network comprising of different components of cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR pathways considered for the simulation are shown (b) Bistable response of <italic>FLO11</italic> expression over an inducing concentration range of ammonium sulfate. <italic>FLO11</italic> expression exists in two stable states, i.e. either high or low based on the preculturing condition.

We have quantified the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> at different steady state concentration of ammonium sulphate. The observed systemic behavior was co-related to the structure of the signaling network with the help of a steady state model. In our experiments using liquid medium, we have demonstrated that the cells precultured in nitrogen rich medium were able to switch on the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> when transferred to media containing limiting concentration of ammonium sulphate. However, with the concentration of ammonium sulphate decreased towards starvation, the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> was switched off and the accumulation of trehalose increased to a maximum. Further, cells in the liquid media responded by inducing the filamentous growth involving the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>, however without the formation of filament. The expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> was required for the formation of filament in solid media, which helped the cells to forage for nutrients and reach the environment conducive for growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Gimeno1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This difference observed with liquid media can result from the fact that the cells are responding to an uniform concentration of ammonium sulphate, which is sufficient for the expression <italic>FLO11</italic>, but not for the formation of filaments.</p><p>We have analyzed the switching on and switching off function of the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> by considering a network comprising of cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR pathways, whose involvement in filamentous growth is well studied. Steady state model developed based on these pathways indicated that the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> switched on by the activation of both cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways and with partial loss of Tor activity under inducing concentration of ammonium sulphate. The expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> was highly sensitive to the concentrations of Flo8 (cAMP-PKA pathway) and Cln1/2(TOR pathway), whereas subsensitive to the concentration of Ste12-Tec1 (MAPK pathway) (see Equation 1). The repression of <italic>FLO11</italic> expression under severe limitation in the concentration of ammonium sulphate primarily depended on the Tor activity. The activity of Tor decreased from partial loss during the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> (i.e. between 25 &#x000b5;M to 300 &#x000b5;M concentration of ammonium sulphate) to complete repression below 25 &#x000b5;M concentration of ammonium sulphate. This was evident from the fact that the decrease in Tor activity increased the STRE activity controlled by Msn2/4 resulting in the accumulation of trehalose. Under complete starvation condition, both cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways do not get activated due to the absence of ammonium transport through Mep2, which along with complete loss of Tor activity contributed towards restricting the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>. Moreover, we also demonstrated that cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways can remain inactive with decrease in the concentration of ammonium sulfate towards starvation (i.e. below 25 &#x000b5;M) to restrict the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>, provided a mechanism exist to antagonize its activation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001663-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). Increase in STRE activity due to loss in the activity of Tor might antagonize the activation of cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways. However, we rule out this possibility since the conditions which inhibited the activity of Tor does not affect the phosphorylation state of Msn2-NLS controlled by PKA of cAMP pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Gorner1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, loss of TOR activity does not spill into cAMP-PKA pathway indicating that the TOR pathway function parallel to cAMP-PKA pathway. Evidences showed that cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR pathways function in parallel to regulate the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>, where loss of function in either of these pathways was sufficient to restrict the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Rupp1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Cutler1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Pan2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in the regulatory network of filamentous growth, multiple signaling pathways function parallely to integrate the signals onto the <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter and thereby control its expression.</p><p>Our analysis also quantified the difference between nitrogen starvation (less than 25 &#x000b5;M concentration of ammonium sulphate) and nitrogen limitation (25 &#x000b5;M-300 &#x000b5;M concentration of ammonium sulphate). The signaling events during these phases differ distinctly resulting in cells preferring the accumulation of trehalose to filamentous growth under nitrogen starvation, while preferring filamentous growth under condition of nitrogen limitation. Our analysis indicated that TOR pathway was able to distinguish between these two states to trigger appropriate response in order to survive under nutritional stress. Such difference in the intensity of stress is shown to trigger different response even in the case of other stress responses such as in osmotic stress, where cells survived severe osmotic stress by accumulating trehalose and moderate osmotic stress through glycerol accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Hounsa1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-ORourke1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Further, our experiments with cells precultured on nitrogen starved media failed to induce the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> when transferred to media containing inducing concentration of ammonium sulphate. This suggested that the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> was bistable over inducing concentration range of ammonium sulphate and can be either high or low depending on the preculturing state. Such an observation can be directly correlated to the presence of a positive feedback or double negative feedback operating within the filamentous signaling network, which is known to exhibit bistable response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Ferrell1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Ferrell2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the bistable system can become irreversible in the presence of a strong feedback. A strong positive feedback loop activates a phenotypic response in the presence of stimulus, but also prevents the response from turning off on removal of stimulus. In the case of double negative feedback loop, the phenotypic response is activated in the presence of stimulus and becomes inactivated on removal of stimulus, but also prevents the activation on re-introducing the stimulus. We observed that such a behavior brought about by double negative feedback loop resembled the response observed in our experiment with regard to the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>.</p><p>In the network comprising of cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways, we did not observe the presence of double negative feedback loop which can contribute towards a bistable response. However, in TOR pathway, the phosphatase Pph21/22 functioned reciprocally to the activity of Tor yielding a double negative feedback loop in the network (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001663-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Such a negative feedback on the activity of Tor antagonized its role in filamentous growth and made the system irreversible. Interestingly, evidence suggested that the increase in Msn2/4 activity can suppress the filamentous growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Stanhill1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Under nitrogen starvation condition, increase in Msn2/4 activity depended on the activation of phosphatase Pph21/22 and therefore can function to antagonize filamentous growth either directly or through a gene product activated by the transcriptional activator Msn2/4. This indicated that under inducing condition of filamentous growth, the cells have differed STRE responses to accommodate the adaptive response of filamentous growth by a mechanism which prevented or antagonized the Msn2/4 activity. Strains which are incapable of antagonizing the Msn2/4 activity under filamentous growth conditions have shown to lack the adaptive response of filamentous growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Stanhill1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Such a negative feedback regulation can maintain the off state of filamentous growth on addition of ammonium sulphate to nitrogen starved cells. In general, our analysis quantified the strength of the negative feedback, which made the system irreversible over a concentration range of ammonium sulphate. This interaction might be necessary as cells preferred degradation of reserves to specific adaptive response, while recovering from nitrogen starvation.</p><p>Mep2 and Tor kinase take part in sensing and signaling the availability of nitrogen source. Our analysis indicated that Mep2 signaling function was sensitive to the concentration of ammonium sulphate, whereas the activity of Tor was insensitive. Such difference in the sensitivity was necessary to achieve the desired properties of a phenotype. Furthermore, the difference in sensitivity also reflected their global role in signaling towards other phenotypes. For example, TOR pathway is shown to be a central controller of cell growth and variation in its activity strongly affected the growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Rohde2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Cardenas1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001663-Schmelzle1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Under such circumstances, if Tor activity was sensitive to nutrients, then for a small change in the concentration of nutrients, the activity of Tor would have decreased dramatically to inhibit growth, which might be undesirable. Therefore, the activity of Tor was subsensitive to the nutritional variation, which made the Tor mediated control of G1 cyclins and STRE regulated genes also less sensitive. This helped the cells to grow albeit slowly under nutritional limitation. Moreover, Tor kinase was able to perform multiple tasks such as control of vegetative growth through a subsenitive response, filamentous growth through a bistable response and starvation response by remaining switched off. In case of Mep2, since it was involved in the transport of ammonium sulphate under both higher and lower concentrations, its function towards signaling was restricted only under lower concentrations. Hence, cells switched to an adaptive response for the survival when the nutrient availability reduced below the threshold requirement for vegetative growth. This was possible only due to the sensitive response of Mep2 signaling to the concentration of ammonium sulphate.</p><p>The steady state analysis in tandem with experiments demonstrated how a complex signaling network interlinks various pathways to respond to changes in the nutritional status. Specific to the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>, three pathways cAMP-PKA, MAPK and TOR operated parallely to decide the appropriate phenotypic response based on the degree of nutritional availability. It should be noted that these pathways have global role in regulating multiple phenotypes and therefore, variation in the sensitivities of these pathways toward each phenotype might help the cells to achieve the desired phenotype. We have demonstrated how these signaling pathways with specific sensitivity towards expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> are integrated to respond under nitrogen starvation. It will be interesting to study the sensitivity with which these global players regulate other phenotypic responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The general methodology that was used to characterize the steady state behavior of the signaling network involved in regulating a phenotypic response is shown as a flowsheet in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001663.s004">Figure S4</xref>.

Based on the comparison of the results to that obtained through experiments, possible hypotheses can be evoked to rationalize the experimental observations.

Therefore, we assumed that Mep2 can activate Gpa2 either through direct downregulation of Gpb1/2 or through Gpr1. Under such a condition, Mep2 can also activate Ras2 by downregulating the Gpb1/2, a known stabilizer of Ira1, thereby controlling MAPK activation. Mep2 as an upstream activator of cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001663.s001">Figure S1</xref>.

Therefore, Mep2 should sense and signal to downstream while transporting under inducing condition.
