In cell-free extract prepared from the thymocytes of wild type but not MUTYH-null mice, adenine opposite 8-oxoG in DNA was excised by MUTYH, however, the generated apurinic (AP) site opposite 8-oxoG mostly remained unincised. Recombinant mouse MUTYH (mMUTYH) efficiently excised adenine opposite 8-oxoG and prevented mouse AP endonuclease (mAPEX1) from incising the generated AP site. In contrast, an AP site opposite 8-oxoG created by uracil DNA glycosylase or tetrahydrofuran opposite 8-oxoG was efficiently incised by mAPEX1 in the presence of an excess amount of mMUTYH. Mutant mMUTYH with R361A or G365D substitution, excised adenine opposite 8-oxoG as efficiently as did wild-type mMUTYH, but failed to prevent mAPEX1 from incising the generated AP site. Wild-type mMUTYH bound duplex oligonucleotides containing A:8-oxoG pair with a lower apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> than that of the mutants, and prevented OGG1 from excising 8-oxoG opposite adenine or the generated AP site. The G365D mutant failed to prevent OGG1 from excising 8-oxoG opposite the generated AP site, thus indicating that the protection of its own product by mMUTYH is an intrinsic function which depends on the C-terminal domain of mMUTYH.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cellular DNA is at high risk of being oxidized by reactive oxygen species, which are inevitably generated by normal metabolic functions such as mitochondrial respiration or by environmental exposure to ionizing radiation and chemicals. The oxidation of DNA appears to result in either spontaneous mutagenesis or cell death and, as a result, it is implicated in various age-related diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c1">1</xref>). Among the various types of oxidized damage in DNA, 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), an oxidized form of guanine, can pair with adenine as well as cytosine during DNA replication or transcription, and it is thus considered to be one of the spontaneous causes of mutagenesis or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c3">3</xref>).</p><p>Mutator mutants of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> revealed that the <italic>mutM</italic> (<italic>fpg</italic>) gene encoding 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase which excises 8-oxoG opposite cytosine in DNA, and the <italic>mutY</italic> gene encoding the adenine DNA glycosylase which removes the adenine incorporated opposite 8-oxoG in template DNA, play important roles in the prevention of such spontaneous mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c6">6</xref>). It has been established that most eukaryotic cells also possess either a MutM homolog or its functional homolog, OGG1 for the repair of 8-oxoG, and a MutY homolog (MUTYH or MYH) for the repair of adenine opposite 8-oxoG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c9">9</xref>).</p><p>Prokaryotic MutY and its mammalian homologs MUTYH proteins specifically recognize the adenine base that is misincorporated opposite 8-oxoG present in the template strand, and excise the adenine base by their intrinsic DNA glycosylase activity. The generated AP site opposite 8-oxoG by MUTYH is likely to be processed by the multi-enzyme base excision repair (BER) pathway to yield C:8-oxoG pair, which is then further processed by the BER pathway initiated by MutM or OGG1 to restore the C:G pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c10">10</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>E.coli</italic> and fission yeast, the absence of these repair enzymes resulted in significant increases in the spontaneous mutation rate, especially of G:C to T:A transversion mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c12">12</xref>). Recently, familial alterations in the human <italic>MUTYH</italic> gene have been reported to be possible causative mutations for certain types of familial colorectal tumors without a germ-line mutation in the <italic>APC</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c14">14</xref>). We recently generated MUTYH-null mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. In the MUTYH-null cells carrying no adenine DNA glycosylase activity, the spontaneous mutation rate increased 2-fold in comparison to wild-type cells, thus demonstrating that the absence of the MUTYH function in mammalian cells indeed results in a mutator phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c15">15</xref>).</p><p>In order to suppress G:C to T:A transversion mutation which is initiated by generation of 8-oxoG in template strand, MUTYH has to specifically excise adenine incorporated into the nascent strand only opposite the 8-oxoG, but not adenine in a template strand to which 8-oxoG is misinserted from the nucleotide pools. Therefore, it is proposed that MUTYH recognizes the nascent strand in association with various cellular proteins, such as PCNA or mismatch repair complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c17">17</xref>). After an excision of adenine opposite 8-oxoG, cytosine may be inserted opposite 8-oxoG during the repair synthesis, and thereafter OGG1 has to initiate an excision repair of 8-oxoG, thus resulting in a restoration of the G:C pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c18">18</xref>). In order to understand the molecular mechanism regulating how MUTYH accomplishes the appropriate repair processes, an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of such repair processes is essential.</p><p>In the present study, we examined the repair reaction by mMUTYH in cell-free extracts prepared from mouse thymus glands, and found that mMUTYH can excise adenine opposite 8-oxoG or guanine, however, an efficient incision was observed at the apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site generated only opposite guanine. Using recombinant mMUTYH and mAPEX1 proteins, we showed that mMUTYH excises adenine opposite 8-oxoG as well as guanine, and prevents mAPEX1 from incising the generated AP site only opposite 8-oxoG. Furthermore, we found that mutant mMUTYH (R361A or G365D) have a much higher dissociation rate than wild type from duplex DNA containing A:8-oxoG pair. As a result, the mutant protein is considered to lose the ability to prevent OGG1 from excising 8-oxoG opposite adenine or the generated AP site, as well as losing the ability to prevent mAPEX1 from incising the generated AP site opposite 8-oxoG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotides</title><p>Oligonucleotides shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh642tb1">1</xref>, were obtained from Greiner Japan, and the Hokkaido System Science.</p></sec><sec><title>Mouse</title><p>By means of gene targeting, we previously established <italic>Mutyh</italic> gene knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c15">15</xref>), and heterozygous mice (<italic>Mutyh</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>) backcrossed to C57BL6/J were maintained.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell-free extracts from thymocytes</title><p>Thymus glands were isolated from four-week old wild-type C57BL/6J and <italic>Mutyh</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice obtained by mating the <italic>Mutyh</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

Cleavage of &#x0002a;A-containing strand after NaOH treatment, which cleaves the generated AP sites by &#x003b2;/&#x003b4;-elimination, was examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f1">1</xref>B). The cleaved fragments (labeled as 19-P and 19-OH) of both duplex oligonucleotides were detected in the reaction products with wild-type extract but not MUTYH-null extract (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f1">1</xref>B, lanes 2, 3, 6, 7), thus indicating that mMUTYH is responsible for the reaction. A fragment co-migrating with a marker oligonucleotide (19-OH) with 3&#x02032;-OH group corresponds to the incision product by a class II AP endonuclease at the generated AP site after an excision of adenine opposite guanine or 8-oxoG by mMUTYH. Such an incised fragment (19-OH) by AP endonuclease was detected only from duplex oligonucleotides containing &#x0002a;A:G pair but not &#x0002a;A:GO pair (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f1">1</xref>B, lanes 2, 6).

No cleaved fragment was detected from the duplex oligonucleotides containing &#x0002a;A:T pair at the corresponding site after incubation with the cell-free extracts, with or without NaOH treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f1">1</xref>C, lanes 10, 11).</p><p>Addition of 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> into the reaction mixture caused non-specific degradation of the substrate (data not shown), probably due to enhanced nuclease activities in the extract. Dialysis of the cell-free extract against the lysis buffer without Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, the activity incising the generated AP site opposite guanine was completely abolished, thus Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or related ions carried over from thymocytes are enough to support the endogenous AP endonuclease activity.</p><p>More than two-thirds of the generated AP sites after an excision of adenine opposite 8-oxoG by mMUTYH remained unincised even after 3 h of incubation with the wild-type extract (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f1">1</xref>D, open squares), while the rest was slowly incised (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f1">1</xref>D, open triangles).

An excision of adenine opposite 8-oxoG by mMUTYH reached a plateau level within 5 min of incubation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f1">1</xref>F, open squares); in contrast, excision of adenine opposite guanine by mMUTYH slowly reached a plateau level after an incubation of &#x0003e;60 min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f1">1</xref>E, closed triangles). These results were also observed in cell-free extracts prepared from splenocytes and ES cells (data not shown).</p><p>As a result, mMUTYH more efficiently and rapidly excised adenine opposite 8-oxoG than adenine opposite guanine, thus generating AP sites.

Purified Trx-mMUTYH possesses an efficient adenine DNA glycosylase activity towards substrates with &#x0002a;A:GO pair with little or no turnover, but not AP lyase activity, since enzymatically incised product was not detected without NaOH treatment at all (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f3">3</xref>B, lanes 3&#x02013;6). These results indicate that Trx-mMUTYH possesses essentially the same catalytic functions as the native MUTYH protein, which also lacks AP lyase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c25">25</xref>).</p><p>The incubation of 20 nM substrate with A:GO pair in the presence of 40 nM Trx-mMUTYH resulted in the formation of AP site on &#x0223c;80% of the substrate, and it is detected as a 19-P fragment after NaOH treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f3">3</xref>C, closed circles). In the presence of His-mAPEX1, only a small part of the generated AP site was incised slowly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f3">3</xref>C, open triangles), detected as a 19-OH fragment regardless of NaOH treatment, while two-thirds of the generated AP sites still remained unincised even after 2 h of incubation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f3">3</xref>C, open squares). Since the same results were obtained after 30 min of incubation in the presence of 5 or 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (data not shown), the low concentration of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (0.2 mM) is not a limiting factor for the poor incision by His-mAPEX1. Previously, Young <italic>et al</italic>.

A synthetic AP site analog, tetrahydrofuran (F) was also placed opposite guanine or 8-oxoG (&#x0002a;F:G, &#x0002a;F:GO) in duplex oligonucleotides. Wild-type Trx-mMUTYH failed to prevent His-mAPEX1 from incising the pre-existing AP site (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f4">4</xref>A) or its synthetic analog (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f4">4</xref>B), either opposite guanine or 8-oxoG.</p><p>Next, we examined whether MUTYH forms a complex with duplex oligonucleotides with A:GO or F:GO, using a gel mobility shift assay.

Nicking assay of the reaction mixture revealed that adenine opposite 8-oxoG in the former MUTYH-DNA complex was likely to be mostly excised (data not shown), suggesting that MUTYH tightly binds to its product, duplex oligonucleotides with AP site opposite 8-oxoG, but not duplex oligonucleotides with the pre-exsisting AP sites opposite 8-oxoG.

The C-terminal halves of MutY homologs consist of a NUDIX domain as a major conserved functional domain, and bacterial MutT or hMTH1, which possess phosphohydrolase module in the NUDIX domain and hydrolyze 8-oxo-dGTP, also partly share amino acid sequences with MutY homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c31">31</xref>). In hMTH1, it is likely that the amino acid residues outside the phosphohydrolase module are involved in contact with its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c32">32</xref>), for example F27A substitution increased its dissociation constant both from 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-OH-dATP 5-fold over wild-type protein. Thus, we introduced substitutions into four conserved residues (Q360, R361, G365, F373) in the region of mMUTYH homologous to the flanking region of the hMTH1 phosphohydrolase module (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f2">2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f5">5</xref>), in order to obtain mutant Trx-MUTYH proteins with a reduced affinity to its substrate. Among these mutants, we found that mutants with R361A or G365D substitution, but not Q360A or F373A substitution, exhibited efficient incision of duplex oligonucleotides with A:GO pair by mAPEX1 (data not shown), thus these two mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f3">3</xref>A, lanes 2, 3). Furthermore, we prepared a mutant Trx-mMUTYH(D207N) protein lacking the adenine DNA glycosylase activity, in which a residue Asp 207 corresponding to the active site residue, Asp138 in MutY protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c33">33</xref>), was substituted with asparagine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f3">3</xref>A. lane 4, 3B, lane 9).</p><p>In the absence of mAPEX1, wild-type and D207N mutant Trx-mMUTYH proteins exhibited substantial levels of a shifted band of duplex oligonucleotides with &#x0002a;A:GO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f6">6</xref>A, lanes 1, 4), and only the wild-type preparation exhibited, to a much lesser extent, a shifted band of duplex oligonucleotides with &#x0002a;A:G pairs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f6">6</xref>A, lane 5). While R361A substitution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f6">6</xref>A, lanes 2, 6) markedly reduced such gel shift activity of Trx-mMUTYH protein for duplex oligonucleotides with &#x0002a;A:GO. Similar results were obtained in the presence of His-mAPEX1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f6">6</xref>B). G365D substitution, which corresponds to a germ-line mutation (G382D) found in patients with autosomal recessive colorectal adenomatous polyposis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c13">13</xref>), also exhibited the same effect as the R361A substitution (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f6">6</xref>A and B, lanes 3, 7). In the presence of mAPEX1, a shifted band was hardly detected for duplex oligonucleotides with A:G pair even with wild-type mMUTYH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f6">6</xref>B, lanes 5&#x02013;8).</p><p>We next compared the binding affinity of wild-type and mutant Trx-mMUTYH proteins for duplex oligonucleotides with A:GO pair or with F:GO, using a gel mobility shift assay. Since it was hard to achieve the saturated binding with increased concentrations of mutant proteins, we incubated the constant amount of each Trx-mMUTYH protein with increased concentrations of the duplex oligonucleotides, thus determined an apparent dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) for each. Wild-type Trx-mMUTYH protein exhibited the lowest <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value, 2.95 nM, while R361A and G365D exhibited a higher <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value, 10.8 nM for duplex oligonucleotides with A:GO pair (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f6">6</xref>C).

FAM-labeled duplex oligonucleotides with &#x0002a;A:GO pair (15 nM) were incubated with Trx-mMUTYH or Trx-mMUTYH(G365D) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of non-labeled duplex oligonucleotides containing A:GO, F:GO, C:GO or C:G pair, and then bound fraction of the FAM-labeled duplex was measured. Binding of wild-type Trx-mMUTYH to the FAM-labeled duplex oligonucleotides with &#x0002a;A:GO was efficiently competed by 10-fold excess duplex oligonucleotides (150 nM) with A:GO or F:GO pair (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f8">8</xref>A, lanes 1&#x02013;6). Similar results were obtained with Trx-mMUTYH(G365D) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f8">8</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;6), however, the latter exhibited much less binding to the FAM-labeled duplex with &#x0002a;A:GO pair in the absence of a competitor. There was no apparent difference between extents of the competition by A:GO and F:GO, both for wild type and G365D mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f8">8</xref>A and B, open squares and circles), probably because the concentration of the competitors exceeds their <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values for F:GO (&#x0003e;20 nM). Binding of Trx-mMUTYH(G365D) to the FAM-labeled duplex with &#x0002a;A:GO was partly competed with 50-fold excess duplex either with C:GO or C:G pair, in a similar extent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f8">8</xref>B, closed circles and open triangles), while the binding of wild-type Trx-mMUTYH was more efficiently competed by the duplex with C:GO than with C:G pair (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f8">8</xref>A, closed circles and open triangles). Since Trx-mMUTYH(G365D) exhibited much lower affinity to the duplex with A:GO pair, these results indicate that mMUTYH(G365D) also has a lower affinity to the duplex with C:GO pair than does wild-type mMUTYH.</p><p>We next examined whether MUTYH prevents OGG1, which is shown to specifically excise 8-oxoG opposite cytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c7">7</xref>), from excising 8-oxoG in duplex oligonucleotides or not. Unexpectedly, we found that OGG1 efficiently excised 8-oxoG opposite adenine (A:&#x0002a;GO) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f9">9</xref>A, circles), however, the reaction was slow in comparison to reactions on 8-oxoG opposite either tetrahydrofuran (F:&#x0002a;GO) or cytosine (C:&#x0002a;GO) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f9">9</xref>A, squares and triangles). The excision of 8-oxoG by OGG1 from duplex oligonucleotides containing C:&#x0002a;GO pair was not inhibited after the pre-incubation of the duplex with an increased concentration of wild-type Trx-mMUTYH or Trx-mMUTYH(G365D) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f9">9</xref>B, open and closed triangles). In contrast, the excision of 8-oxoG from duplex oligonucleotides containing A:&#x0002a;GO pair by OGG1 was efficiently inhibited after the pre-incubation of the duplex with wild-type Trx-mMUTYH, and a 50% inhibition was attained in the presence of 20 nM of Trx-mMUTYH, which corresponded to the concentration of the substrate (20 nM), and 90% of substrate was protected in the presence of 100 nM Trx-mMUTYH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f9">9</xref>B, open circles). With increased concentrations of Trx-mMUTYH(G365D) up to 100 nM, a 5-fold higher concentration than the substrate, only 40% of the substrate was protected from an excision of 8-oxoG by OGG1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f9">9</xref>A, closed circles). We thus concluded that MUTYH prevents OGG1 from excising 8-oxoG opposite adenine or the generated AP site and that G365D substitution apparently impaired the protective function of MUTYH against OGG1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSIONS</title><p>In the present study, we found that an AP site generated opposite 8-oxoG by MUTYH remains unincised for a couple hours in cell-free extracts which contain various enzymes involved in the BER pathway, including AP endonucleases and OGG1, thus indicating that the AP site generated opposite 8-oxoG is inefficiently processed by multi-enzyme BER pathway in the cell-free extracts. Using recombinant mMUTYH and mAPEX1 proteins, we demonstrated that mMUTYH protects the generated AP site opposite 8-oxoG by mMUTYH itself. The generated AP site opposite guanine by mMUTYH was not protected at all both in the cell-free extracts and the reconstituted reaction with recombinant mMUTYH and mAPEX1, thus indicating that this protective function of mMUTYH is specific for the AP site opposite 8-oxoG. Interestingly, mMUTYH could not protect either the pre-existing AP site opposite 8-oxoG which was created by uracil DNA glycosylase, or the synthetic AP site analog, tetrahydrofuran opposite 8-oxoG. These results indicate that mMUTYH protects only its own reaction product, the generated AP site opposite 8-oxoG after excision of adenine by its DNA glycosylase activity. We showed that mMUTYH binds duplex oligonucleotides containing tetrahydrofuran opposite 8-oxoG with a reduced affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x0003e; 20 nM) in comparison with its binding to duplex oligonucleotides with A: 8-oxoG pair (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> &#x0003c; 3 nM), thus indicating that a higher affinity is required for the efficient protection of the generated AP site opposite 8-oxoG by mMUTYH. These facts indicate that the binding mode of mMUTYH to its own reaction product, the generated AP site opposite 8-oxoG, must be different from that to the pre-existing AP site opposite 8-oxoG.</p><p>8-oxoG paired with cytosine is in an <italic>anti</italic> conformation as is normal guanine opposite cytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c34">34</xref>), while 8-oxoG opposite adenine is in a <italic>syn</italic> conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c35">35</xref>). The 8-oxoG opposite the AP site is most likely in the <italic>anti</italic> conformation, because the N-glycosydic bond can freely rotate without base pairing. The binding affinity of wild-type mMUTYH to duplex oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoG is likely to be determined by either the opposite base or the presence of AP site analog, tetrahydrofuran (F), and the order is: A &#x0003e; F &#x0226b; C, thus indicating that MUTYH preferentially recognizes 8-oxoG in the <italic>syn</italic> conformation. Recently, crystal structures of <italic>Bacillus stearothermophilus</italic> MutY&#x02013;DNA lesion recognition complex, which was stabilized through intermolecular disulphide cross-linking to a Asp114Asn variant of MutY, has been determined, and it was shown that adenine opposite 8-oxoG is flipped out of the DNA helix, while 8-oxoG swivels roughly 180&#x000b0; about its N-glycosidic bond, thus converted to the <italic>anti</italic> conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c36">36</xref>). In MutY-DNA complexes with F:GO, which mimics the pre-existing AP site opposite 8-oxoG, 8-oxoG is also in the <italic>anti</italic> conformation with or without soaked adenine, and there are some conformational alterations in the active site and the DNA backbone in comparison to the recognition complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c36">36</xref>).</p><p>It has been also shown that adenine base is rapidly released from <italic>E.coli</italic> MutY&#x02013;product complex, which is extremely stable as we observed in mMUTYH&#x02013;product complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c37">37</xref>). Thus, we may suggest that excision of adenine from the recognition complex by mMUTYH itself may cause some conformational alterations which can stabilize the mMUTYH&#x02013;product complex. Such conformational alterations may not take place when mMUTYH excises adenine opposite guanine or binds the pre-existing AP site opposite 8-oxoG, probably because of guanine opposite adenine or 8-oxoG opposite AP site are in the <italic>anti</italic> conformation. It is noteworthy that MUTYH does not protect the generated AP site opposite guanine with no turnover on the substrate. Since MUTYH weakly associates with the A:G reaction product as seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f6">6</xref>A, such weak interaction of MUTYH and its product may be sufficient to prevent its turnover. It is likely that the conformational alterations of the complex induced after excision of adenine by MUTYH itself also supports the interaction.</p><p>The residue G260 of the MutY, which correspond to the G365 residue in mMUTYH (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f5">5</xref>), initiates a type II turn in the C-terminal domain and backbone amide nitrogen atoms of this turn form hydrogen bonds with the two phosphates immediately 5&#x02032; to the 8-oxoG, suggesting that substitution of this residue G260 with an aspartate results in disruption of the structure of this turn and thus interferes with the ability of MutY to recognize faithfully 8-oxoG in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c36">36</xref>). The reduced affinity of mMUTYH(G365D) to duplex oligonucleotides with A:GO supports this hypothesis. While the residue R256 corresponding to the R361 residue in mMUTYH is likely to contact with the residue E267, and both residues reside in the anti-parallel &#x003b2;-sheets holding the turn and their electrostatic interaction may contribute to stabilize the turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c36">36</xref>). Since the residue E267 and its neighboring residues in <italic>B.stearothermophilus</italic> MutY are well conserved in mMUTYH including the residue E372 (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f5">5</xref>), suggesting that mMUTYH also has a similar local structure. Substitution of the residue R361 in mMUTYH with an alanine may disrupt the electrostatic interaction with the E372, and thus destabilizing the turn in the C-terminal domain. Again, destabilization of the turn may results in reduction of the affinity to the strand containing 8-oxoG as we observed in the mMUTYH(R361A) mutant.</p><p>It was shown that <italic>E.coli</italic> MutY binds to its own reaction product and protects 8-oxoG from excision by MutM, a functional homolog for OGG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c28">28</xref>). In the present study, we for the first time, provide biochemical evidence that mMUTYH protects its own product from the excision of 8-oxoG by OGG1 as well as from an incision of the AP site by AP endonucleases. OGG1 preferentially excises 8-oxoG opposite cytosine and AP site, and very slowly excises 8-oxoG opposite adenine. We showed that the pre-incubation of duplex oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoG:A pair with mMUTYH, during which adenine was excised and AP site was generated opposite 8-oxoG, efficiently prevented OGG1 from excising the 8-oxoG opposite AP site that is an efficient substrate for OGG1. Mutant MUTYH with the G365D substitution hardly prevented OGG1 from excising the 8-oxoG opposite adenine or AP site, indicating that the C-terminal domain of mMUTYH plays important role to protect 8-oxoG.</p><p>The structures of the prokaryotic MutY-DNA complex also revealed that the six-helix barrel module in the N-terminal catalytic domain directly contacts with 8-oxoG in DNA as well as with the C-terminal domain, thus, allowing MutY to encircle the DNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c36">36</xref>). mMUTYH may also encircle its substrate DNA duplex, and thus can prevent OGG1 or APEX1 from inappropriately processing its substrate and product. If MUTYH could not prevent OGG1 from acting on its products, excision of 8-oxoG opposite the AP site by OGG1 would result in the loss of informative bases on the both strands, and in a double-strand break due to the AP lyase activity of OGG1. Thus, OGG1 is a more hazardous counterpart than APEX1 if MUTYH fails to protect its products (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f10">10</xref>).</p><p>The generated AP site opposite 8-oxoG by MUTYH has to be processed through the BER pathway in which an incision by AP endonuclease is an essential step (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f10">10</xref>). In cell-free extract prepared from mouse thymocytes, the mMUTYH reaction product is fairly stable for &#x0003e;3 h. This fact suggests that a positive mechanism which appears to somehow be inactivated in the cell-free extract, is required to accelerate the progression of BER reaction. It has been reported that BER reaction can be completed in HeLa cell nuclear extract for plasmid DNA containing an A:8-oxoG pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c18">18</xref>), however the efficiency of BER was very low. We examined the effects of ATP or other ribonucleoside triphosphates as well as deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, and found essentially no effect on the protection or repair process (our unpublished observation).</p><p>It was pointed out previously that MUTYH recognizes the adenine misincorporated into the nascent strand opposite 8-oxoG in the template strand during progress of DNA replication, and thus post-replicative BER has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c40">40</xref>). Indeed, MUTYH can interact with PCNA, RPA and MSH6, which are known to be involved in post-replicative mismatch repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c17">17</xref>). It is expected that the MUTYH&#x02013;product complex should be precisely processed to result in the insertion of cytosine opposite 8-oxoG, which is supposedly processed to a cytosine:guanine pair by a canonical BER pathway initiated by OGG1. For the completion of proper BER reaction form the MUTYH&#x02013;product complex, some so far unidentified factors, which can support the coordinated actions of AP endonuclease and DNA polymerase or DNA ligase, may also be involved (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh642f10">10</xref>). The MUTYH&#x02013;product complex generated <italic>in vitro</italic> can be an appropriate starting material to isolate the molecules interacting with or to reconstitute the cell-free repair reaction, and such approaches are now under way.</p><p>In patients carrying homozygous G382D mutation in the <italic>MUTYH</italic> gene, which corresponds to the G365D mutation in mMUTYH, multiple colorectal adenoma and adenocarcinoma are often developed with a somatic G to T transversion mutation in <italic>APC</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c41">41</xref>), thus indicating that G382D substitution gives rise to an impaired function of MUTYH. We previously reported that MUTYH-null ES cells exhibited a mutator phenotype and that exogenous expression of wild-type mMUTYH but not mMUTYH(G365D) complemented the mutator phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c15">15</xref>). We also showed that there is no detectable adenine DNA glycosylase activity in the cell-free extract prepared from MUTYH-null cells expressing mMUTYH(G365D), which appears to be modified in the cell-free extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh642c13">13</xref>). In the present study, we showed that the recombinant preparation of mMUTYH(G365D) possesses the adenine DNA glycosylase activity as well as wild-type mMUTYH, therefore we currently could not conclude that mMUTYH(G365D) is totally inactive as DNA glycosylase <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, even if the mutant protein is active <italic>in vivo</italic> as DNA glycosylase, the biochemical defects of mMUTYH(G365D) found in the present study may in part explain the mutator phenotype. mMUTYH(G365D) has a much lower affinity to its own substrate, DNA containing A:8-oxoG pair, and to which OGG1 can also act to excise 8-oxoG. If OGG1 can excise 8-oxoG opposite adenine more efficiently than mMUTYH(G365D) excises adenine opposite 8-oxoG, an uncorrected adenine base were remain to cause G to T transversion mutation.</p><p>Further characterizations of the mutant mMUTYH or proteins interacting with the mMUTYH&#x02013;product complex will hopefully shed some light on the complicated BER pathway as well as on the molecular mechanism for carcinogenesis in the colon.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh642f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Inefficient incision at an AP site created after excision of adenine opposite 8-oxoguanine by MUTYH in a cell-free extract.
