In part, this reflects diabetic dyslipidemia characterized by increased VLDL and reduced HDL levels secondary to peripheral insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>). Vascular insulin resistance may also play a role in the acceleration of atherosclerosis in diabetes. Decreased insulin signaling and Akt activity in vascular endothelium impair vascular nitric oxide responses and are associated with increased expression of inflammatory genes, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and accelerated atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). Moreover, diabetic individuals are susceptible to complications of atherosclerotic plaque formation, reflecting plaque instability. Apoptosis of macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells in advanced atherosclerotic lesions is thought to lead to plaque rupture and atherothrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). Atherosclerotic lesions from patients with type 2 diabetes showed increased areas of necrotic core and increased numbers of apoptotic macrophages even after normalization for total lesion area, suggesting that macrophage apoptosis and resulting necrotic core formation may specifically contribute to plaque instability in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>).</p><p>A variety of different processes contribute to macrophage apoptosis in advanced lesions, including growth factor withdrawal, hypoxia, and oxidative and other cellular stresses. Several of these factors mediate apoptosis by activating the cellular endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Increased expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP, also known as Ddit3/Gadd153) is a hallmark of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and CHOP is expressed in a subset of macrophages in advanced atherosclerotic lesions in both humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). The endoplasmic reticulum stressors in atherosclerotic plaques include free cholesterol (FC), 7-oxysterols, oxidized phospholipids, and homocysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an adaptive response to endoplasmic reticulum stress that involves decreased translation of most proteins but increased expression of a subset of molecules involved in protein refolding or other endoplasmic reticulum functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). The UPR involves a balance or pro- and antiapoptotic factors and only leads to apoptosis when endoplasmic reticulum stress is overwhelming or accompanied by additional apoptotic stimuli. Endoplasmic reticulum loading of free cholesterol induces CHOP but is insufficient to cause apoptosis unless accompanied by an additional stimulus, such as ligation of the scavenger receptor A (SRA) by modified LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). The UPR is also associated with an increase in Akt phosphorylation and activity, which is thought to represent a compensatory prosurvival mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>).</p><p>Macrophages from <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice have decreased levels of insulin receptors and show decreased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 2 in response to insulin, indicating macrophage insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). To model the vascular effects of macrophage insulin resistance, we transplanted bone marrow from <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice into <italic>Ldlr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recipients. This was associated with a dramatic increase in necrotic core formation, reflecting increased numbers of apoptotic macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages showed increased susceptibility to apoptosis induced by loading with free cholesterol or oxidized LDL. In <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages, there was a marked blunting of Akt phosphorylation in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). Insulin signaling leads to a variety of progrowth, antiapoptotic responses, notably phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the closely related transcription factors forkhead transcription factor 01(FoxO1), -3, and -4. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the hypothesis that decreased Akt signaling and increased activity of FoxOs during the endoplasmic reticulum stress response are responsible for the increased apoptotic response of insulin-resistant macrophages.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>LDL receptor knockout, <italic>ob/ob</italic>, and control mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).

To ascertain whether this might contribute to enhanced apoptosis, we used adenovirus to overexpress a constitutively active form of Akt (Myr-Akt). FC loading using AcLDL&#x0002b; an ACAT inhibitor (58035) led to increased apoptosis in <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells compared with <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> cells, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). Myr-Akt expression resulted in a major reduction in apoptosis in response to FC loading in both sets of cells and virtually eliminated the difference between <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Given that transduction efficiency of adenovirus was &#x0223c;60&#x00025;, this indicates a substantial reversal of the effect of FC loading and insulin receptor deficiency on apoptosis. Myr-Akt expression did not affect the uptake of AcLDL or FC accumulation in macrophages (not shown). To assess whether similar responses could be observed in cells with less severe defects in insulin signaling, we also audited the antiapoptotic impact of activated Akt in insulin-resistant <italic>ob/ob</italic> macrophages. Enhanced apoptosis in response to FC loading was also seen in <italic>ob/ob</italic> macrophages, and this response was partly rescued by Myr-Akt overexpression (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). To reinforce the relevance of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling axis in this physiological process, we assessed the impact of inhibition of endogenous Akt activity in FC-loaded macrophages, using the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY-294002. This treatment resulted in a pronounced increase in apoptosis in FC-loaded wild-type macrophages (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). These data suggest that induction of Akt activity during FC-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress provides an antiapoptotic function that is otherwise impaired in insulin-resistant macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>FoxO1 and FoxO3 promote macrophage apoptosis during the UPR.</title><p>Insulin signaling via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase leads to Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO1 and FoxO3 on serine residues, causing nuclear exclusion and loss of transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>). Additionally, FC loading of macrophages leads to activation of Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK), and in other settings, JNK can phosphorylate related FoxOs (FoxO4) on different amino acids, resulting in nuclear localization and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>). We observed increased nuclear FoxO1 as a result of FC loading or insulin receptor deficiency and an additive effect of FC loading and insulin receptor deficiency in <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref> shows FoxO1-GFP; <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref> shows endogenous nuclear FoxO1). <italic>ob/ob</italic> macrophages also showed increased nuclear FoxO1 compared with wild-type macrophages, and again, FC loading further increased levels of nuclear FoxO1 (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). Thus, both decreased insulin signaling and FC-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress are associated with increased nuclear FoxO1.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of constitutively nuclear forms of FoxOs on apoptosis, we transduced macrophages with FoxO1 or FoxO3 in which Akt target serine residues had been mutated to alanine or aspartic acid (FoxO1-ADA and FoxO3-AAA). Whereas in control macrophages, there was only a slight increase in apoptosis, the constitutively active FoxOs resulted in a robust increase in apoptosis in the context of FC loading (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref> and <italic>B</italic>). These findings suggest that FoxO1 and FoxO3 have a major role in promoting apoptosis in cells undergoing the UPR in response to FC loading but not in unstressed cells. To determine whether this was a general feature of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, we subjected macrophages to a different form of endoplasmic reticulum stress by treating them with thapsigargin, an agent that inhibits the endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pump sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). First, we showed that thapsigargin caused an increased amount of apoptosis in <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> relative to <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, consistent with our previous demonstration that <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells are more susceptible to apoptosis induced by a variety of endoplasmic reticulum stress responses (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>). Second, we showed a dramatic increase in apoptosis in cells treated with both FoxO1-ADA and thapsigargin but not in cells treated with either alone (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>).</p><p>To evaluate further the role of FoxOs in apoptotic responses, we assessed the impact of FoxO1 or FoxO3 knockdown via shRNA or siRNA (small interfering RNA) approaches, respectively. The knockdown was &#x0223c;50&#x00025; effective on an mRNA level for each transcription factor (supplementary Fig. S1<italic>A</italic>, which is available in an online appendix at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db08-0520">http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db08-0520</ext-link>). There was a significant reduction of apoptosis with knockdown of either transcription factor in FC-loaded <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. The combined knockdown of FoxO1 and FoxO3 caused a further reduction in apoptosis to a similar final level in <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (supplementary Fig. S1<italic>B</italic>). Comparable results were obtained in <italic>ob/ob</italic> macrophages (supplementary Fig. S1<italic>C</italic>). These findings indicate that FoxO1 and FoxO3 are involved in the apoptosis brought about by FC loading and mediate the enhanced apoptotic response observed in <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and <italic>ob/ob</italic> macrophages.</p><p>Macrophages express all three of the related FoxO isoforms, FoxO1, -3, and -4. To confirm the role of endogenous FoxOs in enhancing an apoptotic response during endoplasmic reticulum stress, we evaluated the response of primary peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow&#x02013;derived macrophages with combined knockouts of FoxO1/3/4, obtained by injecting polyinosine-polycytidylic acid into the <italic>Mx-Cre</italic> transgenic mice containing floxed transgenes for each of the three FoxOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). Efficient knockout of all three FoxOs in bone marrow and peritoneal macrophages was confirmed by PCR (supplementary Fig. S2). This genetic system showed a markedly decreased apoptotic response of the triple-knockout macrophages in response to FC loading in both types of macrophages (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref> and <italic>B</italic>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanisms of FoxO-induced apoptosis during endoplasmic reticulum stress.</title><p>We next considered three potential mechanisms to explain the effect of active FoxOs: <italic>1</italic>) induction of UPR genes, <italic>2</italic>) enhancement of the effects of SRA ligation in the context of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>), and <italic>3</italic>) modification of the apoptotic response to the UPR. Previous studies have shown that FoxO1 induces CHOP expression during differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>), suggesting that FoxO1-ADA could be enhancing apoptosis by increasing the UPR. However, CHOP mRNA and protein were not further induced by FoxO1-ADA or FoxO3-AAA in control, FC-loaded, or thapsigargin-treated macrophages (supplementary Fig. S3<italic>A</italic>&#x02013;<italic>C</italic>; data not shown). A combination of UPR induction and ligation of the SRA (e.g., by the SRA ligand fucoidan) is required to see an apoptotic response in FC-loaded macrophages, and this response is much more prominent in <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> than in <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). If FoxO1-ADA were activating the UPR in cells undergoing FC loading by incubation with Ac-LDL &#x0002b; 58035, it would be anticipated that fucoidan would increase apoptosis in cells expressing FoxO1-ADA. However, the combination of FoxO1-ADA and fucoidan did not increase apoptosis (supplementary Fig. S3<italic>D</italic>).

The increase in I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b; was seen in non&#x02013;FC-loaded macrophages but not after 10 h of FC loading, similar to the loss of the differential response of <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages after 10 h of FC loading (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6<italic>C</italic></xref> and <xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">5<italic>C</italic></xref>).

These experiments suggest that increased I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b; levels reflect increased activity of FoxOs and lead to decreased nuclear p65 in <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages.</p><p>To see whether the <italic>I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b;</italic> gene might be a direct target of FoxOs, we overexpressed FoxO1-ADA and FoxO3-AAA in cells transfected with an <italic>I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b;</italic> promoter-luciferase reporter gene. A construct containing 295 bp of upstream sequence showed transactivation by FoxOs, whereas a construct containing only 159 bp of upstream sequence did not (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref> and <italic>B</italic>). ChIP analysis revealed occupancy of the &#x02212;159 to &#x02212;295 bp region of the <italic>I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b;</italic> promoter by FoxO1 (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>top panel</italic>). We identified three putative FoxO binding core sequences &#x0005b;AAA(C/T)A&#x0005d; in this region, one of which at &#x02212;260 is conserved among rodents, humans, and nonhuman primates. However, using a DBD FoxO1 mutant, we still obtained transactivation of the <italic>I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b;</italic> promoter, consistent with the conclusion that FoxO1 activated <italic>I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b;</italic> transcription without direct DNA binding (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>D</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>). Moreover, the ChIP analysis showed binding of FoxO1 to the <italic>I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b;</italic> promoter containing mutations in all three potential FoxO binding sites (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>bottom panel</italic>). Thus, FoxO1 transactivates the proximal <italic>I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b;</italic> promoter likely by interacting with other molecules that directly bind the DNA in the &#x02212;159 to &#x02212;295 region. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that a subset of FoxO1/3 target genes is induced without direct binding of FoxOs to target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Decreased expression of inflammatory and antiapoptotic genes in FC-loaded <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages.</title><p>Previous reports have suggested either increased apoptosis or decreased inflammatory gene expression in <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>). The finding of reduced NF-&#x003ba;B activity in these cells suggested a common mechanism to explain both increased apoptosis and reduced inflammatory responses. Consistent with this idea, we found decreased expression of several antiapoptotic genes (known targets of NF-&#x003ba;B) and some but not all proinflammatory genes in <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells treated with FC loading (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a blunted Akt response in insulin-resistant macrophages promotes apoptosis during the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and show that a major underlying mechanism involves increased activity of FoxO transcription factors. FoxO1 binds the promoter and induces expression of I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b;, blunting the p65/NF-&#x003ba;B response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, with proapoptotic and anti-inflammatory consequences. These studies are likely relevant to the mechanisms of increased macrophage apoptosis, necrotic core formation, and plaque destabilization in type 2 diabetic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>) and suggest that insulin-sensitizing agents, such as peroxisome proliferator&#x02013;activated receptor-&#x003b3; agonists that reduce macrophage insulin resistance in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>), could have beneficial effects in diabetic at herosclerosis by promoting plaque stabilization.</p><p>The closely related FoxO transcription factors FoxO1, -3, and -4 have a variety of different roles in modulating cell cycle control, apoptosis, and antioxidant responses with substantial redundancy and variable effects dependent on cell type and context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>). A recent study has revealed fundamental and overlapping roles of FoxO1, -3, and -4 in cell cycle control, induction of antioxidant molecules, and protection from apoptosis in hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>). In contrast, in the present study, macrophages with knockout of all three FoxOs showed increased survival during endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by FC loading or growth factor withdrawal. Overexpression of FoxOs in various immortalized cell lines has been shown to induce apoptosis, and FoxO1 and/or FoxO3 have been found to directly target a variety of proapoptotic factors, such as Bim, Fas-ligand, and TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor&#x02013;related apoptosis-inducing ligand). However, increased expression of these molecules did not appear to be involved in the increased apoptosis shown by primary cultures of <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages (C.P.L., unpublished data). CHOP induction of Bim increases apoptosis in response to the UPR in a variety of cell types, including peritoneal macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>). Measurements of <italic>Bim</italic> mRNA and protein showed increased expression in response to FC loading, but this response was not increased further in <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages (supplementary Fig. S6). Importantly, although FoxO1/3 overexpression or knockdown had little effect on macrophage apoptosis in the basal condition, there were major effects during the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, defining a physiological role of these transcription factors in modulating macrophage apoptosis as part of the UPR. Thus, our findings suggest that the outcome of FoxO-dependent transcription is critically dependent on the local context and that the definition of FoxO proteins as pro- or antiapoptotic is an oversimplification.</p><p>At least a part of the role of FoxOs in promoting apoptosis during endoplasmic reticulum stress involved an attenuation of the increased NF-&#x003ba;B response that is characteristic of the UPR and has an antiapoptotic function in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>). The mechanism of increased NF-&#x003ba;B activity during the UPR is not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). However, the blunting of this response in <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells appears to involve a specific increase in levels of I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b; that likely retains p65 in the cytoplasm. Our studies establish the underlying molecular mechanism to be transactivation of the proximal <italic>I&#x003ba;B&#x0025b;</italic> promoter via an indirect binding of FoxO1/3. However, this is not necessarily the only mechanism by which FoxOs influence apoptosis during the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, and this area warrants additional investigation.</p><p>Our findings are likely relevant to the increased complications of atherosclerosis suffered by diabetic individuals. Increased numbers of apoptotic macrophages associated with large necrotic cores and thin caps are characteristic of unstable plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>), and unstable plaques show evidence of increased endoplasmic reticulum stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). A number of different potential endoplasmic reticulum stressors, including an increased content of free cholesterol, are likely relevant in advanced plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>). Although most of our studies were performed using the FC loading method to induce apoptosis, the increase in apoptosis of insulin-resistant macrophages during the endoplasmic reticulum stress response appears to be generic, whether induced by FC loading, oxidized LDL, thapsigargin, or growth factor withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>), and thus is likely relevant to increased atherosclerotic complications in diabetic individuals. Interestingly, administration of an ACAT (acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase) inhibitor (pactimibe) to humans led to a worsening of coronary atherosclerosis, especially in diabetic patients and subjects with BMI &#x0003e;30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>), suggesting direct relevance of mechanisms defined here to diabetic atherosclerosis.</p><p>Diminished levels of nuclear p65 and NF-&#x003ba;B activity observed in <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells during the endoplasmic reticulum stress response were associated with both increased apoptosis and decreased expression of some inflammatory genes, reflecting the well-known role of NF-&#x003ba;B in inducing these genes. This could perhaps explain previous findings of both increased apoptosis and decreased inflammation in different studies involving insulin receptor&#x02013;deficient bone marrow cells in murine atherosclerosis models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>). However, in the complex milieu of advanced atherosclerotic plaques, it is likely that increased apoptosis of macrophages is associated with a clearance defect of apoptotic cells, leading to postapoptotic necrosis and inflammatory changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>). Also, it is notable that in the basal state, <italic>Insr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages showed increased expression of a number of different inflammatory genes (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Overall, our studies suggest that insulin-resistant macrophages are more likely to undergo apoptosis and to promote plaque inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db08-0520_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="db08-0520_db08-0520[1].suppl.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>T.S. is the recipient of a research fellowship from the Manpei Suzuki Diabetes Foundation of Tokyo.
