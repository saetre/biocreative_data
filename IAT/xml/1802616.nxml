To avoid primate experimentation, we generated transgenic mice to study neuronal expression and protein binding partners for BC200 and G22 npcRNAs. The BC200 gene, with sufficient upstream flanking sequences, is expressed in transgenic mouse brain areas comparable to those in human brain, and G22 gene, with upstream flanks, has a similar expression pattern. However, when all upstream regions of the G22 gene were removed, expression was completely abolished, despite the presence of intact internal RNA polymerase III promoter elements. Transgenic BC200 RNA is transported into neuronal dendrites as it is in human brain. G22 RNA, almost twice as large as BC200 RNA, has a similar subcellular localization. Both transgenically expressed npcRNAs formed RNP complexes with poly(A) binding protein and the heterodimer SRP9/14, as does BC200 RNA in human. These observations strongly support the possibility that the independently exapted npcRNAs have similar functions, perhaps in translational regulation of dendritic protein biosynthesis in neurons of the respective primates.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Even after discovering that RNA itself has catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) the doctrine remained: the few surviving functional RNAs, including ribosomal RNAs, tRNAs and others are fossilized remnants of the long gone RNA/RNP worlds. Recent developments forced us to rethink. Experimental and computational RNomics uncovered a plethora of non-protein coding RNAs (npcRNAs) [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>)]. The discovery of non-protein coding RNAs that arose relatively recently in diverse metazoan lineages, such as BC1 RNA in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), sphinx RNA in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), the bsr transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) that harbors RBII-36 snoRNA in the <italic>Rattus</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), BC200 RNA in anthropoid primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), and G22 RNA in the <italic>Lorisoidea</italic> branch of prosimians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) indicates that functional non-protein coding RNAs are not merely fossils from the RNA and RNP worlds. Retroposition is much more pervasive in the evolution of genes (protein coding and other) and genomes. Continued recruitment (or exaptation) of novel RNA molecules including snoRNAs and miRNAs into cellular processes underscores the significance of studying biogenesis of npcRNAs and their cellular functions, such studies will aid in establishing molecular causes of physiological differences of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). The timing of biogenesis of BC1 and BC200 npcRNAs is well documented. BC1 RNA arose by retroposition of a tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> after the mammalian radiation in rodents. BC1 RNA is prevalently expressed in neurons and transported to dendritic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Targeted deletion of its gene reduces exploratory behavior and increases anxiety of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). BC200 RNA (200 nt in length) arose independently by retroposition of a monomeric Alu element into a locus that permitted expression in primate neurons. It has been shown to be dendritic in human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Interestingly, both RNAs despite their different evolutionary origins might have analogous functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). BC1 and BC200 RNAs inhibit translation <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as in transfected cells. At lower concentrations, however, Alu RNAs appear to stimulate translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Consequently, the BC RNAs have been suggested to regulate translation in dendritic microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Such a role is supported by identification of protein partners that play roles in translation including SRP9/14 for BC200 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) and PABP for both BC1 and BC200 RNAs as well as for transcribed SINEs with poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). When the BC RNAs are preincubated with PABP prior to the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation assay, the inhibitory effect is less pronounced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Hence other possible functions for BC1 and BC200 RNAs have to be entertained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we demonstrated that the ancestrally unoccupied G22/BC200 RNA locus was independently targeted by two different but related SINE elements, once in strepsirrhines and once in anthropoid primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Thus, G22 RNA, derived from a dimeric Alu element, inserted into the same locus as BC200 RNA at a different time in a different primate lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown for Lorisiformes and Anthropoidea that both insertions are transcriptionally active and mainly brain-specific. Based on HeLa cell transfection experiments, it was proposed that the BC200/G22 locus harbors promoter elements required for maintaining the tissue-specific transcription of both genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). As studying functional aspects of these molecules in primates is hampered by a number of ethical or conservational restrictions, we generated transgenic mice that simulate expression of BC200 and G22 npcRNAs in the original primate species. Here we report studies on their transcriptional regulation, cellular and subcellular location as well as their interaction with protein partners.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>BC200 and Gmo22 transgenic mice</title><p>The 3.2 kb EcoRI&#x02013;HindIII DNA fragment for BC200 (&#x02212;2271) transgenic mice was released from the &#x003bb; bacteriophage BC200-9a, with the respective restriction enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

In two of the BC200 constructs, the 3&#x02032; flanks were also shortened. For example in BC200 (&#x02212;250), 139 nt instead of 772 nt 3&#x02032; flanks [as in BC200 (&#x02212;2271)] were retained. Finally, in BC200 (&#x02212;515), the 3&#x02032; flank was completely removed except for 19 nt that follow the 200 nt corresponding to the BC200 RNA coding region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This should address the possibility whether elements that influence transcription are also located downstream of BC200 RNA gene.</p><p>When total RNA from different tissues of three independent BC200 (&#x02212;2271) and BC200 (&#x02212;515) transgenic mouse lines was analyzed we observed that the brain-specific expression pattern of BC200 RNA (with low expression level in testis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and C) is largely reproduced and comparable to native BC200/G22 activity in Anthropoidea and Lorisiformes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). However, one of the transgenic mouse lines, BC200 (&#x02212;515), showed a low transcriptional activity of BC200 gene in the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The differences in transcription patterns of the BC200 RNA gene within BC200 (&#x02212;515) transgenic mouse lines most likely reflect the effect of the position of integration in the mouse genome with the concomitant absence of insulation caused by the shorter 5&#x02032; flanks, which would fortuitously provide additional enhancer(s) to the 5&#x02032;-flanking region, rather than being an effect of regulator element(s) deletion located in the 3&#x02032;-flanking region of the BC200 locus.</p><p>It has been shown that upstream sequence elements in the BC200/G22 locus of Lorisiformes and Anthropoidea contain conserved external promoter elements similar to RNA polymerase II and other pol III genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). For example, a conserved TATA-like motif maps to around position &#x02212;20 and &#x02212;30; a second conserved sequence block, positioned &#x0223c;70 bp from the insertion point (coinciding with the +1 position of the transcript) is similar to the proximal sequence element (PSE-motif). Finally, a distal sequence element (DSE-like motif) is located &#x0223c;220 bp upstream from the +1 transcriptional start of both npcRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Additional elements are expected to be responsible for tissue-specific expression. We decided to test whether shortened flanks are still sufficient to maintain tissue-specific transcription of BC200 and G22 transgenes in mice. Two similar constructs were generated, BC200 (&#x02212;250) and Gmo22 (&#x02212;383). The construct BC200 (&#x02212;250) has 250 bp of the upstream sequence from human and Gmo22 (&#x02212;383) has 383 bp from the <italic>Galago moholi</italic> locus, presumably involved in regulation of transcription of BC200 RNA and G22 RNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). From these constructs we generated three independent lines for BC200 (&#x02212;250) and Gmo22 (&#x02212;383) transgenic mice. Northern blot analysis using total RNA extracted from different tissues showed that both RNAs were predominantly expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Once more, we observed low levels of transcription of the BC200 and G22 transgenes in heart and additionally in kidney. Thus, we confirmed that the predicted regulatory elements located in the 5&#x02032;-flanking region in the BC200 locus are sufficient to maintain transcriptional activity of the retroposed elements with high-expression in the brain, although repression in other tissues was somewhat diminished.</p><p>Next, we generated three independent transgenic mouse lines with construct Gmo22 (+1), in which the complete 5&#x02032; flanking G22 RNA sequence was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In order to analyze these transgenic mice, total RNA from different tissues was extracted and northern blot hybridization was performed with a G22 RNA-specific probe. We failed to detect even a weak signal on our blots indicating that the G22 dimeric Alu element is transcriptionally inactive in the transgenic mice. Based on these results, we confirmed our prediction that regulatory elements upstream of BC200 and G22 RNA sequences in the BC200/G22 locus are important for their transcription. Importantly, our data support the notion that in intact organisms external promoter elements are required for transcriptional activity of SINE retronuons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>BC200 RNA and G22 RNA are localized to dendrites</title><p>Anthropoidea BC200 RNA is selectively expressed in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). The distribution of human BC200 RNA shows a clear dendritic localization in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Using BC200 (&#x02212;2271) transgenic mice, we examined whether the BC200 RNA specifically expressed in the mouse brain had a similar subcellular localization pattern as native BC200 RNA in human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization on coronal sections through the hippocampus of BC200 (&#x02212;2271) transgenic mice using an AS probe designed against the unique region of BC200 RNA clearly showed that BC200 RNA is expressed in the CA1, CA2 and CA3 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), where RNA is found in the somatic cytoplasm and in both apical and basal dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Dendritic localization is fairly uniform, except in <italic>stratum lucidum</italic> of area CA3, the terminal fields of the dentate mossy fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), as is the case for phylogenetically unrelated rodent BC1 RNA. There is little or no expression in the granular cells of the dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the cortex, BC200 RNA is expressed in all layers (I&#x02013;VI), but most prominently in the large pyramidal cells of layer V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As in the hippocampus, labeling in the cortex was evident in both somatic cytoplasm and dendrites. In amygdala, where the basal lateral area is more intensely labeled than the central area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), higher magnification reveals clear dendritic staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>As G22 RNA also is predominantly and specifically expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we examined whether G22 RNA exhibits a dendritic localization pattern in the corresponding transgenic mice similar to BC200 RNA. Indeed, G22 RNA was somatodendritically localized (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>). While in the hippocampus of BC200 (&#x02212;2271) transgenic mice there is intense dendritic staining in stratum radiatum of the CA1 and CA2 regions, in Gmo22 (&#x02212;383) transgenes, not all cells are stained in the CA1 and CA2 region, however, the dendrites in the stratum radiatum of CA1 and CA2 region show substantial labeling, albeit, weaker in comparison to BC200 RNA. This might simply be due to differences in expression levels of G22 RNA and BC200 RNA in the investigated transgenic mice. Unlike BC200 transgenes, where there are variable levels of BC200 RNA in the cells of the different cortical layers, in Gmo22 transgenes, the RNA shows a uniform distribution in all layers. Presumably, due to the weaker expression levels of G22 RNA there is no clear dendritic signal observed in the cortical neurons. Apart from exhibiting common dendritic localization patterns, BC200 RNA and G22 RNA have different expression patterns in other areas of the brain. For example, while BC200 RNA is expressed at very low levels, if at all, in the dentate gyrus, G22 RNA is expressed at high levels in dentate gyrus, evident by the intense staining in the somata as well as the corresponding dendritic field of dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>, higher magnification not shown). Control S probe in each case did not show any specific labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A&#x02013;D</xref>). Furthermore, sections of wild-type mouse brains were used as an additional control in hybridizations with both AS and S probes for both BC200 and G22 RNA. As expected, there is no specific labeling with either S or AS probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In order to compare the signal in dendrites, the non-dendritic tubulin mRNA was included as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We observed an intense signal in the cell bodies but clearly no signal in dendritic fields.</p></sec><sec><title>Prenatal expression of BC200 RNA in transgenic mice</title><p>As there are indications that BC1 RNA is expressed prenatally in the developing nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), and switched on when nerve cells start to communicate with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), we examined expression of BC200 RNA in embryos of transgenic mice. On embryonic day 15, labeling was weak and possibly, like BC1 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), also detectable in non-neuronal cells. A later embryonic stage (E18) showed prominent expression in the brain, spinal cord and in a different plane in the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The transgenic BC200 RNP has similar mobility as native BC200 RNP</title><p>In order to determine whether BC200 RNA in transgenic mice forms an RNP similar to the native BC200 RNP, we performed native gel electrophoresis with crude cytoplasmic extracts (S2) prepared from human brain and transgenic mouse brain as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>); <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA was also loaded as a control. The RNPs and the RNA were transferred onto nylon membrane and hybridized with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled oligonucleotide BC207, complementary to the unique region of BC200 RNA. RNP from BC200 transgenic mice, BC200 (&#x02212;2271), and the native BC200 RNP from human brain migrate with similar mobilities, indicating that they have comparable sizes and in all likelihood similar protein components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In either case, free RNA could not be detected in the crude extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Next, we checked whether the protein partners of BC200 RNP in the transgenic mice are identical to those of the native BC200 RNP in order to validate the mouse model for further functional studies.</p></sec><sec><title>BC200 RNA and G22 RNA bind common protein partners, SRP9/14 and PABP</title><p>Recently, it was shown that PABP and SRP9/14 proteins were part of the BC200 RNP complex in the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Moreover, it has been reported that Alu RNAs have a potential to interact with the heterodimer SRP9/14 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). In order to investigate whether the BC200 RNA and G22 RNA had corresponding protein partners in the respective transgenic mice, immunoprecipitations were carried out against PABP and heterodimer SRP9/14 proteins using anti-PABP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and anti-SRP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) antibodies, respectively. Crude S2 brain extracts were prepared from BC200 (&#x02212;2271) and Gmo22 (&#x02212;383) transgenic mice as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Both npcRNAs were efficiently immunoprecipitated with the antibodies mentioned above but not with pre-immune sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). This confirms that the BC200 RNP complex formed in BC200 (&#x02212;2271) transgenic mice brain is similar to that of native BC200 RNP in the human brain containing at least PABP and the protein heterodimer SRP9/14, and that the mouse model can be used for further studies. Moreover, the G22 RNP formed in Gmo22 (&#x02212;383) transgenic mice has at least three common protein partners with human BC200 RNA, indicating that the two RNPs are similar and therefore could be involved in related functions in the brain.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> binding studies of BC200 RNA and G22 RNA with PABP</title><p>To further study similarities or differences of the primate BC200 RNA and G22 RNA with respect to their interaction with PABP, we investigated in detail the binding properties of both npcRNAs.</p><p>First, we tested the ability of PABP to interact selectively and specifically with BC200 RNA. We examined whether selective binding between recombinant PABP and <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed BC200 RNA could be detected by gel retardation assays in the presence of vast excess of non-specific yeast tRNA (molar ratio 1:2000). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), we were able to detect two distinct complexes in our assay that might correlate with two potential PABP binding sites in the 41 nt long A-rich region of BC200 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The BC200 RNA&#x02013;PABP complex was formed with an apparent K50 value of 16 nM. We also performed competition assays with unlabeled BC200 RNA as a competitor (see Materials and Methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The intensity of the upper shifted band was completely abolished with a 16-fold excess of unlabeled BC200 RNA, and with 80-fold excess, both bands were mostly competed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>We next tested whether <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed G22 RNA would interact with human recombinant PABP in the presence of a vast excess of non-specific yeast tRNA (see above). When increasing amounts of PABP were added to G22 RNA, we detected two distinct mobilities of the RNP complex as we did with the BC200/PABP RNP. The G22&#x02013;PABP RNP complex was formed with an apparent K50 value of 12 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In experiments where <sup>32</sup>P-labeled G22 RNA was competed from the G22/PABP RNP with unlabeled G22 RNA, we observed similar results as with the BC200 RNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and D). Thus, we demonstrated specificity of the G22 RNA&#x02013;PABP interaction. To gain further insight into the interaction between the investigated RNAs and PABP, we performed competition experiments, whereby <sup>32</sup>P-labeled G22 RNA and BC200 RNA were competed from their RNPs with unlabeled BC200 RNA and G22 RNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>).</p><p>Unlike BC200 RNA, which has a 41 nt long A-rich region in its central part, G22 RNA contains two A-rich regions of 15 nt each, in the center and near the 3&#x02032; end. When <sup>32</sup>P-labeled G22 RNA was competed with unlabeled BC200 RNA for binding with PABP, we observed reduced intensity of the upper shifted band with 5- to 80-fold excess of competitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). At similar conditions <sup>32</sup>P-labeled BC200 RNA was competed with unlabeled G22 RNA. The reduction in the intensities of the shifted bands was observed with 3- to 160-fold excess of unlabeled G22 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>The slight differences observed in competition might be due to co-operative binding of two PABP molecules to the longer A-rich region of BC200 RNA in comparison to individual binding of monomers to the two separated binding sites in G22 RNA. Our results clearly demonstrate that both BC200 and G22 npcRNAs form specific RNP complexes with PABP. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the G22 RNP in Lorisiformes brain might be involved in functions similar to its analog, the anthropoid BC200 RNP, e.g. possibly in the regulation of dendritic translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Usually, novel genes arise by duplication of existing ones. There are two major modes of duplication: (i) a segment containing an entire gene (usually several, and up to hundreds or thousands of kilobases, occasionally even entire chromosomes or genomes) duplicate or (ii) an RNA transcript of a gene is converted into cDNA by the action of the enzyme reverse transcriptase and inserted at random positions of the genome. The latter requires fortuitous juxtaposition to promoter elements and, as a result, leads with lower frequency to functional gene products that can be exapted into variant and, over time, novel functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). The unsuccessful events are prevalent in genomes of multicellular species and are known as retropseudogenes, SINEs and the like. Multiple retroposon targeting of the same locus is rare as there are potentially more than a hundred thousand potential integration sites. If it occurs, the precise integration at a given location is less surprising due to the consensus sequence 5&#x02032;-TT/AAAA-3&#x02032; of preferred integration sites. In the case presented here, it is quite unusual that both transcripts have been conserved in their respective lineages for at least 35 million years. This is a strong indication for recruitment (exaptation) into a function resulting in purifying selection. Nevertheless, the respective genes are relatively young and establishing their functions is not trivial, especially when they occur in species that are not amenable to experimentation due to conservational or ethical reasons. One way to circumvent these limitations is the generation of transgenic animals that express the genes to be studied. Their expression patterns may provide the first leads concerning their function. Furthermore, in case of RNA molecules, delineation of their complexed protein partners provides clues to their functions.</p><p>We generated at least three founder lines for each construct in order to exclude atypical expression patterns due to contributions of the genomic integration loci. While tissue-specific expression patterns were identical in founder lines that were generated from the same transgene, we could observe differences in their distribution regarding cell-types, (such as cortical neurons; data not shown). This could be ascribed to slight differences in expression of the respective constructs when integrated in different chromosomal loci. This is more pronounced when less flanking regions are present. These shorter flanks (mainly 5&#x02032;) might have lost regulatory sequences or simply provide less buffering against influences from the loci of integration. For example, BC200 RNA with 2271 nt of 5&#x02032; flanking sequences revealed signals on northern blot only in brain and at a reduced level in the testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Even in the presence of only 515 nt upstream, expression was mostly restricted to these organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left panel). In contrast, when only 250 nt were upstream of BC200 RNA or 383 nt upstream of G22 RNA, we observed, in addition to expression in the brain, noticeable signals in heart and kidney, but not in liver and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left panel). Expression levels of the &#x02212;515 BC200 RNA construct indicate that, if any, at most 19 nt at the 3&#x02032; flank are necessary for tissue-specific expression. Apart from the internal box-A and box-B RNA polymerase III promoter elements, which are probably necessary for basal transcription levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), the regulatory elements for efficient, cell-type-specific and developmentally regulated expression of BC200 and G22 RNAs must reside within 515 nt upstream from the transcriptional start and, if at all, 19 nt downstream of the transcriptional termination.</p><p>Our results indicate that the region upstream of the BC200 RNA gene (&#x02212;515&#x02013;&#x02212;250) might be involved in repressing expression in tissues other than brain and testes. More likely, flanking regions simply protect from position effects.</p><p>In line with earlier cell transfection experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), wherein removal of the entire 5&#x02032; flanking sequences resulted in a sequence with intact internal box-A and box-B RNA polymerase III promoter elements and 147 nt 3&#x02032; flanking sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), expression of the dimeric Alu element-derived G22 RNA was completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right panel). This is convincing proof that these elements are not sufficient for transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>, at least under normal conditions.</p><p>Moreover, our data indicate that the Alu-derived retroposons harboring intact internal promoter elements are &#x02018;dead on arrival&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>), unless they are fortuitously furnished by the locus with its own regulatory elements, an event exceedingly rare.</p><p>Expression of BC200 RNA in transgenic mice revealed cell-type-specific expression that generally is analogous to the pattern observed in human brain sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and to the rodent analogue BC1 RNA. Similarly, the transgenic BC200 RNA is upregulated during embryonic development of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Early embryonic expression appears to be reduced but more promiscuous with respect to tissue or cell-types. Importantly, as in primates, BC200 RNA was transported to dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Congruence of BC200 RNA and G22 RNA transgene expression is not too surprising due to the high-level of sequence similarity. A surprising divergence between all BC200 RNA and G22 RNA transgenes is the extreme difference (absence and high-level expression) of the respective RNAs in dentate gyrus.</p><p>Several hundred mRNAs are estimated to be dendritic. Consistently, non-protein coding RNAs that play a role in synthesis or regulatory aspects of translation can be found in dendrites. Examples for the former are rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) and tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>), for the latter moderate levels of SRP RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), high-levels of BC1 and BC200 RNA and most recently even a micro RNA [miR-134; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>)]. Because of the great similarity of G22 RNA, especially to BC200 RNA (basically, G22 is a dimer of BC200 RNA), it is not surprising that G22 RNA is transported into dendrites. More work in transgenic models is needed to delineate the structures and/or motifs that are responsible for dendritic localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>).</p><p>Both BC RNAs and miR-134 are possibly involved in the regulation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Deletion of BC1 RNA leads to a behavioral phenotype (see above) and miR-134 is thought to control translation of the synaptic Limk1 protein, thereby regulating the size of dendritic spines. It would not be surprising if G22 RNA had a function in a prosimian branch that closely corresponds to that of BC200 RNA in anthropoid primates. Observations reported here support the assumption that G22 RNA shares PABP as a major protein partner with BC1 RNA and BC200 RNA and the SRP protein dimer SRP9/14 with BC200 RNA. The observation that the K50 values of interaction of PABP with BC200 and G22 RNAs are slightly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), might be due to the distribution of the A-rich sequences on both RNAs. A rather long stretch (41 nt) is located in the center of BC200 RNA, while G22 RNA features two shorter A-rich regions (15 nt each) between the monomers and 3&#x02032; to the right monomer.</p><p>Of the dendritic small npcRNAs, the best-studied is BC1 RNA in rodents. Although it is not ancestrally related to the primate dendritic npcRNAs characterized in this paper, it might be a functional analogue due to a similar tripartite domain structure (a 5&#x02032; domain with similarity to a SINE, a central A-rich domain, and a 3&#x02032; unique non-repetitive domain) and, as mentioned above, shared protein binding partners. It will be interesting to test whether mice transgenic for BC200 RNA or G22 RNA, when crossed into BC1 RNA-deleted mice, will exhibit compensation of the reduced exploratory behavior and increased anxiety of KO mice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Alexander Ludwig and Vladimir Kuryshev for helpful discussions.
