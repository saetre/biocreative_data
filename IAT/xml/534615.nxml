Immunocytochemical experiments confirm that the enzyme indeed localizes to mitochondrial compartment. Inhibition of expression of the enzyme by RNA interference results in significant shortening of the poly(A) tails of the mitochondrial ND3, COX III and ATP 6&#x0002f;8 transcripts, suggesting that the investigated protein represents a bona fide mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase. This is in agreement with our sequencing data which show that poly(A) tails of several mitochondrial messengers are composed almost exclusively of adenosine residues. Moreover, the data presented here indicate that all analyzed mitochondrial transcripts with profoundly shortened poly(A) tails are relatively stable, which in turn argues against the direct role of long poly(A) extensions in the stabilization of human mitochondrial messengers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Polyadenylation of messenger RNAs plays important, yet diverse, role in RNA turnover in different biological systems. For nuclear-encoded mRNAs of eukaryotes, the presence of the poly(A) tail stabilizes the transcript, and promotes its nuclear export and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c2">2</xref>). In contrast to this, polyadenylation in bacteria and chloroplasts facilitates the decay of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c6">6</xref>). Neither occurrence nor the physiological roles of polyadenylation have been conserved between mitochondria of different organisms. In mitochondria of the protist <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, most mRNAs contain either short (&#x0223c;20 nt) or long (120&#x02013;200 nt) poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c7">7</xref>). The function of the long tails is not clear yet, while the presence of the short poly(A) tails seems to promote RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c8">8</xref>). In plant mitochondria, although polyadenylation is not constitutive with respect to mature messengers, it initiates exonucleolytic degradation of the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c12">12</xref>). A notable exception in the emerging view of diverse mechanisms of mitochondrial RNA turnover is yeast, where RNA is not polyadenylated at all; instead the DNA-encoded AU-rich dodecamer sequence at the 3&#x02032; ends ensures stability and translatability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c13">13</xref>).</p><p>In human mitochondria, the large transcript encompassing almost the whole mt genome is processed by endonucleolytic cleavage, and subsequently the mRNAs are polyadenylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c17">17</xref>). The addition of poly(A) tails to mammalian mitochondrial mRNAs generates proper stop codons, that are absent in some messengers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c15">15</xref>). However, no detailed studies on the influence of polyadenylation on mitochondrial transcript stability were published to date.</p><p>Polyadenylation in different biological systems can be performed by two classes of enzymes. One of them is poly(A) polymerase, which is able to synthesize homopolymeric poly(A) tails, like in the case of eukaryotic nucleus, cytoplasm and in prokaryotes in the exponential phase of growth, as well as in green algae chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c27">27</xref>). Another enzyme possessing polyadenylating activity is the polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c29">29</xref>). Poly(A) tails created by PNPase are heteropolymeric and besides adenosine residues contain a significant fraction of other nucleotides. This is the case of cyanobacteriae, chloroplasts of higher plants and prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c32">32</xref>). In plant mitochondria, the polyadenylating enzyme is yet to be identified, but nearly homopolymeric composition of analyzed poly(A) tails indicates that PAP, rather than PNPase, might be engaged in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c34">34</xref>). On the other hand, it was shown that maize mitochondrial mRNAs frequently terminate with CCA extensions, which could indicate the possible role of terminal nucleotidyltransferase in the posttranscriptional modification of 3&#x02032; ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c35">35</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotic cells, several poly(A) polymerases (PAPs) have been described up to date, and it appears that they are the result of gene duplication during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c36">36</xref>). In human cells, three genes have been identified whose products display poly(A) polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c37">37</xref>). Two of them, PAPOLA and PAPOLG, are ubiquitously expressed. Protein product encoded by PAPOLA gene (PAPalpha) is localized only in the nuclear compartment, while PAPgamma, arising from PAPOLG expression displays dual nucleo-cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c38">38</xref>). The third gene, PAPOLB, encodes PAPbeta protein, whose expression is tissue specific, and it functions exclusively in testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c40">40</xref>). In addition, the poly(A) polymerase active in the process of tumorigenesis has been recently discovered, displaying 71% homology with respect to PAPalpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c41">41</xref>). Furthermore, human cells contain an enzyme adenylating SRP, U2 snRNA as well as 5S rRNA particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c42">42</xref>). However, no data have hitherto emerged that would indicate a putative protein that could be responsible for the addition of poly(A) tails at the 3&#x02032; ends of human mitochondrial messengers. None of the above-mentioned proteins possesses the mitochondrial targeting sequence.</p><p>A novel family of cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerases has been recently discovered in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c44">44</xref>). Its first identified metazoan member, called GLD-2, is involved in the control of germline development and embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c45">45</xref>). It has been reported that GLD-2 alone possesses low poly(A) polymerase activity, which is considerably stimulated by another developmental regulator, GLD-3, belonging to the bicaudal-C family of RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c46">46</xref>). While canonical PAPs are monomeric, GLD-2 requires an RNA-binding partner to accomplish its function, and it is probably due to the fact that it does not contain an apparent RNA recognition motif (RRM)-like domain. It has been postulated that GLD-3 may target poly(A) polymerase activity of GLD-2 to specific mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c44">44</xref>). Five human orthologs of the GLD-2 protein named Hs1 to Hs5 were recently described by Kwak <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c47">47</xref>); only one of them (Hs1) displayed a poly(A) polymerase activity resembling that of the <italic>C.elegans</italic> enzyme while studied in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte assay system.</p><p>Mammalian mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase was characterized biochemically more than 30 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c50">50</xref>). Purified enzyme catalyzed the incorporation of ATP into poly(A) and used ATP exclusively as a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c51">51</xref>). However, no molecular analysis of the enzyme has been performed. In view of those facts the question arises which gene could code for a human mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase.</p><p>We present here the identification of a novel human mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase. Our data indicate that long poly(A) tails are not required for stability of the mitochondrial transcripts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>Human HeLa and simian COS-1 cell lines were grown as monolayer at 37&#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified atmosphere in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FCS), 4 mM glutamine with or without antibiotics (Penicillin&#x02013;Streptomycin; Sigma).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of the sequence of the 3&#x02032; ends of mitochondrial RNAs by circularization assay (CR&#x02013;RT&#x02013;PCR)</title><p>The experimental procedure described by Kuhn and Binder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c52">52</xref>) was used with minor modifications.

By that means, we managed to obtain a large number of clones corresponding to ND3 mRNA, CYTB mRNA, ATP6&#x0002f;8 mRNA and COXIII mRNA, encoding subunits of different oxidative chain complexes. In order to document the fidelity of the technique, we analyzed simultaneously cloned cDNAs corresponding to 12S rRNA, which in human mitochondria are known to contain one or two adenosine residues at their 3&#x02032; ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c58">58</xref>). The prediction of the lengths of the final inserts was carried out with the assumption that poly(A) tail size of mitochondrial mRNAs should be &#x0223c;50&#x02013;60 bp, while 12S rRNA should not contain poly(A) extension [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c58">58</xref>), unpublished data]. For all mRNAs except CYTB the observed lengths were in agreement with the presence of &#x0223c;60 bp long poly(A) tail (Supplementary Material 1; data not shown).</p><p>We analyzed in total 51 independent clones corresponding to five different mitochondrial RNAs with respect to the sequence of their 3&#x02032; extensions. The results of this analysis are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh923tb1">1</xref>. The length of poly(A) tails of all tested mitochondrial mRNAs varied from 10 to 62, with the average of 43 bp (&#x000b1;14) [excluding clones for 12S rRNA with short tails and three clones for CYTB, that lacked poly(A) tails, probably due to mRNA degradation]. As expected, the 3&#x02032; terminus of 12S rRNA contained oligo(A) tails comprising only 1&#x02013;2 adenosine residues, which is in concordance with the data from literature, and confirms the accuracy of the selected method.</p><p>Our results indicate that poly(A) extensions at the 3&#x02032; ends of human mitochondrial messengers are essentially homopolymeric. We found only 12 residues other than adenosine (G or C) among 1875 that have been sequenced. Their presence might be explained as the result of amplification error or an activity of an enzyme other than poly(A) polymerase. In plant chloroplasts, where PNPase is the only polyadenylating enzyme, the 3&#x02032;-extensions contain 30% non-A nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c55">55</xref>). In the case of <italic>E.coli</italic>, where both PAP and PNPase are active, probably resembling the situation in human mitochondria, the content of nucleotides other than adenosine may vary from 0% (exponential phase of growth) up to 17% (stationary growth) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c32">32</xref>). In our study, the inclusion of non-A residues was very low (0.6%). This almost 100% homopolymeric composition of the poly(A) tails indicated that neither PNPase nor the CCA adding enzyme, which had been localized in human mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c60">60</xref>), was likely to be responsible for the polyA tail synthesis in this organelle.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c47">47</xref>).</p><p>We found that one of these proteins, identical to Hs4 reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c47">47</xref>) (accession nos: BAB13981and Q9HA74), was strongly predicted to be imported into the mitochondrial compartment by the following programs: MitoProt II 1.0a4 (score 0.9853), TargetP V1.0 (score 0.914) and PSORT (score 0.73) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c61">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c63">63</xref>). Putative mitochondrial localization of this protein was also indicated with slightly lower probability by iPSORT, PSORTII, Predotar v1.03 and SignalP v1.1 programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c64">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c66">66</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.inra.fr/predotar/">http://www.inra.fr/predotar/</ext-link>). Moreover two of the programs, MitoProt II 1.0a4 and SignalP v1.1, detected exactly the same position of the potential cleavage site, located between amino acids 37 and 38. It is worth noting that the results presented above resembled those obtained for the two other proteins investigated in our laboratory, namely hSUV3 and hPNPase, where localization in mitochondria was verified experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c67">67</xref>). The putative human mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase thus identified will be hereby referred to as hmtPAP.</p><p>The gene coding for the putative hmtPAP is localized at chromosome 10 (band 10p12.1). We analyzed the genomic organization of this gene by comparing an available sequence of human chromosome 10 genomic contig (accession no. NT&#x0005f;008705) with the longest cDNA sequence (2571 bp) corresponding to the examined protein (accession no. AK022188). The gene spans over the region of &#x0223c;35.5 kb and consists of nine exons, divided by eight introns. All exon&#x0002f;intron junctions fulfill the criteria of GT-AG rule (Supplementary Material 2).</p><p>The gene coding for the putative hmtPAP is expressed in humans, as confirmed by the availability of numerous ESTs in databases (data not shown). Furthermore, we were able to detect an mRNA of length &#x0223c;2.6 kb by performing hybridization to Human Multiple Tissue Northern Blot, containing poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mRNA samples isolated from eight different human tissues, using PCR product corresponding to the ORF of hmtPAP as a probe and &#x003b2;-actin as a standard to normalize RNA input (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh923f1">1</xref>). The value of 2.6 kb is very close to that of the above-mentioned cDNA sequence. As can be seen in the Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh923f1">1</xref>, the hmtPAP mRNA is expressed in all analyzed tissues, nonetheless the levels of its expression vary considerably between tissues when compared with actin mRNA expression. The highest level of expression is observed in the tissues displaying high energy requirements: heart, brain as well as skeletal muscles. The pattern of hmtPAP expression in various tissues resembles that which is characteristic for another mitochondrial protein under examination in our laboratory, namely hSUV3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c68">68</xref>), as well as for the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh923f1">1</xref>). Interestingly, a fainter hybridization signal was observed, representing a larger RNA species of length &#x0223c;6.0 kb. It could rather be excluded that this band resulted from unspecific hybridization, as the pattern of its expression displays significant similarity to that of the main hmtPAP mRNA species recognized by the probe corresponding to the full-length ORF. The nature and identity of the larger RNA remain to be investigated. It is likely that it could contain a longer 3&#x02032;-untranslated region, as in the case of human PNPase mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c70">70</xref>).</p><p>Members of the novel family of cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerases display relatively low level of homology with canonical PAPs and this homology is confined to the predicted catalytic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c43">43</xref>). Kwak and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c47">47</xref>) showed that GLD-2 and its homologs possess central and catalytic domains, resembling the classical PAPs; however, in contrast to them they lack C-terminal RRM. We performed our own search for the predictable conserved domains within the putative hmtPAP using InterProScan tool available at the EBI Server. Results of this analysis revealed that the protein encompasses several conserved domains, among which the most significant with respect to the its putative function were PAP&#x0002f;25A core domain (Interpro accession no. IPR001201), PAP&#x0002f;25A-associated domain (Interpro accession no. IPR002058), as well as two IPR non-integrated domains, SSF54928 RNA-binding domain (RBD) and SSF81301 nucleotidyltransferase domain, which partially overlaps with PAP&#x0002f;25A core domain. The complete coding sequence and the derived polypeptide sequence of the putative hmtPAP, together with its modular structure, are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh923f2">2</xref>.</p><p>To verify whether our protein of interest might represent the first member of mitochondrially targeted subgroup of the novel family of poly(A) polymerases, we carried out another BLAST search using hmtPAP amino acid sequence as query. Our aim is to find its homologs among other model eukaryotic organisms that would possess <italic>in silico</italic> predictable mitochondrial transition signal at the N-terminus and comparable domain organization. We managed to detect proteins that fulfilled those two criteria in <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (mmtPAP), <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> (rmtPAP) and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (fmtPAP) [accession nos: Q9D0D3 (BAB27689), XP&#x0005f;225468 and O46102 (NP&#x0005f;569904), respectively], but we were unable to confirm the presence of such orthologs in <italic>C.elegans</italic> or <italic>A.thaliana</italic>. The results of pairwise BLAST between hmtPAP and its mouse, rat and fruitfly counterparts are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh923tb2">2</xref>, and their aligned sequences are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh923f3">3</xref>. The only significant difference of mmtPAP in comparison with the human protein is the presence of three additional amino acid residues (PSS) inserted between N and Q in positions 155&#x0002f;156 in hmtPAP. rmtPAP is almost identical to the mouse protein, but it possesses slightly extended N-terminus (18 amino acids longer), which constitutes mitochondrial targeting sequence. Fruitfly ortholog displays the highest level of divergence, especially in terms of the composition of both N- and C- terminal parts. Alignment of all four sequences allows to distinguish three regions of highest homology marked A, B and C in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh923f3">3</xref>. Region A is located in the middle of putative nucleotidyltransferase domain and encloses conserved DXD motif, characteristic for members of the class II nucleotidyltransferase family, encompassing CCA-adding enzymes and eubacterial poly(A) polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c59">59</xref>). It is also worth noting that this motif together with one of glycine residues located upstream and other aspartates positioned downstream may consitute G-D-D-D signature sequence, characteristic of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c72">72</xref>). Region B corresponds almost perfectly to the putative PAP&#x0002f;25A core domain, while region C is localized within the putative PAP&#x0002f;25A-associated domain. The putative RBD, detected with the lowest probability by InterProScan tool, is conserved only between human, mouse and rat homologs, therefore its existence appears to be the most questionable. Nevertheless, general structural similarity of all mtPAPs is relatively high.</p><p>All proteins described above have very similar physico-chemical parameters, such as length (582&#x02013;612 amino acids), molecular mass (65&#x02013;68 kDa), isoelectric point (8,64&#x02013;9,24), total number on negatively (55&#x02013;61 amino acids) as well as positively (67&#x02013;77 amino acids) charged residues, instability index, aliphatic index, etc. It is worth mentioning that the estimated molecular mass of the rmtPAP is in agreement with the biochemical data obtained in early 70's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c50">50</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning of the ORF coding for the putative hmtPAP</title><p>In order to clone the hmtPAP ORF, we took the advantage of possessing human cDNA library, which was previously successfully used in our laboratory for the isolation of full-length cDNA clone encoding human SUV3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c68">68</xref>). The library was divided into pools, which were screened for the presence of full-length hmtPAP ORF by PCR amplification, by using appropriate primers. We were able to limit the presence of the adequate clone to the single well (&#x0223c;2000 clones) out of 384 subjected to the analysis. The hmtPAP ORF has been subsequently cloned into pBluescript&#x000ae; II KS (&#x0002b;) vector, and two out of the seven positive clones have been submitted to sequencing. One of the examined clones, named KS5, harbored two point mutations in comparison with the cDNA sequence present in databases (accession nos: FLJ12126 and AK022188), which were not the result of known discrepancies between genomic and mRNA sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh923f2">2</xref>); transversion T1201G resulted in the change of serine in position 401 into alanine, and transversion A1513C caused replacing of serine in position 505 into arginine. Owing to this fact two rounds of site-directed mutagenesis were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental verification of mitochondrial localization of hmtPAP</title><p>In order to determine the subcellular localization of hmtPAP within mammalian cells, we transiently transfected both human HeLa and simian COS-1 cells with the construct encompassing the full-length hmtPAP tagged on the C-terminus with the c-myc epitope 9E10. The subcellular distribution of such overexpressed fusion protein was then assessed by comparing the position of green fluorescent signal arising from FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies used in the last step of the detection of c-myc epitope, with the red fluorescence of the mitochondrial marker MitoTracker CMX-Ros. As can be seen in the Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh923f4">4</xref>, both kinds of fluorescence showed almost perfect co-localization. It can therefore be concluded that the hmtPAP is indeed localized in mitochondrial compartment.

Therefore, we decided to employ a modified approach described by Yang and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c75">75</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c77">77</xref>), which relies on enzymatic generation of siRNAs from long dsRNAs corresponding to the mRNA target. By this means, we intended to produce a heterogeneous siRNA pool that could potentially target numerous sites per mRNA molecule, which should at least in theory increase the probability of successful inhibition of hmtPAP activity.</p><p>We generated three PCR products corresponding to the almost full-length hmtPAP ORF (PCR F), as well as its left (PCR L) and right (PCR R) part. They served as templates for the generation of relatively long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA F, dsRNA L and dsRNA R, respectively) by an RNA <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. Those dsRNA molecules were initially cleaved with RNAse III and the resulting 100&#x02013;300 nt long dsRNA species were further processed by recombinant DICER into 21&#x02013;23 bp fragments and purified. Anti-hmtPAP siRNAs were then pooled and introduced into human HeLa cells by liposome-mediated transfection and after collection of the control (C) as well as siRNA-treated (RNAi) cells, we isolated total RNA from both samples.</p><p>In order to check whether our siRNAs exert the expected effect on hmtPAP expression, the level of siRNA-mediated repression was assayed by real-time PCR. The amount of hmtPAP mRNA remaining in siRNA-inhibited cells was 11&#x02013;26% of the level observed in mock-treated cells, depending on which of the three reference genes (B2M, GAPDH or &#x003b2;-actin) was applied for standardization (data not shown).</p><p>We started the analysis of the effects of hmtPAP silencing from the shortest mitochondrial mRNA species, ND3, using high-resolution northern blot. As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh923f5">5</xref>a, the majority of the mature ND3 mRNA migrates much faster in the lane corresponding to the siRNA-treated cells (lane RNAi) when compared with control cells (lane C). The difference in size corresponds to &#x0223c;50 nt, which is in agreement with the lack of poly(A) tails in the lower fraction of ND3 mRNA. This result appears to confirm the hypothesis that hmtPAP participates in mitochondrial polyadenylation and that the ablation of its expression leads to the profound shortening of poly(A) extensions at the 3&#x02032; ends of mitochondrial messengers.</p><p>Quite unexpectedly, we found that the steady-state level of ND3 mRNA lacking the long poly(A) extension was relatively high. High-resolution northern blot was applied to visualize qualitative changes of transcript length, but it turned out not to be particularly quantitative in our hands. In order to demonstrate the quantitative change in the steady-state level of ND3 mRNA more accurately, exactly the same amounts of both analyzed samples were subjected to conventional northern blot analysis using large ribosomal cytoplasmic RNA as the loading control. By this approach, we were able to observe a significant increase in the level of ND3 following RNA interference against hmtPAP comparing to mock-treated cells. Similar result was also obtained for another mitochondrial mRNA, ATP6&#x0002f;8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh923f5">5</xref>b). Combining data gained from high-resolution and standard northern blots, it appears that the long poly(A) tails do not act directly as the determinants of mitochondrial mRNA stability.</p><p>We extended our analysis of the effects of siRNA-mediated suppression of hmtPAP expression using high-resolution northern blots for two other mitochondrial transcripts, COXIII and ATP 6&#x0002f;8. As this set of hybridizations was performed using RNA samples obtained from the experiment independent from the previous one, we repeated the analysis for ND3 mRNA as the positive control. The degree of silencing was similar in both experiments, as judged by real-time PCR results (data not shown). The respective northern blots are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh923f5">5</xref>c. Results for COXIII and ATP 6&#x0002f;8 were comparable to those observed in the case of ND3 in terms of the appearance of a substantial fraction of shortened mRNA species after siRNA treatment. In all the cases, the observed difference in length between poly(A) and lower fractions was &#x0223c;50 nt, which is in agreement with the reported sizes of poly(A) tails of human mitochondrial mRNAs. The effect of hmtPAP silencing on mitochondrial mRNAs analyzed was slightly divergent when we looked at the ratios of longer:shorter fraction using ImageQuant. They were 25%:75%, 41%:59% and 56%:44% for ND3, ATP 6&#x0002f;8 and COXIII, respectively, and 90%:10% in the control cells. Nevertheless, the general trend of quantitative changes between two fractions was similar for all three messengers. It may be also noticed that in the siRNA-treated cells, the polyadenylated fraction migrates slightly faster than in the control cells.</p><p>In order to prove unequivocally that the lower, abundant mRNA fraction after inhibition of hmtPAP indeed results from shortening of the poly(A) tails of mitochondrial mRNAs and to study the shortened tail structure, we determined the sequence of the 3&#x02032;-5&#x02032; joining sites for ND3 and ATP 6&#x0002f;8 mRNAs, employing the CR&#x02013;RT&#x02013;PCR procedure as described in Materials and Methods. The results are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh923tb3">3</xref>. We found that all sequences corresponded to mRNA species containing oligo(A) tails ranging from 1 to 17 residues in length with the average of 6 nt (&#x000b1;3). Moreover, sequencing data allowed us to indisputably exclude the possibility that shortening of ND3 and ATP6&#x0002f;8 transcripts observed in high-resolution northern blots is due to the truncations affecting coding sequence, as both ends of transcripts were intact in all cases. In conclusion, inhibition of hmtPAP activity in HeLa cells resulted in shortening of the poly(A) tails of the mitochondrial ND3 and ATP 6&#x0002f;8 mRNAs from about 43 residues on average to &#x0223c;6 nt. It is worth mentioning that in normal HeLa cells the fraction of RNA lacking the long poly(A) tails is also oligoadenylated (J. Piechota, personal communication).</p><p>The results presented above indicate that the long poly(A) tails are not indispensable for transcript stability in human mitochondria, but the oligo(A) tails may be sufficient for transcript stabilization.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this paper, we demonstrate the identification of a novel human nuclear-encoded poly(A) polymerase, and we provide the experimental data indicating that this enzyme indeed localizes in mitochondria.</p><p>In order to study the physiological function of the hmtPAP, we decided to look at the effects of its silencing in human HeLa cells. To this end, we applied RNA interference technology. The decrease of the hmtPAP mRNA level to &#x0223c;11&#x02013;26% of that in the non-treated cells resulted in a dramatic change in proportion of the steady-state levels of polyadenylated mitochondrial mRNAs to the oligoadenylated ones. Unpublished data obtained in our laboratory indicate that under physiological conditions, 90% of a given mitochondrial mRNA contain poly(A) tails of &#x0223c;50 bp, while only about 10% contain short oligo(A) tails varying in length between 2 and 13 nt, and both fractions are stable (J. Piechota, personal communication). This is in concordance with the situation observed in our mock-transfected cells. In contrast, inhibition of hmtPAP leads to a decrease in the level of polyadenylated fraction to 25&#x02013;56% depending on mRNA, while the oligoadenylated fraction is increased accordingly to 44&#x02013;75%. We interpret this result as the proof that hmtPAP is indeed responsible for the synthesis of long poly(A) tails in human mitochondria.</p><p>The role of polyadenylation in the mRNA decay pathway in human mitochondria may differ from the other known systems. In <italic>E.coli</italic> polyadenylation triggers degradation of RNA, and the same is true for plant chloroplasts and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c78">78</xref>). In all these systems, only a small fraction of mRNA is polyadenylated, in bacteria at any given time &#x0003c;2% of total RNA bear poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c79">79</xref>), while non-polyadenylated molecules are more stable and translatable. In contrast to this, in eukaryotic cells almost all translationally active mRNA molecules are polyadenylated, while deadenylation stimulates degradation [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c80">80</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c81">81</xref>)]. As in human mitochondria, the majority of transcripts is polyadenylated, and hmtPAP suppression resulted in strong accumulation of the oligo(A)-tailed fraction, it would be interesting to determine whether both mRNA fractions are equally good substrates for translation.</p><p>The physiological role of polyadenylation in human mitochondria has been studied recently by Temperley <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c82">82</xref>), who used a cell line from a patient with a micro-deletion in the ATP6&#x0002f;8 mitochondrial gene. The deletion resulted in the loss of the terminal 3&#x02032; uridine, from which polyadenylation would generate a proper UAA stop codon. In the patient cell line processing and polyadenylation still occurred, but the resulting mRNA lacked the stop codon. Translation was unaffected, but the mRNA was rapidly degraded in a deadenylation-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c83">83</xref>). The data were interpreted as consistent with the role of poly(A) tails in promoting mRNA stability, similar to the eukaryotic cytosol. However, it should be noted that the results of Temperley <italic>et al</italic>. were obtained in a system with a potentially pathogenic mitochondrial mutation, where polyadenylation was not affected. Therefore, the question that what would be the effect of disturbance in the synthesis of poly(A) tails on mitochondrial translation is still unanswered.</p><p>The abundance of the oligoadenylated mRNA species in the cells treated with siRNAs against hmtPAP is striking. Moreover, the total level of transcripts [poly(A) plus oligo(A)] is increased in samples obtained after RNA interference. This effect is more clearly visible on standard northern blots, which in our hands appear to be much more quantitative that the high-resolution northern blots, that we applied for qualitative analyses. The accumulation of the oligo(A) fraction could indicate either that short oligo(A)-tailed mRNAs are stable [in other words long poly(A) tails are not the prerequisite for the stability of mitochondrial mRNAs] or that the transcription rate is much higher in the siRNA-inhibited cells, so that it compensates for the degradation of oligoadenylated mRNAs. Although it seems unlikely to us that the observed increased steady-state level of mitochondrial mRNAs could be achieved if the oligoadenylated species were rapidly degraded, experiments are under way to address this issue and to discriminate which of the two scenarios envisaged above is true.</p><p>In principle, the oligo(A) tails may be either an intermediate in the synthesis of long poly(A) tails, or an intermediate of the deadenylation process, leading to RNA degradation. Recent unpublished results from our laboratory, obtained from experiments with inhibitors of polyadenylation, transcription and translation, indicate that human mitochondrial oligo(A) tails are intermediates in the polyadenylation pathway (J. Piechota, personal communication). This possible two-step mechanism of human mitochondrial polyadenylation appears to be similar to the respective processes in both <italic>E.coli</italic> and eukaryotic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c84">84</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c86">86</xref>).</p><p>At present, it is unclear which enzymatic activity is responsible for the synthesis of the short oligo(A) extensions in HeLa cells treated with siRNAs against hmtPAP. It seems possible that the residual activity of hmtPAP is sufficient for the synthesis of short oligo(A) extensions in siRNA-treated cells. Under these conditions, the poly(A)-containing fraction is slightly shorter (&#x0223c;10 nt) than in the control; this might also be explained as the result of the low concentration of the poly(A) polymerase, which abandons not fully extended tails. On the other hand, we cannot exclude that when hmtPAP level is low, both oligo(A) and poly(A) tails are synthesized by another, yet undiscovered, enzyme. In the <italic>E.coli</italic> strain devoid of PAP activity, the percentage of heteropolymeric tails increased up to 83%, due to the activity of PNPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c28">28</xref>). We did not observe such phenomenon in the case of human mitochondrial system following ablation of hmtPAP expression, as only one clone for ND3 represented heteropolymeric tail. Research is in progress to obtain statistically significant number of sequences of poly(A) tails after hmtPAP inhibition; our preliminary data indicate that these tails are homopolymeric. The above facts argue against the hypothesis that hPNPase is responsible for oligo(A) or poly(A) synthesis in conditions when hmtPAP activity is lowered.</p><p>It is important to note that no mRNA species completely devoid of post-transcriptionally added adenosine residues could be observed either in siRNA-inhibited cells or in the control. This could have two explanations: (i) oligoadenylation is a very rapid reaction coupled to the RNA processing and thus no such intermediates could be detected; and (ii) deadenylated mRNAs (in contrast to oligoadenylated ones) are very rapidly degraded.</p><p>Identification of hmtPAP should facilitate the development of the model of human mtRNA decay. It seems plausible that the poly(A) tails and oligo(A) tails play double roles in both stabilizing and destabilizing mRNAs, depending on which proteins are bound to mRNA and whether the transcripts are engaged in translation or not. So far we have shown the presence of three important enzymes in human mitochondria, which are known to participate in RNA turnover in other systems: RNA helicase hSUV3, which is also one of the components of yeast mitochondrial degradosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c87">87</xref>), PNPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c60">60</xref>) and poly(A) polymerase hmtPAP (this study). It seems that the interplay of these enzymes plus the involvement of yet unidentified putative exoribonuclease(s), endoribonuclease(s), poly(A) binding proteins and finally translational machinery [as suggested by Temperley <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh923c82">82</xref>)] regulate in concert mitochondrial RNA decay. Research is in progress to identify the missing gene products and to develop a model for the regulation of mitochondrial RNA stability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_32_20_6001__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_20_6001__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh923f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Analysis of hmtPAP expression in eight normal human tissues.
