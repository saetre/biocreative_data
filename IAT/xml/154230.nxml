In this study, we characterized two newly discovered orthologs of TDG, the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Thd1p and the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Thp1p proteins, with an objective to address the function of this subfamily of uracil-DNA glycosylases from an evolutionary perspective. A systematic biochemical comparison of both enzymes with human TDG revealed a number of biologically significant facts. (i) All eukaryotic TDG orthologs have broad and species-specific substrate spectra that include a variety of damaged pyrimidine and purine bases; (ii) the common most efficiently processed substrates of all are uracil and 3,<italic>N4</italic>- ethenocytosine opposite guanine and 5-fluorouracil in any double-stranded DNA context; (iii) 5-methylcytosine and thymine derivatives are processed with an appreciable efficiency only by the human and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> enzymes; (iv) none of the proteins is able to hydrolyze a non-damaged 5&#x02032;-methylcytosine opposite G; and (v) the double strand and mismatch dependency of the enzymes varies with the substrate and is not a stringent feature of this subfamily of DNA glycosylases. These findings advance our current view on the role of TDG proteins and document that they have evolved with high structural flexibility to counter a broad range of DNA base damage in accordance with the specific needs of individual species.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The human thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) was first discovered as an enzymatic activity in extracts of HeLa cells that excised thymine from G&#x000b7;T mismatched oligonucleotide DNA duplexes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c1">1</xref>). Today, we know that this DNA repair enzyme belongs to a large family of conserved and omnipresent proteins with a common &#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2;-fold structure and a general ability to excise uracil from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c2">2</xref>). All these uracil-DNA glycosylases (UDGs) have a monofunctional mode of action. They all employ a common base-flipping, DNA intercalation strategy for substrate recognition and binding, and catalyze the hydrolysis of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond of the flipped-out substrate base, thereby generating an abasic site (AP-site) in the DNA backbone (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c3">3</xref>). However, minor variations in the active site architecture and the catalytic mechanism define a number of subfamilies of UDGs with distinct properties. The eukaryotic UDGs belong to the UNG, MUG and SMUG subfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c2">2</xref>), with TDG representing the founding member of the MUG branch. Most, if not all, organisms possess at least one DNA uracil-processing activity, but none of the UDG subfamilies is represented ubiquitously. The UNG and MUG proteins show the broadest distribution and are found in species ranging from bacteria to human, whereas SMUG proteins appear to occur only in multicellular eukaryotes excluding plants and nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c2">2</xref>). Strikingly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> lacks an UNG but has a MUG and a SMUG, whereas the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has an UNG but neither a MUG nor a SMUG, and the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> has both an UNG and a MUG, but no SMUG. The enzymatic differences between the UDG protein subfamilies are best illustrated by a comparison of UNG with TDG. Unlike the very potent UNG-type UDGs that remove uracil from single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with a high catalytic rate and selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c4">4</xref>), TDG processes both uracil and thymine with an appreciable rate but only when they are in a mispairing configuration with guanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>). Since both the G&#x000b7;U and the G&#x000b7;T mismatches arise in DNA mainly as a consequence of spontaneous hydrolytic deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine, respectively, the G mismatch dependence was taken as evidence for TDG being responsible for the initiation of base excision repair (BER) at sites of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine deamination in DNA.</p><p>The first TDG homologs to be described were proteins of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> that share &#x0223c;37&#x00025; amino acid sequence identity with the human TDG and align with its catalytic core domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c7">7</xref>). The <italic>in vitro</italic> translated <italic>E.coli</italic> enzyme showed UDG activity on a G&#x000b7;U substrate but failed to process a G&#x000b7;T mismatch under physiological conditions. Like human TDG, the bacterial protein did not excise uracil from A&#x000b7;U base pairs or ssDNA efficiently and was therefore named Mug (for <underline>m</underline>ismatch-specific <underline>u</underline>racil-DNA <underline>g</underline>lycosylase). Mutational analysis of the human enzyme confirmed that its conserved central domain (residues 112&#x02013;360) is indeed sufficient for processing of a G&#x000b7;U substrate, while efficient hydrolysis of thymine from a G&#x000b7;T mismatch requires additional N&#x02010;terminal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c7">7</xref>). Further insight into the substrate spectra and requirements of the MUG subfamily of UDGs came with the observation that both the human and the <italic>E.coli</italic> enzymes were capable of excising the 3,<italic>N</italic><sup>4</sup>-ethenocytosine (&#x003b5;C) from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c8">8</xref>). In fact, Mug was reported to be the major activity in <italic>E.coli</italic> to eliminate this highly mutagenic lesion from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c9">9</xref>). Other substrates described for the human TDG were the cytotoxic anti-cancer agent 5-fluorouracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>) and 5-methylcytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c10">10</xref>).</p><p>These findings raise the question of whether MUG proteins, rather than dealing specifically with the deamination products of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine, are more generally involved in the repair of DNA base damage. The crystal structure available for <italic>E.coli</italic> Mug shows that, in principle, this is possible. Unlike the restricting active site geometry of the highly uracil-specific UNG proteins, the active site pocket of Mug would easily accommodate a wide spectrum of pyrimidine derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c12">12</xref>) and, owing to the high degree of structural conservation, this is likely to be the case also for other members of the protein subfamily. Thus, a systematic examination of the substrate spectra of MUG proteins of different species seems imperative for a comprehensive understanding of their conserved functions and, ultimately, their biological roles. This study introduces two novel members of the MUG protein family, which we identified in the partially sequenced genomes of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c1">1</xref>). We report their molecular cloning and biochemical characterization, and show a systematic comparison of the substrate spectra and requirements of the fission yeast and insect enzymes with those of the human TDG. The data establish that eukaryotic MUG proteins have divergent substrate spectra which include a wide range of damaged cytosine, 5-methylcytosine, thymine and even adenine bases. The G&#x000b7;U mismatch is the common most efficiently processed substrate, whereas 5-methylcytosine and thymine derivatives are processed at a physiologically relevant rate only by the human enzyme. Also, the characteristic double strand and mismatch dependency of the MUG proteins varies with the substrate and is not strictly conserved between species. These findings suggest that MUG proteins have evolved with a high degree of flexibility to counter particular forms of DNA base damage according to the specific needs of individual species.</p></sec><sec><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents and oligonucleotides</title><p>All standard oligonucleotides were synthesized by Microsynth (Switzerland).

The invariant asparagine within this motif (Asn140 in TDG; Asn18 in Mug) is critical for catalysis. It is proposed to mediate hydrolysis of the <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond linking the DNA base with the sugar moiety of the nucleoside by positioning and activating a water molecule for a hydrophilic attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c11">11</xref>). Asn795 and Asn158 occupy structurally equivalent positions in Thd1p and Thp1p, respectively, and are thus considered the putative active site residues of these enzymes. A second, less conserved C-terminal sequence motif (VMPSSSAR in TDG) also contributes to the active site in MUG proteins. Residues of this motif were shown to establish specific contacts with the DNA substrate during the base hydrolysis process, ensuring both stability of the DNA helical structure and substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c11">11</xref>). Closely related sequence elements are present at equivalent positions in Thd1p (VMPSSSAR) and in Thp1p (VGISSSGR). Interest ingly, the extra N- and C-terminal domains of the eukaryotic MUG proteins appear to be species specific and vary in sequence composition and size (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f1">1</xref>C). However, the overall architecture and the specific structural elements of the conserved domains imply that Thd1p and Thp1p are MUG-type UDGs.</p></sec><sec><title>Recombinant Thd1p and Thp1p possess DNA glycosylase activity</title><p>To facilitate enzymatic studies, we produced the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic> TDG homologs in <italic>E.coli</italic> and purified the recombinant proteins to near homogeneity. In the case of the large Thd1p, we engineered a vector expressing a segment of 415 amino acids (650M&#x02013;1063N) including the putative catalytic domain (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f1">1</xref>) plus an extra His<sub>6</sub> tag at the N-terminus. Thp1p was expressed as a full-length protein with an N&#x02010;terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag. Both proteins were expressed in soluble form in <italic>E.coli</italic> and, following a two-step purification scheme including Ni-NTA and FPLC-UNO S1 chromatography, we were able to recover 2&#x02013;4 mg of highly pure protein per liter of bacterial culture. Like human TDG (46 kDa), the 46 kDa Thd1p polypeptide showed a retarded mobility in SDS&#x02013;PAGE (&#x0223c;60 kDa), whereas migration of the 37 kDa Thp1p was as expected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f2">2</xref>A).</p><p>To monitor the catalytic activities of Thd1p and Thp1p, we employed a standard base release assay previously developed for human TDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>). The assay measures the excision of mispaired (e.g. G&#x000b7;U) and&#x0002f;or damaged (e.g. G&#x000b7;&#x003b5;C) DNA bases from synthetic 60mer oligonucleotide duplex substrates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f2">2</xref>B). Incubation of Thd1p and Thp1p alone with a G&#x000b7;U substrate did not yield any incised product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f2">2</xref>C). Only when the samples were incubated further with the human AP-endonuclease APE1 or heat treated in the presence of 90 mM NaOH did product bands with the expected length of 23 nt appear on the gel. The slightly higher electrophoretic mobility of the chemical cleavage products is accounted for by the negatively charged 3&#x02032; phosphate generated by the &#x003b2;,&#x003b4;- elimination reaction involved. Neither APE1 nor NaOH treatment alone generated any detectable incision products (data not shown). These data illustrate that recombinant Thd1p and Thp1p act as monofunctional DNA-glycosylases with properties similar to the human TDG.</p><p>We further investigated the effects of temperature, pH and possible cofactors on G&#x000b7;U processing by Thd1p and Thp1p. Both enzymes were most active at 37&#x000b0;C with a pH between 7 and 9. Testing the requirement for divalent metal ions and ATP revealed that neither of the combinations of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> with ATP had any effect on the nicking activities of the two enzymes. However, Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> at concentrations &#x0003e;1 mM inhibited the G&#x000b7;U processing activity of both enzymes as well as of human TDG. Therefore, we chose a metal ion- and ATP-free buffer at pH 8.0 and an incubation temperature of 37&#x000b0;C for all subsequent comparisons.</p></sec><sec><title>TDG homologs all process uracil in DNA but act differently on G&#x000b7;T mispairs</title><p>The human TDG excises thymine from G&#x000b7;T and uracil from G&#x000b7;U mismatched substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c14">14</xref>), whereas the <italic>E.coli</italic> Mug protein processes G&#x000b7;U substrate but fails to act on G&#x000b7;T mismatches with an appreciable efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c7">7</xref>). To compare the substrate preferences of the eukaryotic MUG proteins, we examined their abilities to process the &#x02018;classical&#x02019; G&#x000b7;T, G&#x000b7;U and A&#x000b7;U substrates as well as U in ssDNA. While the G&#x000b7;U mispair was efficiently converted to product G&#x000b7;AP-sites by all enzymes, the G&#x000b7;T mismatch was only a poor substrate for Thd1p and totally resisted processing by Thp1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f3">3</xref>). Even in the presence of high concentrations of Thp1p and after extended incubation, the G&#x000b7;T substrate remained fully intact (data not shown). Strikingly, unlike the human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> enzymes, Thp1p showed little preference for mismatched substrate and processed uracil opposite A or in an ssDNA context with remarkable efficiency.</p><p>All UNG-type UDGs are inhibited by the small polypeptide Ugi encoded by the bacteriophage PBS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c15">15</xref>). Although UNG and MUG proteins appear to have similar active site architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c11">11</xref>), <italic>E.coli</italic> Mug and human TDG are not inhibited by Ugi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c7">7</xref>), and this is also true for Thd1p and Thp1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f3">3</xref>). All substrates tested were processed to the same extent by both enzymes in the absence or presence of an excess of Ugi peptide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f3">3</xref>). Identical reaction conditions fully inhibited an equimolar amount of the <italic>E.coli</italic> Ung enzyme (data not shown).</p><p>The differences in substrate spectra and mismatch dependencies prompted us to investigate the base release reaction in more detail. Because TDG is fully product inhibited owing to its tight binding to the product AP-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c17">17</xref>), we used a previously standardized method to measure and compare single turnover kinetics of AP-site formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>). Time course experiments with TDG, Thd1p and Thp1p and G&#x000b7;U substrate revealed that all reactions proceeded relatively quickly in an initial phase, and then leveled off to a plateau where no more substrate was processed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f4">4</xref>). We confirmed that neither of the enzymes lost activity under assay conditions and that the product:enzyme ratios never exceeded 1:1 even when a vast excess of substrate over enzyme was provided (data not shown). Thus, the plateaus reflect product inhibition of Thd1p and Thp1p.</p><p>As expected, the kinetic time courses with the substrates G&#x000b7;T, A&#x000b7;U and U in ssDNA showed interesting qualitative differences. G&#x000b7;T was processed with an intermediate efficiency by TDG, with low efficiency by Thd1p but not detectably by Thp1p. The comparably slow initial rate of Thd1p most probably reflects a poor affinity of the protein for the G&#x000b7;T mismatch so that initial mismatch binding would be the rate-limiting step in this reaction. A poor affinity for the G&#x000b7;T mismatch was shown previously for human TDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>) and could also help to explain the lack of G&#x000b7;T processing by Thp1p and <italic>E.coli</italic> Mug. On the other hand, A&#x000b7;U and U in ssDNA (ssU) were processed with an appreciable rate by Thp1p only. The reaction with A&#x000b7;U was initially slower but plateaued at a level comparable with that obtained with G&#x000b7;U, whereas single-stranded uracil substrate was processed with an intermediate rate and to a higher product yield. Since Thp1p also failed to turn over on these substrates (data not shown), we conclude that the substrate-dependent uracil excision kinetics reflect differences in enzyme&#x02013;substrate complex formation rather than in catalysis. The kinetic properties further show that catalysis by Thp1p is less dependent on a specific interaction with the base opposite uracil, implicating a catalytic mechanism which differs from that proposed for the human and bacterial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c11">11</xref>). Taken together, G&#x000b7;U appears to be a common efficiently processed substrate for all MUG-type UDGs but neither the G&#x000b7;T processing activity nor the mismatch dependency of the proteins appear to be strictly conserved.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of DNA-binding properties of Thd1p, Thp1p and TDG</title><p>The lack of turnover in base release assays with dsDNA substrates indicated that Thd1p and Thp1p are strongly product inhibited. We therefore examined the ability of the two enzymes to bind different DNA substrates and product AP-sites in the presence or the absence of homoduplex competitor DNA. EMSAs in the presence of a 10-fold excess of competitor DNA revealed that both enzymes bound G&#x000b7;C homoduplex and G&#x000b7;T heteroduplex DNA with significantly lower affinity than the G&#x000b7;U substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f5">5</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3). This resembled the substrate-binding preferences of a catalytically inactive variant of TDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>). The apparently higher affinity of TDG for the G&#x000b7;T substrate reflects the ability of this enzyme to process the mismatch under EMSA conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>, and unpublished data), while Thd1p and Thp1p are unable to do so. Hence, the assay measures product AP-site binding for TDG but G&#x000b7;T binding for Thd1p and Thp1p. The same caveat of substrate conversion also applies when binding of Thd1p and Thp1p to the well processed G&#x000b7;U substrate is examined. The finding that both enzymes bound to G&#x000b7;U duplexes nearly as robustly as to G&#x000b7;AP-site substrates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f5">5</xref>, lanes 3 and 4) must therefore be interpreted to reflect their high compound efficiencies of uracil excision and G&#x000b7;AP-site interaction. Of all the enzymes, Thp1p was the only one to bind an A&#x000b7;U substrate with an appreciable efficiency and an A&#x000b7;AP-site duplex with a high affinity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f5">5</xref>, lanes 5 and 6). This is consistent with its ability to release uracil from A&#x000b7;U base pairs in a reaction that is product AP-site inhibited (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f4">4</xref>). In contrast, Thd1p and TDG bound efficiently to G&#x000b7;AP substrates whereas A&#x000b7;AP binding was hardly above homoduplex background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f5">5</xref>, lanes 4 and 6).</p><p>These data document that the complementary base facing the AP-site rather than the AP-site itself determines the DNA-binding affinities of MUG enzymes, and that this mode of opposite base interaction may differ slightly between Thp1p and Thd1p or TDG. For the reasons discussed above, a more precise assessment of substrate affinities is difficult with active DNA glycosylases and will require the use of either non-hydrolyzable DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c18">18</xref>), or of catalysis-deficient but substrate interaction-proficient mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of the substrate spectra of Thd1p, Thp1p and human TDG</title><p>Unlike UNG proteins, which have a restricting active site geometry designed for accommodation of and specific interaction with uracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c19">19</xref>), MUG proteins appear to form a comparably loose binding pocket, where no specific contacts with the substrate base are established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c12">12</xref>). This observation led us to investigate the substrate spectrum of the eukaryotic MUG proteins in greater detail. We thus examined the abilities of Thd1p, Thp1p and TDG to excise various DNA base lesions including oxidation, alkylation and deamination products of cytosine, 5-methylcytosine, thymine and adenine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f6">6</xref>). Because these enzymes are fully product inhibited, we based our comparisons on measurements of single turnover kinetics under conditions that were standardized for TDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>). For each substrate, we determined the parameters <italic>P</italic><sub>max</sub>, maximum of substrate processing within an unlimited period of time; and <italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub>, the time required to reach 50&#x00025; of the product plateau level (<italic>P</italic><sub>max</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>). To facilitate comparison, we calculated a relative processing efficiency (Eff<sub>Rel</sub>) for each enzyme and substrate by dividing <italic>P</italic><sub>max</sub> by <italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub>. The values obtained from at least three independent measurements are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg344tb1">1</xref>, and the relative processing efficiencies for all double-stranded substrates are plotted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f7">7</xref>. Because the substrates 5-hydroxyuracil (<sup>H</sup>U) and 5-hydroxycytosine (<sup>H</sup>C) were provided in a slightly different sequence context and required an autoradiography-based method of evaluation, these results are not directly comparable with all others and therefore are only mentioned in the text.</p><p>With the exception of <sup>H</sup>C (not shown), human TDG removed the substrate pyrimidines 5-fluorouracil (<sup>F</sup>U), 5-hydroxymethyluracil (<sup>Hm</sup>U), 5-bromouracil (<sup>Br</sup>U), &#x003b5;C and thymine paired with guanine with high relative efficiencies (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg344tb1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f7">7</xref>). <sup>H</sup>U mispaired with guanine was also excised from DNA with a catalytic efficiency in the range of that obtained for G&#x000b7;<sup>Hm</sup>U (data not shown). In addition, TDG efficiently excised &#x003b5;C opposite adenine and <sup>F</sup>U from any dsDNA or ssDNA substrate as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c8">8</xref>). Remarkably, we also found a low but significant level of hypoxanthine (Hx) processing when the base was located opposite guanine. Since Hx is the deamination product of adenine, it would arise most frequently in DNA opposite thymine, but TDG processed a Hx&#x000b7;T substrate with an insignificant efficiency only. All data together give the following order of substrate preference for TDG: high efficiency, G&#x000b7;<sup>F</sup>U &#x0003e; G&#x000b7;U &#x0003e; G&#x000b7;<sup>Hm</sup>U &#x0003e; G&#x000b7;<sup>H</sup>U &#x0003e; G&#x000b7;<sup>Br</sup>U &#x0003e; G&#x000b7;&#x003b5;C &#x0003e; G&#x000b7;T &#x0003d; A&#x000b7;<sup>F</sup>U; intermediate efficiency, A&#x000b7;&#x003b5;C &#x0003e; G&#x000b7;Hx &#x0003e; A&#x000b7;U; low efficiency, A&#x000b7;<sup>Br</sup>U &#x0003d; T&#x000b7;Hx; insignificant efficiency, G&#x000b7;&#x003b5;A &#x0003d; T&#x000b7;&#x003b5;A &#x0003d; G&#x000b7;G &#x0003e; G&#x000b7;<sup>m</sup>C &#x0003d; G&#x000b7;<sup>H</sup>C (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg344tb1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f7">7</xref>).</p><p>Thd1p showed a substrate preference very similar to that of TDG except that it was significantly less effective (5&#x02013;10-fold) on the derivatives of 5-methylcytosine (G&#x000b7;<sup>Hm</sup>U, G&#x000b7;T). Like TDG, Thd1p clearly preferred guanine as an opposite base and, with the notable exception of <sup>F</sup>U, did not process damaged bases in ssDNA efficiently (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg344tb1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg344f7">7</xref>).

In general, Thp1p hydrolyzed the target base fastest when it was opposite a guanine, but for most substrates the <italic>P</italic><sub>max</sub> values reached similar levels independent of the complementary base.

Another obvious difference was the lack of opposite base and&#x0002f;or dsDNA dependency in the action of Thp1p on virtually all substrates tested. The common, most efficiently processed substrates for all enzymes were the cytosine-derived G&#x000b7;U, G&#x000b7;<sup>H</sup>U, G&#x000b7;&#x003b5;C and A&#x000b7;&#x003b5;C mispairs as well as the non-physiological but therapeutically interesting <sup>F</sup>U. Recent reports documented the excision of 5-methylcytosine in a hemimethylated CpG sequence context by bacterially expressed human and chicken TDG. This activity was 30-fold lower than that of thymine excision from G&#x000b7;T mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c10">10</xref>). Using different hemi- and symmetrically methylated DNA substrates (<sup>m</sup>C&#x000b7;G&#x0002f;G&#x000b7;C, <sup>m</sup>C&#x000b7;G&#x0002f;G&#x000b7;<sup>m</sup>C) and applying similar assay conditions, we were unable to detect a release of <sup>m</sup>C by TDG or by either the <italic>Drospophila</italic> or the <italic>S.pombe</italic> proteins. Finally, the DNA sequence context only marginally affected the relative efficiencies of uracil excision by all three enzymes (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we introduce two novel members of the MUG family of DNA glycosylases, Thd1p of <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> and Thp1p of <italic>S.pombe</italic>. A comparative enzymatic characterization of the human, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and fission yeast proteins justifies the following general conclusions: (i) eukaryotic MUG proteins have divergent and species-specific substrate spectra that include a wide range of damaged cytosine, 5-methylcytosine, thymine and even adenine bases; (ii) the common, most efficiently processed substrate is a G&#x000b7;U mismatch, whereas 5-methylcytosine and thymine derivatives are processed with a physiologically relevant rate only by the human enzyme; and (iii) the double strand and mismatch dependency of the MUG enzymes varies with the substrate and is not strictly conserved between the species. These findings open up novel perspectives with regard to the possible biological roles of MUG proteins and provide a solid basis for functional studies in prominent genetic model organisms.</p><p>Like the bacterial and human orthologs, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and fission yeast MUG enzymes are monofunctional, they hydrolyze the <italic>N</italic>-glycosidic bond of a target base without incising the DNA strand at the resulting AP-site. The substrate spectra of Thd1p and TDG appear to be similar, with the caveat that the preferences of the full-length Thd1p may deviate slightly from those of the extended glycosylase domain studied here. Thp1p, however, shows some interesting and distinctive features. It fails to process G&#x000b7;T and G&#x000b7;<sup>Hm</sup>U but efficiently excises damaged and&#x0002f;or mispaired purine bases, and lacks dsDNA or opposite base dependency.</p><p>A lack of G&#x000b7;T and G&#x000b7;<sup>Hm</sup>U processing is understandable from the standpoint that <italic>S.pombe</italic> apparently does not methylate cytosine in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c20">20</xref>). Obviously, this obviates the need for an enzyme dealing with 5-methylcytosine damage. In organisms that have cytosine methylation, however, evolution appears to have selected for MUG proteins with an acquired function to excise the respective deamination and oxidation products. In this context, it is noteworthy that the domain architecture of the MUG proteins documents a modular evolution that most probably started from a simple DNA glycosylase fold to which activities modulating N- and C-terminal sequences were added in the process of adaptation to specialized functions. For instance, the ability to process G&#x000b7;T or G&#x000b7;<sup>Hm</sup>U efficiently appears to be related to the structure of the non-conserved N-termini of these proteins rather than to the geometry of their active sites. Deletion of the N-terminus of TDG was shown to virtually abolish G&#x000b7;T but not G&#x000b7;U processing activity, and <italic>E.coli</italic> Mug that lacks a comparable N-terminus does not process G&#x000b7;T mismatches with a physiologically significant rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c7">7</xref>). Also, the ability of MUG proteins to hydrolyze purine-derived substrate bases (e.g. Hx and &#x003b5;A) implicates that bases far bulkier than thymine can fit into their active site pockets. This suggests that the initial formation of a productive enzyme&#x02013;substrate complex and&#x0002f;or catalysis rather than a steric exclusion of thymine from the binding pocket is rate limiting for G&#x000b7;T processing by Thp1p and, by inference, by <italic>E.coli</italic> Mug and the N&#x02010;terminally truncated human TDG protein. However, the resolution of exactly how the N-terminus of TDG provides G&#x000b7;T processing ability will require more detailed structure&#x02013;function studies.</p><p>TDG and <italic>E.coli</italic> Mug show relatively low catalytic efficiency as compared with the functionally related UNG enzymes, and both need to establish a stable interaction with the DNA strand opposite the mismatched substrate base whereby specific opposite base contacts play an important role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c12">12</xref>). Interestingly, Thp1p shows little double strand or complementary base dependency; similar to UNG enzymes, but unlike TDG and Thd1p, it excised uracil from both dsDNA and ssDNA substrates with comparable efficiencies. This is consistent with the DNA-binding properties of the glycosylases; Thp1p could stably interact with a guanine and an adenine opposite an AP-site, whereas the human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> enzymes showed a strong preference for the G&#x000b7;AP substrate and A&#x000b7;AP binding was only insignificantly above homoduplex background. Thus, an increased affinity for a complementary adenine would give Thp1p the power to interact stably with and process uracil in any DNA substrate that has the potential to establish a secondary structure involving the substrate base. Obviously, precisely this must be avoided for thymine-processing MUG enzymes such as TDG to ensure the discrimination between a regular thymine opposite an adenine and a mutagenic thymine mispaired with guanine, which prevents processing of normal A&#x000b7;T base pairs.</p><p>Besides uracil and thymine, several other DNA lesions are processed by MUG proteins. To date, we can distinguish three classes of substrates: those that represent damaged cytosine bases, including U, <sup>H</sup>U or &#x003b5;C; those that arise from 5-methylcytosine, namely T and <sup>Hm</sup>U; and the purine derivatives Hx and &#x003b5;A. However, uracil in a G&#x000b7;U mismatch and &#x003b5;C in a G&#x000b7;&#x003b5;C context appear to be the only substrates processed efficiently by all MUG enzymes tested to date. We would therefore conclude that the conserved function of MUG DNA glycosylases is the repair of cytosine damage in DNA.</p><p>In the absence of genetic evidence, the biological significance of the divergent substrate spectra of the MUG proteins remains uncertain. The range of possible substrates predicts that the MUG proteins are functionally redundant with other DNA glycosylases including UDGs and enzymes that process oxidized pyrimidines (e.g. NTH1) and deamination or alkylation products of purines (e.g. MAG1). Considering only the repair of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine damage in mammalian cells, there are at least three enzymes in addition to TDG that are capable of excising the respective deamination and&#x0002f;or oxidation products: UNG is a very potent enzyme known to excise uracil from DNA with a high turnover rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c4">4</xref>); SMUG1 was first described as a single-strand-selective UDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c21">21</xref>), but was then shown to process G&#x000b7;U, A&#x000b7;U, A&#x000b7;<sup>Hm</sup>U and G&#x000b7;<sup>Hm</sup>U substrates too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c23">23</xref>); MBD4, which is related to bacterial EndoIII-type DNA glycosylases and contains a methyl-CpG-binding domain, excises thymine and uracil from G&#x000b7;T and G&#x000b7;U mismatches, respectively, but also <sup>F</sup>U and &#x003b5;C when paired with guanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c25">25</xref>). It is difficult to assess the significance of these apparent functional overlaps at this point, but it is likely that each of these enzymes evolved to fulfill specialized functions that are temporally and&#x0002f;or spatially separated from each other in the cellular context. For instance, the nuclear form of human UNG (UNG2) was shown to co-localize with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and replication protein A (RPA) in replication foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c26">26</xref>). No such localization was found for SMUG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c23">23</xref>) and TDG (our unpublished data). <italic>ung</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> knockout mice do not exhibit an increased spontaneous mutation frequency, most probably because some uracil-processing activity remains in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c27">27</xref>). In tissue extracts of <italic>ung</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mice, this activity processes G&#x000b7;U and less efficiently U opposite A or in ssDNA and can be partly attributed to the SMUG1 enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c22">22</xref>). Thus, UNG2 may have evolved as a uracil-processing enzyme with a specialized role in the elimination of dUMP misincorporated opposite adenine during DNA synthesis, whereas the mutagenic G&#x000b7;U mispairs resulting from cytosine deamination may be repaired preferentially by one of the other uracil-excising activities in the cell (SMUG1, TDG or MBD4). Considering G&#x000b7;T repair in mammalian cells, TDG may associate with and be active in transcribed regions of the genome through its interaction with transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c30">30</xref>), whereas MBD4 could be targeted to transcriptionally silent genomic regions with dense CpG methylation through its methylated DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg344c31">31</xref>). Finally, the MUG homologs in general may play an additional role in repairing other pyrimidine damage including &#x003b5;C, <sup>H</sup>U and <sup>Hm</sup>U, and possibly purine damage such as &#x003b5;A or Hx.</p><p>We conclude that MUG proteins form part of a DNA repair network consisting of base damage recognition functions with overlapping substrate specificities. Our data suggest that the catalytic properties of individual members of the MUG subfamily of UDGs have evolved in a species-specific manner. TDG, Thp1p and Thd1p are thus illustrative examples of how nature can take advantage of a simple but versatile catalytic polypeptide to develop specialized enzymes by the addition of activity-modulating extra domains. It is our hope that the study of these enzymes in organisms easily amenable to genetic manipulation will allow us to discover their true biological role.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg344f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Conservation of MUG-type UDGs.
