The most important genetic risk factor for RA is the inheritance of polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II alleles containing the 'shared epitope', which occurs in approximately 40% of the healthy Caucasian population but in approximately 70% of RA patients within that group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The critical role of MHC class II in the presentation of antigens to CD4<sup>+ </sup>T helper (Th) lymphocytes has long implicated Th cells as effector cells in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Evidence from animal models of arthritis has shown that Th cells, particularly Th17 cells, which produce the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-17, play an important role in mediating arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The role of Th17 cells in human RA is less established, but it is known that IL-17 can act directly on fibroblast-like synoviocytes, macrophages, and osteoclasts to induce proinflammatory mediators implicated in RA synovial damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus, regulation of Th17 cells has become an attractive target for treatment of RA.</p><p>One level of control of Th cells is at the induction phase, which is regulated by direct interaction of na&#x000ef;ve Th cells with professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells, activated macrophages, and activated B lymphocytes. The cytokine environment at the time of interaction between APCs and T cells drives Th cells to become Th1, Th2, regulatory T (Treg), or Th17 cells that produce the characteristic cytokines: interferon-gamma (IFN&#x003b3;), IL-4, IL-10, or IL-17, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In mice, the presence of IL-6 and low levels of transforming growth factor-beta at the time of T-cell activation drives Th17 cell differentiation, whereas the presence of other Th cell cytokines such as IL-4 and IFN&#x003b3; inhibits Th17 cell induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interactions between co-stimulatory or regulatory cell surface molecules on APCs and their counter-receptors on T cells may also play an important role in Th cell cytokine production. Manipulating the cytokine microenvironement and/or interactions between APCs and Th cells may have profound effects on Th cell activation and disease outcome.</p><p>One level of control of Th cell activity involves the induction of Th cell death (apoptosis), which can be mediated through intrinsic or extrinsic pathways. The best studied extrinsic pathway of T-cell death involves ligation of the Fas death receptor (CD95) by Fas ligand (FasL, CD95L, or CD178) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and is dependent on activation of the target cell. Deficiencies in Fas or FasL lead to severe lymphoproliferative disease in mice, manifesting in a lupus-like condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Conversely, adoptive transfer of genetically engineered APCs with forced expression of FasL was shown to prevent arthritis in an animal model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that FasL can be naturally expressed by mouse or human B cells and can lead to induction of Th cell apoptosis and control of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In particular, the small population of CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells in the spleen has been shown to be constitutively positive for FasL and were potent mediators of T-cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. FasL expression on CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells was upregulated by IL-4 and IL-10, and previous studies have shown that IL-10 can be produced by CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These results led us to hypothesize that CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells could play a role in regulating arthritis through interactions with arthritogenic T cells.</p><p>In the present study, we have used a T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic (Tg) mouse model in which immunization with type II collagen (cII) can potentially stimulate all of the Th cells within the mouse. Initial results indicated that a group of these immunized cII TCR Tg mice developed severe arthritis with a rapid onset whereas other mice developed moderate, mild, or even no arthritis over a 28-day time period. Analysis of the splenic lymphocytes in these mice revealed that severely arthritic mice had relatively fewer CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells than mildly or moderately arthritic mice. FasL expression was highest on CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells compared with other lymphocyte subsets, but the level of expression on individual cells was not correlated to disease activity. Importantly, increased T-cell apoptosis correlated with the relative number of FasL<sup>+ </sup>B cells in cocultures, and differences in IL-17 and IFN&#x003b3; production patterns were evident after neutralizing FasL. A direct killing effect of B cells on a T-cell line specific for an arthritogenic autoantigen was also demonstrated. This is the first evidence that killer B cells may play a role in regulating arthritogenic T cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice, immunizations, and arthritis measurement</title><p>Wild-type DBA/1LacJ mice and a breeding pair of TCR Tg (D1Lac.Cg-Tg(TCRa,TCRb)24Efro/J) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Breeding was performed in the facilities of the Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine of the University of Michigan Medical School, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Transgene expression was confirmed in all offspring by polymerase chain reaction analysis of tail biopsies. The TCR transgene is reported to be specific for an immunodominant peptide of cII (cII<sub>260-267</sub>) when bound to MHC class II I-A<sup>q </sup>molecules (DBA/1 background) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. C57BL/6- [Tg] DR-4- [KQ]ABB (human class II MHC DRB1*0401 [DR4] Tg) mice were purchased from Taconic (Hudson, NY, USA). Female mice were immunized at the base of the tail with 0.1 mg of freshly solubilized type II chicken collagen (Chondrex, Redmond, WA, USA) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) (Chondrex). Paw swelling was assessed every 3 or 4 days following immunization and was scored on a 4-point scale for each paw: 0 = no arthritis, 1 = swelling and redness confined to digits, 2 = minor swelling and redness spreading from the digits to the distal paw, and 3 = major swelling and redness extending proximally from the paw. Mice were sacrificed on day 28 after immunization unless otherwise noted, and spleens were removed for processing of single-cell suspensions from individual mice. For some analyses, the splenocytes were pooled from mice with similar disease severity as follows: score of 0 to 2 = mild or no arthritis, score of 3 to 6 = moderate arthritis, and score of 7 to 12 = severe arthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies and flow cytometry</title><p>Anti-mouse CD19-allophycocyanin (clone 1D3), anti-mouse CD3-biotin (145-2C11), anti-mouse CD5-biotin (53-7.3), anti-mouse FasL-phycoerythrin (anti-mouse FasL-PE) (MFL3), anti-CD4-PE (H129.19), anti-CD8-fluorescein isothiocyanate (anti-CD8-FITC) (53-6.7), anti-CD38-FITC (clone 90), streptavidin-PE cychrome 7 conjugate (streptavidin-PECy7), and Annexin-V-FITC were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA). Propidium iodide (PI) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Freshly isolated single-cell suspensions from mouse spleens were stained with purified FcBlock (2.4G2; BD Biosciences) before being labeled with anti-mouse CD19-APCs and either anti-CD5-biotin or anti-CD3-biotin for 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide. Cells were then washed in PBS and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde overnight. Fixation solution was washed away thoroughly followed by labeling of the CD5-stained group with streptavidin-PECy7, anti-FasL-PE, and anti-CD38-FITC. Gating used for CD5<sup>+ </sup>T and B cells was determined using magnetic bead-separated T and B cells and reflects the fact that CD5 expression on B cells is low in comparison with T cells. The few CD5<sup>hi</sup>CD19<sup>+ </sup>cells on the dot plots that were excluded by gating are not present in the separated populations and most likely represent doublets of T and B cells as further indicated by higher forward scatter characteristics. The CD3-biotin-stained group was labeled with streptavidin-PECy7, anti-CD4-PE, and anti-CD8-FITC.

An established immunization protocol for collagen-induced arthritis involving a single injection at the base of the tail of cII in CFA was used, and joint inflammation was noted for some mice beginning at day 16 after immunization and showed rapid progression to severe arthritis for some of the early responders (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). However, a significant portion of the mice had no visible inflammation or had only mild arthritis by day 27 after immunization. Disease scores on day 27 ranged from 0 (nonarthritic) to 12 (highest possible), with good representation of all scores in between. Disease activity was independent of which cage the mice were housed in, and splenocytes from all mice responded to recall challenge with cII peptide <italic>in vitro </italic>by producing IL-17 or IFN&#x003b3; or both, indicating that all had been successfully immunized. The broad range of disease activity suggested that there were individual differences in the immune responses to immunization that could not be explained solely by genetic or environmental factors.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Arthritis scores of type II collagen/complete Freund's adjuvant-immunized T-cell receptor transgenic mice and total splenocyte counts at day 28</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Mouse<sup>a</sup></bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Cage</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Day 16<sup>b</sup></bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Day 20</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Day 23</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Day 27</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Final score</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Category</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Total number of splenocytes</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">0,0,0,0</td><td align="center">0,0,1,2</td><td align="center">3,0,3,3</td><td align="center">3,0,3,3</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">Severe</td><td align="center">8.00 &#x000d7;

This suggested that IL-17 production was tightly regulated by B cells through an antigen-dependent mechanism.

Previous studies have shown that FasL<sup>+ </sup>'killer' B cells occur naturally in mice and humans and can regulate the immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the present study, Tg mice carrying a TCR transgene specific for a cII peptide varied widely in the severity of joint inflammation following immunization with cII. This variability suggested that analysis of individual mice could lead to clues about the mechanisms controlling arthritis severity.</p><p>Various trivial explanations of this variability were excluded. Immunization of all 19 mice shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> was performed on the same day by the same person with one antigen preparation. All mice showed evidence of successful immunization. A subsequent experiment with 18 additional mice yielded similar results (data not shown). Differences in disease severity were detected between mice in the same cage and from the same litter, suggesting that age, genetics, and environmental factors were not the major determinants of disease severity.</p><p>Differences in arthritis severity correlated with a reduction in the percentage of CD5<sup>+</sup>/CD19<sup>+ </sup>splenic B cells but not CD5<sup>-</sup>/CD19<sup>+ </sup>B cells or T cells. The trend toward fewer total lymphocytes in the spleens of severely arthritic mice indicates that the absolute number of CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells was also reduced with increasing arthritis severity. This result supports the hypothesis that CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells can regulate the severity of T cell-driven arthritis and prompted an analysis of the mechanisms by which this might occur.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that splenic CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells expressed FasL and could induce CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cell death. In the present study, CD5<sup>+</sup>/CD19<sup>+ </sup>B cells were indeed the highest expressers of FasL among splenic lymphocytes in all mice. The mean fluorescence intensity of FasL staining was not significantly different on CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells from severely arthritic mice compared with moderately, mildly, or nonarthritic mice. This result contrasts with previous studies in a highly polarized Th2 system, in which higher expression of FasL on CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells was a mechanism for decreased inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus, the present data suggest that an insufficient number of killer B cells, rather than a decrease in FasL expression or functional killer activity by CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells, could be responsible for reduced immune regulation in severely arthritic mice.</p><p>To determine whether arthritis severity could be directly linked to killer function of B cells, coculture experiments were performed in which B cells were first removed from whole splenocyte preparations and then added back with or without antigen. T cells from severely arthritic mice were resistant to apoptosis compared with T cells from mice with less severe arthritis. B cells were capable of inducing T-cell apoptosis in an antigen-dependent and disease severity-dependent manner. These data suggested that the relatively small differences in the number of FasL<sup>+ </sup>B cells in the cocultures played a significant role in directing T-cell death. An implication of these findings is that interventions that would reduce resistance of T cells to apoptosis and/or increase the number of FasL<sup>+ </sup>CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells could tip the balance toward regaining immune tolerance.</p><p>The role of CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells in RA has been debated for many years. CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells are capable of producing autoreactive antibodies, including rheumatoid factor (RF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, the relative contributions of CD5<sup>+ </sup>and CD5<sup>- </sup>B cells to RA pathogenesis remain elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Some of the initial investigations comparing CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells in the circulation of RA patients and their nonarthritic first-degree relatives did not show significant differences, whereas other studies found not only significantly elevated CD5<sup>+ </sup>B-cell levels in the blood of arthritic individuals, but also a correlation between the higher number of CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells and higher titers of IgM RF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In another study, the relative number of IgG RF<sup>+ </sup>CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells was reduced in arthritis patients whereas the number of IgG RF<sup>+ </sup>CD5<sup>- </sup>B cells was elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Yet more confusing are the findings that elevated CD5<sup>+ </sup>B-cell levels in peripheral blood are associated with both earlier onset of and remission of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Perhaps the present findings of FasL expression on CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells and the inverse correlation between total numbers of splenic CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells and arthritis severity in mice can shed new light on these apparent contradictions.</p><p>If a normal function of CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells is to express FasL and regulate immune reactions through induction of T-cell apoptosis, then the specificity of CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells for autoantigens could be a mechanism leading to peripheral tolerance of autoreactive T cells. Uptake of autoantigens by CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells and subsequent presentation to T cells by cells that coexpress FasL would lead to selective elimination of the autoreactive T cells and protection from autoimmunity. However, if an individual had a defect in the number of CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells, in the expression of FasL by CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells, or in the T-cell response to death signals, then this mechanism of peripheral tolerance could be ineffective, and interaction of CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells with T cells might lead to exacerbation of disease by increasing the T-cell response to autoantigens.</p><p>Cocultures of na&#x000ef;ve T cells with activated B cells in the presence of antigen and neutralizing antibody to FasL showed that B cells could preferentially regulate the production of IL-17 versus IFN&#x003b3; in a FasL-dependent manner. Surprisingly, significant production of IL-17 was elicited by coculture of na&#x000ef;ve T cells with anti-CD40-activated purified B cells when antigen was not present. In contrast to its role in antigen-dependent interactions, FasL did not appear to be regulating the production of IL-17 in the absence of antigen. This suggests that there may be antigen-independent interactions occurring between T- and B-cell populations that drive Th17 cell activity, a finding that may have implications concerning the role of activated B cells interacting with 'bystander' T cells.</p><p>Interestingly, blockade of IL-10 in these cocultures had no effect on the production of IL-17 or IFN&#x003b3;. Cytokine production by B cells has received increasing attention over the past several years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Among the cytokines produced by B cells, IL-6 and IL-10 are of particular interest because of their reported production by CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells and their respective pro- and anti-inflammatory effects in arthritis models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Intracellular cytokine staining of freshly isolated splenocytes from immunized cII TCR Tg mice demonstrated that IL-10<sup>+ </sup>subsets were found within both CD4<sup>+ </sup>cells and CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells (data not shown). We found a significant decrease in the percentage of IL-10<sup>+ </sup>CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells corresponding to increasing disease severity, which was not evident in the IL-10<sup>+ </sup>or FoxP3<sup>+ </sup>Treg cell subset (data not shown).</p><p>The ability of B cells to regulate immune responses through expression of FasL and induction of cell death of T cells is a fairly new concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Although antigen-dependent T-cell death has been demonstrated using purified CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells in the murine model of <italic>Schistosoma mansoni </italic>infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], the present report is the first to show that T-cell death could be stimulated using a peptide derived from an arthritis-associated autoantigenic peptide. Death induction was highly dependent on B cells, specific antigen, and MHC and was at least partially dependent on FasL. This suggests that killer B cells may be an effective mechanism to target antigen-specific T cells to undergo apoptosis.</p><p>At present, it is unclear whether CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells play a similar role in immune regulation in human patients. FasL expression has been detected on human B cells in CD5<sup>+ </sup>B-CLL lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] but has never been directly studied on nonmalignant CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells in humans. Recent studies of B-cell depletion in RA patients have shown that there are clear therapeutic benefits to eliminating B cells, presumably by eliminating pathogenic B cells that may contribute to inflammation through antigen presentation to autoreactive T cells, proinflammatory cytokine production, and/or production of autoantibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Although the present study might seem to contradict the benefit of B-cell depletion therapy, evidence in mouse models suggests that CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells may be protected from depletion mediated by anti-CD20 antibodies, and evidence from the anti-CD20 antibody trials in humans demonstrates that many of the earliest B cells that repopulate these patients express CD5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. It will be interesting to determine whether the repopulating CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells also preferentially express FasL and to study immunoregulatory effects of these cells on human T lymphocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present findings suggest a novel regulatory role for CD5<sup>+ </sup>B cells on disease severity in a murine model of arthritis. The dependency of B cell-mediated killing on antigen specificity implies that FasL<sup>+ </sup>B cells might be useful to eliminate arthritogenic T cells specifically, without harming other T cells that are necessary for defense against infections or neoplasm. If killer/regulatory B cells are shown to be important in controlling arthritic inflammation in humans, attractive new goals in the treatment of RA could include the enhancement of their killer activity or stimulation of their repopulation after B-cell depletion.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>APC: antigen-presenting cell; CFA: complete Freund's adjuvant; cII: type II collagen; DR4: human class II major histocompatibility complex DRB1*0401; FasL: Fas ligand; FITC: fluorescein isothiocyanate; HCgp39: 39-kilodalton human cartilage glycoprotein; IFN&#x003b3;: interferon-gamma; IL: interleukin; MHC: major histocompatibility complex; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PE: phycoerythrin; PECy7: phycoerythrin cychrome 7 conjugate; PI: propidium iodide; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; RF: rheumatoid factor; TCR: T-cell receptor; Tg: transgenic; Th: CD4<sup>+ </sup>T helper; Treg: regulatory T.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>SKL declares that he has no competing interests relevant to this manuscript.
