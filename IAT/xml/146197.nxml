Characterization of its expression during oogenesis and development shows significant differences from the expression of the core histone H2A. First, H2A.ZI mRNA is mainly detected only during oogenesis and after the midblastula transition, whereas H2A is constitutively expressed, at much higher levels, throughout embryonic growth. Second, in contrast with H2A, the variant H2A.ZI is polyadenylated during development. Third, expression of H2A.ZI is uncoupled from the S phase after gastrula, whereas synthesis of the core histone H2A mRNA is tightly controlled to DNA replication. Interestingly, H2A.ZI is less charged in the N-terminal tail which is crucial for chromatin-mediated repression. The characteristics of H2A.ZI suggest that its incorporation into nucleosomes would lead to a chromatin structure more competent for gene expression during development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
