Glucocorticoid-Induced Leucine Zipper (GILZ), an intracellular protein widely expressed in immune tissues, has been reported in epithelial tissues and controls some of key signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis. However, there has been no report on GILZ in EOC up to now. The objectives of the current study were to examine the expression of GILZ in EOC and its effect on tumor cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>GILZ expression was measured by immunohistochemical staining in tissue sections from 3 normal ovaries, 7 benign EOC and 50 invasive EOC. GILZ was not detected on the surface epithelium of normal ovaries and benign tumors. In contrast, it was expressed in the cytoplasm of tumor cells in 80% EOC specimens. GILZ immunostaining scores correlated positively to the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Spearman test in univariate analysis, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.00001, r = 0.56). They were also higher in tumor cells containing large amounts of phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT) (unpaired t test, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001). To assess the effect of GILZ on proliferation and AKT activation, we used the BG-1 cell line derived from ovarian tumor cells as a cellular model. GILZ expression was either enhanced by stable transfection or decreased by the use of small interfering (si) RNA targeting GILZ. We found that GILZ increased cell proliferation, phospho-AKT cellular content and AKT kinase activity. Further, GILZ upregulated cyclin D1 and phosphorylated retinoblastoma (p-Rb), downregulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, and promoted the entry into S phase of cell cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study is the first to identify GILZ as a molecule produced by ovarian cancer cells that promotes cell cycle progression and proliferation. Our findings clearly indicate that GILZ activates AKT, a crucial signaling molecule in tumorigenesis. GILZ thus appears as a potential key molecule in EOC.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) accounts for nearly 90% of ovarian malignant tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Early stage ovarian carcinoma is silent in nature and therefore these carcinoma often expand into the peritoneal cavity and metastasize to the omentum before diagnosis. Consequently, treatment is particularly challenging and this malignancy is a leading cause of death among gynecological malignancies in developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The prognosis for patients with ovarian carcinoma is determined by conventional criteria, including tumor stage, histological type, and grade. Indeed, there is also a need to identify molecular markers that drive ovarian tumor progression, one of the least determined process in cancer research, to offer novel, targeted, biological therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Glucocorticoid-Induced Leucine Zipper (GILZ) is a small leucine zipper protein of 17 kDa and a member of the TSC22D (Transforming Growth Factor1 Stimulated Clone 22 Domain) family of proteins also known as TSC22D3. GILZ was discovered as a dexamethasone-induced transcript in murine thymocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It is widely expressed in immune tissues and has also been reported in epithelial tissues often associated to a hormonal background. It is rapidly induced by glucocorticoids in T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], macrophages, dendritic cells and mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. GILZ expression in the anterior pituitary during embryonic development in the chick is consistent with regulation by corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]; in the kidney cortical collecting duct, GILZ is induced by aldosterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; and in human cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa cells, GILZ expression is controlled by estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>GILZ interferes with Raf-1, nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), AP-1 and FoxO forkhead transcription factor FoxO3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], all are key signaling molecules important for tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. There have, however, been few studies of GILZ in cancer. GILZ has been reported in multiple myeloma, in lymphoblastic leukemia and in human osteosarcoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Most relevant work has been in cell lines and very few data from human tumor specimens are available. To our knowledge, there is no report on GILZ in EOC. We therefore investigated GILZ expression and function in these malignant tumors. Our findings are supported by parallel and complementary data accumulated in tumor specimens and in the BG-1 cellular model. We report evidence that GILZ, an intracellular factor not previously described in EOC, plays a pivotal role in tumor cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec><title>results</title><sec><title>GILZ detection in human ovarian tumor samples</title><p>GILZ expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of sections isolated from three normal ovaries, seven benign EOC and 50 invasive EOC. GILZ was not detected on the surface epithelium of normal ovaries and in benign tumors. In contrast, among the invasive ovarian cancers, 40 (80%) expressed GILZ. GILZ immunoreactivity was detected in the four main histological subtypes, serous, clear cell, endometrioid and mucinous tumors. It was clearly confined to the cytoplasm of tumor cells and was weak in, or absent from the tumor stroma (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Using the same antibody, we detected GILZ protein by western blot. GILZ was revealed at 17 kDa, which is the size of the protein described by Ricardi and co-workers in 1997 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], in BG-1 cells transfected with the <italic>GILZ</italic>-encoding vector pcDNA3-GILZ (pGILZ BG-1 cells used as positive control), in epithelial cells from malignant ascites and in ovarian tumor samples for which frozen tissues were available, confirming the staining data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Interestingly, the non-epithelial cells from malignant ascites do not express GILZ. GILZ 17 kDa protein was also detected in ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV-3, OVCAR-3 and BG-1; it was less abundant in BG-1 cell line than in SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). BG-1 thus appeared as the best-fitted cellular model for processing up and down regulation of GILZ.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>GILZ detection in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)</bold>.

We asked if differences in GILZ expression levels are related to the expression of two markers, the proliferation marker Ki-67 used in routine diagnostics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and p-AKT used to characterize malignant ovarian tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Hyperactivation of AKT is frequently observed in ovarian neoplasms and is related to the control of cell proliferation in EOC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Immunoreactivity of GILZ, Ki-67 and p-AKT was measured on serial sections of EOC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). GILZ and Ki-67 immunostainings were scored on a seven-point scale based on the staining intensity and the extent of staining. GILZ and Ki-67 expression scores were significantly correlated in the entire cohort (Spearman test in univariate analysis, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.00001, r = 0.56) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). They were still correlated in serous carcinoma and non serous carcinoma as well (Spearman test in univariate analysis, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001, r = 0.61, n = 26 serous carcinoma, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.02, r = 0.49, n = 24 non serous carcinoma). The expression of p-AKT in tumor cells was mostly cytoplasmic, although some nuclear staining was also detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining patterns were considered to assess p-AKT immunoreactivity, scored as high or low. GILZ expression scores were significantly higher in p-AKT<sup>high </sup>specimens (mean &#x000b1; SE = 5.2 &#x000b1; 0.2, n = 25) than in p-AKT<sup>low </sup>specimens (mean &#x000b1; SE = 2.6 &#x000b1; 0.4, n = 25), (unpaired t test, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>GILZ expression correlates with p-AKT levels and with cell proliferation in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)</bold>.

The enhancement of AKT activation by GILZ therefore accounts for GILZ effect, at least in part, on cell proliferation. In contrast, the enhancement of cyclin D1 promoted by GILZ is disconnected of its action on AKT.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The effects of GILZ have been mostly described in immune cells, particularly T-lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] or dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The role of GILZ in cancer is still poorly understood and most relevant work has been done in cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Here, we identified GILZ as a significant factor in the control of tumor cell proliferation in EOC.</p><p>This is the first report of the constitutive expression of GILZ in ovarian tumor specimens from patients with invasive ovarian carcinoma. Epithelial cells from malignant ascites, tumor specimens, and the ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV-3, OVCAR-3 and BG-1, all contain GILZ with a molecular weight of 17 kDa which is the original variant described by Riccardi and co-workers in 1997 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Although contrasting views of the origin and histogenesis of EOC have been proposed, the epithelium that lines the ovarian surface is traditionally considered to be the most common origin of the neoplastic transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Here, we did not detect GILZ on the surface epithelium of normal ovaries or in benign tumors, whereas it was expressed in most of EOC specimens, suggesting that GILZ is a molecule associated with malignant processes in ovaries. Ovarian epithelial tumors generally display morphological heterogeneity that pathologists classify into serous, clear cell, endometrioid, and mucinous subtypes on the basis of histopathological examination. Each subtype is characterized by specific genetic risk factors, molecular features, and mRNA expression profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], suggesting that ovarian carcinoma is a heterogeneous disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Despite this heterogeneity, GILZ was detected in all the well-defined histological types and appears to be widely expressed in EOCs, and not restricted to particular histological subtypes.</p><p>GILZ was clearly confined to the cytoplasm in ovarian tumor cells. The intensity of GILZ staining and the proportion of tumor cells that were stained for GILZ differed between tumor sections. We found that this uneven production of GILZ in EOC correlated with the expression levels of Ki-67 when all the tumors were considered and also when the serous group was only considered. These findings were further supported by <italic>in vitro </italic>data demonstrating that tumor cell proliferation is regulated by GILZ expression level. Along with Ki-67, GILZ correlated with p-AKT, commonly used to characterize malignant tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These findings were supported by <italic>in vitro </italic>data demonstrating that GILZ enhances p-AKT level and AKT activity. The PI3K/AKT pathway transmits mitogenic signals and controls cell cycle progression in ovarian cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We found that p-AKT, the active form of AKT, accumulated in strongly positive GILZ tumor specimens. Further, up and down regulation of GILZ in BG-1 cells grown <italic>in vitro </italic>promoted parallel changes in the cellular abundance of p-AKT and in cell proliferation. In contrast, there was no feed back control of GILZ expression by p-AKT, unlike what has recently been reported in multiple myeloma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. AKT is frequently hyperactivated in EOC and contributes to the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, little is known about intracellular molecules that control AKT activation in tumor cells. Protein-protein interactions between GILZ and Raf and between GILZ and Ras have been reported in primary spleen T Lymphocytes and thymocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. As a consequence, GILZ inhibits downstream AKT cascades leading to antiproliferative effects in these cells. In contrast, our data are consistent with a model in which GILZ activates AKT and promotes cell proliferation. These findings probably reflect the large spectrum of GILZ actions and how they may differ substantially according to cell type and physio-pathological conditions. We also reveal the presence of GILZ-AKT complexes in BG-1 cells, suggesting that GILZ may be a novel partner of AKT. AKT-interacting proteins that bind to different functional domains have been widely reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. They cause phosphorylations and/or structural changes that activate AKT and lock it in an active conformation. Our findings suggest that GILZ may provide intrinsic signals for AKT activation in the absence of external stimulation. Further studies will be needed to determine the precise molecular mechanisms underlying GILZ/AKT interaction.</p><p>Most of the G1-S regulators which control the G1-S transition, a crucial step in cell cycle progression, play also an important role in the tumor progression. Cyclin D1 is a positive regulator of progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The transition to S phase is triggered by the activation of the cyclin D/CDK complex, which phosphorylates Rb, a well known regulator of cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. At the opposite, p21, a universal CDK inhibitor, prevents cell cycle progression by acting at checkpoint G1 that causes sustained G1 blockade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Importantly, we reveal that GILZ increases cyclin D1 expression and the amount of p-Rb, the essential substrate of cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex, whereas at the opposite it decreases p21 expression. All these effects that have never been reported before, are consistent with GILZ action on S-phase entry.</p><p>Using Triciribine, a pharmacological inhibitor of AKT activation, we reveal that BG-1 cell proliferation depends on AKT phosphorylation. In the same time we reveal that p21 which is negatively regulated by GILZ, is also reduced by AKT activation. This is consistent with a possible control of p21 expression by AKT as previously reported in various cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Thus, GILZ-mediated enhancement of AKT activity may contribute to decrease p21 and to promote cell proliferation. In contrast, AKT is not required for cyclin D1 up regulation in BG-1 cells unlike what has been reported up to now in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Possibly, GILZ may directly control the transcriptional activity of cyclin D1 as already demonstrated for other molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Few studies have identified particular molecules and their roles in the molecular mechanisms of tumor progression in EOC. Here, we report a previously unsuspected and important role for GILZ in the control of tumor cell proliferation in EOC. Our findings were supported by parallel and complementary data from tumor specimens and work with the BG-1 cellular model. They demonstrate that, in EOC, GILZ increases tumor cell proliferation, activates AKT, down-regulates p21 and promotes cyclin D1 expression; all these molecules are involved in the progression of malignant tumors and their deregulations are often associated to poor clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].
