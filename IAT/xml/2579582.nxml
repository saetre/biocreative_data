The seven insulin-like peptides (DILPs) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are expressed in a stage- and tissue-specific manner. Partial ablation of the median neurosecretory cells (mNSCs) in the brain, which produce three DILPs, extends lifespan, reduces fecundity, alters lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and increases oxidative stress resistance. To determine if reduced expression of DILPs is causal in these effects, and to investigate possible functional diversification and redundancy between DILPs, we used RNA interference to lower specifically the transcript and protein levels of <italic>dilp2</italic>, the most highly expressed of the mNSC-derived DILPs. We found that DILP2 was limiting only for the increased whole-body trehalose content associated with mNSC-ablation. We observed a compensatory increase in <italic>dilp3</italic> and <italic>5</italic> mRNA upon <italic>dilp2</italic> knock down. By manipulation of <italic>dfoxo</italic> and <italic>dInR</italic>, we showed that the increase in <italic>dilp3</italic> is regulated via autocrine insulin signaling in the mNSCs. Our study demonstrates that, despite the correlation between reduced <italic>dilp2</italic> mRNA levels and lifespan-extension often observed, DILP2 reduction is not sufficient to extend lifespan. Nor is the increased trehalose storage associated with reduced IIS sufficient to extend lifespan. To understand the normal regulation of expression of the <italic>dilp</italic>s and any functional diversification between them will require independent control of the expression of different <italic>dilp</italic>s.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The insulin/IGF-like signalling (IIS) pathway, present throughout multicellular animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Skorokhod1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, has functions including the regulation of growth, development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Butler1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Kimura1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and metabolic homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Saltiel1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as determination of adult lifespan, resistance to stress and fecundity, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Clancy1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Dorman1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutations that reduce the activity of IIS can increase lifespan in all three organisms, often in conjunction with associated alterations in growth, stress resistance, metabolic phenotypes and fecundity. Identifying the precise modulations of IIS that are required for lifespan-extension is thus important for determining which, if any, of the associated phenotypes are either causal in extension of lifespan or unavoidably associated with it.</p><p>Intracellular components of IIS are encoded by single genes in the invertebrates <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, with the exception of the triplication of the protein kinase B, <italic>Akt</italic>, SGK-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Pierce1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, resulting in a relatively simple intracellular signalling pathway. In contrast, mammals have several versions of the intracellular components of IIS. On the other hand, there are multiple genes for the insulin-like ligands in the two invertebrates, with seven detected in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Brogiolo1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and 38 in <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Pierce1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The seven <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptides (DILPs) are predicted to resemble preproinsulin at the structural level, and are therefore considered orthologous to mammalian insulin. The genes encoding the <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptides are independently transcriptionally regulated in response to nutrition, as well as in a tissue- and stage-specific manner during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Brogiolo1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Ikeya1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, in these invertebrates, the multiple functions of IIS may be mediated in part by functional diversification of the ligands.</p><p>Reducing the levels of a subset of the DILPs, by ablation of DILP2, 3 and 5-producing mNSCs in the <italic>pars intercerebralis</italic> of the brain late in the final larval instar, leads to an array of phenotypes including increased fasting glucose levels in the adult hemolymph, increased storage of lipid and carbohydrate, reduced fecundity, extension of median and maximal lifespan and increased resistance to oxidative stress and starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Broughton1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Ablation of these cells earlier in larval development resulted in developmental delay, growth retardation, and elevated carbohydrate levels in larval hemolymph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Rulifson1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings imply that reduction in the level of one or more of the three DILPs produced in these cells causes this diverse array of phenotypes, but direct proof of this, together with information on possible functional diversification and redundancy of the DILPs, requires direct manipulation of the levels of individual DILPs.</p><p>Of the DILPs produced by the mNSCs, DILP2 is currently thought to be the most important. It is the most highly expressed, the most potent growth stimulator and over-expression of it alone can rescue the diabetic phenotypes of mNSC-ablated larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Broughton1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Rulifson1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Ikeya1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, DILP2 has been suggested to play a prominent role in lifespan-extension by reduced IIS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Hwangbo1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Min1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Hwangbo et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Hwangbo1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, and more recently Min et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Min1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, reported a reduction in <italic>dilp2</italic>, but not in <italic>dilp3</italic> and <italic>5</italic> mRNA, in response to activated FOXO in head fat body, and proposed that this reduction mediated lifespan-extension. <italic>dilp2</italic> expression also responds to JNK activation in the mNSCs, and the resulting lifespan-extension was suggested to be mediated by Foxo-dependent repression of <italic>dilp2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Wang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Bauer et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Bauer1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> showed that expression of a dominant negative form of p53 in adult neurons extended lifespan and reduced <italic>dilp2</italic> transcript levels, and again suggested that the reduction of <italic>dilp2</italic> expression was responsible for the increase in lifespan. However, none of these studies experimentally manipulated <italic>dilp2</italic> expression and nor did they establish whether DILP protein levels were affected by the changes in transcript level.</p><p>To test experimentally the hypothesis that a reduction in <italic>dilp2</italic> alone produces lifespan extension, and to ascertain if other phenotypes regulated by DILP2 could be determinants of lifespan, we reduced <italic>dilp2</italic> expression using RNAi specifically against <italic>dilp2</italic> in the mNSCs, and examined the consequences for lifespan-extension and other phenotypes associated with mNSC ablation. We found that reducing <italic>dilp2</italic> alone in the adult fly to a level similar to that due to mNSC ablation and observed in the above-mentioned studies correlating <italic>dilp2</italic> levels and lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Hwangbo1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Min1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, had no effect on lifespan, fecundity, stress resistance, hemolymph carbohydrate levels or glycogen levels. A possible explanation of this finding is compensation by increased expression of one or more of the other <italic>dilps</italic>, if there can be functional redundancy between them. Indeed, increases in <italic>dilp3</italic> and <italic>5</italic> mRNA were observed following <italic>dilp2</italic> knock down, suggesting compensatory regulation of <italic>dilp3</italic> and <italic>5</italic>. In the case of <italic>dilp3</italic>, this up-regulation may be due to reduced IIS in the mNSCs upon <italic>dilp2</italic> knock down since we could show that <italic>dilp3</italic> is up-regulated upon down regulation of IIS via manipulation of the insulin receptor activity and that it requires FOXO for its basal expression. Knock down of <italic>dilp2</italic> did, however, lead to an increase in total trehalose content of the same magnitude as that resulting from mNSC ablation. <italic>dilp2</italic> expression is therefore not limiting for lifespan, and it plays an individual role only in the increase in trehalose storage among the phenotypes affected by mNSC ablation. Furthermore, our data show that increased trehalose storage alone is not sufficient to extend lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Targeted knock-down of <italic>dilp2</italic> by RNAi</title><p>To examine the role of DILP2 in lifespan extension and other phenotypes associated with mNSC ablation, we directed RNAi specifically against <italic>dilp2</italic> in the mNSCs&#x02013;the only cells expressing <italic>dilp2</italic> in the adult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Broughton1">&#x0005b;14; FlyAtlas&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Chintapalli1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

We confirmed that the knock-down was specific to <italic>dilp2</italic>, because no decrease in <italic>dilp3</italic> and <italic>5</italic> transcripts was observed in either line. On the contrary, we observed increased levels of <italic>dilp3</italic> and <italic>5</italic> transcripts, which were statistically significant in line B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003721-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>To investigate if these apparently compensatory increases in <italic>dilp</italic>3 and 5 mRNA were due to an autocrine feedback loop, we examined the levels of <italic>dilp2, 3</italic> and <italic>5</italic> in flies expressing a dominant-negative form of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin receptor (UAS-InR-DN) in the mNSCs. This dampening of the insulin signal in the mNSCs resulted in a significant increase in <italic>dilp3</italic> mRNA levels, paralleled with more variable increases in <italic>dilp2</italic> and <italic>5</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003721-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). That <italic>dilp3</italic> transcription is regulated by insulin signalling was further confirmed by the observation that FOXO is required for basal levels of <italic>dilp3</italic> expression, since <italic>dilp3</italic> transcript was significantly reduced in FOXO null flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003721-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Deletion of FOXO did not, however, affect the levels of <italic>dilp2</italic> or <italic>5</italic> mRNA. Indeed, by searching for perfect matches to the mouse Foxo1/Foxo4 consensus binding site (RWWAACA) 1 Kb upstream of the ATG we could identify eight putative FOXO binding sites in the <italic>dilp3</italic> promoter compared with two and one for the <italic>dilp2</italic> an<italic>d 5</italic> promoters, respectively. Hence, reduction in <italic>dilp2</italic> by RNAi in the mNSCs causes up-regulation of <italic>dilp3</italic> and <italic>5</italic> transcription that, in the case of <italic>dilp3</italic>, appears to occur via direct autocrine regulation through the insulin signalling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>dilp2RNAi/d2GAL flies are not longer-lived or less fecund than controls</title><p>In two independent experiments, reduced <italic>dilp2</italic> had no significant effect on lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003721-g002">Figure 2A, B</xref>) or fecundity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003721-g002">Figure 2D, E</xref>) under standard conditions.

Lifespan was measured on food with 1.5x normal yeast concentration (150 g/l), and again no effect of reduction of <italic>dilp2</italic> alone on lifespan was found, although the mNSC-ablated flies were still longer lived than their controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003721-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The magnitude of lifespan extensions due to mNSC-ablation in the three experiments is within the range of those seen previously (14 and data not shown). Hence, although DILP2 was reduced to very low levels, this reduction was not sufficient to produce the lifespan and fecundity phenotypes of the mNSC-ablated flies, suggesting that DILP2 levels are not limiting for these phenotypes. Furthermore, in contrast to mNSC ablation, the reduction in DILP2 alone had no effect on growth as indicated by adult weight (data not shown).</p><fig id="pone-0003721-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003721.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>dilp2RNAi/d2GAL mated females are not long-lived or less fecund than controls.</title><p>Survival curves, median lifespans, percentage increase compared to control, and sample sizes are as follows.

It remains quite possible that the lifespan extensions due to the FOXO, JNK or p53 manipulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Hwangbo1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Min1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> were mediated by reductions in one or more of DILPs 2, 3 and 5, because the context in which the level of <italic>dilp2</italic> was lowered was different in each case. This could, for instance, have resulted in different levels of transcript for other <italic>dilp</italic>s or different states of the intracellular IIS pathway. Our findings do show clearly, however, that neither reduction in <italic>dilp2</italic> RNA and DILP2 protein expression alone nor increased trehalose storage alone is sufficient to extend lifespan.</p><p>Of the phenotypes observed on mNSC-ablation, we found that reduction in DILP2 had an effect only on whole body trehalose levels. This result could indicate that reduction in DILP2 <italic>per se</italic> is required for increased stored tehalose upon mNSC-ablation. Alternatively, if there is functional redundancy between the 3 DILPs produced in the mNSCs, it is possible that trehalose storage is the most sensitive of the phenotypes to a reduction in the overall expression of DILPs in the mNSCs. The compensation that we observed in transcript levels of <italic>dilp</italic>s <italic>3</italic> and <italic>5</italic> upon reduction in <italic>dilp2</italic> transcript may not be sufficient to bring overall <italic>dilp</italic> transcript levels in the mNSCs back to normal, because <italic>dilp2</italic> is much more highly expressed than the other two <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Broughton1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Hwangbo1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar arguments apply to the lack of effect of reduction in DILP2 levels on the other phenotypes associated with mNSC-ablation. Because of the compensation in <italic>dilp</italic>s 3 and 5, the result could indicate that there is functional redundancy between DILPs and that there was insufficient reduction in overall DILP levels for these phenotypes to appear. Consistent with redundancy, while we have shown that DILP2 levels are not limiting for the hemolymph carbohydrate phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003721-g003">Figure 3</xref>), over-expression of <italic>dilp2</italic> alone can rescue the growth and hemolymph carbohydrate phenotypes due to early ablation of the mNSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Rulifson1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively DILP2 may not be involved in producing these phenotypes when the mNSCs are ablated, other than the increased whole body trehalose. To determine which interpretation is correct would require independent manipulation to varying degrees of the different <italic>dilp</italic>s.</p><p>The increases in <italic>dilp3</italic> and <italic>5</italic> transcripts when <italic>dilp2</italic> is knocked down suggest that there may be compensatory increases in DILP3 and 5 proteins. It is interesting in this respect that our data show that <italic>dilp3</italic> is the only <italic>dilp</italic> in the mNSCs whose expression is sensitive to reduced insulin signaling in these cells, implicating an autocrine feedback loop. The other two <italic>dilp</italic>s may be regulated in response to other signals, such as nutritional status in the case of <italic>dilp5</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Min1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, different <italic>dilp</italic>s may be produced in response to different intrinsic/extrinsic stimuli but once produced function redundantly.</p><p>A specific role for DILP2 in trehalose metabolism raises the possibility of distinct roles for DILPs 3 and 5 in one or more of the phenotypes of the ablated flies, including lifespan. Although all seven DILPs are capable of promoting growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Brogiolo1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and thus acting redundantly in this circumstance, the phenotypes resulting from a lowering of a subset of the DILPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Butler1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Brogiolo1"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Kimura1">&#x0005b;3 and 5&#x0005d;</xref> despite the persistence of the remaining ligands suggests at least some functional specificity among them. This notion is supported by the finding that the abolition of sexual dimorphism in locomotor behaviour, which is a consequence of mNSC ablation in males, unlike growth or hemolymph sugars, cannot be rescued by injection or over-expression of DILP2 alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Belgacem1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, <italic>Drosophila</italic> p70/S6 kinase in the mNSCs mediates hunger regulation of feeding behavior in larvae, and over-expression of DILPs 2 and 4, but not DILP3, suppresses this hunger-driven behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Wu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. The specificity of the DILPs may be determined by their biochemical properties, regulation of their synthesis as well as their sites of release.</p><p>The physiological role of the regulation of trehalose metabolism is not known. Increased whole-body trehalose has been correlated with resistance to anoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Chen1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. We, however, could not observe such resistance in the DILP2-knock-down lines or the mNSC-ablated flies (data not shown). The increased trehalose in the dilp2RNAi/d2GAL flies correlated with a slight increase in resistance to starvation, indicating that these trehalose stores play, if any, only a minor part in starvation tolerance. Furthermore, this observation also indicates that the starvation resistance of the mNSC-ablated flies does not stem from the increased whole-body trehalose. These data are consistent with a recent finding that <italic>Drosophila</italic> ARC protein, which is expressed in the <italic>dilp</italic>-producing mNSCs, is a regulator of behavioural responses to starvation but is not a general regulator of insulin signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Mattaliano1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutants are starvation resistant likely due to their loss of normal starvation induced hyperlocomotion. It is therefore possible that the mNSC-ablated flies are starvation resistant predominantly because of a reduction in ARC, and the slight effect on starvation resistance following DILP2 knock down in the dilp2RNAi flies may be due to an alteration of metabolic rates and the consumption and distribution of energy sources, of which increased whole body trehalose may be a sign.</p><p>Further investigation of putative specific roles of the individual DILPs, which awaits production of specific mutants or effective RNAi against <italic>dilps 3</italic> and <italic>5,</italic> may shed light on the links between the different aspects of fly physiology they control. However, our finding that DILP2 levels are not limiting for lifespan, fecundity and stress resistance clearly demonstrates that we need to change our thinking about how <italic>dilp</italic>s regulate lifespan and other traits, and we need direct experimental manipulation to address this issue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly Stocks and Maintenance</title><p>The control <italic>white</italic><sup>Dahomey</sup> background stock, UAS-<italic>reaper</italic> and <italic>dilp2</italic>-GAL are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003721-Broughton1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.
