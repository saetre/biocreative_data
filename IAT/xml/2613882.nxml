The structure of Prp40, its relationship to other proteins within the U1 snRNP, and its precise function remain little understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we have investigated the essentiality and interaction properties of the FF domains of yeast Prp40. We show that the C-terminal two FF domains of Prp40 are dispensable. Deletion of additional FF domains is lethal. The first FF domain of Prp40 binds to U1 protein Luc7 in yeast two-hybrid and GST pulldown experiments. FF domains 2 and 3 bind to Snu71, another known U1 protein. Peptide array screens identified binding sites for FF1-2 within Snu71 (NDVHY) and for FF1 within Luc7 (&#x003d5;[FHL] &#x000d7; [KR] &#x000d7; [GHL] with &#x003d5; being a hydrophobic amino acid).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Prp40, Luc7, and Snu71 appear to form a subcomplex within the yeast U1snRNP. Our data suggests that the N-terminal FF domains are critical for these interactions. Crystallization of Prp40, Luc7, and Snu71 have failed so far but co-crystallization of pairs or the whole tri-complex may facilitate crystallographic and further functional analysis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Spliceosome assembly in yeast occurs in a stepwise manner with U1, U2, U4/U6 and U5 snRNPs binding sequentially to the pre-mRNA and each other. The first defined step is the building of the commitment complex in yeast or the E complex in metazoans where the U1snRNP binds initially to the 5' splice site. The metazoan U1snRNP contains the proteins U1-A, U1-70K and U1-C. The yeast U1snRNP contains the homologs of these proteins, Mud1, Snp1 and Yhc1, as well as seven additional proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In yeast the essential U1snRNP component Prp40 plays an important role in bringing the 5' and 3' splice sites into spatial proximity so that the intron can be spliced out of the pre-mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Ito et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] found Prp40 to interact with Snu71 among their "core" yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) data. To our knowledge, no direct interaction between Prp40 and Luc7 has been reported although both proteins have been found in the same complex multiple times (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]).</p><p>Prp40 is a modular protein consisting of a pair of WW domains followed by a series of four FF domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). FF domains were first described in 1999 by Bedford &#x00026; Leder as domains of about 60 amino acids including two conserved Phenylalanines (F) after which the domain was named [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Typically FF domains occur in tandem arrays. For example, among the 78 metazoan FF domain proteins listed in the SMART database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], 13 have 2 or 3 FF domains, while all others have 4 to 6. The structure of three FF domains has been solved recently: the FF1 domain of the human protein HYPA/FBP11, the FF1 domain of the yeast protein Prp40, and the single FF domain of Urn1/Ypr152c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. FF domain proteins can be classified in two families: the p190 Rho GTPase-related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and the WW/FF family whose members contain one or more WW domains followed by several FF domains. Three proteins of the latter family are known to recognize the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II via their FF domains, namely the human transcription elongation factor CA150, the human splicing factor FBP11 and the yeast splicing factor Prp40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, FF domains of CA150 seem to use multiple independent binding sites rather than to bind cooperatively to proteins such as the transcription and splicing associated factor Tat-SF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The FF1 domain of Prp40 is known to interact with Clf1 (Crooked neck-like factor), an essential and well conserved multifunctional protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The role of the second yeast FF protein, Urn1/Ypr152c, which contains one WW domain and one FF domain, may be a splicing factor too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Prp40 FF domains 1&#x02013;3 bind to Snu71 I and FF domain 1 binds to Luc7 II</bold>.

Note that the structural model of the human U1snRNP does not include any of the proteins studied here. The dashed line extending to the FF1 domain indicates that the full length Snu71 interacts with FF2-3 whereas Snu71-I interacts only with domains FF1-3.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-9-29-1"/></fig><p>Here we investigated the role of the FF domains and their binding specificity. More specifically, our study aims to complement other data in order to define a consensus binding site for FF domains, such as those sites known for other domains such as the SH3 domain (whose consensus binding site is "proline-rich"). We addressed this problem by a combination of genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screens, in-vitro binding assays, peptide arrays, and genetic experiments.</p><p>We show that only two of the four FF domains of Prp40 are essential and explain this behaviour by their interactions with two other components of the yeast U1 snRNP. The binding site we found significantly differs from previously published binding sites of FF domains and thus implicates that FF domains are interaction modules with a wide range of specificities, in stark contrast to other domains such as SH3 or PDZ domains.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Prp40 interacts with Luc7 and Snu71 via its FF domains</title><p>To investigate the interaction properties of yeast FF domains, we first screened Prp40 and Urn1/Ypr152c as well as several isolated FF domain baits against genome wide yeast two-hybrid arrays containing almost all ORFs of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>as Gal4-activation domain fusions (preys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]). These screens resulted in only two interaction partners, Snu71 and Luc7, two other known components of the U1 snRNP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. No interaction partners could be identified for the full-length Ypr152c protein, nor for its FF domain bait.</p><p>Once Prp40 was identified as interacting bait, we cloned its FF domains and combinations thereof and tested these as baits against fragments of Snu71 and Luc7 as preys (see methods for domain definitions). These experiments showed that the FF1 domain of Prp40 binds to a C-terminal fragment of Luc7 (Luc7 II, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Similarly, a C-terminal fragment of Snu71 (Snu71 I) binds to Prp40 FF domains 1&#x02013;3. Interestingly, full length Snu71 but not Snu71-I interacts with the FF2-3 domain fragment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>We have also screened isolated domains or combinations thereof as baits against our genome-wide prey array. However, no new proteins were found this way: FF1-4 interacted with Snu71 and Luc7, while FF1-3 and FF2-3 interacted only with Snu71 but not Luc7 in these screens (data not shown).</p><p>These results encouraged us to revisit the protein topology of the U1 snRNP. We tested all U1snRNP associated proteins by systematic pairwise yeast two-hybrid tests using full-length bait and prey constructs but found only the previously detected interactions Prp40-Snu71 and Prp40-Luc7.</p><p>To verify the yeast two-hybrid experiments by an independent method we performed GST pulldowns. Different FF domains were expressed as GST fusion proteins in <italic>E. coli </italic>and purified on glutathione sepharose beads. Surprisingly, protein constructs containing the FF3 domain consistently failed to be expressed in significant amounts. We conclude that the FF3 domain renders the FF3, FF2-3, FF1-3 and FF1-4 constructs somehow insoluble or unstable. Nevertheless, Snu71 and Luc7 were translated and 35S-labeled in vitro and incubated with the remaining GST-FF fusion proteins. These experiments clearly showed that Luc7 binds specifically to the FF1 and possibly FF2 domains of Prp40 although binding to FF2 was signficantly weaker than to FF1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Unfortunately, the interaction between Prp40-FF1-3 and Snu71 could not be confirmed this way as it involved the inaccessible FF3 domain.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The FF1 domain of Prp40 binds to Luc7 in vitro</bold>.

In order to map the binding sites of the Prp40 FF domains we synthesized overlapping 15-mer peptides of Luc7 and Snu71 on nitrocellulose membranes and probed them with GST-FF domain fusions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The peptides used covered the regions of Luc7 (amino acids 93&#x02013;261) and Snu71 (amino acids 329&#x02013;536) that were shown to interact in Y2H assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These screens identified a peptide in the C-terminal half of Luc7, D<sub>214</sub>RRLADHFLGKIHLG<sub>228 </sub>(A24), that appeared to be the primary interactor of the FF1 domain (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B&#x02013;D</xref>). Although the results shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;B</xref> used a fusion of FF1-2 an explicit goal of this project was to identify targets of single FF domains. Hence the following experiments (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C&#x02013;D</xref>) were carried out with FF1 as this domain appeared to contribute most to binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The A24 peptide was characterized by systematic alanine scans (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) and substitution analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) to define critical amino acids for the interaction with the FF1 domain of Prp40. This analysis clearly showed the importance of the FLGKIH motif for binding &#x02013; only Glycine-223 and Histidine-226 seemed less important for binding. Based on our substitution analysis this interacting motif can be generalized as &#x003d5;[FHL] &#x000d7; [KR] &#x000d7; [GHL] where &#x003d5; may be any hydophobic amino acid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). Interestingly, the Luc7 binding site showed no similarity to the interaction region (peptide B1: H<sub>418</sub>LANDVHYDHHRSFK<sub>432</sub>) in Snu71 which was obtained by the same approach (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). A consistent interaction region (N<sub>421</sub>DVHY) narrowed down by four overlapping peptides was detected when Snu71 II was synthesised on a CAPE-membrane as 20-mer overlapping peptides with 3 amino acid shifts and probed with GST-FF1-2.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>FF domains of Prp40 bind to specific peptides within Snu71 and Luc7</bold>. <bold>A</bold>, Peptides of Snu71-I (aa 329&#x02013;536) and Luc7-II (aa 93&#x02013;261) were synthesised as 15 mers with 3 aa shifts on a &#x003b2;-alanine membrane.

To determine the physiological role of the four FF domains in Prp40 we deleted one or more FF domains starting from the C-terminus in vivo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In each mutant strain the deleted FF domain was replaced by a proteinA/kanMX6 cassette for selection of deletion mutants and easy protein detection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). We were unable to isolate a deletion of FF domain 4 and thus assumed it to be essential. However, the deletion of FF domains 3&#x02013;4 (FF&#x00394;3-4ProA) was viable albeit it showed a clear growth defect when compared to two control constructs (FF1-4ProA, i.e. wildtype Prp40 with Protein A fused to its C-terminus and the wildtype control strain PJ69-4&#x003b1;) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Deletions of FF domains 2&#x02013;4 and 1&#x02013;4 appear to be lethal too as we could not isolate such mutants. These results confirmed our initial two-hybrid findings which indicated that FF1 and FF2 are critical for Prp40 whereas FF3 and FF4 may only increase its activity and/or stability.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Only Prp40 FF domains 1&#x02013;2 are essential in vivo</bold>. <bold>A</bold>, A strain with Protein A fused to the full-length Prp40 (FF1-4ProA) shows no signficant difference in growth to the wild-type.

However, replacements of FF domains 4 or 3&#x02013;4 could not be found and thus may be lethal. <bold>B</bold>, The mutant lacking FF domains 3&#x02013;4 is viable but shows a growth defect compared to the wild-type controls. <bold>C</bold>, Summary of domains and functional motifs in Prp40.

To investigate this question, we tested splicing efficiency in two selected <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>intron-containing genes, DBP2 and ECM33, which are commonly used as splicing reporters. However, RT-PCR assays of the RNAs of these two genes revealed no splicing defect in the FF&#x00394;3&#x02013;4 mutant (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Although the composition of the the yeast U1 snRNP has been known for a decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] the precise interactions among its components and their atomic structure remain elusive. Equally puzzling is the fact that the human U1 snRNP is commonly assumed to consist of 10 proteins (U1-A, U1-70K and U1-C plus seven Lsm proteins (in addition to the snRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] while its yeast counterpart contains up to 18 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In both species U1-A, U1-70K and U1-C (Mud1, Snp1, Yhc1 in yeast) form a complex that is associated with the heptameric Sm protein ring complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Except for the Mud1-Snp1-Yhc1 core complex and the Lsm ring little information is available about the structure of the yeast U1 snRNP. Most complex purification studies find large complexes of 10 to 51 proteins when individual U1 components are used as baits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Here we suggest that Prp40, Luc7, and Snu71 form a subcomplex within the U1 snRNP. Surprisingly, we did not find any other interaction within the U1snRNP when we systematically tested all pairwise interactions among the known 10 subunits, suggesting that limitations of the yeast two-hybrid system or the requirement for RNA prevented detection of other interactions. Many of the U1snRNP associated proteins contain RNA binding domains and are known to bind RNA directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, we did not find another known Prp40 interactor, Clf1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], in our initial genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screen. However, subsequent verification of the pertinent array position revealed that the Clf1 ORF was missing from our prey array.</p><p>We showed that the FF1 domain of Prp40 is responsible for the binding of Luc7 whereas the region FF1-3 binds to full length Snu71 as well as the C-terminal fragment Snu71-I. The fragment containing FF2-3 binds to full-length Snu71 but not to Snu71-I. This suggests that binding may be cooperative or that regions outside Snu71-I present additional binding sites. However, the single binding site indicates that there is no other strong site besides the N<sub>421</sub>DVHY motif. In any case, our results confirm that different FF domains clearly have different binding specificities with the FF1-2 region being the business end of Prp40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The ability of FF domains to bind non-phosphorylated peptides refutes the suggestion that the FF domain is an exclusively phospho-peptide binding domain.</p><p>The two FF domain binding sites identified by our study in Luc 7 and Snu71 do not share any obvious similarity with previously identified binding motifs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Several studies showed that FF domains bind to phospho-peptides, usually the phospho-CTD of RNA polymerase II (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Similarly, several FF domains of CA150 were shown to bind to acidic peptides. However, while this may be true for Prp40 FF domains 2&#x02013;3 the FF1 domain of this protein appears to prefer basic residues. This finding is in agreement with the acidic nature of Prp40-FF1 (binding basic peptides) and the basic FF2 and FF3 domains which bind the rather acidic Snu71 peptide. Unfortunately there is still too little information to derive reliable consensus binding sites. Similarly, available 3D structures of FF domains bound with their cognant ligands are not sufficient to derive rules that allow us to predict binding sites more generally.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] have investigated the functional role of several motifs in Prp40, including putative RNA-binding domains they call "region 1" and "region 2" both of which overlap with the first two FF domains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). While deletion of region 1 is lethal, deletion of region 2 resulted in a slow growth phenotype. However, Murphy et al. were not able to show RNA-binding of these "domains" and thus it is likely that their similarity to RNA-binding domains is spurious. The fact that they overlap significantly with the FF domains supports that notion. Nevertheless, deletion of region 2 partially deletes the FF2 domain. It is possible that such a truncated FF2 domains has some residual binding activity and thus shows only a "slow growth" defect. We have not tested whether this partial deletion of FF2 still binds to Snu71 but given the non-essential role of Snu71, binding may not be absolutely required for U1 function.</p><p>The role of Snu71 remains elusive too. Newo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] have analyzed the U1 snRNP of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe </italic>and found no homolog of Snu71 although homologs of Prp40 and Luc7 were clearly present. However, they speculate that Usp107p may be a functional homolog of Snu71, given its similar size and the presence of a PWI domain in Usp107p.</p><p>While Prp40 does not bind to a conserved sequence in Snu71, the binding site in Luc7 is highly conserved. As a more rigorous confirmation of the specificity of the Prp40 and other FF domains, it would be interesting to compare the peptide-binding specificities of all available domains with their cognate peptides under comparable conditions. Similarly, the <italic>in vivo </italic>relevance of the interactions described here can only be elucidated with detailed structural analysis and mutation of the interaction epitopes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>For a detailed understanding of U1 protein function, crystal structures of the individual proteins or, preferably, the whole complex, will be required. The structure would also tell us whether the FF domains of Prp40 bind to 3-dimensional epitopes or two linear motifs. Since membrane-bound peptides as used in this study may not be folded as in the native protein, they may produce artifactual results.</p><p>This study should also provide new insight into the important role of Prp40 as a mediator between transcription and splicing. While Prp40 has been consistently shown to be a component of the U1 snRNP, its precise role in splicing remains unclear. Similarly, the mechanistic details of its involvement in transcription require additional data. Several publications indicate a direct connection between specific steps of transcription and mRNA-processing in eukaryotes, i. e. co-transcriptional mRNA-processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results show that FF domains 1 and 2 are critical for Prp40 function. However, while FF domains 3 and 4 are dispensable, they convey a considerable growth disadvantage when absent. We conclude that they also assist with spliceosome assembly or activity. This is also reflected by the evolutionary conservation of 4 or, sometimes 5, FF domains in homologous proteins. We suggest that our observations may also help to characterize the U1 snRNP structurally and suggest that previous crystallization efforts failed because Luc7 and Snu71 were expressed individually and crystallization attempts included only such individual proteins. We speculate that Luc7 may be crystallized together with Prp40 or fragments thereof. Further studies are required to derive general rules for physiological FF domain functions and activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>2.1.
