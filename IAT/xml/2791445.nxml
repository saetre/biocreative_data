Here we elucidate a novel phase variable mechanism for NadA, an adhesin and invasin of <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>. The NadR repressor protein binds to operators flanking the phase variable tract and contributes to the differential expression levels of phase variant promoters with different numbers of repeats likely due to different spacing between operators. We show that IHF binds between these operators, and may permit looping of the promoter, allowing interaction of NadR at operators located distally or overlapping the promoter. The 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, a metabolite of aromatic amino acid catabolism that is secreted in saliva, induces NadA expression by inhibiting the DNA binding activity of the repressor. When induced, only minor differences are evident between NadR-independent transcription levels of promoter phase variants and are likely due to differential RNA polymerase contacts leading to altered promoter activity. Our results suggest that NadA expression is under both stochastic and tight environmental-sensing regulatory control, both mediated by the NadR repressor, and may be induced during colonization of the oropharynx where it plays a major role in the successful adhesion and invasion of the mucosa. Hence, simple sequence repeats in promoter regions may be a strategy used by host-adapted bacterial pathogens to randomly switch between expression states that may nonetheless still be induced by appropriate niche-specific signals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Diversification strategies, through genetic switches that randomly turn genes on and off, occur in many pathogenic bacterial populations and confer adaptive advantages to new environments and evasion of host immune responses. This is often mediated by spontaneous changes in the length of short DNA sequence repeats located in protein-coding regions or upstream regulatory regions, leading to deactivation or alteration of the associated genes. In this study we describe how a repeat sequence, distally upstream of the promoter region, alters the expression of an important adhesin of <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>. We identify the major mediator of this control, a negative regulator NadR, which binds to sequences flanking the variable repeat. Changes in the spacing between these sequences affect the ability of NadR to shut down expression from the promoter. We also identify a relevant metabolite that can block NadR activity and therefore act as a signal to induce adhesin expression. This finding sheds new light on the role of DNA-repeats identified in intergenic regions for which no role could be hypothesised, and may be a model mechanism used by bacterial pathogens for fine-tuning diversity within the host. Elucidating these mechanisms can aid in our understanding and prevention of disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> is an important human pathogen which colonises the nasopharynx in about 5&#x02013;10&#x00025; of healthy individuals.

Consequently, the organism is able to cross the blood/brain barrier gaining access to the meninges surrounding the brain as well as infecting other organs. In order to ensure effective colonization and transmission, as well as coping with the diverse stages of the infectious cycle inside the host, the meningococcus must be able to respond and adapt to different microenvironments through regulated and stochastic expression of genes involved in pathogenesis.

Therefore, we have identified a distal upstream cis-acting region that we call the GPR region, which is responsible for repression of transcription from P<italic><sub>nadA</sub></italic> in log phase, possibly upon binding of a repressor protein.</p><fig id="ppat-1000710-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000710.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Identification of a <italic>cis</italic>-acting element of the <italic>nadA</italic> promoter determining <underline>g</underline>rowth <underline>p</underline>hase <underline>r</underline>egulatory effects (the GPR region) and the GPR-binding protein from cleared cell extracts of MC58.</title><p>(A) Schematic representation of the mutant <italic>nadA</italic> promoter variants (based on the MC58 <italic>nadA</italic> promoter with 9 repeats) present in single copy transcriptional fusion in the MC58 background in the strains, MC-P1, MC-P2, MC-P3, MC-P4, MC-P5, MC-P&#x00394;.

The level of expression of NadA and NadR in the wild type and &#x00394;1843 meningococcal strains was evaluated by Western Blot, in order to evaluate the role that NadR may play in NadA regulation across different strains of the meningococcus. The wild type strains showed, as expected, levels of NadA expression that can be associated with transcript levels of the <italic>nadA</italic> phase variant promoter they bear, and NadR was constitutively expressed in each strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000710-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;5). Each of the knockout strains exhibits higher levels of NadA expression than their respective wildtype strain indicating that NadR represses <italic>nadA</italic> expression in each strain (lanes 6&#x02013;10 vs 1&#x02013;5). Surprisingly, the mutation of NadR results in almost equivalent levels of NadA between the knockout strains, although the 5/99-&#x00394;1843 and BZ-&#x00394;1843 still exhibit slightly higher NadA expression. This suggests that NadR, although expressed to the same level, has a different repressive activity on the <italic>nadA</italic> gene in each strain and this may depend on the number of repeats in the different phase variant promoters i.e. NadR does not efficiently repress the 8x promoter of 5/99 but very efficiently represses the 9x promoter of MC58. To further test this hypothesis and to rule out effects due to strain differences, we deleted the <italic>nadR</italic> gene in the isogenic MC58 strains carrying high (x8), medium (x6) and low (x9) promoter variants and measured the steady state levels of transcription from the promoters at log and stationary growth phase in the presence or absence of the NadR regulator. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000710-g005">Figure 5B</xref> confirm that in the mutant (&#x00394;1843) all three promoters are derepressed, and, interestingly, little or no variation in transcript levels between the phase variants is observed, suggesting that in the absence of NadR the mechanism of transcriptional control exerted by variable number of repeats is alleviated or negligible. It is worth noting, however, that the maximum level of transcription in exponentially growing cells is observed from the promoter variant with 8 repeats, in agreement with higher NadA expression in 5/99-&#x00394;1843, suggesting that NadR is not the sole modulator of phase variable promoter activity and that there is another factor which may establish differential RNAP contacts to modulate transcription.</p><fig id="ppat-1000710-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000710.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>The NadR repressor contributes to phase variable expression.</title><p>(A) Western Blot analysis of the level of expression of NadA and NadR in wild type strains 5/99, BZ83, ISS838, 961&#x02013;5945 and MC58 carrying <italic>nadA</italic> promoters with 8, 5, 6, 12, and 9 repeats (lanes 1&#x02013;5), respectively, and their NadR null mutant derivatives, 5/99- &#x00394; 1843, BZ- &#x00394; 1843, ISS-&#x00394;1843, 961-&#x00394;1843, MC-&#x00394;1843 (lanes 6&#x02013;10).

Moreover, it is responsive to the 4HPA substrate of the pathway, which binds to the repressor and induces expression of the catabolic genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000710-Galan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. We, therefore, assessed whether the 4HPA molecule could act as putative inducer of NadA expression in vivo. Addition of 1 mM or 5 mM 4HPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000710-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) to cultures of wild type MC58 significantly induced NadA expression. No induction could be detected in cultures of the &#x00394;1843 mutant, indicating that the 4HPA molecule induced a NadR-mediated derepression of NadA expression. To confirm that the observed increases in NadA expression could represent a direct interaction of the inducer with NadR, the ability of the compound to dissociate purified recombinant NadR from the high affinity operator OpI was assessed by EMSA. The 4HPA compound was found to attenuate the binding activity of the NadR regulator to the GPR probe in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000710-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, addition of 1 mM 4HPA to crude cell extracts containing the native NadR meningococcal protein resulted in complete inhibition of retardation of the GPR probe in EMSA (data not shown), suggesting that the recombinant and native NadR proteins respond in vitro similarly to the compound.

We describe a complex promoter architecture in which spontaneous changes in the number of simple sequence repeats in a tract between the most distal regulatory regions and the core promoter can alter the promoter activity and lead to phase variable expression. We have shown that the NadR repressor is the major contributor to the phase variable expression levels of the promoter as it binds to two high affinity operators flanking the SSR. One operator overlaps the &#x02212;10 region of the promoter and the transcriptional start site and therefore binding of NadR is consistent with its function as a repressor through sterically hindering RNAP access to the promoter. The other high affinity operator is on the distal upstream side of the phase variable repeat in a cis-acting region that we call the GPR, which is functionally active in repressing the promoter despite its distal location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000710-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We have identified a single IHF binding site that is located between these two high affinity operators and we show that IHF binding to this promoter is necessary for efficient NadR-mediated repression of P<italic><sub>nadA</sub></italic>. The IHF binding site comprises some sequence upstream of the TAAA as well as part of the TAAA tract itself. We found that if the TAAA tract is removed, the protein no longer binds to the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000710-g002">Figure 2</xref>) but that IHF binding is unaffected by the number of TAAA repeats. However the number of repeats changes the spacing of the DNA on the upstream and downstream flanking regions of the tract and, therefore, may influence the localisation, and possibly the orientation of proteins that bind to the operators. The ability of IHF to bend DNA may facilitate the looping of the DNA of the <italic>nadA</italic> promoter and bring the GPR element proximal to the core promoter elements. A looping mechanism would explain the function of such a distal operator in repression of transcription, possibly through interactions of dimers present on spatially proximal operators which lock the promoter to RNAP similar to the mechanism described for the <italic>lac</italic> operon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000710-Oehler1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000710-Lewis1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in the completely derepressed form there are still significant, albeit marginal differences in the promoter strength of variants with different numbers of repeats. The alpha-subunit of RNAP binds to the distal GPR regulatory region and also immediately upstream of the core promoter overlapping the TAAA tract which may function as UP-like elements. We propose a model in which differential distancing between the NadR operators and the contact points of RNAP result in optimal or suboptimal configuration of the protein complexes and, therefore, result in more or less efficient repression mediated by NadR and/or more or less cis-enhancement of RNAP activity on the basal promoter strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000710-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

This scenario resembles in part what we observe with &#x003b1;-subunit interaction over the <italic>nadA</italic> promoter.</p><fig id="ppat-1000710-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000710.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Model of regulation of NadA promoter.</title><p>Two promoter variants with 9 and 8 repeats representing low activity and high activity promoter phase variants, respectively, highlighting the ability of NadR to efficiently or less efficiently repress the promoters (top panels) and NadR-independent effects on the derepressed promoter basal levels possibly due to differential contacts with the &#x003b1;-subunit of RNAP (bottom panels) due to different spatial organization of the NadR and RNAP contact points resulting from the different number of repeats.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1000710.g007"/></fig><p>The gonococcal homologue of NadR is FarR, which has been characterised in gonococcus as a repressor of the FarAB fatty acid resistance efflux pump <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000710-Lee2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. FarR binds two distal operators on the <italic>farAB</italic> promoter (located similarly to OpI and OpII in the <italic>nadA</italic> promoter) and represses transcription in an IHF dependent way. It would appear from deletion analysis of the <italic>nadA</italic> promoter that all regulatory elements necessary for control of <italic>nadA</italic> expression were horizontally transferred together with the <italic>nadA</italic> gene, as the direct repeat delineating the border of the transferred DNA is at &#x02212;193. The intriguing question is: how did the <italic>nadA</italic> locus, which is present in only a fraction of strains as a result of a horizontal transfer event, adopt such a complex regulatory mechanism that pre-existed in <italic>Neisseria</italic>. The <italic>nadR</italic> gene is well conserved in other <italic>Neisseria</italic> spp. such as <italic>N. mucosa</italic>, <italic>N. cinerea, N. lactamica, N. subflavia</italic> and <italic>N. flavescens</italic> and, therefore, must respond to signals in the ecological niches of all these species.</p><p>The NadR protein is a member of the MarR ligand-responsive transcriptional regulators and the majority of MarR family members are regulated by the non-covalent binding of low molecular weight ligands. These signalling molecules regulate the activity of the regulators. In this study, we have identified a putative ligand, 4HPA, which is able to relieve the DNA binding activity of NadR, thus derepressing or inducing NadA expression. This molecule is a catabolite of aromatic amino acids and it is secreted in human saliva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000710-Takahama1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> (and also urine), suggesting that the inducer is present in the oropharynx and NadA may be induced in the mucosal niche which is bathed in saliva.</p><p>The 4HPA molecule is a catabolite of the aromatic amino acids, tyrosine and phenylalanine. Two groups of bacteria, the soil inhabitants such as <italic>P. putida</italic> and the enteric bacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic> contain pathways for the breakdown of these amino acids to succinate and pyruvate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000710-Diaz1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000710-Sparnins1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. However, such a pathway is not present in the meningococcal genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000710-Tettelin1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, <italic>nadR</italic> is present in an operon-like organization with two downstream genes, one of which shows significant homology to the HpaC small subunit of a hydroxylase involved in the conversion of 4HPA to a less toxic form (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid). It is unclear whether this operon may be involved in the utilisation of the 4HPA inducer in some way in the meningococcus, or whether it is the remnant of a partial catabolic pathway that was acquired horizontally and the 4HPA molecule simply acts as a signal inducing the expression of the adhesin, which is necessary for colonization and invasion of the mucosa.</p><p>Phase variation functions as an adaptive strategy generating spontaneous diverse sub-populations of the bacterium which may be beneficial in adapting to different microenvironments within the human host during the course of a natural infection. However, in the case of <italic>nadA</italic> gene regulation, this type of mechanism is bi-functional, in that the major mediation of phase variable expression levels of NadA is through repression by NadR in the absence of the correct inducer signal. Subpopulations expressing low levels of NadA through promoter phase variations still have the potential to respond to the correct niche signal, such as 4HPA, and express high levels under certain environmental or niche-specific conditions. Such variation will have an impact on the interaction with the host tissues, as well as escaping immune responses.
