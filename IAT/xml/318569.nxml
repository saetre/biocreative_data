The nucleotide sequence of these rat IFN cDNA clones revealed i. the partial presence of the coding region of the gene and ii all cDNA clones were derived from the same subtype of rat IFN-alpha mRNA. Purified inserted fragments were used as a hybridisation probe against chromosomal "Southern blots" to show that at least twelve rat IFN-alpha-related sequences are present in the genome. A lambda-linked rat gene library was screened with the cDNA probes, resulting in an equivalent number of rat IFN-alpha-related hybrid phages. By use of a 3'-noncoding region as a probe, the chromosomal counterpart of the cDNA clones could be detected and the nucleotide sequence of its coding region has been determined. Expression of the coding region in E. coli yielded biologically active IFN, when tested for in vitro or in vivo antiviral activity.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0381-a" xlink:role="1233"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0375.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1227"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0376.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1228"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0377.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1229"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0378.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1230"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0379.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1231"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0380.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1232"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0381.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1233"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0382.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1234"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0383.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1235"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0384.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1236"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0385.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1237"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0386.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1238"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0387.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1239"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0388.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1240"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0389.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1241"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00320-0390.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1242"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
