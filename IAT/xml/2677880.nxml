Here, we report that the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene was strongly repressed during differentiation of human cells, whereas modest mTERT expression was detected in terminally differentiated and post-mitotic cells. The stringent hTERT repression depended on the native chromatin environment because transiently transfected hTERT promoters were not repressed in differentiated cells. Conversely, the transiently transfected mTERT core promoter was repressed during cell differentiation, suggesting that the repression of mTERT promoter did not require its endogenous chromatin structures. To understand the mechanisms of this differential regulation, we examined chromatin structures of the endogenous <italic>TERT</italic> loci during cell differentiation. In both human and mouse cells, repression was accompanied by the loss of multiple DNase I hypersensitive sites at the TERT promoters and their upstream regions, revealing positions of potential regulatory elements. Interestingly, the <italic>hTERT</italic> locus was located within a nuclease-resistant chromatin domain in human cells, whereas a corresponding chromatin domain was not detected for the <italic>mTERT</italic> locus. Taken together, our study indicated that, unlike the repression of <italic>mTERT</italic> gene, the condensed native chromatin environment of <italic>hTERT</italic> locus was central to its silencing during cell differentiation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Telomeres serve as essential protective caps of linear chromosomal ends in all eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In the absence of telomere maintenance, progressive telomere shortening accompanied by cell division leads to chromosomal instability and proliferative senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In stem cells and immortal cell lines, telomeric TTAGGG repeats are replenished by telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase complex containing a template RNA subunit (TER) and a catalytic protein subunit (TERT). In most cells, the transcription of <italic>TERT</italic> gene is limiting and correlates with telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Telomerase is highly regulated during development and cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>). Telomerase expression is a defining feature of pluripotent stem cells and most somatic stem cells, as it is required for the self-renewal capability of stem cells. Telomerase activity is also detected during embryonic development. In most human adult somatic tissues, however, both telomerase activity and the hTERT protein are either undetectable or expressed at an extremely low level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). Incidentally, differentiated human somatic cells, such as fibroblasts, never undergo spontaneous immortalization under <italic>in vitro</italic> culture conditions. Given that ectopic expression of hTERT leads to immortalization of many human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), it is not surprising that the transcription of <italic>hTERT</italic> gene is tightly repressed in these cells. In fact, we have previously demonstrated that the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene was embedded in a condensed chromatin domain in several human cell lines and normal human fibroblasts, providing a mechanism for its tight regulation in human somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>In mice, most somatic tissues express a detectable amount of mTERT mRNA, albeit at lower levels than in embryonic tissues and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Consequently, mouse cells have much longer telomeres and do not undergo telomere-dependent proliferative senescence. This interspecies difference likely contributes to some of the distinct characteristics of aging and cancers in humans and mice, and therefore has important implications in using mice as models of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>). The molecular basis of differential TERT expression in humans and mice is only beginning to be addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>Terminal differentiation of animal cells has been studied extensively in cell lines of myeloid lineages, such as human HL60, U937 and murine M1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>). Repression of hTERT and telomerase expression during differentiation was demonstrated in HL60 and U937 cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21">19&#x02013;21</xref>). Recently, we have demonstrated that a transgenic hTERT reporter locus was silenced during <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), in a similar way as the native <italic>hTERT</italic> gene in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In contrast, less is known about the mTERT regulation, besides the reports showing that mTERT is downregulated during differentiation of mouse ESCs and C2C12 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Here, the repression of <italic>hTERT</italic> and <italic>mTERT</italic> genes in differentiating cells was studied and directly compared in the context of their respective native chromatin environments. The experiments indicated that, unlike repression of the <italic>mTERT</italic> gene, the native chromatin environment played a key role in the silencing of <italic>hTERT</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and differentiation</title><p>Human HL60 and U937 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum.

The levels of TERT mRNAs were measured by quantitative RT-PCR and normalized to 18S rRNA. The hTERT mRNA level in human newborn foreskin fibroblasts (NHFs) was barely detectable and it was at least three orders of magnitude lower than in human embryonic stem cell line (hESC) H9 and human leukemic HL60 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The hTERT expression was higher in human embryonic lung fibroblast IMR90 cells than in NHFs, but its level was still about 100-fold lower than that in H9 hESCs. In contrast, significant mTERT expression was detected in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and its level was one-third of that in mouse embryonic stem cell line (mESC) HM1 and 1/6 of that in mouse leukemic M1 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Because human and mouse sequences might be amplified with different efficiencies, it is difficult to directly compare TERT mRNA levels in human and mouse cells. Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent cells capable of differentiating into all cell types in adult organisms. They are immortal normal cells that express high levels of telomerase and TERT mRNAs. Therefore, assuming that TERT expression was similar in undifferentiated human and mouse ESCs, the hTERT mRNA levels in NHF and IM90 cells were about 1000- and 30-fold lower than the mTERT mRNA level in MEFs, respectively. The higher hTERT expression in IMR90 cells, as compared to NHF cells, was likely due to its embryonic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) rather than <italic>in vitro</italic> passaging, because NHF cells used in this study were of earlier passages (population doublings or PDLs 10&#x02013;15) than IMR90 cells (PDLs 25&#x02013;30). Thus, hTERT expression was significantly lower in human fibroblasts than its counterpart in mouse fibroblasts. <table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Relative levels of TERT expression in human and mouse cells</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead align="left"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comparison</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Relative ratio of hTERT expression<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF1"><sup>a</sup></xref></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comparison</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Relative ratio of mTERT expression<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF1"><sup>a</sup></xref></th></tr></thead><tbody align="left"><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NHF/H9-hESC</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0004 &#x000b1; 0.0001</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MEF/HM-1mESC</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.34 &#x000b1; 0.06</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NHF/HL60</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0001 &#x000b1; 0.0001</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">MEF/M1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.15 &#x000b1; 0.03</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">IMR90/H9-hESC</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.012 &#x000b1; 0.001</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">F2-1d/F2-1mESC<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF2"><sup>b</sup></xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0016 &#x000b1; 0.0020</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">F2-1d/F2-1mESC</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.17 &#x000b1; 0.01</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">F9-1d/F2-9mESC<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="TF2"><sup>b</sup></xref></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0016 &#x000b1; 0.0021</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">F9-1d/F2-9mESC</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.11 &#x000b1; 0.03</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>NHF, normal human newborn foreskin fibroblasts.

In U937 cells, the hTERT mRNA level was reduced 37-fold upon induction of monocytic differentiation. A direct comparison of hTERT mRNA in these two cell lines revealed that proliferating U937 cells expressed about 100-fold less hTERT mRNA than proliferating HL60 cells and the hTERT mRNA expression was low in both differentiated HL60 and U937 cells.

The differentiation of M1 cells is accompanied by induction of several differentiation-specific genes and processes, such as MyD expression, growth arrest, cell attachment and macrophage maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Proliferating M1 cells expressed a high level of mTERT mRNA, similar to that in undifferentiated mESC clones (F2-1 and F2-9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). However, in contrast to hTERT expression, mTERT expression in M1 cells decreased only 5-fold following a 5-day differentiation process induced by IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Because only terminally differentiated M1 cells attached to tissue culture dishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), IL-6-treated cells were washed prior to harvest to eliminate any possible partially differentiated non-adherent cells.

We examined the mTERT expression in mESC clones F2-1 and F2-9 and their osteogenic cell-derived differentiated F2-1d and F2-9d cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, F2-1d and F2-9d cells expressed 6- and 9-fold less mTERT mRNA than the parental F2-1 and F2-9 ESCs, respectively. F2-1 and F2-9 ESCs were two independent HM1 clones containing a stably integrated human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) reporter, in which a <italic>Firefly</italic> luciferase ORF and a <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase ORF were inserted into the hTERT and hCRR9 translational initiation codons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Because transcription from the hCRR9 promoter did not change during differentiation of mESCs into osteogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), expression of <italic>Firefly</italic> luciferase from the hTERT promoter was normalized to <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase expressed from the hCRR9 promoter. Transcription from the hTERT promoter in differentiated F2-1d and F2-9d cells was about 1/600 of that in the parental F2-1 and F2-9 ESCs, as measured by luciferase activities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown). Therefore, mTERT expression was downregulated upon <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of mouse cells, but its repression was much less stringent than that of the hTERT promoter.</p><p>To determine if proximal promoter sequences accounted for the differential TERT repression during cell differentiation, we performed transient transfection experiments in HL60 cells using <italic>Firefly</italic> luciferase plasmid reporters containing TERT promoters. Six hours after transfection, HL60 cells were treated with or without DMSO for 2 days to induce differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Whereas the endogenous hTERT mRNA was completely repressed within 24 h following DMSO treatment (data not shown), plasmids pYF3 and pYF10, containing a 208- bp and a 1.4-kb human genomic sequence upstream of the hTERT initiation codon, respectively, maintained similar levels of <italic>Firefly</italic> luciferase expression 2 days after induction of differentiation. pBTdel-408, containing a sequence &#x02013;462-bp to &#x02013;51-bp relative to the hTERT initiation codon but lacking the downstream E-box, expressed a slightly higher level of <italic>Firefly</italic> luciferase activity in differentiating HL60 cells than in proliferating cells. On the other hand, pmTERT-Fluc, including a 432-bp mouse genomic sequence upstream of the mTERT initiation codon, was downregulated by about 2-fold. As controls, both the CRR9 promoter and the SV40 promoter were expressed at a similar level in proliferating and differentiating HL60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and data not shown). These results indicated that transiently transfected plasmid reporters containing up to 1.4-kb hTERT promoter sequences were not repressed during HL60 cell differentiation.</p><p>Horikawa and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) recently identified several consensus elements important for hTERT repression in normal human fibroblasts within the hTERT core promoter, including a nonconserved GC-box, an E2F consensus site and the downstream E-box. We have obtained and tested a subset of hTERT reporter plasmids used in their studies. These reporters included pBT-255, which contained a 295-bp hTERT core promoter, and its mutant derivatives with mutations at the nonconserved GC-box (pBT-255-hM12), the E2F consensus site (pBT-255-hM13) and the conserved downstream E-box (pBT-255-hM14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) Similar to pYF3 and pYF10, the hTERT promoter in pBT-255 was similarly active in proliferating and differentiating HL60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Also similar to the results in NHF cells published by Horikawa and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), mutations at the nonconserved GC-box (pBT-255-hM12) and the conserved downstream E-box (pBT-255-hM14) led to an &#x0223c;2-fold increase in the hTERT promoter activity in HL60 cells. Surprisingly, a mutation at the E2F consensus site (pBT-255-hM13) resulted in an almost complete loss of the promoter activity, suggesting the involvement of E2F family transcription factors in hTERT transcription in HL60 cells. However, all of these hTERT plasmid reporters, pBT-255 and its mutant derivatives, had similar activities in both proliferating and differentiating cells, indicating that none of the aforementioned potential regulatory elements were sufficient to repress the hTERT promoter during HL60 cell differentiation.</p><p>To determine whether a transiently transfected hTERT promoter is repressed in fully differentiated cells, in which the endogenous hTERT gene is silenced, the hTERT reporter activities were directly compared with those of constitutively active CRR9 promoter and SV40 promoter in NHF cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, <italic>Firefly</italic> luciferase activity expressed from the wild-type hTERT core promoter was about 20-fold higher than that of the control vector, pGL3-Basic, and 30&#x02013;50% of those from the CRR9 and SV40 promoters. This result was consistent with our previously published data that the hTERT promoter activity was 30&#x02013;50% of that of the CMV promoter in telomerase-negative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In addition, mutation of the non-conserved GC-box resulted in about 2-fold increase of the hTERT promoter activity, whereas mutation of the E2F consensus site did not abolish the promoter activity in NHF cells, supporting the previously published results by Horikawa <italic>et al</italic>.

These results suggested that, whereas E2F family transcription factors are important for hTERT promoter activity in HL60 cells, the repression of hTERT promoter during cell differentiation was chromatin dependent. Distal elements and/or chromatin environment might be essential for hTERT silencing. In contrast, moderate repression of the mTERT promoter during cell differentiation did not appear to require its native chromatin environment.</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping DNase I hypersensitive sites in human cells</title><p>Transcriptional regulation is associated with chromatin structural alterations, such as the appearance of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs). Such sites are discontinuities of nucleosomal arrays that often result from interactions between regulatory proteins and <italic>cis</italic>-elements. To determine the chromatin structural changes that accompanied hTERT repression, we examined the DNase I sensitivity of the proximal promoter region between EcoRI (&#x02013;3.9 kb) and SphI (+1.7 kb) sites by Southern blotting and indirect end-labeling. Using a probe specific for the upstream end of this region (probe <italic>a</italic>), a prominent band (3.9 kb) was detected in proliferating HL60 cells, in addition to the full-length genomic fragment of 5.6 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, left panel). This 3.9-kb band was present only in DNase I-treated nuclei and disappeared at higher concentrations of the nuclease, indicative of a DHS band corresponding to the hHS1 that we reported previously in several other telomerase-positive human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). In differentiated HL60 cells, however, the 3.9-kb band shifted upward to 4.2 kb and had a reduced intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, right panel). When the same blot was hybridized with the downstream probe (probe <italic>b</italic>), two DHS bands (1.4 kb and 1.7 kb) were seen near the promoter region in proliferating HL60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, left panel). The 1.7-kb band, corresponding to the hHS1, disappeared upon cell differentiation and thereby correlated with hTERT transcriptional repression. The 1.4-kb size of the second band indicated the presence of a novel DHS within intron 1 of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene (hHS2). This DHS, however, was present in both proliferating and differentiated HL60 cells. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>DHSs at the proximal region of the hTERT promoter in proliferating (P) and differentiated (D) human cells.

Therefore, multiple DHSs were identified within a 2-kb region covering the hTERT promoter in HL60 and U937 cells. hHS1, which overlapped with the hTERT core promoter and was present specifically in hTERT-expressing proliferating cells, likely corresponded to an assembly site for RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors. hHS2 and hHS3, on the other hand, were found in both proliferating and differentiated cells and were candidates of regulatory elements involved in hTERT regulation in these cells.</p><p>To identify distal regulatory elements, a genomic region (&#x0223c;125 kb) that included the entire <italic>hTERT</italic> gene, its upstream and downstream neighboring loci, <italic>hCRR9</italic> and <italic>hXtrp2</italic>, were examined for the presence of DHSs.

In the current study, we provided evidence that compared to mTERT, hTERT was strongly repressed in differentiated human somatic cells and this stringent repression depended on its native chromatin conformation. Differentiated human cells, including fibroblasts and differentiated granulocytes and monocytic cells, expressed very low levels of hTERT mRNA compared to undifferentiated human cells, such as embryonic stem cells. In newborn foreskin fibroblast cells, the hTERT mRNA was barely detectable and its level was estimated to be at least 1000-fold lower than in hESC H9 cells and leukemic HL60 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Embryonic fibroblast IMR90 cells expressed slightly more hTERT mRNA, but still 100-fold less than in H9 and HL60 cells. This low hTERT expression might still be required for maintaining telomere integrity in normal human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>The hTERT expression appeared to be inversely correlated to the status of cell differentiation. For example, HL60 cells differentiate to either granulocyte-like cells or monocyte/macrophage-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), whereas U937 cells are already committed to the monocytic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Accordingly, proliferating HL60 cells expressed about 100-fold more hTERT mRNA than U937 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Following terminal differentiation, hTERT transcription was repressed to very low levels in both HL60 and U937 cells. Thus, silencing of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene in most human somatic cells likely resulted from strong transcriptional repression of the <italic>hTERT</italic> gene during cell differentiation.</p><p>Like HL60 cells, mouse M1 cells are myeloblasts that undergo differentiation into granulocyte- and monocyte-like cells upon IL-6 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). However, mTERT expression in post-mitotic differentiated M1 cells was still one-fifth of those in proliferating M1 cells. Similarly, MEFs contained a significant level of mTERT mRNA compared with undifferentiated mESCs and M1 cells. Recently, we have published the study of a chromosomally integrated hTERT reporter locus, in which the hTERT promoter was repressed by several orders of magnitudes when mouse ESCs were differentiated into osteogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In these same cells, mTERT expression was downregulated by only 6&#x02013;9-fold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Taken together, mTERT silencing was not tightly linked to terminal differentiation as it was for hTERT in human cells.</p><p>Several aspects of the endogenous loci need to be addressed in order to explain the differential repression of <italic>hTERT</italic> and <italic>mTERT</italic> genes. Interactions between transcription factors and the promoter elements might be different for <italic>hTERT</italic> and <italic>mTERT</italic> genes. c-Myc, Sp-1, and E2F factors were thought to be the main transcription activators to regulate the hTERT core promoter. The downstream E-box and the E2F consensus site have been shown to participate in both positive and negative regulation of telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Switch of occupancy by Myc/Max to Mad1/Max at the hTERT core promoter was proposed to be responsible for the downregulation of hTERT transcription during HL60 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In this report, we demonstrated that, unlike the endogenous hTERT promoter, transiently transfected hTERT promoter reporters were not silenced in NHF cells and during HL60 cell differentiation. Mutation of the downstream E-box resulted in a moderate increase of the hTERT promoter activity, whereas mutation of the E2F consensus site significantly decreased its activity. These data suggested that, although both E-box and E2F sites are important regulators of the hTERT promoter activity, presence of these sites are insufficient for the repression of hTERT promoter during differentiation of HL60 cells. Furthermore, these two sites are conserved at hTERT and mTERT promoters, raising the possibility that additional mechanisms contribute to the differential expression of hTERT and mTERT in human and mouse cells.</p><p>It was previously reported that several binding elements near or within the hTERT core promoter were involved in hTERT repression in human cells. Particularly, a nonconserved GC-box and upstream AP-1 consensus sites were shown to mediate the suppression of the hTERT core promoter in transiently transfected reporter assays in NHF cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Our data confirmed these results and showed that mutation of the nonconserved GC-box resulted in a 2-fold increase in hTERT promoter activity in transient transfection assays in both NHF and HL60 cells. These data suggested that, whereas the GC-box and the downstream E-box negatively regulated the hTERT core promoter, these elements were unable to silence the hTERT promoter in differentiated cells without an appropriate chromatin context.</p><p>Compared to earlier reports suggesting that the hTERT promoter reporters were inactive in telomerase-negative cells, we found that the transiently transfected hTERT promoters were active in NHFs and differentiated HL60 cells, in which the endogenous hTERT promoter was repressed. However, we do not believe that our experimental results were significantly different from those of Horikawa <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). We demonstrated that transiently transfected hTERT promoters were less active than the mTERT promoter, as shown by Horikawa <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), but they were not silenced in telomerase-negative fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). Our results further indicated that chromatin-dependent repression of the <italic>hTERT</italic> locus was an important mechanism of differential expression of the <italic>TERT</italic> genes in human and mouse cells.</p><p>The native chromatin environments of the <italic>hTERT</italic> and <italic>mTERT</italic> genes likely contribute to their differential regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In this study, we showed that, in HL60 and U937 cells, the endogenous <italic>hTERT</italic> locus was embedded in a nuclease-resistant chromatin domain and this condensed domain persisted throughout differentiation. However, in mouse M1 cells, F2-9 ESCs, and their differentiated derivatives, such a condensed chromatin domain was not detected for the <italic>mTERT</italic> locus. In addition, the transgenic <italic>hTERT</italic> locus in F2-9 mESCs and F2-9d cells adopted a conformation similar to its native locus in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) and was silenced upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of histone deacetylases in telomerase-negative fibroblasts led to an opening of the chromatin and induction of hTERT transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Together, these results collectively provided evidence for a causal role of the chromatin conformation in tight hTERT repression. In proliferating cells, activation by strong transcription activators such as c-Myc, Sp1, and E2Fs might permit transcription from the hTERT promoter despite repression by this chromatin domain. In fact, the endogenous hTERT promoter is under repression even in telomerase-positive immortal cell lines because inhibition of histone deacetylases resulted in a further increase of hTERT transcription in these cells (data not shown). Conversely, this condensed chromatin domain would cooperate with repressors that were recruited to the promoter during cell differentiation and effectively reduce basal transcription. Therefore, the chromatin environment is likely a crucial factor for the tight hTERT repression in human somatic cells. In contrast, although mTERT expression was moderately repressed during differentiation, this regulation did not appear to require the native chromatin structure.</p><p>The present study also identified several novel DHSs within and near both <italic>hTERT</italic> and <italic>mTERT</italic> genomic loci. DHSs are often the binding sites for proteins that regulate chromatin structure and/or transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>. In earlier studies, we showed that hHS1 coincided with the hTERT core promoter and was present in all telomerase-expressing cells but absent in telomerase-negative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Here, we found that the novel hHS2 was mapped to the first intron of <italic>hTERT</italic> gene, which contained two ETS consensus sites (+288 nt and +390 nt). It was previously reported that these ETS sites mediated the activation of hTERT transcription by ER81, an ETS family transcription factor involved in the oncogenic HER2/Neu-Ras signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). hHS3, located about 1.5 kb upstream of the hTERT transcription start site in U937 cells, overlapped with one of the AP-1 sites identified by Takakura <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Because hHS2 and hHS3 were present in both proliferating and differentiated cells, it remains to be determined whether these sites play a role in hTERT repression during differentiation. In contrast, hHS4, mapped to about 9.5 kb upstream of the hTERT promoter, appeared only in proliferating HL60 cells. This DHS coincided with an Alu repeat. Interestingly, mHS2, located about 6 kb upstream of the mTERT promoter in F2-9 mESCs and M1 cells, was also mapped to a mouse type II Alu-like SINE repetitive element B2. Alu elements belong to the SINE family (short interspersed nuclear elements) of repetitive elements and may regulate, often negatively, transcription of several genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). For example, Alu repeats were proposed to be transcriptional silencers of the human erythropoietin receptor gene, the Wilms&#x02019; tumor gene WT1, and BRCA2 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35 B36 B37">35&#x02013;37</xref>). However, both hHS4 and mHS2 disappeared upon differentiation, suggesting that formation of these DHSs associated with activation of the TERT promoters. Also, mHS2 appeared to be linked to mTERT transcription but not differentiation <italic>per se</italic>, as it was detected in both proliferating and terminally differentiated M1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C).</p><p>In most human cells, including HL60 and U937 cells, transition from the nuclease-sensitive <italic>hCRR9</italic> locus to the condensed chromatin domain of <italic>hTERT</italic> locus occurs at the 3&#x02032; end of <italic>hCRR9</italic> gene [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], suggesting the presence of a chromatin boundary element within this region. It was previously shown that an E-box binding protein USF1 bound to the 5&#x02032;HS4 insulator of &#x003b2;-globin domain and acted as a barrier by recruiting histone modifying activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Interestingly, at least two DHSs (hHS5 and hHS6) were identified near the 3&#x02032; end of <italic>hCRR9</italic> gene in HL60 cells. This region contained a number of potential USF consensus sites and correlated with histone hyperacetylation (data not shown). Thus, it will be interesting to determine if hHS5 and hHS6 function as a barrier to prevent encroachment of heterochromatin from the condensed chromatin domain into the <italic>hCRR9</italic> gene.</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrated that the hTERT gene was silenced upon cellular differentiation whereas the mTERT expression was only moderately downregulated. The <italic>hTERT</italic> locus, but not the <italic>mTERT</italic> gene, was embedded in a condensed chromatin domain. The strong hTERT repression in somatic cells was dependent on its repressive chromatin environment and was not recapitulated by transient transfection of the hTERT promoter. In contrast, the regulation of the mTERT promoter was relatively independent of its native chromatin structure because transiently transfected mTERT promoter was repressed during cell differentiation. Therefore, chromatin environments of the <italic>hTERT</italic> and <italic>mTERT</italic> genes played an important role in differential telomerase regulation in human and mouse cells.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp125/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> grant <grant-num>GM071725</grant-num>; and J.Z. is a Research Scholar of American Cancer Society.
