The Groucho/TLE (transducin-like enhancer) family of co-repressor proteins also regulate development and modulate the activity of many DNA-binding transcription factors during a range of diverse cellular processes including haematopoiesis. We have shown previously that PRH is a repressor of transcription in haematopoietic cells and that an Eh-1 (Engrailed homology) motif present within the N-terminal transcription repression domain of PRH mediates binding to Groucho/TLE proteins and enables co-repression. In the present study we demonstrate that PRH regulates the nuclear retention of TLE proteins during cellular fractionation. We show that transcriptional repression and the nuclear retention of TLE proteins requires PRH to bind to both TLE and DNA. In addition, we characterize a trans-dominant-negative PRH protein that inhibits wild-type PRH activity by sequestering TLE proteins to specific subnuclear domains. These results demonstrate that transcriptional repression by PRH is dependent on TLE availability and suggest that subnuclear localization of TLE plays an important role in transcriptional repression by PRH.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>co-repressor</kwd><kwd>Groucho</kwd><kwd>haematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>haematopoietically expressed homeobox (Hex)</kwd><kwd>nuclear retention</kwd><kwd>proline-rich homeodomain (PRH)</kwd><kwd>transcriptional repression</kwd><kwd>trans- dominant negative</kwd><kwd>transducin-like enhancer (TLE)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>CIP, calf intestinal phosphatase</kwd><kwd>DAPI, 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole</kwd><kwd>DTT, dithiothreitol</kwd><kwd>Eh-1, Engrailed homology motif</kwd><kwd>eIF-4E, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E</kwd><kwd>EMSA, electrophoretic mobility-shift assay</kwd><kwd>GFP, green fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>Hex, haematopoietically expressed homeobox</kwd><kwd>PML, promyelocytic leukaemic</kwd><kwd>PRH, proline-rich homeodomain</kwd><kwd>pTK, thymidine kinase promoter</kwd><kwd>TLE, transducin-like enhancer</kwd><kwd>TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine &#x003b2;-isothiocyanate</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><ref-count count="56"/><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Transcription factors that bind to DNA are important regulators of multiple processes in the cell and often act in conjunction with non-DNA-binding co-repressors and co-activators to bring about changes in gene expression. Generally the role of the co-regulatory proteins is to recruit chromatin remodelling enzymes or chromatin-binding proteins in order to set up more open or closed chromatin configurations. Most co-activators and co-repressors are able to interact with a variety of DNA-bound factors to regulate gene expression. The PRH (proline-rich homeodomain) [also known as Hex (haematopoietically expressed homeobox)] protein is a DNA-binding transcription factor that can regulate gene expression in a number of tissues using multiple mechanisms (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). PRH forms oligomers in cells and can bind to DNA in the oligomeric state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. When bound to DNA, PRH generally functions as a repressor of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and we have shown previously that PRH can recruit members of the Groucho/TLE (transducin-like enhancer) family of co-repressor proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]; however, in some contexts, PRH functions as a DNA-bound activator of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. PRH can also regulate transcription without binding to DNA by regulating the activity of other DNA-binding transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, PRH can regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by regulating the transport of specific mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>PRH regulates embryonic development in all vertebrates and is necessary for the development of embryonic forebrain, thyroid, lungs, liver and heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. PRH also plays a role in the early development of vascular tissues and the formation of haematopoietic lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the adult, PRH is expressed in thyroid, liver and lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and may play a role in the maintenance of differentiation of these tissues. Moreover this protein regulates haematopoiesis in the embryo and in the adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. PRH is strongly expressed in pluripotent haematopoietic progenitors, in erythromyeloid and B-cell progenitors, but not in T-cell lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In general, the gradual down-regulation of PRH is associated with differentiation of most haematopoietic lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. PRH interacts with the growth control proteins PML (promyelocytic leukaemic) and translation initiation factor eIF-4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and has been shown to regulate cell growth or differentiation in haematopoietic cells as well as in a number of different tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Decreased PRH expression and loss of nuclear localization of PRH is implicated in a number of human myeloid leukaemias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, a chromosomal translocation resulting in a PRH fusion protein that can activate transcription and has trans-dominant-negative activity over wild-type PRH has been shown to be a causative agent in acute myeloid leukaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The PRH protein consists of three regions: a proline-rich N-terminal domain, a central homeodomain and an acidic C-terminal domain. The proline-rich N-terminal domain of PRH can make multiple protein&#x02013;protein interactions and binds to several proteins including PML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], eIF-4E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], proteosome subunit HC8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and members of the Groucho/TLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] family of co-repressor proteins. PRH forms foci in haematopoietic cells and exists as oligomeric complexes <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The N-terminal domain of PRH is required for oligomerization and transcriptional repression and can influence the DNA-binding activity of the PRH homeodomain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. As well as binding to DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the PRH homeodomain is important in PRH oligomerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and forms protein&#x02013;protein interactions with other transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The C-terminal domain of PRH is rich in acidic residues but appears to play no role in repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]; however, both the homeodomain and C-terminal domain are reported to play a role in transcription activation by PRH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>The TLE proteins are members of a family of transcription co-repressors that includes the archetypical <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein Groucho. Like PRH, Groucho/TLE family proteins are involved in many developmental decisions including: neuronal and epithelial cell differentiation, segmentation and sex determination, and the differentiation of haematopoietic, osteoblast and pituitary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Members of the Groucho/TLE family do not have DNA-binding activity, but are instead recruited to DNA by interactions with DNA-binding proteins. Once recruited to a promoter, these proteins can bring about long-range transcriptional repression by recruiting histone deacetylases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and by interacting directly with histones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. TLE proteins form tetramers and larger oligomeric complexes and oligomerization is essential for co-repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The TLE proteins are phosphoproteins and are hyperphosphorylated during the cell cycle and during cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. A subset of the DNA-binding transcription factors that interact with Groucho/TLE proteins in the haematopoietic compartment, including Hes1, Runx-1 and Pax5, have been shown to play a role in regulating TLE phosphorylation and modulating its activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. For example, Hes1- and Runx-1-dependent phosphorylation of nuclear TLE1 by CK2 (casein kinase 2) has been shown to increase its co-repressor activity and its association with chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In contrast, phosphorylation of TLE by HIPK2 (homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2) decreases its co-repression ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>We have shown previously that endogenous PRH and TLE are present in both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear compartments of K562 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We have also shown that a short sequence of amino acids in the PRH N-terminal domain, known as the Eh-1 (Engrailed homology) motif, mediates the binding of PRH to TLE proteins. Moreover we have demonstrated that a direct interaction between TLE1 and PRH is required for co-repression of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the present study, we demonstrate that PRH brings about nuclear retention of endogenous TLE proteins in early myeloid progenitors (K562 cells). Furthermore we show that a mutated form of PRH that is defective in DNA binding can function as a trans-dominant negative of wild-type PRH by sequestering TLE proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>Mammalian expression and reporter plasmids</title><p>The mammalian expression plasmid pMUG1-Myc&#x02013;PRH expresses Myc-tagged human PRH (amino acids 7&#x02013;270). pMUG1-Myc&#x02013;PRH and pMUG1-Myc&#x02013;PRHF32E have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

A FITC-labelled pan-TLE polyclonal antibody was used to detect the expression of endogenous TLE proteins; however, these experiments were not conclusive as the expression of Myc&#x02013;PRH in the nucleus hindered detection of the endogenous TLE proteins (weak FITC signal) in the cell. Therefore to address this question we next examined the subcellular localization of endogenous TLE proteins using subcellular fractionation and Western blot analysis. K562 cells or K562 cells expressing Myc&#x02013;PRH were fractionated into the post-nuclear fraction consisting of cytoplasmic and loosely held nuclear proteins and nuclear fractions consisting of tightly held nuclear proteins. To compare the endogenous TLE protein levels in each subcellular compartment an equal amount of protein from each fraction was loaded on to SDS/PAGE and the TLE proteins were detected using the pan-TLE antibody. Fractionation and equal loading in each fraction was assessed by the expression of tubulin in the post-nuclear fraction and lamin A/C in the nuclear fraction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>(C) shows that endogenous TLE proteins were predominantly localized to the post-nuclear fraction although a faint band was present in the nuclear fraction (compare lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, in the presence of Myc&#x02013;PRH, endogenous TLE was strongly present in the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, compare lanes 3 and 4). The blot was stripped and reprobed with the Myc-antibody to detect Myc&#x02013;PRH. Myc&#x02013;PRH was present in both the post-nuclear and nuclear fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, lanes 3 and 4 lower panel). We conclude that PRH increases the nuclear retention of TLE proteins. Our previous immunofluoresence experiments with Myc&#x02013;PRH have shown that PRH is present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This is in agreement with the fractionation experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. However PRH localization in the presence of TLE appears strongly nuclear in the immunofluorescence experiments shown above. This suggests that co-expression of PRH with TLE has an influence on the localization of PRH and vice versa.</p><p>TLE runs as a doublet on SDS/PAGE due to phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The upper TLE band in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>(C) (lane 4) very probably corresponds to hyperphosphorylated TLE, and expression of PRH brings about an increase in the intensity of this band suggesting that PRH induces TLE phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, compare lane 1 with lane 4). To establish that the TLE proteins of retarded mobility correspond to TLE phosphoproteins induced by PRH expression, we incubated K562 nuclear extracts transfected with Myc&#x02013;PRH with CIP. There is a predominance of the TLE band of retarded mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lanes 1 and 2) after incubation at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C or 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in the presence of a cocktail of phosphatase inhibitors. Incubation of nuclear extracts with CIP in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors resulted in a decrease in the intensity of this upper band and an increase in intensity of the lower TLE band (lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, incubation of the extracts with CIP in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors does not lead to a change in the TLE band (lane 5). These results show that the TLE band of reduced mobility observed in the presence of Myc&#x02013;PRH corresponds to phosphorylated TLE.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutations in the PRH homeodomain block nuclear relocalization of TLE</title><p>To investigate whether the DNA-binding and nuclear-localization activities of PRH are required for the relocalization of TLE proteins we designed two mutations in the Myc&#x02013;PRH protein: PRH N187A and PRH R188A,R189A. These mutations lie in the homeodomain of the PRH protein and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>(A). The N187A mutation is predicted to significantly reduce the DNA-binding activity of PRH since we have shown previously that mutation of asparagine to alanine at the equivalent position in the highly conserved avian PRH homeodomain prevents DNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].

A plasmid expressing Myc&#x02013;PRH F32E was produced in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The PRH F32E mutation was designed to inhibit the binding of PRH to TLE1.

The mutant protein shows a slightly retarded mobility compared with wild-type PRH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, bottom panel).

The reason for this apparent change in mobility is not known at present. We confirmed that the nuclear localization of the PRH F32E was not altered compared with wild-type PRH, using immunostaining experiments and confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, middle panel).

PRH and the PRH N187A and PRH R188A,R189A mutants all co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged TLE, whereas PRH F32E failed to co-immunoprecipitate TLE (bottom panel). These results demonstrate that the F32E mutation in the PRH Eh-1 domain prevents the interaction of PRH and TLE in cells. In this experiment the PRH N187A appears to immunoprecipitate much more TLE than the corresponding wild-type PRH protein, which may reflect an increased binding affinity between PRH N187A and TLE proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Repression by PRH requires retention of TLE proteins in the nuclear fraction</title><p>In order to study the transcription repression properties of these mutated PRH proteins, a reporter plasmid carrying the luciferase gene under the control of the TK promoter and five PRH-binding sites was transiently transfected into K562 cells with vectors expressing PRH or the PRH mutants. In addition, all cells were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing &#x003b2;-galactosidase to act as a control for transient transfection efficiency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>(A) shows that although PRH represses reporter activity to approx. 30% of the unrepressed level, the DNA-binding-deficient mutants PRH N187A and PRH R188A,R189A showed little or no repression activity. In this assay PRH F32E was a very poor repressor and had no more repression activity than the DNA-binding-defective protein PRH N187A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, column 6). PRH is able to repress transcription by several mechanisms, including binding to the TATA box, and we have shown previously that at high expression levels PRH F32E has some ability to repress transcription, presumably via binding to the TATA box or because of residual binding to TLE. In the present study we have directly compared the repression activity of PRH F32E with that of wild-type PRH, and Western blot analysis confirmed that in this assay the proteins were expressed at equivalent levels in the transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). We have demonstrated that PRH F32E does not influence the retention of TLE proteins in the nucleus and that this protein can bind to DNA such as wild-type PRH. We conclude that the direct interaction between PRH and TLE is essential for the enhanced nuclear retention of TLE proteins brought about by PRH and plays an important role in transcriptional repression by PRH.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>PRH N187A is trans-dominant over PRH in transcription repression assays</title><p>The histograms show the relative promoter activity found in K562 cell extracts 24&#x000a0;h after transient co-transfection with a reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene under the control of the TK promoter and five PRH-binding sites (pTK&#x02013;PRH), a &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression plasmid (pSV-lacZ) and PRH expression vectors.

In order to further dissect the mechanisms whereby PRH represses transcription, we next examined whether any of these mutant PRH proteins would have a trans-dominant-negative activity over transcriptional repression by wild-type PRH. The pTK&#x02013;PRH reporter plasmid described above was transfected into K562 cells with plasmids expressing wild-type PRH and increasing amounts of each of the plasmids expressing mutant PRH proteins. As before, all cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing &#x003b2;-galactosidase to control for transfection efficiency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>(B) shows that, as expected, PRH repressed transcription to approx. 40% of unrepressed promoter activity (lane 2). Increasing amounts of PRH N187A (lanes 3&#x02013;5), PRH F32E (lanes 9&#x02013;11) or PRH R188A,R189A (lanes 15&#x02013;17) did not result in transcriptional repression (as shown previously in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A); however, co-expression of PRH with increasing amounts of PRH N187A resulted in a significant decrease in repression by PRH (lanes 6&#x02013;8) and at a 2:1 ratio of PRH N187/PRH there was almost a complete loss of repression. In contrast, co-expression of PRH with increasing amounts of PRH F32E (lanes 12&#x02013;14) or PRH R188A,R189A (lanes 18&#x02013;20) did not alter the repression activity of PRH. Thus these results demonstrate that PRH N187A has a trans-dominant-negative activity over wild-type PRH for transcriptional repression.</p><p>To investigate the mechanism of this trans-dominant inhibition of PRH repression activity we used site-directed mutagenesis to make two PRH expression plasmids that carried either a combination of the F32E and N187A mutations or the F32E and R188A,R189A mutations. K562 cells were transfected with the reporter plasmid, the PRH expression vector and increasing amounts of plasmids expressing these double mutants. Western blot analysis confirmed that the double mutants were expressed at equivalent levels to wild-type PRH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>(D) shows that PRH repressed transcription to approx. 30% of unrepressed promoter activity (lane 2) and that increasing amounts of PRH F32E,N187A (lanes 3&#x02013;5) or PRH F32E,R188A,R189A (lanes 9&#x02013;11) did not result in transcriptional repression. Co-expression of PRH with increasing amounts of PRH F32E,N187A (lanes 6&#x02013;8) or PRH F32E,R188A,R189A (lanes 12&#x02013;14) did not result in a decrease in repression activity. Since PRH N187A has trans-dominant negative activity but PRH F32E,N187A does not, we infer that titration of TLE is essential for the trans-dominant-negative activity of PRH N187A.</p><p>We have previously shown that Myc&#x02013;PRH expression is cytoplasmic and diffuse nuclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and that the accumulation of this protein in nuclear foci is apparent at lower levels of expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. We have also shown that co-expression of PRH with FLAG&#x02013;TLE1 protein results in their co-localization. Both proteins show diffuse nuclear staining but, in addition, there is co-localization in subnuclear foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To determine whether the trans-dominant-negative protein PRH N187A is able to sequester TLE proteins away from wild-type PRH and into a particular subnuclear compartment we expressed FLAG&#x02013;TLE1 protein in K562 cells. The FLAG&#x02013;TLE protein showed a diffuse nuclear staining pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). We also expressed each of the Myc&#x02013;PRH proteins in K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B) and these proteins also showed diffuse nuclear staining. Interestingly, the co-expression of Myc&#x02013;PRH N187A and FLAG&#x02013;TLE1 showed strong co-localization of the two proteins in subnuclear foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E) in immunofluorescent staining experiments (large yellow dots). In contrast, the co-expression of TRITC-labelled Myc&#x02013;PRH (wild-type) or Myc&#x02013;PRH F32E with FLAG&#x02013;TLE1 resulted in co-localization in the nucleus in a predominantly diffuse nuclear staining pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E). We conclude that the subnuclear localization of PRH N187A and TLE1 are altered when the proteins are co-expressed. Thus the interaction of PRH N187A with TLE results in the sequestration of TLE in a subnuclear compartment that is not the same as the subnuclear compartment occupied by wild-type PRH and TLE1. We infer that the inability of PRH to bind to DNA prevents PRH N187A from taking TLE1 to the DNA/chromatin or alternatively prevents TLE1 from taking PRHN187A to the DNA/chromatin. In any event we conclude that sequestration of TLE proteins to a different subnuclear localization is involved in the trans-dominant-negative activity of this protein.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>PRH is a transcriptional repressor protein that plays important roles in the regulation of several cellular processes including haematopoiesis. PRH is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of haematopoietic cells from myeloid lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Aberrant expression of PRH or loss of nuclear localization of PRH contributes to leukaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. K562 cells are blast cells that can spontaneously differentiate along myeloid and erythroid lineages. In the main, these cells contain a very large nucleus and relatively little cytoplasm. Immunofluorescent staining of PRH and TLE proteins in these cells has shown that PRH and TLE can be present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We have used biochemical fractionation to examine the nuclear retention of TLE proteins. We have shown that endogenous nuclear TLE proteins are not tightly bound in the nuclei of K562 cells and fractionate into the post-nuclear fraction; however, in the presence of exogenous PRH, endogenous TLE proteins become strongly retained in the nuclear fraction. In other cell types the Hes1 and Runx-1 repressor proteins have been shown to bind to TLE and increase the nuclear retention of TLE by increasing the association of TLE with chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Further experiments are required to establish whether the mechanism of nuclear retention of TLE in the presence of PRH is similar to that effected by Hes1 and involves chromatin association of TLE proteins or other subnuclear compartments such as the nuclear matrix.</p><p>The mutation of asparagine to alanine (N187A) in the DNA recognition helix of the PRH homeodomain and mutation of adjacent arginine residues (R188A,R189A) results in proteins that are unable to bind to DNA. These mutants are both unable to influence the nuclear retention of TLE proteins, although they are able to bind to TLE. In fractionation studies both PRH N187A and PRH R188A,R189A show both post-nuclear and nuclear distribution. PRH N187A acts as a trans-dominant-negative protein in repression assays with wild-type PRH. In contrast, PRH R188A,R189A does not act as a trans-dominant-negative protein. In the present study we have shown that PRH N187A and TLE co-localize in subnuclear foci, whereas PRH R188A,R189A and TLE do not co-localize in these foci. Presumably this difference accounts for the trans-dominant repression activity of PRH N187A; however the difference in the ability of these proteins to have trans-dominant activity over wild-type PRH may be because PRH N187A has a higher affinity for TLE or because the PRH R188A,R189A has a subtle defect in nuclear retention. It is also possible that the higher affinity of PRH N187A for TLE and/or the subtle defect of PRH R188A,R189A in nuclear retention are responsible for the difference in subnuclear localization. Finally we cannot rule out the possibility that sequestration of TLE is not wholly responsible for the trans-dominant-negative activity of PRH N187A. PRH is known to form oligomers and it may be that PRH N187A, but not the PRH R188A,R189A mutant, is able to form hetero-oligomers with wild-type PRH and thereby block repression. Interestingly, it is clear that in complete contrast with previous reports, PRH R188A,R189A is able to enter the nucleus of K562 cells, suggesting that this mutation does not strongly affect the nuclear localization of PRH in these cells although this mutation does inhibit the nuclear localization of PRH in NIH 3T3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. One reason for this discrepancy could be that K562-cell-specific proteins might aid the nuclear import of this mutant.</p><p>As might be expected, a mutation in the Eh1 motif (F32E) located within the N-terminal domain of PRH reduces binding to TLE and blocks nuclear retention of TLE. Thus the retention of TLE proteins within the nucleus requires two properties of the PRH protein: a direct protein&#x02013;protein interaction between PRH and TLE and DNA binding by PRH. Neither DNA binding alone, nor TLE binding alone by PRH is sufficient for nuclear retention of TLE or in fact for transcriptional repression by PRH. Presumably the nuclear retention of TLE proteins is necessary for transcriptional repression by PRH. We have reported previously that although PRH F32E is defective in binding to TLE and defective in repression compared with wild-type PRH, it retains some repression activity when expressed at high levels. We suggest that this is because the mutant is not completely unable to bind TLE and retains weak TLE-binding activity which may become apparent at very high expression levels.</p><p>Since a defect in binding TLE blocks repression as effectively as a defect in DNA binding, we conclude that most of the PRH-dependent repression observed at the pTK&#x02013;PRH promoter is TLE-dependent; however, it is possible that mutation of the Eh-1 domain might also affect the conformation of the PRH protein and hence also decrease the interaction of PRH with other PRH-interacting proteins. The trans-dominant-negative activity of the DNA-binding mutant PRH N187A together with the loss of this trans-dominant-negative activity in the PRH F32E,N187A double mutant (cannot bind to DNA and TLE) reinforces the idea that transcriptional repression is very sensitive to the availability of TLE. PRH N187A may prove to be a useful tool for understanding the direct and indirect transcriptional activities of PRH. Clearly the ability of PRH N187A to act as a trans-dominant negative for PRH repression activity occurs through a very different mechanism from that inferred for the trans-dominant-negative activity of a Nup&#x02013;Hex/PRH fusion protein identified recently in a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia. In the Nup&#x02013;Hex/PRH fusion protein, the N-terminus of the nucleoporin protein Nup98 is fused in-frame with the homeodomain and C-terminus of PRH. In this case the N-terminus (TLE-binding region) of PRH is absent in the fusion protein and it is thought that the trans-dominant-negative function of Nup&#x02013;Hex/PRH derives from the ability of the fusion protein to compete with PRH for PRH-binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The experiments outlined above demonstrate that there is more than one way to block PRH repression activity and suggest that acute myeloid leukaemic patients might harbour a variety of PRH mutations.</p><p>We have shown in the present study that PRH directly affects nuclear retention of TLE and presumably, as a consequence, availability of TLE in discrete subnuclear domains. Thus it is very likely that TLE-dependent genes may be equally sensitive to PRH levels. Further work is required to determine whether alterations in PRH expression impact on the plethora of TLE-repressed genes that do not appear to contain binding sites for PRH. Our studies have shown that PRH can influence the amount of available TLE proteins in the nucleus; however, it is not known whether binding of TLE to PRH results in PRH sequestering TLE away from other transcription factors in the nucleus or whether PRH simply increases the amount of free TLE proteins in the nucleus. The Wnt signalling pathway functions in haematopoietic progenitors to promote self renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. TLE proteins are important antagonists for Wnt signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The Notch signalling pathway also functions in haematopoietic progenitors to inhibit differentiation along myeloid lineages and thereby increase the amount of undifferentiated progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. TLE proteins mediate the Notch signalling pathway and thereby promote the inhibition of differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Thus an increase in available TLE in the nucleus might be expected to inhibit self renewal and decrease differentiation. Interestingly PRH functions as an inhibitor of cell proliferation in early haematopoietic progenitors and in differentiated myeloid cells. Although the effect of PRH on cell proliferation has been shown to be through the regulatory effect of PRH on the translation factor eIF-4E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the anti-proliferative effects of PRH could also be a consequence of PRH altering the amount of available nuclear TLE.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Professor Stefano Stifani (Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) for useful discussions.</p></ack><sec sec-type="funding"><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust [grant number WT076527]; and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [grant number BB/D005094/1] (to P.-S.
