Here we show that DnaI consists of a C-terminal domain (Cd) with ATPase and DNA-binding activities and an N-terminal domain (Nd) that interacts with the replicative ring helicase. A Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding module mediates the interaction with the helicase and C67, C70 and H84 are involved in the coordination of the Zn<sup>2+</sup>. DnaI binds ATP and exhibits ATPase activity that is not stimulated by ssDNA, because the DNA-binding site on Cd is masked by Nd. The ATPase activity resides on the Cd domain and when detached from the Nd domain, it becomes sensitive to stimulation by ssDNA because its cryptic DNA-binding site is exposed. Therefore, Nd acts as a molecular &#x02018;switch&#x02019; regulating access to the ssDNA binding site on Cd, in response to binding of the helicase. DnaI is sufficient to load the replicative helicase from a complex with six DnaI molecules, so there is no requirement for a dual helicase loader system.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Bacterial chromosome replication initiates at an origin (<italic>oriC</italic>) where the ubiquitous origin recognition protein DnaA binds to begin the recruitment of the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The initial step of this process involves the coordinated assembly of a primosome to load the main replicative ring helicase and then recruit the primase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Successful assembly of the primosome allows the synthesis of primers and recruitment of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme for elongation to begin. Occasionally replication forks collapse and different restart mechanisms reassemble the replisome at sites other than <italic>oriC</italic>, depending on the structure of the arrested fork. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> the PriA/PriB/DnaT dependent mechanism restarts the replisome when a 3&#x02032; end is available whilst the PriC-dependent mechanism is involved when there is a single-strand gap at the fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> loading of the ring helicase DnaC (homologue of <italic>E.coli</italic> DnaB, 44% identity) is achieved by the action of three primosomal proteins DnaD, DnaB (not to be confused with the <italic>E.coli</italic> DnaB helicase) and DnaI, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). DnaI is homologous to <italic>E.coli</italic> DnaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), the helicase loader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>); it is not to be confused with the <italic>B.subtilis</italic> DnaC helicase. There are no homologues of DnaD and DnaB in <italic>E.coli</italic> but homologues of both proteins, as well as DnaI, are found in low G+C Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). DnaI interacts with DnaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and together with DnaB loads DnaC onto DNA in a DnaD-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). The precise molecular events that underpin the function of the DnaD-DnaB-DnaI primosomal cascade are not clear but data suggest that DnaD acts early, setting the stage for the recruitment of the DnaI&#x02013;DnaC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), while DnaB may be acting together with DnaI to form a pair of helicase loaders for the recruitment of DnaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Alternatively, DnaB may act as a membrane attachment protein to regulate initiation of DNA replication by regulating the recruitment of DnaD to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). DnaD interacts with DnaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), PriA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>) and DnaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), disrupts the helicase&#x02013;DnaI complex and exhibits a DNA architectural activity similar to the histone-like <italic>E.coli</italic> HU proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). DnaB also exhibits a DNA remodelling activity that counteracts that observed for DnaD and the two proteins have been proposed to link nucleoid reorganization and initiation of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p><italic>B.subtilis</italic> DnaI interacts functionally with the <italic>Bacillus stearothermophilus</italic> DnaB helicase (referred to as stearoDnaB to distinguish it from <italic>B.subtilis</italic> DnaB), altering its ATPase activity profile and stimulating its helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). StearoDnaB is highly homologous to the <italic>B.subtilis</italic> DnaC helicase (82% identity and 92% similarity) and is expressed in soluble form in <italic>E.coli</italic>. In the absence of DNA it forms a stable complex with DnaI with an apparent stoichiometry of stearoDnaB<sub>6</sub>-DnaI<sub>1 or 2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). By comparison, <italic>B.subtilis</italic> DnaC is expressed in insoluble form in <italic>E.coli</italic> but forms a soluble complex with DnaI, with apparent stoichiometry DnaC<sub>6</sub>-DnaI<sub>6</sub> when the two proteins are co-expressed and purified in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Purified DnaC and DnaI proteins do not re-associate to form a homogeneous DnaC<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;DnaI<sub>6</sub> complex at low &#x003bc;M concentrations even in the presence of ATP, but form instead a variety of complexes with wide ranging stoichiometries at 15 &#x003bc;M in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>Structural information about bacterial helicase loaders is lacking and apart from the presence of Walker A and B motifs, nothing is known about the biochemical properties of DnaI. Here we report that DnaI is a two-domain protein with a 21 kDa C-terminal domain (Cd) that binds DNA and hydrolyses ATP, and a 16 kDa Zn<sup>2+</sup>-containing N-terminal domain (Nd) that interacts with the replicative helicase. The Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding module mediates the interaction with the helicase, with the C67, C70 and H84 residues involved in the coordination of the Zn<sup>2+</sup>. The fourth Zn<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating residue is either C76 or C101. DnaI binds MANT-ATP with 1:1 stoichiometry and exhibits ATPase activity under conditions of excess of enzyme over ATP. Our data suggest that Nd masks a cryptic DNA-binding activity that resides on Cd. Therefore, Nd acts as a molecular switch modulated by the binding of the helicase. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies show, that in the presence of ATP, DnaI alone is sufficient to efficiently load the helicase at the 5&#x02032; end of immobilized ssDNA, and that only the stearoDnaB<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;DnaI<sub>6</sub> complex is capable of being loaded. DnaI then dissociates rapidly, followed by much slower dissociation of the helicase. We therefore propose a model for the DnaI-mediated helicase loading in <italic>B.subtilis</italic> that does not require a dual helicase-loader system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Limited proteolysis</title><p>Limited proteolysis was carried out with subtilisin (1:5000 subtilisin : DnaI molar ratio) at 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 10% v/v glycerol at 37&#x000b0;C.

Samples were removed at time intervals (0&#x02013;120 min) and reactions were terminated with the addition of 20 mM EDTA. Small samples (1.2 &#x003bc;l) were spotted onto TLC plates that were then developed in 1 M formic acid, 0.5 M LiCl<sub>2</sub> and analysed using a phosphorimager. The percentage conversion of ATP to Pi was used to determine the increase of [Pi] with time.</p></sec><sec><title>SPR experiments</title><p>Experiments were carried out at 20&#x000b0;C in a BIAcore 2000 at 5 &#x003bc;l/min with HBSEP buffer (Biacore) supplemented with 1 mM DTT as running buffer, essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). A solution (100 nM) of 3&#x02032;-biotinylated (dT)<sub>35</sub> in running buffer was injected over a streptavidin-coated chip surface (Biacore SA chip) to yield an increase of 300 RU (1 min) on one flow cell. Another flow cell was unmodified and served as a control. The binding buffer was HBSP (Biacore) supplemented with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 2.7 mM ATP. When required to remove tightly-bound proteins, regeneration of the flow cells was achieved with 1 min injection of 50 mM NaOH/1 M NaCl. StearoDnaB, DnaI and Nd were diluted in binding buffer and injected in combinations or individually during 1 or 2 min, followed by dissociation in running buffer. The binding buffer was selected because it gave the strongest binding of stearoDnaB-DnaI onto ssDNA. Use of the running buffer (without Mg<sup>2+</sup>/ATP and with 3 mM EDTA) during the dissociation phase resulted in a fast dissociation of DnaI from the loaded complex, allowing the observation of the subsequent slow dissociation of stearoDnaB from the ssDNA. When the binding buffer was used throughout, the same biphasic dissociation was observed, but with a slower DnaI dissociation phase, making it difficult to determine the stoichiometry of the complex.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>DnaI is a two-domain protein</title><p>DnaI was sensitive to subtilisin and a cleavage site was identified by N-terminal protein sequencing (data not shown).

StearoDnaB eluted at &#x0223c;9.8 ml and DnaI at 14.5 ml. The precise elution volume depends on the actual gel matrix and the size of the particular column, but the resolution power of the Superdex S200 column is not sufficient to clearly separate complexes above 200 kDa in size. However, the clear shift of some DnaI into the earlier peak in the presence of stearoDnaB indicates the formation of a complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). An interaction between Nd and stearoDnaB could also be detected by gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). While Nd eluted at &#x0223c;18.2 ml in the presence of stearoDnaB some Nd appeared in the earlier peak indicating the formation of a complex. The interactions of DnaI and Nd with stearoDnaB were also verified by yeast two hybrid experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By comparison, Cd exhibited a very weak interaction in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>) and no complexes with stearoDnaB or Nd were detected by gel filtration (data not shown). These data were confirmed with quantitative ONPG assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Several yeast clones carrying Cd were tested and although none exhibited significant DnaB-interactions, weak signals just above the background were detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DnaI binds Zn<sup>2+</sup></title><p>The C67, C70, C76, H84 and C101 residues in Nd are part of the sequence CX<sub>2</sub>CX<sub>5</sub>CX<sub>7</sub>HX<sub>16</sub>C that could potentially coordinate Zn<sup>2+</sup>. The Zn<sup>2+</sup> contents of DnaI and Nd were investigated by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Four different DnaI preparations, at different concentrations (2.8 and 4.2 &#x003bc;M) were used using standard solutions of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and the presence of the metal was confirmed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The Zn<sup>2+</sup> molar contents were measured at 1:1 and 1:1.6 relative to the protein. Similar experiments were carried out with Nd but our initial data revealed that it contained less Zn<sup>2+</sup> than expected, estimated at 1:25.3 relative to the protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). One explanation for the poor Zn<sup>2+</sup> content of Nd could be that the Ni<sup>2+</sup> column used in our first purification step of the His-tagged Nd may have competed off the Zn<sup>2+</sup>. We investigated this using a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-loaded column and a preparation of Nd purified in this manner was assayed for Zn<sup>2+</sup>. The data confirmed the presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> in 1:1 molar ratio (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The involvement of cysteines in Zn<sup>2+</sup> coordination was established directly using the PAR assay (Supplementary Figure S2). The gradual increase of the absorbance at 500 nm, as <italic>p</italic>-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid was titrated into a solution of DnaI and PAR, indicated the release of Zn<sup>2+</sup> from cysteines and the formation of the PAR&#x02013;Zn<sup>2+</sup> complex. Subsequent titration of increasing concentrations of EDTA resulted in decreasing absorbance indicating the release of Zn<sup>2+</sup> from PAR and its chelation by EDTA.</p></sec><sec><title>A Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding module mediates the interaction with the helicase</title><p>The C67A, C70A, C76A, H84A and C101A mutants of DnaI were constructed to identify the residues involved in metal coordination. Mutant proteins, when expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> were partially soluble (&#x0223c;30% soluble; data not shown) and were purified in good quantities for biochemical investigations. Atomic absorption experiments revealed that the C67A, C70A and H84A mutants contained no Zn<sup>2+</sup>, whereas C76A still bound Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The C101A mutant gave mixed results. In one preparation Zn<sup>2+</sup> was undetectable but in another Zn<sup>2+</sup> was detected. We conclude that residues C67, C70 and H84 are involved in Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding whereas C76 is not. The status of C101 could not be confirmed unequivocally (see Discussion for an explanation). Notably, all the mutant proteins were partially soluble after sonication of the cells only in the presence of 50 mM glutamate and 50 mM arginine, indicating that these mutations alter somewhat the solubility properties of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). This is not the result of misfolding as the CD spectra of all mutant proteins were identical to the wtDnaI, indicating similar overall folds (Supplementary Figure S3). In addition, all the mutant proteins eluted at the same point as the wtDnaI through the Superdex S200 gel filtration column indicating proper globular folding.</p><p>An intriguing possibility was the involvement of the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding module in interaction with the helicase. This was examined directly using analytical gel filtration. Mutant DnaI proteins were mixed with stearoDnaB in 1:1 molar ratio and the mixtures were resolved through a Superdex S-200 column. Samples from the peaks were analysed with SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The ability of DnaI to interact with the helicase was dependent upon its ability to bind Zn<sup>2+</sup>. The C67A and H84A mutants did not interact with the helicase, the C70A mutant exhibited very weak interaction barely detectable by gel filtration, whereas the C76A and C101A mutants retained their ability to interact. These data are consistent with data obtained from the atomic absorption experiments, where the C67A, C70A and H84A proteins were unable to bind Zn<sup>2+</sup>, whereas the C76A protein was able to bind Zn<sup>2+</sup> and the C101A protein gave mixed results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DnaI binds MANT-ATP in 1:1 stoichiometry</title><p>Binding of ATP to DnaI was investigated by fluorescence using MANT-ATP. The binding stoichiometry was determined using the continuous variation analysis from Job plots and the fitted lines gave an intersection at the stoichiometry 1:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Binding was examined at four different [MANT-ATP] (90, 200, 300 and 500 nM) while the [DnaI] was varied and the fluorescence change was plotted as function of [DnaI], (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

The DnaI ATPase activity was demonstrated by TLC assays under conditions of excess protein over ATP, and was found to be unaffected by ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Since the Walker A and B motifs reside in the Cd domain, its ATPase activity was also examined under the same conditions. Cd exhibited poorer ATPase activity compared to the full-length protein but in the presence of ssDNA, the activity was stimulated to the same level as that of DnaI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). By comparison, Nd exhibited no detectable ATPase activity (data not shown), and the Walker A K174A mutant exhibited reduced ATPase activity (Supplementary Figure S4).</p><p>Under conditions of excess ATP over protein, DnaI failed to fully hydrolyse all the ATP even after 2 h, indicating that the enzyme does not turn over ATP (Supplementary Figure S5). These data imply that once DnaI hydrolyses ATP it is then locked into an inactive ADP-bound conformation. We also observed that at a fixed ATP concentration (50 &#x003bc;M) all DnaI molecules turn over ATP once (0.1 &#x003bc;M DnaI hydrolyses 0.1 &#x003bc;M ATP) but as the concentration of DnaI is increased the relative fraction of DnaI molecules that hydrolyses ATP is decreased (Supplementary Figure S5). For example, 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 &#x003bc;M DnaI hydrolyse 0.7, 2.9, 3.9, 8.8 and 14.4 &#x003bc;M ATP, respectively. This may be because as the DnaI concentration is increased not all DnaI molecules have bound ATP or at high DnaI concentrations there may be some kind of regulatory inhibitory effect by DnaI&#x02013;DnaI interactions or even there may be an ATP-induced oligomer being formed with some DnaI molecules in the oligomer no longer capable of hydrolysing ATP.</p></sec><sec><title>A cryptic DNA-binding site is located on the Cd domain</title><p>The ssDNA-induced stimulation of Cd ATPase activity implies that this domain binds ssDNA. By comparison, the lack of stimulation of the full-length DnaI in the presence of ssDNA implies that either it does not bind ssDNA or ssDNA binding does not confer the conformational changes required for ATPase stimulation. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the DNA-binding ability of DnaI with single-strand and fork-DNA substrates using gel shift assays was examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Under our experimental conditions in the range 0.25&#x02013;28 &#x003bc;M DnaI-binding to a single-strand 50mer oligonucleotide was undetectable whereas weak binding to fork-substrates was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Binding to ssDNA could only be detected at concentrations higher than 0.9 mM DnaI (data not shown). DnaI exhibited weak binding to 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-tailed DNA substrates (data not shown). The presence of ADPNP or ATP had no effect on DNA binding. Thus, the lack of stimulation of DnaI ATPase activity is a reflection of its inability to bind ssDNA. Instead it exhibits a preference for ss-dsDNA junctions but binding is still weak.</p><p>Similar analysis of Cd revealed that it binds to ssDNA and to fork-substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), confirming that the observed stimulation of its ATPase activity is the result of its interaction with ssDNA. The presence of ADPNP or ATP resulted in a marginal decrease of DNA binding. Therefore in the full-length protein, the Nd domain &#x02018;masks&#x02019; the DNA-binding site on the Cd domain. This cryptic DNA-binding site has been revealed upon Cd detachment from Nd.</p></sec><sec><title>The DnaI&#x02013;stearoDnaB complex binds ssDNA in the presence of ADPNP</title><p>Although DnaI binds to stearoDnaB, the stability of the complex is not affected by ADPNP in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). In the presence of 1 mM ADPNP stearoDnaB binds better to ssDNA, as shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), whilst in the presence of 8 &#x003bc;M DnaI and increasing concentrations of stearoDnaB (0.25&#x02013;28 &#x003bc;M) a super-shifted band was detected representing binding of the DnaI&#x02013;stearoDnaB complex to DNA (compare left and right segments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). DnaI does not bind to ssDNA as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. In the absence of ADPNP no super-shifted complex was observed (compare left and right segments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In the presence of 1 mM ATP the super-shifted band disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). More efficient loading was observed at higher DnaI:stearoDnaB molar ratios, 32:1, 16:1, 8:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, lanes 1&#x02013;3 right segment) compared to lower molar ratios 4:1, 2:1, 1:1 (lanes 4&#x02013;6), indicating that under these experimental conditions excess of DnaI is required to ensure formation of a stable loading complex. These data indicate that binding of the DnaI&#x02013;stearoDnaB complex to ssDNA is stimulated by ATP-binding and ATP hydrolysis facilitates the dissociation of the complex leaving the helicase on the DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>DnaI is required for efficient loading of stearoDnaB onto ssDNA</title><p>An assay for DnaI-mediated loading of stearoDnaB onto ssDNA using SPR (BIAcore) was devised in a similar manner to that described for the interaction between the C-domain of <italic>E.coli</italic> DnaG and <italic>E.coli</italic> DnaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). A 3&#x02032;-biotinylated (dT)<sub>35</sub> was first loaded onto a streptavidin chip, exposing the 5&#x02032; end. Then either stearoDnaB alone or a mixture of stearoDnaB and DnaI were injected, in the presence of Mg-ATP. No interaction of 175 nM stearoDnaB or 1.75 &#x003bc;M DnaI, alone with DNA was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; red and light blue). Binding was detected when the two proteins were combined, and the response depended on the concentration of DnaI. Therefore, formation of a complex of DnaI with stearoDnaB is necessary for helicase loading onto ssDNA. The response consistently decreased by 40% over 2 min to a stable value regardless of [DnaI]. The simplest explanation for this behaviour is that the stearoDnaB&#x02013;DnaI complex first loads, and then one of the components dissociates. We proceeded to discover which component dissociates from the ternary complex.</p></sec><sec><title>DnaI dissociates after the helicase is loaded onto ssDNA</title><p>The ternary complex was formed by injection of a mixture of stearoDnaB-DnaI (175 nM:1.75 &#x003bc;M). After the fast dissociation phase, the same concentration of DnaI (1.75 &#x003bc;M) alone was injected again and the second binding response indicated re-formation of the ternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>; blue). When stearoDnaB was injected instead, very little binding to ssDNA was observed under these conditions, while no binding was apparent on the same flow cell after stearoDnaB was stripped from the ssDNA (data not shown). Therefore, it is the stearoDnaB that remains stably bound to the DNA after dissociation of DnaI and the ternary complex re-forms upon addition of more DnaI.</p></sec><sec><title>Stoichiometry of the complex loaded onto ssDNA</title><p>The conditions used in this assay permitted visualization of a biphasic dissociation curve with dissociation rates different enough (fast for DnaI, slow for stearoDnaB) to allow extrapolation to zero time of both parts of the response curve to obtain quantitative measures of the amount of stearoDnaB-DnaI loaded and of stearoDnaB remaining after dissociation of DnaI. Determination of the ratio of bound stearoDnaB to total complex loaded showed that for every ratio of components used to generate the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, the mass ratio was close to 0.6. This corresponds closely to the ratio of masses of the proteins, indicating strict 1:1 stoichiometry of helicase and DnaI in the loaded complex. The high response compared to the ssDNA that is available on the chip, and the well-established properties of hexameric helicases, suggests that it is the hexameric form of the helicase that is loaded, and therefore the only species in the mixture capable of being productively loaded onto the exposed 5&#x02032; end of ssDNA was the stearoDnaB<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;DnaI<sub>6</sub> complex. Complexes with fewer than six molecules of DnaI per helicase hexamer are either not formed in the mixtures because of highly cooperative association of DnaI, or if they are, they are not capable of being loaded at the exposed 5&#x02032; end of the ssDNA.</p><p>The stearoDnaB<sub>6</sub>-DnaI<sub>6</sub> stoichiometry implied by SPR is different than the apparent stearoDnaB<sub>6</sub>-DnaI<sub>1 or 2</sub> stoichiometry implied by gel filtration [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>]. The latter was deduced based upon the assumption that all of the available stearoDnaB was in complex with DnaI. If this is not true then the peak of the hexameric stearoDnaB will overlap with the peak from the complex and free stearoDnaB will co-elute with the complex, thus giving an apparent impression of less DnaI in the complex. It is indeed difficult to assess the precise stoichiometry of this complex by gel filtration since the resolution power of Superdex S200 is not enough to separate clearly complexes above 200 kDa in size. Also, there appear to be some variability in the stoichiometry of this complex. For example, <italic>B.subtilis</italic> DnaC and DnaI form mainly a DnaC<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;DnaI<sub>6</sub> complex, when they are co-expressed and co-purified but other complexes with fewer than six DnaI molecules are also apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). When the two proteins are separated and mixed, again they appear to form complexes with fewer than six DnaI molecules per DnaC hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In addition, the effect of DNA on the stoichiometry of the complex has not been assessed and one possibility may be that in the presence of ssDNA the stearoDnaB<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;DnaI<sub>6</sub> complex is more stable.</p><p>Not surprisingly, we have been unable to find conditions where the Nd domain of DnaI is capable of loading stearoDnaB onto ssDNA in these SPR assays. One reason is that it lacks the cryptic DNA-binding region in the Cd domain. Another is that it probably lacks regions in the Cd required for cooperative interactions with the helicase.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>DnaI interacts with the helicase via its Nd domain</title><p>DnaI is the putative helicase loader in <italic>B.subtilis</italic> but the helicase loading mechanism is still unknown. Our data show that DnaI consists of an Nd domain that contains a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding module involved in the interaction with the helicase, and a Cd domain with ATPase and DNA binding activities. However, a very weak interaction between Cd and the helicase was also detected only by yeast two hybrid. Quantification of this weak interaction with six different Cd clones revealed that it is variable. Some clones exhibited slightly better signal than others did, albeit they were all just above the negative control levels. The functional significance of this observation is not clear but it could be argued that a secondary patch that interacts weakly with the helicase resides on Cd. One could speculate that cooperativity in binding of multiple DnaI molecules to the helicase hexamer may also involve protein&#x02013;protein interactions within or between Cd domains. In the analogous <italic>E.coli</italic> DnaC helicase loader, a single point mutation near the N-terminus also abolished binding to the helicase whilst retaining its ability to bind ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DnaI has a cryptic DNA-binding site on its Cd domain</title><p>We were unable to detect significant binding of DnaI to ssDNA even at high concentrations in the presence or absence of ADPNP, suggesting that the native protein does not bind ssDNA. Weak binding to fork and tail (5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032;) DNA substrates was detected indicating a slight preference for ds-ssDNA junctions. The weak nature of this interaction makes its biological significance uncertain. Cd exhibited DNA-binding activity. The simplest interpretation of these data is that the Nd domain masks the DNA-binding site located on Cd. Nd acts as a &#x02018;molecular switch&#x02019; that regulates the availability of the DNA-binding site. In the native protein, this site is buried but when the helicase binds to Nd a conformational change reveals the cryptic DNA-binding site. The helicase-loader can now deliver the helicase to the DNA but it can do so only when bound to ATP. This is consistent with the inability of the stearoDnaB&#x02013;DnaI complex to produce a super-shifted complex on ssDNA in the absence of the ATP analogue ADPNP. Having eliminated misfolding problems, the partial insolubility of Cd is likely to indicate that certain hydrophobic patches on its surface are protected by the presence of Nd in the intact protein and exposed in its absence. It is likely that this allosteric control of domain movement in DnaI is an important functional property regulating helicase loading. Taking into account the combined data, we propose a model for the DnaI-mediated helicase loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). By comparison, the Gram-negative <italic>E.coli</italic> helicase loader DnaC has been reported to exhibit a cryptic ssDNA binding activity only when bound to the helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) and to interact weakly to ssDNA in the absence of the helicase, with ATP strengthening this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). The Cd domain belongs to the AAA family of a diverse group of ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). They often consist of a non-ATPase Nd that acts in substrate recognition (in our case Nd that recognizes the helicase), followed by one or two AAA domains (in our case the Cd domain). This family also belongs to the classic AAA<sup>+</sup> superfamily of chaperone-like ATPases that assist in the assembly and disassembly of protein complexes and the remodelling of protein&#x02013;DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>B.subtilis</italic> DnaI has weak ATPase activity</title><p>Despite the presence of Walker A and B motifs characteristic of ATP-metabolising enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) no ATPase activity has been demonstrated for DnaI. Our data reveal that DnaI binds ATP in a 1:1 stoichiometry and hydrolyses ATP. ATP appears to be essential for the formation of a DnaC<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;DnaI<sub>6</sub> complex when the two proteins are co-expressed and purified from <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) but in its absence complexes of different stoichiometry DnaB<sub>6</sub>-DnaI<sub>1 or 2</sub> also have been observed with the stearoDnaB protein (homologous to <italic>B.subtilis</italic> DnaC). Interestingly, the DnaC<sub>6</sub>&#x02013;DnaI<sub>6</sub> complex cannot be fully reconstituted with purified DnaC and DnaI proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In the <italic>E.coli</italic> DnaC helicase loader, ATP has been reported to be essential for the formation of a stable helicase loader-helicase complex and binds only to one of two DnaC protein conformations that exist prior to nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). ATP-binding induces conformational changes that increase its affinity for the helicase, whilst ADP-binding acts as a negative effector. In a similar manner, ATP-binding may also modulate the DnaI conformation thus increasing its affinity for the helicase <italic>in vivo</italic>, although no such effect has been detected <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, the non-hydrolysable analogue ADPNP is able to promote binding of the helicase loader (DnaI)-helicase (stearoDnaB) complex to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The importance of the ATP-binding site for the conformation of DnaI is highlighted by the effect of the K174A mutation. This mutation affected the solubility of the protein but its CD spectrum and behaviour through gel filtration are identical to wtDnaI, indicating no problems with overall folding. In addition, it retains some ATPase activity suggesting that altering residues in the active site can affect subtly the ATP-binding pocket and ATPase activity. The fact that K174A has reduced ATPase activity compared to wtDnaI indicates that this residue is not directly involved in catalysis, but could be participating along with other residues in ATP-binding. In other ATPases, the effect of mutating the equivalent lysine also appears to have variable consequences. For example, in the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATPase &#x003b2;-subunit, the K to N/E mutation causes only a 3- to 5-fold reduction in ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) and an equivalent mutation in UvrA causes only a 2-fold decrease in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), while the K405S mutation in NS-1 of the minute virus of the mouse (MVM) results in a mutant protein with 87% of the ATPase activity of the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). In the PcrA helicase, the equivalent K37A mutation produces a protein with reduced <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> but tighter <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> retaining reasonable levels of helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Therefore, it is not clear whether the conserved lysine residue of the Walker A motif is involved in nucleotide binding or hydrolysis or in both activities collectively or alternatively in coupling the ATPase reactions with other activities. In contrast, the equivalent K112R mutation in the putative Walker A GKN motif of <italic>E.coli</italic> DnaC produced a soluble protein that was defective in ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). The ATP-binding site in <italic>E.coli</italic> DnaC includes the recognition of many structural elements of the ATP, including the base, ribose, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; phosphate groups and these complex interactions may couple ATP-induced conformational changes to allosteric sites elsewhere in the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). <italic>E.coli</italic> DnaC does not hydrolyse ATP but in the presence of an ATPase-dead DnaB mutant or ssDNA, it turns over ATP at 0.6 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 0.9 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively. Maximal activity of 3.5 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is observed in the presence of both the mutant DnaB and ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Our data indicate that in <italic>B.subtilis</italic>, ATP-binding promotes the association of the helicase loader&#x02013;helicase complex with DNA and the ATPase activity of DnaI is stimulated upon binding to DNA. ATP hydrolysis promotes the dissociation of the complex leaving the helicase bound to the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Therefore, a single helicase-loader (DnaI) is sufficient to load the hexameric helicase onto the DNA and there is no absolute requirement for a dual helicase loader system as has been suggested before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The role of the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding module</title><p>A comparison with DnaI proteins from other species reveals that the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding module is not strictly conserved. <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Listeria</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus</italic> proteins have no obvious Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding residues. <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and <italic>Oceanobacillus iheyensis</italic> proteins have HX<sub>3</sub>HX<sub>4</sub>CX<sub>6</sub>H and CX<sub>2</sub>CX<sub>5</sub>CX<sub>7</sub>S sequences, respectively, that could potentially coordinate Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Even in other <italic>Bacillus</italic> strains, the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding motif is not strictly conserved. For example, the <italic>Bacillus halodurans</italic> protein has the sequence CX<sub>2</sub>CX<sub>5</sub>CX<sub>7</sub>Q that could also coordinate Zn<sup>2+</sup>. The C67, C70 and H84 residues are involved in Zn<sup>2+</sup> coordination but the status of C76 and C101 could not be established unequivocally. A plausible explanation may be that while mutations in the C67, C70 and H84 residues abolish Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding, mutations in the C76 and C101 residues may cause local structural rearrangements, thus allowing C101 to substitute C76 for Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding in the C76A mutant and vice versa. The compromised ability of the C67A, C70A and H84A proteins to interact with the helicase suggest that the role of the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-module is to provide the structural framework for this interaction.
