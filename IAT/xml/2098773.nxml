Previous analyses based on conventional RT-PCR reported the presence of an unspliced c-<italic>fos </italic>transcript in several mammalian systems.

Then, we used a quantitatively rigorous approach based on real-time PCR to provide, for the first time, the actual steady-state copy numbers of the two c-<italic>fos </italic>transcripts.

(ii) Intron 3 confers to c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 an outstanding destabilizing effect of about 6-fold. (iii) Major determinant of c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 steady-state levels in cultured cells is its remarkably high rate of synthesis. (iv) Rapid changes in the synthesis and/or degradation rates of both <italic>c-fos </italic>transcripts in serum-stimulated cells give rise to rapid and transient changes in their relative proportions. Taken as a whole, these findings suggest a co-ordinated fine-tune of the two <italic>c-fos </italic>transcript species, supporting the notion that the alternative processing of the precursor mRNA might be physiologically relevant. Moreover, we detected a c-Fos immunoreactive species corresponding in mobility to the predicted truncated variant.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Activator protein-1 (AP-1) is a dimeric transcription factor regulating major physiological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, neoplastic transformation, apoptosis, and response to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Main AP-1 components in mammals are members of the Fos and Jun protein families. The Fos family includes the products of the c-<italic>fos </italic>(the cellular counterpart of oncogene v-<italic>fos</italic>), <italic>fosB</italic>, <italic>fra-1 </italic>and <italic>fra-2 </italic>genes. Fos proteins associate with Jun, but also with other basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) proteins to create a variety of AP-1 complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The expression of c-<italic>fos </italic>is subjected to a tight regulation at multiple levels. The c-<italic>fos </italic>gene undergoes rapid and transient transcriptional activation in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Both c-<italic>fos </italic>mRNA and protein turn over with short half-lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Additionally, when the c-Fos protein is over-synthesized, the c-<italic>fos </italic>gene is transcriptionally repressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Alternative splicing is a widespread mechanism of gene expression regulation. The typical form of this regulation results from tissue- or temporal-specific splicing events that lead to the synthesis of either productive (protein-coding) or non-productive (no protein- coding) RNAs. Regarding transcription factors, alternative splicing preferentially adds or deletes domains that are important for their architectures and functions ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and references herein). The production of multiple isoforms is a common strategy for regulating the activity of genes within the Fos family (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). A particularly instructive example is the differential splicing of the <italic>fosB </italic>transcript, which generates two mRNAs that encode proteins with antagonistic activities. Briefly, alternative splicing removes codons 238&#x02013;284 and causes a shift in the reading frame that places a stop codon following the bZIP region. The truncated protein (referred to as &#x00394;FosB), missing the C-terminal 101 aa of FosB, functions as a trans-negative regulator of transcriptional activation and transformation, presumably by competing with the full-length Fos protein in the dimerization with Jun and binding to DNA steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Previous analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] based on RT of total RNA followed by conventional PCR have reported the presence of a transcript isoform (hereinafter referred to as c-<italic>fos</italic>-2) in several mammalian systems: (i) rat brain following kainic acid treatment, (ii) primary cortical culture of mouse brain treated with lipopolysaccharide, (iii) cartilage from newborn mouse, and (iv) mouse and human cultured stromal cells. Compared to the well-defined knowledge on the alternative splicing of <italic>fosB</italic>, the physiological relevance of c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 transcript in regulating c-<italic>fos </italic>expression has not been well addressed.</p><p>The work described herein aimed to gain further insights into the functional significance of the alternative splicing of c-<italic>fos</italic>. To this end, we first undertook a systematic and meticulous quantitation of the real copy numbers of c-<italic>fos </italic>transcript variants by means of a real-time PCR methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We tested how the organ context, gestational age, synthesis and turnover rates, and serum stimulation of quiescent cells modulate the absolute expression profiles of the investigated c-<italic>fos </italic>transcripts. The translation of these transcripts predicts the synthesis of a truncated c-Fos protein, in addition to the canonical full-length counterpart. From cultured cells we partially purified a c-Fos immunoreactive species corresponding in mobility to the predicted truncated species.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Alternative splicing variants of c-<italic>fos </italic>messenger</title><p>Differential pre-mRNA splicing is an important mode of regulating the steady-state abundance of a specific mRNA. Based on the known structure of c-<italic>fos </italic>gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), a set of primers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) was designed to investigate the occurrence of any splicing variant that might be derived from the primary c-<italic>fos </italic>transcript. Gene <italic>fosB </italic>was included for comparison. Primer pairs E1U-E2L and E2U-E3L (located in exons 1 and 2 and in exons 2 and 3, respectively) generated single RT-PCR amplicons of expected sizes and sequences after regular splicing of introns 1 and 2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). However, the primer pair E3U-E4L revealed the presence of two transcript populations: while the shorter amplicon (141 nt) corresponded to the canonical spliced form of c-<italic>fos </italic>message, the larger amplicon (258 nt) retained the 117 nt of intron 3. These data confirmed that intron 3 is not always spliced from the primary c-<italic>fos </italic>transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. To quantitate this second transcript species, an additional primer pair (E3U-I3L) was designed. As expected, these primers gave a unique RT-PCR product of the predicted size (120 nt) and sequence.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>RT-PCR amplicons from c-fos and fosB transcripts</bold>.

Forty cycles of PCR were performed as detailed [16]. Genomic DNA was further amplified by the E1U-E2L primer pair to exclude the possibility that our PCR conditions were not optimal for the amplification of the longest theoretical fragment, i.e. the 933 nt amplicon that should be observed if intron 1 remained unspliced in the c-<italic>fos </italic>transcript population [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>].

In the adult organs examined, the canonical spliced c-<italic>fos </italic>mRNA displayed high steady-state levels in brain (10 molecules/pg of total RNA) followed by heart, lung, and ovary (average of 4 molecules/pg), as compared to spleen and testis (about 0.4 molecules/pg), and the rest of the organs (around 0.07 molecules/pg). Notably, this quantitative tissue-expression profile is not in good agreement with qualitative RT-PCR results in public database. For instance, qualitative RT-PCR (accession ID, MGI:1204456) generated a strong c-<italic>fos </italic>amplification band from either liver or lung RNA and no detectable signal from kidney RNA. However, quantitative data given here (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) showed much lower expression levels in both liver and kidney (around 0.07 molecules/pg RNA) than in lung (5.7 molecules/pg RNA). These discrepancies might be due, at least partly, to the experimental uncertainties of the end-point RT-PCR methodology.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Organ-, embryo-, and cell type-associated differences in basal amounts of c-fos transcripts</bold>.

Regarding whole embryos, an over 7-fold overexpression in both c-<italic>fos </italic>transcripts occurred as early as E7 (gastrulating embryos). Thereafter, their amounts declined to approximately the average numbers of the steady-state copies measured in adult tissues. Therefore, the c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 species accounted for a constant 8&#x02013;9% of the total transcript molecules throughout mouse embryonic development.</p><p>Elevated levels of the two c-<italic>fos </italic>transcripts were also quantitated in NIH 3T3 and Hepa1-6 confluent cells. Interestingly, at least in these 2 cell lines, we observed both products with an about equal yield. This finding differs from a recent report in which confluent stromal cells expressed only the c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. With regard to the absolute amounts of transcripts coding for the rest of proteins within the Fos family (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and data not shown), we found that the c-<italic>fos-2 </italic>variant was nearly as abundant in lung, liver, and kidney and in NIH 3T3 cells as the transcripts coding for Fra-1 and Fra-2. Comparatively, the transcript coding for FosB displayed a much lower level.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Absolute steady-state levels of transcripts encoding proteins of the Fos family in mouse lung</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center">mouse</td><td align="center"><italic>c-fos</italic></td><td align="center"><italic>c-fos-2</italic></td><td align="center"><italic>fosB</italic></td><td align="center"><italic>fra1</italic></td><td align="center"><italic>fra2</italic></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">2.80</td><td align="center">0.59</td><td align="center">0.035</td><td align="center">0.96</td><td align="center">1.93</td></tr><tr><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">4.52</td><td align="center">0.62</td><td align="center">0.039</td><td align="center">0.98</td><td align="center">2.42</td></tr><tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">3.37</td><td align="center">0.81</td><td align="center">0.033</td><td align="center">1.03</td><td align="center">2.48</td></tr><tr><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">3.04</td><td align="center">0.66</td><td align="center">0.030</td><td align="center">1.03</td><td align="center">1.63</td></tr><tr><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">2.00</td><td align="center">0.49</td><td align="center">0.022</td><td align="center">1.15</td><td align="center">2.73</td></tr><tr><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">3.08</td><td align="center">0.47</td><td align="center">0.023</td><td align="center">1.26</td><td align="center">2.34</td></tr><tr><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">2.14</td><td align="center">0.16</td><td align="center">0.012</td><td align="center">1.26</td><td align="center">2.04</td></tr><tr><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">2.41</td><td align="center">0.41</td><td align="center">0.018</td><td align="center">1.44</td><td align="center">2.60</td></tr><tr><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">3.57</td><td align="center">0.61</td><td align="center">0.022</td><td align="center">1.51</td><td align="center">2.61</td></tr><tr><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">3.71</td><td align="center">0.88</td><td align="center">0.033</td><td align="center">1.29</td><td align="center">2.82</td></tr><tr><td align="center">11</td><td align="center">4.16</td><td align="center">0.42</td><td align="center">0.014</td><td align="center">1.13</td><td align="center">2.67</td></tr><tr><td align="center">12</td><td align="center">3.90</td><td align="center">0.58</td><td align="center">0.038</td><td align="center">1.37</td><td align="center">2.94</td></tr><tr><td align="center">mean &#x000b1; SEM</td><td align="center">3.22 &#x000b1; 0.23</td><td align="center">0.56 &#x000b1; 0.053</td><td align="center">0.027 &#x000b1; 0.003</td><td align="center">1.20 &#x000b1; 0.050</td><td align="center">2.44 &#x000b1; 0.11</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Male BALB/c mice of 7 weeks of age were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Spain).

We first tried to determine the half-life of each investigated c-<italic>fos </italic>transcript in a whole animal study. For this purpose, we administered actinomycin D (AmD) to stop transcription and then quantitated the number of transcript molecules remaining at various times after the transcription shut-off. Surprisingly, in contrast to previous results with other murine mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the decay rates of the c-<italic>fos </italic>transcripts could not be calculated in animals, since their hepatic, pulmonary and renal levels increased (not decreased) upon the intraperitoneal injection of AmD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These results indicate that c-<italic>fos </italic>(an early response gene) is up-regulated <italic>in vivo </italic>by AmD under conditions in which the transcription of other genes is blocked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We have previously addressed this problem in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], where the levels of mRNAs that are particularly responsive to environmental changes are up-regulated by current procedures for blocking transcription (i.e. RNA polymerase inhibition by specific drugs or thermal inactivation of a temperature-sensitive mutant). Since AmD doses higher than 2 mg kg<sup>-1 </sup>body weight and incubation times longer than 16 h could not be used without affecting the apparent healthy aspect of mice, we next considered the possibility of quantifying the decay rates of the investigated c-<italic>fos </italic>transcripts in the cell-cultured model.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Time-courses of c-fos transcripts in mouse kidney, lung and liver in response to AmD</bold>.

Transcript turnover rates in the order of minutes was a characteristic of proto-oncogenes since other mRNA species such as those encoding for heme oxygenase 1, thioredoxin 1, and superoxide dismutase 3 presented turnover rates in the order of hours.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Rates of transcript decay and synthesis in cultured cells</bold>.

The result of such a calculation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) suggests that the major determinant of c-<italic>fos-</italic>2 transcript level in cultured cells is its high rate of synthesis, as compared to that of the spliced c-<italic>fos </italic>variant, and particularly to those of both <italic>fosB </italic>and of non proto-oncogenes mRNAs.</p><p>Next, we asked ourselves whether cycloheximide (Cx), a protein synthesis inhibitor, leads to the stabilization of the alternative c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 transcript. We found (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), that the fast decay rate of the c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 species is not coupled to translation, since it went on being &#x02264; 3 minutes in the presence of Cx, irrespective of the cell type (NIH 3T3 or Hepa1-6).

In both cases, a dramatic 11-fold increase (from about 2.3 to 25 molecules/pg) was quantitated as soon as 5 min after serum addition. However, following this early up-regulation, while the c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 copy number remained relatively constant within 5&#x02013;30 min, the amount of the spliced c-<italic>fos </italic>mRNA increased until a maximum of 100-fold was reached 30 min past stimulation. Thereafter, both transcript levels decayed with different kinetics: spliced c-<italic>fos </italic>mRNA molecules decreased to 50% of maximum in 20 min, while c-<italic>fos-</italic>2 lasted 37 min. Overall, these distinguishing features caused rapid changes in the relative abundance of both transcripts throughout the period analyzed in this experiment. Comparatively, our quantitative PCR analysis revealed a much less differential expression of both <italic>fosB </italic>mRNA isoforms. Moreover, in contrast to previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the expression of <italic>fosB </italic>did not precede that of &#x00394;<italic>fosB </italic>mRNA at any time following serum stimulation. In fact, both transcripts were induced in a close parallelism throughout the first 30 min of serum treatment, and, additionally, the &#x00394;<italic>fosB </italic>mRNA increase persisted longer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Time-course of c-fos (left) and fosB (right) transcript levels in serum-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells</bold>.

Therefore, serum-related changes in the copy number of the c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 transcript were entirely explained by differences in its rate of synthesis. Nonetheless, two trends could be envisaged regarding the spliced c-<italic>fos </italic>mRNA: while an outstanding induction of its synthesis would be the only determinant for the large up-regulation of spliced c-<italic>fos </italic>mRNA within the first 30 minutes after serum addition, the subsequent rapid return of this transcript to the prestimulation levels would require an accelerated turnover rate (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Rates of synthesis and degradation of c-<italic>fos </italic>and c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 transcripts upon serum stimulation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center" colspan="3">c-<italic>fos</italic></td><td align="center" colspan="3">c-<italic>fos</italic>-2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">NIH 3T3 cells</td><td align="center">amount (molec/pg)</td><td align="center">half-life (min)</td><td align="center">synthesis (molec/min)</td><td align="center">amount (molec/pg)</td><td align="center">half-life (min)</td><td align="center">synthesis (molec/min)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">confluent</td><td align="center">12.1</td><td align="center">17.9</td><td align="center">0.47</td><td align="center">12.8</td><td align="center">2.6</td><td align="center">3.41</td></tr><tr><td align="left">quiescent</td><td align="center">2.6</td><td align="center">17.5</td><td align="center">0.10</td><td align="center">2.2</td><td align="center">2.3</td><td align="center">0.66</td></tr><tr><td align="left">serum (15 min)</td><td align="center">116.1</td><td align="center">17.1</td><td align="center">4.71</td><td align="center">28.1</td><td align="center">2.3</td><td align="center">8.47</td></tr><tr><td align="left">serum (60 min)</td><td align="center">77.1</td><td align="center">8.5</td><td align="center">6.29</td><td align="center">10.2</td><td align="center">2.7</td><td align="center">2.62</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Experimental conditions are as in Figs. 4 and 6.

To this end, RNA was isolated from separate cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of NIH 3T3 cells, and then the resulting RNAs were analyzed by end-point RT-PCR.

For this purpose, c-Fos proteins were partially purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from NIH 3T3 cell extract following 30 min serum stimulation. Immunoblot analysis with anti-cFos Ab of the eluate column revealed several electrophoretically distinguishable bands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>).

Bands detected in the range of 42- to 50-kDa might be c-Fos breakdown products. Finally, the discrete immunoreactive species corresponding in mobility to a ~23-kDa protein would be the truncated c-Fos form. This band was not detected in crude extract from either serum-starved or serum-stimulated cells. The possibility that the ~23-kDa band would be primary Ab light chains leaching off the immunoaffinity column was excluded by using only the secondary Ab [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, the possibility that the ~23-kDa band would be a non-specific protein co-purified with the rabbit anti-cFos Ab was excluded by using a different primary Ab in the Western blotting [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Detection of c-Fos immunoreactive species</bold>.

To avoid the deleterious effects of deregulated expression, c-<italic>fos </italic>is subjected to numerous transcriptional and posttranscriptional controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Differential pre-mRNA splicing is an important mode of regulating the activity of mammalian genes (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). Our interest in c-<italic>fos </italic>splicing stems from previous studies on <italic>fosB </italic>where a truncated spliced variant missing the C-terminus of FosB appears to be of great physiological relevance, e.g. in mediating long-term adaptive changes in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Murine c-<italic>fos </italic>gene comprises 4 exons and 3 introns spanning ~3.4 kb of chromosome 12. By means of specific primers, we first explored the presence of intron sequences in the transcript population derived from c-<italic>fos</italic>. We demonstrated that whereas introns 1 and 2 are regularly spliced from the precursor RNA, intron 3 remains unspliced in part of the total transcript molecules. Following this finding, we performed a robust and sensitive RT-PCR methodology for providing for the first time a comprehensive quantitation of the absolute expression levels of each transcript isoform: the canonical spliced c-<italic>fos </italic>and the alternative c-<italic>fos</italic>-2. Comparisons of expression levels across 8 mouse organs, 3 fetal stages and 2 cultured cell lines led to four observations: (i) The c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 transcript is ubiquitously synthesized either <italic>in vivo </italic>or <italic>in vitro </italic>situations. (ii) This isoform is present in amounts that are higher or similar to those of mRNAs coding for other Fos family members like FosB, &#x00394;FosB, Fra-1 or Fra-2. (iii) The c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 variant is frequently processed in certain mouse tissues, like ovary and lung, and in confluent cell cultures, where both transcript isoforms are produced in about equal quantities. (iv) No obvious relationship exists between total amount of c-<italic>fos </italic>transcripts and the relative quantity of the c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 form. For instance, c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 accounted for about 9% of total transcript molecules in liver and about 6% in brain, though this last organ exceeds the hepatic steady-state amount by over 75-fold. On the whole, these findings support the notion that the c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 copy number might be controlled.</p><p>The number of copies of any transcript is determined by a delicate balance between opposing synthesis and degradation mechanisms. Here we show that the presence of intron 3 confers to the c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 transcript a destabilizing effect of about 6-fold, e.g. reducing the transcript half-life from 18 to 3 min in confluent NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>The canonical c-<italic>fos </italic>mRNA is targeted for decay by two functionally independent instability determinants. One of these determinants (designated mCRD) is located in the protein-coding region and the other (an AU-rich element) in the 3'-untranslated end of the c-<italic>fos </italic>mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The mRNA decay mediated by mCRD represents a "suicide" mechanism in which translation of the mCRD-containing RNA results in the rapid degradation of the message [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Here we show that the half-lives of the c-<italic>fos </italic>and c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 transcripts are affected differently by inhibition of the translation, since cycloheximide caused the stabilization of only the canonical c-<italic>fos </italic>mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This result suggests that the shorter half-life of the alternative c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 species is independent of translationally coupled mRNA turnover mechanisms, like the one directed by the mCRD determinant. Accordingly, the c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 transcript with the PTC lying in the last intron 3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>) should be also immune to the so-called nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). It is noteworthy that this latter was anticipated given that one critical determinant of whether a mammalian transcript is subjected to NMD is the presence of a splicing-generated exon-exon junction &#x0003e;50&#x02013;55 nt downstream the PTC (recently reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]). In the absence of these two translationally coupled mRNA turnover mechanisms, an intriguing question remains to be answered: Why is the c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 transcript degraded at a faster rate than the canonical c-<italic>fos </italic>message?.</p><p>A recent paper by Moraes <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] indicates that the CUG-binding protein (CUG-BP) plays a role in c-<italic>fos </italic>mRNA decay. By means of an <italic>in vitro </italic>deadenylation assay, they showed that CUG-BP binding to c-<italic>fos </italic>mRNA stimulates the poly(A) shortening by the PARN deadenylase. Since deadenylation is a rate-limiting step in the turnover of most mRNAs, we hypothesized that the presence of intron 3 in the c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 transcript might accelerate its decay by the above-referred mechanism. We reasoned that in this case, the proportion between both c-<italic>fos </italic>transcript variants might change when using an anchored oligo(dT)primer (5'-T<sub>20</sub>VN-3'), rather than random primers, in the cDNA synthesis. This approach allowed us to track specifically the transcripts that retained poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>tails of a sufficient length to allow priming. We found [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>] that the poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>population has practically the same copy numbers of c-<italic>fos </italic>and c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 transcripts as the overall RNA population. Moreover, the rate at which each transcript disappeared from the poly(A)<sup>+ </sup>population was similar to their overall decay rates [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>]. These data seem to favour the idea that the two transcripts undergo deadenylation at the same rate, which seems to be in agreement with the synchronous deadenylation pattern seen for c-<italic>fos </italic>RNA both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Further work should pursue the identification of new instability determinants within the c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 transcript variant.</p><p>Shur <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] have recently reported rapid changes in c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 and c-<italic>fos </italic>transcript levels in response of the osteoblastic cells to a challenge with dexamethasone (a pharmacological glucocorticoid hormone). Control of c-<italic>fos </italic>splicing through the interaction of the glucocorticoid receptor with the c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 transcript was the mechanism proposed to explain the observed changes. Here we too show that the proportion between both c-<italic>fos </italic>transcript variants changes rapidly and transiently upon the stimulation by serum of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in quiescence. Our data indicate that differential rates of synthesis determine the large up-regulation of spliced c-<italic>fos </italic>relative to c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 level at the early stage of the serum response. However, destabilization of the newly synthesized c-<italic>fos </italic>message, possibly as it is being translated, contributes to completing the response and restoring the ~50% yield (percentage of total transcript molecules) quantitated in confluent cultures. This temporal sequence of events further supports the idea that the alternative processing of the primary c-<italic>fos </italic>transcript might be of physiological relevance, given that a relatively short extension of c-<italic>fos </italic>expression is sufficient for fibroblasts to manifest properties of cell transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Translation of the c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 transcript predicts the synthesis of a truncated protein lacking 211 aa at the carboxyl-terminus. We partially purified by immunoaffinity chromatography a c-Fos protein (verified by Western blot) with an apparent molecular weight of 23-kDa as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This finding suggests that the truncated variant of c-Fos is expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. The truncation would occur after the conserved basic domain for DNA binding but prior to the adjacent leucine zipper for dimerization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Therefore, the truncated c-Fos should be inactive for transformation and transactivation since the functional integrity of the bZIP motif is required for these activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Moreover, the truncated c-Fos (unable to heterodimerize) should not exhibit antagonistic functional properties with the canonical longer counterpart, as in the case of &#x00394;fosB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. On the other hand, however, the truncated c-Fos species might gain in stability as predicted by the loss of the main destabilizing activity residing at the C-terminal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>What might the biological significance of the above-referred truncated variant of c-Fos protein be? One could speculate with the idea that the truncated species is just the side effect of the c-<italic>fos</italic>-2 translation occurring or tolerated in the cells. Nonetheless, a more active role in regulating gene expression could also be envisaged, since the truncated c-Fos would retain the DNA binding domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Two pathways have been described for binding dimeric proteins to DNA. In the dimer pathway, proteins first form dimers and then go on to bind DNA. Along the monomer pathway, a monomer&#x02022;DNA complex is formed first, followed by recruitment of the second monomer to form the final complex. A growing number of dimeric DNA-binding proteins are able to form complexes with DNA via a monomer pathway. In fact, the monomer pathway is considered the best option for a faster and more specific formation of the final complex ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and references herein). Although Fos and Jun monomer&#x02022;DNA complexes are difficult to observe, particularly in gel retardation experiments (e.g. see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]), recent stopped-flow fluorescence studies on the kinetics of Fos&#x02022;Jun&#x02022;DNA complex formation indicate that both protein monomers bind DNA sequentially and assemble their dimerization interface while interacting with DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These data allow us to speculate with the possibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] that even low levels of the truncated c-Fos variant might influence AP-1 mediated gene expression through the formation of non-productive monomer&#x02022;DNA intermediates at specific DNA target sites. Additional experiments would be required to support such a notion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we provide the first absolute (molecule number) quantitative analysis of alternative spliced transcript isoforms derived from the c-<italic>fos </italic>precursor RNA.

The amount of c-<italic>fos </italic>mRNA molecules lacking intron 3 was estimated by subtracting the molecules with intron 3 (determined with E3U-I3L) from the total molecule number (determined with E3U-E4L). Similarly, the amount of mRNA molecules coding for &#x00394;FosB was estimated by subtracting the molecules for the full-length FosB (determined with I4U-I4L) from the total molecule number (determined with E4U-E5L) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoaffinity purification of c-Fos proteins</title><p>Rabbit polyclonal Ab (Calbiochem, PC05) against the N-terminal region (aa 4&#x02013;17) shared by the full-length and the putative truncated c-Fos protein were coupled to cyanogen bromide (CNBr)-activated agarose (Sigma C9142) following the manufacturer's recommendations. NIH 3T3 cells were cultured as described above. The accumulation of c-Fos proteins was promoted by 30 min serum stimulation. The cells were harvested and then lysed in 150 &#x003bc;l of buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.03% Tween 20, 0.4 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 0.4 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml aprotinin, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), by using a polypropylene pestle for microcentrifuge tubes mounted in a cordless motor and 4 cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at room temperature.

After washing the blots with blocking buffer, the membranes were incubated with 1:4000 of a secondary anti-rabbit IgG Ab (Sigma, A9169) to which horseradish peroxidase had been covalently coupled. Blots were developed using the ECL-Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions.

The concentration of the standard RNA was determined by measuring the optical density at 260 nm and converting the absorbance to the number of copies by using its molecular weight. Ten-fold serial dilutions from 10<sup>9 </sup>to 10<sup>2 </sup>RNA copies were prepared, retrotranscribed and amplified by real-time PCR. Primers for the amplification of the standard have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These primers generate a 130 bp PCR product. The standard curve was constructed by plotting the log of starting RNA molecules versus the threshold cycle (Ct). The resulting standard curve is linear (r = 0.998) over 7 orders of magnitude. The efficiency (E) value is calculated from the slope of the standard curve equation, as E = 10<sup>[-1/slope]</sup>-1. The slope of the standard curve indicates that the standard is amplified with 99.8% efficiency.
