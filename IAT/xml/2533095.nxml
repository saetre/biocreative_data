TR&#x003b1; acts as an intracellular receptor for thyroid hormone (T<sub>3</sub>), thereby regulating expression of T<sub>3</sub>-responsive genes associated with many aspects of development, growth, and metabolism. Among the nuclear receptors, TR&#x003b1; is particularly intriguing in that it can modulate transcription whether or not it is bound to T<sub>3</sub>. Consistent with this dual role as an activator or repressor of transcription, at steady state TR&#x003b1; appears to be almost exclusively localized in the nucleus. However, we have shown that the receptor, in fact, shuttles rapidly between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). Whereas the significance of this nucleocytoplasmic shuttling remains to be precisely characterized, this activity may be related directly to regulation of TR&#x003b1; target genes as well as to yet unknown non-genomic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>).</p><p>Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling occurs as a result of a dynamic balance between the recognition of nuclear localization signals (NLS) and nuclear export signals (NES) by particular import and export factors termed importins and exportins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). Most nuclear receptors appear to enter the nucleus via importin &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; recognition and subsequent translocation through the nuclear pore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). Unlike nuclear import, however, the export pathways followed by nuclear receptors remain more elusive.</p><p>The most thoroughly studied and well characterized nuclear export pathway involves the exportin CRM1. Many shuttling transcription factors outside of the nuclear receptor superfamily follow a CRM1-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Like other nuclear receptors, however, TR&#x003b1; lacks the leucine-rich NES associated with classical CRM1-mediated nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Concordantly, we have shown through interspecies heterokaryon assays that TR&#x003b1; nuclear export is not inhibited by leptomycin B (LMB), a potent inhibitor of CRM1 activity. These data clearly indicate that, at least in a heterokaryon system, TR&#x003b1; can use a CRM1-independent nuclear export pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>).</p><p>There is compelling evidence that suggests that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein calreticulin (CRT) may play a role in the nuclear export of several nuclear receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). For example, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) undergoes CRT-dependent nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) mediated through its highly conserved DNA binding domain (DBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). However, the extent to which CRT functions as an export receptor has remained a subject of debate because its primary role is in the quality control of protein folding in the ER. In addition to this process, CRT has been implicated in an increasing number of critical cellular processes including regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>), integrin-mediated cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>), numerous roles in immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>), and cardiac muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>).</p><p>As noted above, a widely used technique to study the subcellular trafficking of nuclear receptors has been the interspecies heterokaryon assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that the polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced fusion of the cytoplasm during this assay disrupts the ER, thereby causing a transient elevation in cytosolic CRT levels as the protein is released from the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). This fusion process may alter the export kinetics of some shuttling proteins. For example, in contrast to the rapid shuttling of GR observed in heterokaryon assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>), GR shuttling was found to occur only slowly over a period of hours during fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments in monokaryons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). Moreover, in contrast to heterokaryon fusion experiments in which GR shuttling was shown to be CRT-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>), slow GR recovery in experiments other than heterokaryon fusions was shown to occur in a CRT-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). Given these results, the question has arisen as to whether CRT-dependent nuclear export occurs under physiological conditions or merely in response to exogenous environmental stresses such as cell fusion.</p><p>With these data in mind we sought to ascertain whether TR&#x003b1; shuttles under physiological conditions and, if so, whether it follows a CRT or CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway. To this end, we used a combined approach of <italic>in vivo</italic> FRAP experiments, <italic>in vitro</italic> digitonin-permeabilized cell nuclear export assays, and GST pull-down assays. Taken together, our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data point to the intriguing possibility that TR&#x003b1; uses an export pathway in which CRT binds directly to TR&#x003b1; and, thereby, promotes a cooperative interaction in which both CRT and CRM1 play a role in mediating rapid, efficient translocation of TR&#x003b1; from the nucleus to cytoplasm.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Plasmids</italic>&#x02014;The plasmid pGFP-TR&#x003b1; encodes a functional GFP-TR&#x003b1; fusion protein expressed under human cytomegalovirus promoter control.

These mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum under similar conditions. Cells were grown to 70-90% confluency.</p><p><italic>Transient Transfection and Live Cell Imaging</italic>&#x02014;For transient transfections, cells were seeded at 4-7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells per 60-mm vented dish (Nunc, Rochester, NY) onto 5-cm coverslips. Twenty-four h after seeding, cells at 40-60% confluency were transfected with 4 &#x003bc;g of plasmid DNA and 20 &#x003bc;l of Lipofectamine Reagent (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reduced serum medium was replaced with complete medium 16-18 h post-transfection.</p><p>After transfection, cells were used for microscopy within 48 h. Prior to mounting in an enclosed perfusion chamber (Bioptechs, Butler, PA), coverslips were incubated in 2 ml of complete media containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml cycloheximide (Sigma), penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml), and 2-4 n<sc>m</sc> LMB (Sigma) or with vehicle (0.1% methanol) for 30 min. Coverslips were then washed with 2 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and mounted. For the duration of each experiment, cells were incubated in MEM or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 &#x003bc;g/ml cycloheximide, penicillin (50 units/ml)/streptomycin (50 &#x003bc;g/ml), and 2-4 n<sc>m</sc> LMB or vehicle (0.1% methanol).</p><p>Images were collected from an inverted Nikon ECLIPSE TE 2000-E fluorescence microscope equipped with a Radiance 2100 laser scanning unit using a &#x000d7;60 1.2 NA water objective (Nikon). The 488-nm line of a krypton-argon laser with a bandpass 515/30 nm emission filter was used for GFP detection and images were obtained using the time course module of Laser Sharp 2000 (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY).</p><p>FRAP was recorded to analyze shuttling of proteins between nuclei within monokaryons. All FRAP experiments were performed in a temperature-controlled setting using a FCS2 live-cell chamber heating system and objective heater system (Bioptechs) to maintain 37 &#x000b0;C. After the appropriate temperature was reached, an initial image was recorded from an area containing a multinucleated GFP-expressing cell using 2-8% laser power from the 488 nm line of a krypton-argon laser. One nucleus within the monokaryon was exposed at 50% laser power for two cycles using the same laser. After this bleaching exposure, sequential images were taken every 5 min for 11 cycles. To minimize undesired photobleaching, low laser intensities of 2-8% were again used for post-bleach images. For quantitative analysis of digitized images, fluorescence intensity values were generated using ImageJ (NIH). Bleached and unbleached nuclei were each considered as independent regions of interest. In addition, these values took into account the background brightness levels during each experiment. Intensity values were subsequently normalized so that the total fluorescence within each monokaryon after bleaching was equal to 1. Graphs were generated using Microsoft Excel.</p><p><italic>Heterokaryon Assay</italic>&#x02014;For the preparation of heterokaryons, <italic>crt</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells (K42) were seeded at 2-2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well onto coverslips in 6-well dishes. Cells were then transfected with a GFP-TR&#x003b1; expression vector. Twenty-four hours post-transfection of the <italic>crt</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells, human HeLa cells were trypsinized and resuspended in heterokaryon growth medium containing 70% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 20% sterile distilled water. The resuspended cells were then plated on the same coverslips at 5-6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well. The cells were then incubated for 2.5 h in the presence of cycloheximide at 50 &#x003bc;g/ml followed by 30 min in media with cycloheximide at 100 &#x003bc;g/ml at 37 &#x000b0;C to allow adherence. Subsequently, the cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's PBS. For cell fusion, coverslips were placed on 100-&#x003bc;l drops of warm 50% polyethylene glycol 1500 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and incubated for exactly 2 min. Each coverslip was then rinsed with Dulbecco's PBS and incubated for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C in heterokaryon growth media containing 100 &#x003bc;g/ml cycloheximide.</p><p>Following incubation, the cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's PBS and then fixed for 10 min in 3.7% formaldehyde. After three 5-min washes with Dulbecco's PBS, the cells were permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100. Following three 5-min washes with Dulbecco's PBS the cells were incubated in 200 &#x003bc;l of 1.5% normal goat serum for 20 min. The cells were then washed with Dulbecco's PBS and incubated for an additional 20 min in 1.5% normal goat serum containing 0.5 units/ml rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to visualize actin. Following a wash in Dulbecco's PBS, the cells were then incubated for 10 min in Dulbecco's PBS containing 10 &#x003bc;g/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) to visualize DNA. Finally, the coverslips were mounted on slides using GelMount mounting media (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Slides were examined by fluorescence microscopy and images were obtained with a CoolSNAP HQ<sub>2</sub> CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) and NIS-Elements software (Nikon).</p><p><italic>Antibody Staining</italic>&#x02014;Cells were grown to 80-90% confluency and plated at 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well onto coverslips in six-well dishes (Nunc). 24 h post-plating, coverslips were incubated in 2 n<sc>m</sc> LMB or 0.1% methanol for 5 h. The cells were then fixed and permeabilized. After fixation and permeabilization, cells were incubated in 1.5% normal goat serum in Dulbecco's PBS for 30 min. The cells were then washed in Dulbecco's PBS and probed for 1 h in blocking solution containing rabbit polyclonal anti-CRT antibodies (Stressgen, Ann Arbor, MI) diluted to 1:1000. Cells were then washed in Dulbecco's PBS three times for 5 min each prior to incubation for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted to 1:600. After incubation the cells were washed in Dulbecco's PBS and mounted using GelMount containing 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2&#x02032;-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Sigma) (0.5 &#x003bc;g/ml). CRT staining was visualized by fluorescence microscopy.</p><p><italic>Nuclear Extractions</italic>&#x02014;Cells were plated at 1-2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> and grown for 24 h to confluence in 100-mm vented dishes. Cells were rinsed 3 times in Dulbecco's PBS and nuclei lysed in 1 ml of Cell Lysis Solution (10 m<sc>m</sc> Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 m<sc>m</sc> KCl, 10 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA pH 8.0, 0.4% IGEPAL (Sigma), 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche), 1 m<sc>m</sc> dithiothreitol (dithiothreitol) (Omnipur, Gibbstown, NJ), Complete Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablet (1 tablet/10 ml) (Roche) for 10 min at 4 &#x000b0;C. The lysed cells were scraped and sheared by four passages through a 21-gauge needle. The quality and purity of the nuclei were monitored by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy at &#x000d7;600; shearing was repeated until &#x0003e;95% of nuclei were visibly free from ER and other cytoplasmic contamination. Nuclei were pelleted by a 5-s pulse spin (200 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>) at 4 &#x000b0;C in a microcentrifuge. The cytoplasmic fraction was collected and the purified nuclei were washed twice with 1 ml of extraction solution. A small fraction of the resuspended nuclei from the last wash was observed by DIC to confirm that the nuclei had remained intact and were free from ER and other cytoplasmic debris. The nuclear proteins were then extracted with 100 &#x003bc;l of Nuclear Extraction Solution (20 m<sc>m</sc> Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 <sc>m</sc> NaCl, 10 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 m<sc>m</sc> dithiothreitol, Complete Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets (1 tablet/10 ml)). Proteins from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were then analyzed by Western blot.</p><p><italic>Western Blotting</italic>&#x02014;The approximate concentration of total protein in nuclear and cytoplasmic samples was determined by absorption at 280 nm. For cytoplasmic and whole cell extract, 40 &#x003bc;g of protein were analyzed per lane, 40-60 &#x003bc;g per lane were used for nuclear extracts, and 0.5-2 &#x003bc;l of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) (Promega, Madison, WI) were analyzed. The samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by semi-dry electroblotting (Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated overnight in the presence of blocking solution (Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20). After six washes with TBS, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h. For the detection of CRT and &#x003b2;-tubulin both rabbit polyclonal anti-CRT antibodies (SPA-600D, Stressgen) and rabbit polyclonal anti-&#x003b2;-tubulin antibodies (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) were mixed together in blocking solution at 1:20,000 and 1:200, respectively. For the detection of CRM1 and CRT, Western blots were incubated separately with anti-CRM1 (Affinity Bioreagents) or anti-CRT (Stressgen) antibodies at 1:200 or 1:20,000, respectively. The blots were then washed six times with TBS and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) at 1:30,000 for 1 h in blocking solution. Following this incubation, the blots were washed again six times and incubated with ECL-Plus detection reagent (GE Healthcare). Subsequently, the blots were analyzed using a Storm 860 Molecular Imager scanner (GE Healthcare) and ImageJ (NIH).</p><p><italic>Protein Overexpression</italic>&#x02014;Plasmids coding for the protein of interest were transformed into competent <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (BL21 DE3-RIl) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), per the manufacturer's protocol, and grown to an <italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub> of 0.6-0.8 at 37 &#x000b0;C.

Post-expression cultures were centrifuged at 1,700 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 &#x000b0;C; bacterial pellets were stored at -80 &#x000b0;C prior to protein purification.</p><p><italic>GST Protein Purification</italic>&#x02014;Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of B-PER&#x000ae; Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce), 1 ml of 5.0 mg/ml lysozyme (Fisher), 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tris, pH 8.0, and one Complete Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablet (Roche). Resuspended pellets were incubated on ice for 30 min. The pellets were subsequently sonicated (Sonic Dismembrator model 100; Fisher) on ice to fully lyse the bacteria. The lysed mixture was then centrifuged at 17,950 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 &#x000b0;C, and the supernatant was applied to 200 &#x003bc;l of 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare).

This shuttling is not blocked by LMB in heterokaryons, indicating that TR&#x003b1; is exiting the nucleus by a CRM1-independent pathway in the heterokaryon assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). The heterokaryon assay involves PEG-induced fusion of the cytosols of transfected cells of one species (<italic>e.g.</italic> mouse) with untransfected cells of another species (<italic>e.g.</italic> human). Movement of the protein of interest can then be monitored from the nuclei of transfected cells into the shared cytosol of the fused cells and, subsequently, into the nuclei of the opposing species. The recent finding that PEG-induced cell fusion causes changes in the cellular environment including a transient elevation in CRT levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) has called into question the validity and interpretation of previous heterokaryon experiments.</p><p>We first sought to determine whether TR&#x003b1; shuttles under physiological conditions by performing experiments in living cells, independent of heterokaryon formation. To maintain physiological conditions, we used a FRAP assay in multinucleate live cells (monokaryons) to monitor the movement of GFP-TR&#x003b1; from unbleached to bleached nuclei. Unlike in heterokaryons, a monokaryon system does not require cell fusion or other manipulation that would compromise the integrity of the ER and thus, presumably, maintains low levels of cytosolic CRT. Transfected monokaryons were selected and one nucleus within these cells was exposed to intense laser illumination. This exposure resulted in loss of fluorescence within the selected nucleus due to irreversible photobleaching of the GFP fluorophore. The initial bleaching did not, however, result in loss of fluorescence to neighboring nuclei within the same cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). A series of images was taken for each individual experiment in which fluorescence recovery to bleached nuclei was measured and compared with the concomitant decrease in intensity within unbleached nuclei. Through image analysis and plotting of these fluorescence intensity data, we were able to determine the relative degree of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling within particular cell types and treatments. Specifically, we assayed for TR&#x003b1; shuttling in human HeLa and mouse <italic>crt</italic><sup>+/+</sup> cell lines, both of which express CRT. We show that, in contrast to the slow nuclear export observed for GR in COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>), TR&#x003b1; in fact shuttles rapidly between nuclei in both HeLa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) and <italic>crt</italic><sup>+/+</sup> monokaryons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). These data are in close agreement with those observed for TR&#x003b1; shuttling kinetics in heterokaryons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>), and suggest that TR&#x003b1; may play an as yet unknown role in cytosolic signaling pathways. After confirming that TR&#x003b1; rapidly shuttles between nuclei in these cells, we sought to determine whether TR&#x003b1; follows a CRM1 or CRT-dependent nuclear export pathway in live, unfused cells.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>TR</bold>&#x003b1; <bold>shuttling is inhibited by treatment with LMB in live monokaryons expressing CRT.</bold><italic>A</italic>, HeLa cells were transfected with a GFP-TR&#x003b1; expression plasmid and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling was monitored through FRAP (<italic>n</italic> = 7). <italic>White arrowheads</italic> indicate photobleached nuclei.

Surprisingly, we saw only slow recovery of TR&#x003b1; within photobleached monokaryon nuclei of both cell types during FRAP experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In contrast to previous data for heterokaryons in which near complete equilibration between nuclei was seen over the course of 1 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>), recovery of fluorescence to bleached nuclei within live monokaryons treated with LMB was limited to only 22% (&#x000b1;3%) for HeLa cells and 14% (&#x000b1;2%) for <italic>crt</italic><sup>+/+</sup> cells over a similar time course (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). These results are in sharp contrast to parallel FRAP experiments performed in the absence of LMB, during which TR&#x003b1; shuttling was much more rapid. In these experiments recovery to the bleached nuclei was measured at 56% (&#x000b1;4%) equilibration for HeLa cells and 88% (&#x000b1;2%) equilibration for <italic>crt</italic><sup>+/+</sup> cells over 1 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). To graphically illustrate the sensitivity of TR&#x003b1; nucleocytoplasmic shuttling to LMB, mean brightness values for photobleached and unbleached nuclei were plotted as a function of time post-bleach. Fluorescence intensity was normalized so that the overall fluorescence of bleached and unbleached nuclei was equal to 1.0 (arbitrary units). After normalization, convergence of the representative curves for bleached nuclei and unbleached nuclei toward one another represents the degree of fluorescence equilibration between these compartments. When one bleached and one unbleached nucleus are present, complete equilibration occurs at 0.5 fluorescence units.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>TR</bold>&#x003b1; <bold>requires CRT for nuclear export.</bold><italic>crt</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells were transfected with a GFP-TR&#x003b1; expression plasmid and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling was monitored through FRAP (<italic>n</italic> = 8). <italic>White arrowheads</italic> indicate bleached nuclei.

Thus, the altered nuclear import of some proteins in <italic>crt</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells is a specific effect and is not indicative of a general defect in the import cycle.

Indeed, only 14% (&#x000b1;2%) fluorescence equilibration from unbleached nuclei to bleached nuclei was seen in the <italic>crt</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cell line. In contrast, HeLa cells and <italic>crt</italic><sup>+/+</sup> cells not treated with LMB showed 56% (&#x000b1;4%) and 88% (&#x000b1;2%) fluorescence equilibration with unbleached nuclei, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). To demonstrate that the lack of CRT in these cells was not responsible for any nonspecific action preventing all nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, <italic>crt</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells were also transfected with a shuttling control construct, pNES-GFP-GST-NLS. The fusion protein localizes to the nucleus at steady state and shuttles via a CRM1-mediated nuclear export pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>).

Recently, however, increasing numbers of reports have identified small fractions of CRT in both the cytosolic and nuclear compartments of various cell lines in addition to its primary location within the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). To assess whether a detectable population of CRT was localized to the nuclei of the cells used in our study, we isolated nuclei by biochemical fractionation. To ensure that the nuclei extracted were free of ER and other cytoplasmic contamination, during the purification process nuclei were monitored by DIC at high resolution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Purification steps were repeated until only nuclei that were free of ER and other cytoplasmic debris remained. Proteins were extracted from the cytoplasmic fraction and from the purified nuclei and analyzed by Western blot. Blots were probed simultaneously with anti-CRT and anti-&#x003b2; tubulin, which was used to normalize the data. When comparing the amount of CRT in purified nuclei to the amount of tubulin, a strictly cytoplasmic protein, we found that the purified nuclei from HeLa cells were significantly enriched in CRT (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). In HeLa cells, the ratio between CRT and tubulin increased from 1.7 &#x000b1; 0.3 in the cytoplasm to 9.6 &#x000b1; 4.2 in the nucleus indicating that the amount of CRT observed in the purified nuclei is not a result of residual cytoplasmic contamination.

Together these data provide further evidence that CRT is present in a small but significant fraction within the nucleus in the cell lines used for our experiments. To further demonstrate that CRT is localized to multiple cellular compartments, we performed indirect immunofluorescence assays.

For this assay, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a GFP-TR&#x003b1; expression plasmid. GFP-TR&#x003b1; displays a complete and strong nuclear fluorescence 16 h post-transfection. At this point the outer cell membrane was permeabilized with digitonin and export reactions were performed. First, we sought to assess whether exogenous CRT was sufficient to induce nuclear export of TR&#x003b1;. Our results showed no observable change in TR&#x003b1; nuclear localization between 0 and 40 min irrespective of varying CRT concentration from 270 n<sc>m</sc> to 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>. During this period, all TR&#x003b1; remained localized to the nucleus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p><p>To determine whether additional factors were required to either permit nuclear import of CRT or to aid in the nuclear export of TR&#x003b1; in conjunction with CRT, export reactions containing CRT and a cytosol mixture (RRL) alone or a combination of CRT and RRL were similarly assayed at 0 and 40 min. RRL is commonly used as a source of cytosol for nuclear import and export assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>). Initially, we tested RRL alone. As expected, at <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> TR&#x003b1; was localized to the nucleus. At <italic>t</italic><sub>40</sub> a moderate level of export was observed as indicated by a decrease in GFP-TR&#x003b1; fluorescence in the nuclei compared with <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> (&#x0003e;80% loss of fluorescence) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). Upon addition of RRL and CRT in combination, however, we observed a striking increase in the nuclear export of TR&#x003b1; as compared with that which was observed for RRL or CRT individually. Indeed, over a similar time course nuclear export was nearly complete (&#x0003e;95% fluorescence loss) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). These data suggest that an additional factor (or factors) present in the cytosol interacts cooperatively with CRT to mediate efficient nuclear export of TR&#x003b1;.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>RRL contains CRM1 but not CRT.</bold> HeLa whole cell extract and varying volumes of RRL were subject to Western blot analysis, using anti-CRM1 and anti-CRT antibodies.

In this conformation, RanGTP participates in the formation of export complexes containing the classical leucine-rich NES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). In addition, it also stabilizes protein kinase inhibitor/CRT interactions as well as enhances CRT-dependent nuclear export of protein kinase inhibitor in permeabilized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). It has been shown in permeabilized cell nuclear export assays that residual nuclear RanGTP remaining in cells after permeabilization was sufficient to permit CRT-dependent nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). To determine the role of Ran in the nuclear export of TR&#x003b1;, we performed assays with recombinant CRT in the absence of RanGTP or having supplemented the system with 1.9 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> RanGTP. We did not, however, observe any difference in TR&#x003b1; nuclear localization between these conditions; TR&#x003b1; remained localized to the nucleus in either case (data not shown). This suggests that RanGTP is not the limiting factor for TR&#x003b1; nuclear export.</p><p>Several factors may play a role in stabilizing CRT/cargo interactions, inducing a conformational shift in CRT, or in other nonspecific functions. Calcium, for example, modulates CRT conformation within the lumen of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>) and also regulates CRT function as a chaperone for the T-cell protein perforin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>). In addition, Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhances CRT-mediated nuclear export of GR-GFP but, interestingly, excess Ca<sup>2+</sup> also inhibits classical NES-regulated nuclear export of Rev-GFP <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). We supplemented permeabilized cell export assays with 20 m<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of CRT but observed no difference in TR&#x003b1; nuclear localization. Under these conditions TR&#x003b1; remained localized to the nucleus (data not shown). These results suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> also is not the limiting factor required for nuclear export in these assays.</p><p>Based on our findings in live cells that the nuclear export of TR&#x003b1; shows partial CRM1 dependence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we performed Western blot analysis to test whether CRM1 was present in RRL and could be the additional factor required for efficient CRT-dependent nuclear export. Our data show that CRM1 was present in RRL and HeLa cell extracts, whereas CRT was detected only in HeLa cell extract and was absent from RRL (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). These findings point to the possibility that CRM1 could be the additional factor accounting for the enhanced export of TR&#x003b1; in <italic>in vitro</italic> export assays supplemented with RRL. A cooperative interaction between CRT and CRM1, whether direct or indirect, also accounts for the observation that TR&#x003b1; is not exported as efficiently from nuclei treated with RRL, as CRT is absent from this exogenous cytosol replacement.</p><p><italic>TR</italic>&#x003b1; <italic>Interacts Directly with CRT</italic>&#x02014;To determine whether interactions between TR&#x003b1;, CRT, and CRM1 during nuclear export are direct or indirect, GST pull-down assays were performed (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). A GST-CRT fusion protein was incubated with His-tagged TR&#x003b1; (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>), His-tagged CRM1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>B</italic></xref>), or both (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>C</italic></xref>), and the input (flow-through) and binding (elution) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. TR&#x003b1; interacted with GST-CRT (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>lane 3</italic>), but not with GST alone (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>lane 5</italic>). In contrast, all input CRM1 was present in the flow-through fraction (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>lane 5</italic>); no CRM1 bound specifically to CRT alone (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>lane 6</italic>), or together with TR&#x003b1; (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>lane 4</italic>). Supplementing <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays with RRL had no effect on complex formation (data not shown). Complex formation in HeLa, <italic>crt</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, and <italic>crt</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells was not detectable by coimmunoprecipitation assays (data not shown), suggesting that interaction of TR&#x003b1; with CRT <italic>in situ</italic> is transient and that only a small fraction of TR&#x003b1; forms export complexes at any given time. This is consistent with the primarily nuclear population of TR at steady state.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, we present findings that provide evidence for a previously uncharacterized mechanism for the dynamic shuttling of TR&#x003b1;. We have used a combination of <italic>in vivo</italic> FRAP experiments, <italic>in vitro</italic> digitonin-permeabilized cell nuclear export assays of transiently transfected cells, and GST pull-down assays to investigate aspects of TR&#x003b1; subcellular trafficking. Taken together, our data suggest a novel export mechanism in which CRT directly binds TR&#x003b1;, and CRT and CRM1 work cooperatively to promote rapid, efficient export of TR&#x003b1; from the nucleus (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Alternatively, when the CRM1 pathway is blocked or CRT levels are increased under cellular stress, CRT can act independently as a less efficient exportin. <italic>crt</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cell lines fail to support nuclear export of TR&#x003b1;, suggesting that CRT is indispensable for TR&#x003b1; nuclear export. Thus, CRT may be the most important component of the TR&#x003b1; nuclear export pathway. These data suggest that CRT deficiency prevents CRM1 interacting either directly or indirectly with TR&#x003b1;, and inhibits both cooperative and autonomous TR&#x003b1; export as a consequence.</p><p>Prior to this study, the role that CRT plays in nuclear export was a subject of debate. Previously, CRT was thought to reside permanently within the ER lumen where it participates in the maturation of newly synthesized proteins and sequesters Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition to its prominence in the ER, however, increasing numbers of reports have suggested that CRT may in fact be present in small fractions in other cellular compartments. For example, CRT appears to interact with a ubiquitin-like nuclear protein in the nucleus of rice cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). Moreover, CRT also localizes to the nuclear matrix of some carcinoma cells and assists in chromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>). All of these data suggest that CRT is likely to possess an evolutionarily conserved ability to access the nucleus, where it appears to serve multiple functions. Recently, a mechanism involving the post-translational processing and retrotranslocation of CRT from the ER to the cytoplasm has been identified, suggesting a potential pathway for CRT to subsequently gain access to the nucleus via import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>FIGURE 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Thyroid hormone receptor (TR</bold>&#x003b1;<bold>) interacts directly with CRT.</bold><italic>In vitro</italic> binding interactions were examined by GST pull-down assays. <italic>A</italic>, His-TR&#x003b1; (46 kDa) was retained by GST-CRT bait (<italic>lane 3</italic>, elution), whereas the negative control GST-only bait did not retain TR&#x003b1; (<italic>lane 5</italic>, elution). <italic>Lane 1</italic>, Bio-Rad prestained Kaleidoscope protein molecular mass standards, given in kDa (P-KPS); <italic>lanes 2</italic> and <italic>4</italic>, TR&#x003b1; protein inputs; <italic>lanes 6-8</italic>, reference protein samples. <italic>B</italic>, CRM1 alone was not retained on either GST-CRT (<italic>lane 3</italic>, elution) or negative control GST-only bait (<italic>lane 6</italic>, elution). <italic>Lane 1</italic>, Bio-Rad Kaleidoscope protein molecular mass standards, given in kDa (KPS); <italic>lanes 2</italic> and <italic>5</italic>, His-CRM1 flow-through (<italic>input</italic>); <italic>lane 4</italic>, no prey input, GST-CRT bait elution; <italic>lanes 7-9</italic>, reference protein samples. <italic>C</italic>, TR&#x003b1; binds CRT, but His-CRM1 does not interact directly with the TR&#x003b1;-CRT complex.

Although TR&#x003b1; export was inhibited in <italic>crt</italic><sup>-/-</sup> monokaryons, rapid shuttling and fluorescence equilibration was observed between nuclei of heterokaryons. For CRT to mediate export of TR&#x003b1; from <italic>crt</italic><sup>-/-</sup> nuclei, presumably it must first be imported into these same nuclei. Following import, CRT could then interact with TR&#x003b1; and facilitate its nuclear export. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> nuclear export assays suggest that whereas CRT is necessary for efficient export, there is also an additional factor (or factors) in the cytosol required for its nuclear import, its role in the export of TR&#x003b1;, or both. Based on our <italic>in vivo</italic> FRAP experiments, our <italic>in vitro</italic> nuclear export assays, and our Western blot analysis of RRL composition, we suggest that at least one of these additional factors is the exportin CRM1.</p><p>In both HeLa and <italic>crt</italic><sup>+/+</sup> cell lines, TR&#x003b1; displayed rapid nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in the absence of LMB. Although the precise mechanism by which this export occurs remains to be determined, there are several potential explanations. CRT and CRM1 could undergo a conformational shift that maximizes interaction with components of the nuclear pore complex, thus expediting the export process. Alternatively, CRM1 could increase the affinity of CRT for TR&#x003b1; allowing for more efficient export. In any case, the fluorescence equilibration between photobleached and unbleached nuclei in monokaryons of either cell type (HeLa <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> = 40 min, <italic>crt</italic><sup>+/+</sup><italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;</sub> = 10 min) indicates that TR&#x003b1; shuttles rapidly under these conditions.</p><p>As treatment with LMB results in covalent modification of a critical cysteine residue within CRM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>), this potential cooperative interaction with CRT may be abolished upon LMB treatment. As such, CRT may still be capable of binding TR&#x003b1; and facilitating export, albeit to a lesser extent. This would explain our results in which TR&#x003b1; shuttling in HeLa and <italic>crt</italic><sup>+/+</sup> monokaryons occurs only slowly after treatment with LMB.</p><p>Finally, our model takes into account the cell fusion-dependent release of CRT during heterokaryon experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) and explains the stark contrast between LMB-insensitive TR&#x003b1; shuttling in heterokaryons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>) <italic>versus</italic> LMB-sensitive shuttling in monokaryons (present study). Although CRT may be the limiting factor in TR&#x003b1; nuclear export under normal circumstances, this limitation is countered by the increased efficiency of export resulting from the cooperative pathway involving CRM1 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Although CRM1 is undoubtedly inactivated by LMB treatment in heterokaryons, the attenuated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling expected may not be observed due to the increased cytosolic levels of CRT resulting from PEG-induced cell fusion. Under these conditions, the relatively low levels of CRT found within the nucleus or cytosol under normal circumstances would be markedly increased and its low levels would no longer be limiting. Although, according to this model, autonomous CRT-mediated export of TR&#x003b1; is not as efficient as cooperative export in the presence of CRM1, the sheer increase in free CRT directly after cell fusion may be enough to overcome this deficiency and allow rapid nuclear export to proceed in the presence of LMB (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p>Previously, the only support for the hypothesis that CRT mediates export of TR was the finding that the DBD of TR&#x003b2; is sufficient to confer nuclear export when fused to a GFP reporter. The DBDs of TR&#x003b2; and GR share 43% sequence homology and, most importantly, the amino acids predicted to be key for CRT binding are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Thus, it is not unreasonable to propose that the TR&#x003b2; DBD could also interact directly with CRT, as has been shown for the GR DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Examining the specific nucleocytoplasmic shuttling properties of TR&#x003b1; domains within CRT-deficient and CRT-expressing cell lines will provide valuable insight into the physical basis for TR&#x003b1; binding of CRT. Comprehensive analysis of the effects of mutations by <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays and <italic>in vivo</italic> functional assays should help to identify and clarify those specific amino acid sequences required for nuclear export, as well as nuclear import, of TR&#x003b1;.</p><p>In a prior study we showed that <italic>in vitro</italic>-generated <sup>35</sup>S-labeled TR&#x003b1; does not interact with purified CRM1 in a His pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). However, most CRM1-dependent NESs bind CRM1 with low affinity and often require additional adapter proteins to serve as a bridge between CRM1 and the cargo protein being exported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). For example, Ran-binding protein 3 (RanBP3) directly binds CRM1 in the nucleus and increases the affinity of CRM1 for NES containing cargo as well as RanGTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). In addition, RanBP3 binding also maximizes the interaction of the CRM1 export complex with nucleoporins of the nuclear pore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>). Similar conditions are observed for CRM1 binding of other regulatory proteins that participate in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Although steroid receptor coactivator-1 contains two clusters of hydrophobic amino acids similar to the classic leucine-rich NES associated with CRM1-mediated nuclear export, this protein failed to accumulate within the nuclei of COS-7 cells when these regions were mutated even though its export was sensitive to LMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>). Presumably then, an unknown adapter protein that is recognized by both CRM1 and steroid receptor coactivator-1 accounts for the nuclear accumulation of steroid receptor coactivator-1 upon LMB treatment. Other examples include both the 60 S and 40 S ribosomal subunits of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic> These large complexes undergo CRM1-mediated nuclear export in an adapter-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>). Such situations are analogous to our TR&#x003b1; export pathway model in which additional export factors may be required to facilitate the CRM1-dependent component of TR&#x003b1; translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm.</p><p>The model presented here explains several previously anomalous observations relating to CRT, CRM1, and nuclear receptor export in general. There is certainly a discrepancy between the shuttling kinetics of nuclear receptors in a heterokaryon system <italic>versus</italic> under other experimental conditions, such as those reported in Walther <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). Particularly striking is the disparity observed between protein shuttling within <italic>in vivo</italic> monokaryon experiments compared with the interspecies heterokaryon assay. Here, for the first time, the observation that some nuclear receptors such as TR&#x003b1; (present study) and GR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>) rely in part on CRM1-dependent nuclear export can be reconciled with the observation that cell lines deficient in CRT expression, but retaining their CRM1 activity, fail to support nuclear export of the same proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) (present study).</p><p>Interestingly, we have also shown that the p53 tumor suppressor protein displays highly reduced shuttling kinetics in <italic>crt</italic><sup>+/+</sup> monokaryons as compared with heterokaryon assays using HeLa and NIH/3T3 cells.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">5</xref> Although the significance of these observations remain to be determined, they again high-light the complexity of nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways and point to a similar discrepancy between p53 shuttling under <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. As p53 undergoes nuclear export in a CRM1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>), this observation should be considered when designing experiments that attempt to utilize p53 as a control for CRM1 activity.</p><p>These data provide insight into the nuclear export pathway of TR&#x003b1; and suggest a possible mechanism by which other shuttling proteins may use complex and, to some extent, functionally redundant export modes involving both characterized pathways (CRM1) and a multitude of other chaperones. In addition, these results also represent a novel role in nuclear export for the functionally diverse protein CRT. Although more research will be necessary to precisely determine the significance of this cooperative export pathway, regulation of TR&#x003b1; target genes may be influenced in several ways. Inefficient TR&#x003b1; nuclear export in the absence of CRT could, for example, be indicative of an evolved compensatory mechanism to up-regulate the transcription of genes involved in similar cellular processes as the numerous ones that have been identified for CRT. Conversely, rapid shuttling of TR&#x003b1; dependent on an intact cooperative export pathway may be representative of a general mechanism to clear shuttling transcription factors from the nucleus under physiological conditions. This cooperative CRM1/CRT-mediated nuclear export pathway may be relevant to related members of the nuclear receptor superfamily other than TR&#x003b1;. Identification of this export pathway and other mechanisms by which nuclear receptors exit the nucleus will contribute substantially to understanding the regulatory activity of these proteins. One challenge for the future will be to examine how regulation of this cellular compartmentalization is impaired or altered in the case of aberrant nuclear receptor expression. In addition, defining how nuclear export integrates TR&#x003b1; activity with other signaling pathways may provide important clues as to the mode of action of mutant TRs that are responsible for a host of pathological conditions including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Bunn, C.
