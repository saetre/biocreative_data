By construction and analysis of a conditional loss of mitotic function allele of the nuclear mitotic apparatus (NuMA) protein in mice and cultured primary cells, we demonstrate that NuMA is an essential mitotic component with distinct contributions to the establishment and maintenance of focused spindle poles. When mitotic NuMA function is disrupted, centrosomes provide initial focusing activity, but continued centrosome attachment to spindle fibers under tension is defective, and the maintenance of focused kinetochore fibers at spindle poles throughout mitosis is prevented. Without centrosomes and NuMA, initial establishment of spindle microtubule focusing completely fails. Thus, NuMA is a defining feature of the mammalian spindle pole and functions as an essential tether linking bulk microtubules of the spindle to centrosomes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mitotic spindle is a bipolar array of microtubules required for the alignment and segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. The poles of the spindle are major focal points for the minus ends of spindle microtubules and serve as the final destination for chromosomes segregated in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Compton, 1998</xref>). In animal somatic cell mitosis, spindle poles are coincident with centrosomes, the major cellular microtubule-organizing structures. However, centrosomes are not required for the formation of the spindle or the pole. In vitro, DNA-coated beads catalyze the formation of bipolar microtubule spindles in acentrosomal <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heald et al., 1996</xref>). Additionally, bipolar spindles also form in somatic mitotic cells in which centrosomes have been destroyed by laser ablation or prevented from forming normally by depletion of essential centrosomal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khodjakov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahoney et al., 2006</xref>). Previous studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts in vitro have established a role for the abundant spindle pole&#x02013;localized nuclear mitotic apparatus (NuMA) protein in centrosome-independent spindle pole formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heald et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merdes et al., 2000</xref>). However, the relative contributions of NuMA and centrosomes in the establishment and maintenance of spindle pole integrity remain to be determined.</p><p>The attachment and movement of chromosomes on the mitotic spindle is mediated by kinetochore fibers, bundles of microtubules that link spindle poles to the kinetochores of each chromosome. Microtubules are nucleated in both a centrosome-dependent and -independent manner. Many are initiated directly at the pole by &#x003b3;-tubulin&#x02013;dependent nucleation, whereas others are nucleated adjacent to kinetochores through the local activation of components such as Tpx2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tulu et al., 2006</xref>). In the mitotic cytoplasm, these components are inactive as the result of binding to the importins but can be released by a chromosome-generated gradient of Ran-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gruss and Vernos, 2004</xref>). Under these conditions, microtubules nucleated in the vicinity of kinetochores are elongated and captured by centrosomal microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dasso, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khodjakov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maiato et al., 2004</xref>). How these kinetochore-associated bundles are captured and focused toward centrosomes has not been determined. In addition, the means for sustained anchoring of kinetochore fibers at spindle poles and the role of centrosomes in both active focusing and the maintenance of spindle pole integrity are not established.</p><p>NuMA, along with cytoplasmic dynein, has been proposed to participate in focusing microtubules toward the poles of the mitotic spindle and physically tethering centrosomes to spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merdes et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khodjakov et al., 2003</xref>). The foundation for our current mechanistic understanding of the role for NuMA during mitosis was established by work in cell-free extracts. Compared with typical mammalian spindles, those formed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts are much larger, undergo substantially greater microtubule flux, and have limited astral microtubules and no cortical attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ganem and Compton, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, spindles formed in egg extracts rely significantly more on a gradient of Ran-GTP emanating from chromosomes to contribute to spindle assembly and have relatively few bundled microtubules comprising kinetochore fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kalab et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2006</xref>).</p><p>Investigations of NuMA function in mammalian mitosis have previously used antibody microinjection approaches, which have yielded contradictory outcomes. An early study reported spindle collapse to monopolarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang and Snyder, 1992</xref>), and subsequent efforts demonstrated unfocused spindle poles and an extended mitotic delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaglio et al., 1995</xref>). The difficulty in using siRNA to remove the abundant and long-lived NuMA protein has confounded strategies to determine mitotic NuMA function in the mammalian context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Elbashir et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chang et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, during interphase, NuMA accumulates in the nucleus, where it has been proposed to participate in aspects of nuclear structure and/or function, which might also be disrupted during extended siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Merdes and Cleveland, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harborth et al., 1999</xref>). To specifically test the principles of mammalian spindle assembly, particularly the mechanisms of spindle pole focusing and the maintenance of pole integrity, we now use gene replacement to engineer mice and cells in which NuMA's mitotic function can be selectively disrupted by administration of the small molecule 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). Using this system, we demonstrate that NuMA is essential for early embryogenesis and cellular proliferation. During the first mitosis after inactivation of NuMA, spindles initially form with microtubules focused at centrosomes. However, subsequent to initial spindle assembly and upon generation of spindles forces, centrosome&#x02013;spindle attachment is uncoupled. As a consequence, kinetochore fibers defocus, and centrosomes fail to maintain and reestablish connection with the spindle. Surprisingly, chromosome segregation is largely intact even without NuMA anchoring of kinetochore fibers to centrosomes. From these findings, we propose that NuMA is essential to maintain centrosome attachments to kinetochore fibers in mammalian mitosis and suggest that NuMA functions redundantly with centrosomes for initial focusing of microtubules at spindle poles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Creation of mice with a conditional exon 22 deletion allele of NuMA</title><p>Immunoblotting of extracts from a panel of mouse tissues indicated that NuMA was expressed at similar levels in most tissues examined (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810091/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810091/DC1</ext-link>). In contrast, Mad2, BubR1, and centromere protein E (CENP-E), which are thought to be primarily or exclusively functional during mitosis, were only detected in the testes and spleen, which contain large numbers of dividing cells. Expression of the nuclear proteins lamin A and C was detected in all tissues examined and closely mirrored the expression of NuMA (Fig. S1 A). Examination of NuMA localization by immunostaining of terminally differentiated motor or Purkinje neurons demonstrated that NuMA was exclusively nuclear but excluded from nucleoli (Fig. S1 B). The near-ubiquitous expression pattern and accumulation of NuMA in nuclei of long-lived postmitotic cells supports the possibility of a nonmitotic interphase function of NuMA.</p><p>To test a mitotic role for NuMA without disrupting putative nuclear functions, we used gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to create a conditional loss of mitotic function allele of NuMA. To do this, we identified an in-frame deletion within the NuMA gene that eliminated its microtubule binding without affecting intranuclear accumulation in interphase. The tubulin-binding domain of NuMA is comprised of an &#x0223c;100 amino acid region in the C-terminal globular tail of NuMA, which interacts directly with tubulin in vitro and mediates its localization to spindle poles in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haren and Merdes, 2002</xref>). Mouse and human NuMA share 88% of amino acid identity in this domain, which is partially encoded by nucleotides comprising the 22nd exon of the mouse NuMA gene. We tested the localization of GFP-tagged versions of the 410 amino acid C-terminal globular tail of the mouse NuMA protein that were either wild-type or deleted for residues encoded by exon 22 (Fig. S2, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810091/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810091/DC1</ext-link>). The C-terminal tail was used to avoid association of tagged NuMA with endogenous NuMA through the central coiled-coil dimerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harborth et al., 1995</xref>). As expected, a wild-type NuMA tail fragment tagged with GFP localized appropriately to nuclei in interphase and was present in the crescent-shaped pattern typical of endogenous NuMA at spindle poles during mitosis (Fig. S2 C). The same GFP tail fragment, but lacking the 59 amino acids encoded by exon 22, was also nuclear during interphase but was severely compromised in localization to spindle poles during mitosis (Fig. S2, C and D).</p><p>Therefore, we generated a targeting construct designed to produce an allele of NuMA in which exon 22 could be conditionally deleted through the action of the Cre recombinase. Homologous recombination in mouse ES cells was used to flank exon 22 with loxP sites to create a NuMA<sup>Neo</sup> allele in which the Neo gene was itself deleteable by the action of the flipase (Flp) recombinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). ES clones were screened by PCR and DNA blotting for homologous recombination at 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the exon 22 targeting construct, and multiple targeted clones were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B&#x02013;D</xref>). Two independently targeted ES cell lines were used to generate mice. These animals were crossed to an Flp-enhanced deleter strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rodriguez et al., 2000</xref>) to remove the Flp recombinase target (FRT)&#x02013;flanked neomycin gene from intron 22, thereby generating a conditional allele, NuMA<sup>flox</sup>. Subsequent mating to the ZP3-Cre mouse line expressing the Cre recombinase in the female germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewandoski et al., 1997</xref>) produced animals heterozygous for the NuMA deletion allele, NuMA<sup>&#x00394;22</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Genotypes were confirmed using a three-primer PCR reaction capable of distinguishing wild type and each of the engineered NuMA alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Creation of conditional and disrupted NuMA alleles.</bold> (A) Schematic representations of (i) a portion of the mouse NuMA gene including exons 16&#x02013;25 and EcoRI restriction sites, (ii) the exon 22 targeting vector showing the neomycin resistance (Neo) and diphtheria toxin (DT) cassettes and placement of loxP and FRT sites, (iii) the structure of the correctly targeted allele with the introduced SacII restriction site and locations of genotyping primers, (iv) the conditional allele (flox) produced by Flp-enhanced recombinase&#x02013;mediated recombination of FRT sites flanking Neo, and (v) the deletion allele (&#x00394;) produced by Cre recombination of loxP sites surrounding exon 22.

Taking advantage of this hypomorphic expression from NuMA<sup>Neo</sup>, we tested the requirement for NuMA in embryonic development and viability and found that the NuMA<sup>Neo</sup> allele could not be bred to homozygosity. No NuMA<sup>Neo/Neo</sup> live pups or early embryos were ever recovered (0/88 pups and 0/50 embryos; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). As expected, the conditional NuMA<sup>flox</sup> allele, produced by Flp-mediated removal of the neomycin marker, was readily bred to homozygosity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).

These observations indicate that loss of NuMA function during mitosis does not prevent the initial timely establishment of focused bipolar spindles but results in centrosome loss from the spindle poles before anaphase followed by microtubule defocusing.

To confirm that a potential nuclear defect in NuMA<sup>&#x00394;22/&#x00394;22</sup> cells was not responsible for the subsequent mitotic deficits, we performed an in vivo test for retention of nuclear function of the NuMA<sup>&#x00394;22</sup> protein. To do this, wild-type NuMA was replaced with NuMA<sup>&#x00394;22</sup> protein in spinal cord motor neurons, a cell type in which NuMA is known to be present in nuclei in adult neurons (Fig. S1 B). These cells were chosen for two reasons: first, defects in motor neuron function give rise to characteristic and easily scorable motor deficits, including gait alterations and paralysis. Second, the lifetimes of individual neurons extend for the full life span of the organism, allowing access to any age-dependent features of loss of interphase NuMA function.</p><p>NuMA was deleted specifically from motor neurons by crossing the NuMA<sup>flox</sup> allele with animals carrying the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAchT)&#x02013;Cre transgene. This transgene has previously been demonstrated to direct Cre recombinase expression exclusively in motor neurons after the final division of motor neuron progenitors, ensuring that any phenotypes would arise exclusively from postmitotic loss of NuMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Misawa et al., 2003</xref>).

Examination of spinal cord and sagittal brain sections from VAchT-Cre,ROSA26R mice for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity confirmed that Cre expression was restricted to motor neurons (Fig. S5 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810091/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810091/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>Extensive visual observation demonstrated that NuMA<sup>flox/flox</sup>,VAchT-Cre animals showed no behavioral defects indicative of motor neuron dysfunction, even at up to 2 yr of age.

Finally, counting of cresyl violet&#x02013;stained motor neuron cell bodies in spinal cord sections of 200-d-old animals revealed no effect on motor neuron numbers (Fig. S5 C). Thus, the exon 22&#x02013;deleted mutant complements all potential nuclear functions of NuMA and does so for extended periods in vivo.

This strongly supports a maintenance rather than establishment role for NuMA in the attachment of centrosomes to kinetochore fibers. To further test this, we arrested NuMA wild-type, NuMA<sup>+/&#x00394;22</sup>, and NuMA<sup>&#x00394;22/&#x00394;22</sup> cells in mitosis with the Eg5 inhibitor S-trityl-<sc>l</sc>-cysteine (STLC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Skoufias et al., 2006</xref>). Eg5 is a bipolar, homotetrameric, kinesin-related motor protein that is required during mitosis to both establish and maintain separation of centrosomes. It is thought to function by cross-linking and sliding apart antiparallel microtubules from opposing centrosomes, thereby pushing centrosomes apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>). STLC inhibits activity of Eg5, causing collapse of bipolar spindles. Regardless of genotype, in the absence of STLC, monopolar spindles were observed with equally low frequency in all cell lines, but upon STLC treatment, all MEF cell lines produced a high frequency of monopolar spindles that appeared almost exclusively as chromosome rosettes surrounding a central &#x003b3;-tubulin&#x02013;positive pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>). This indicates that in monopolar spindles, centrosomes continue to dictate the location of spindle pole formation when NuMA function is disrupted. Furthermore, under these conditions, kinetochore fibers do not require NuMA for active focusing toward centrosomes.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Prometaphase centrosome separation and centrosome-independent spindle pole focusing require NuMA.</bold> (A) Primary MEFs were arrested in mitosis by treatment with STLC and processed for immunofluorescence.

How can this be reconciled with a maintenance role of NuMA in centrosome&#x02013;spindle coupling? Relative to bipolar metaphase spindles, monopolar spindles have reduced tension forces acting between centrosomes and kinetochores. Thus, the spindle defects produced in cycling NuMA<sup>&#x00394;22/&#x00394;22</sup> cells likely reflect a requirement for NuMA in maintaining centrosomes at poles of spindles experiencing typical metaphase forces. To directly test this possibility, STLC was washed out from monopolar-arrested cells to reintroduce tension into spindles with kinetochore fibers focused toward a monopole. 1 h after release, cells were fixed for immunofluorescence. In control cells, anaphases always had one centrosome at each pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). In contrast, NuMA<sup>&#x00394;22/&#x00394;22</sup> cells displayed anaphase figures in which chromosomes had segregated normally, but spindle poles were defocused, and centrosomes (detected as discrete foci of strong &#x003b3;-tubulin staining) had failed to separate.</p><p>These results were corroborated by following the recovery of spindle bipolarity in retrovirally transduced &#x003b1;-tubulin-YFP&#x02013;expressing fibroblasts.

However, after the reestablishment of tension, NuMA<sup>&#x00394;22/&#x00394;22</sup> fibroblasts often formed spindles with one well-focused pole and one splayed spindle pole lacking a centrosome (8/13 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref> and Video 4).

These cone-shaped spindles were not arrested monopolar spindles observed in profile because they uniformly proceeded into anaphase, indicating that mitotic checkpoint signaling was silenced. These data demonstrate that normal NuMA function is required for centrosome separation after recovery from a monopolar state. In addition, because the centrosome distal half of each NuMA-deficient spindle forms a splayed pole after release from STLC, we conclude that in the absence of centrosomes, NuMA is required for the establishment of microtubule focusing.</p></sec><sec><title>Stable kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule interactions are required for centrosome separation after recovery from monopolarity</title><p>The aforementioned evidence demonstrates a requirement for NuMA in the physical tethering of centrosomes to kinetochore fibers and reveals the surprising finding that centrosome&#x02013;spindle connections are required for centrosome separation after recovery from monopolarity. This finding has important implications for the mechanism of centrosome separation during reestablishment of spindle bipolarity in prometaphase. Therefore, we specifically tested whether stable microtubule&#x02013;kinetochore attachments are also required for centrosome separation in recovering monopolar spindles. The Ndc80 complex, a heterotetramer composed of the Ndc80, Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25 proteins, is a key component involved in the stable attachment of microtubule bundles at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheeseman and Desai, 2005</xref>).

These cells were arrested with monopolar spindles using STLC, the drug was removed, and time-lapse fluorescence microscopy was used to observe recovery of spindle bipolarity. 90 min after STLC washout, all but 3% of control siRNA-treated cells had separated their centrosomes and formed bipolar spindles. However, in the same period of time, 35% of Nuf2-depleted spindles failed to resolve their centrosomes and form bipolar spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, B and C</xref>).

By combining inducible inactivation of this allele with a prolonged G0/G1 arrest, we were able to achieve nearly quantitative turnover of accumulated wild-type NuMA protein before the first mitotic division. Strikingly, we show that in the absence of functional NuMA, and despite apparently normal initial bipolar spindle formation, centrosomes are unable to maintain attachment to the ends of kinetochore fibers. The subsequent defocusing of microtubules at spindle poles reveals a distinct requirement for NuMA in the maintenance of mammalian centrosome&#x02013;spindle attachments.</p><sec><title>Mechanisms and maintenance of microtubule focusing at poles</title><p>A previous study has implicated a role for NuMA-mediated capture of kinetochore fibers in pole focusing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khodjakov et al., 2003</xref>). This has been proposed to occur through the capture of kinetochore fibers by NuMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khodjakov et al., 2003</xref>), which itself is transported toward spindle poles, likely on centrosomal/astral microtubules by dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merdes et al., 2000</xref>). However, centrosomes are not required for microtubule focusing or NuMA localization to spindle poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khodjakov et al., 2000</xref>). Our efforts in this study have extended this to demonstrate that in the absence of functional NuMA, initial bipolar spindle formation proceeds normally. However, after the establishment of tension across kinetochores, centrosomes subsequently detach from the spindle, and microtubules defocus. This demonstrates that NuMA is required to physically tether kinetochore fiber minus ends at the poles of bipolar spindles under tension and provides the first evidence that an essential function of NuMA during mitosis is in the maintenance and not establishment of mammalian centrosomal&#x02013;spindle connections.</p><p>The normal initiation of bipolar spindle formation in the absence of NuMA suggests the existence of alternative processes involved in establishing focused spindle poles. These are likely to be dependent on the presence of centrosomes, which might function in cooperation with components such as HSET in mammals and Ncd in <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gordon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goshima et al., 2005</xref>). This interpretation is corroborated by our observation that after recovery from monopolarity, microtubules in NuMA<sup>&#x00394;22/&#x00394;22</sup> fibroblasts are severely defocused in the acentrosomal spindle half. The formation of these monoastral, bipolar cone-shaped spindles provides clear evidence that NuMA is required for spindle pole focusing in the absence of centrosomes. Thus, NuMA and centrosomes function redundantly in establishing spindle poles by contributing independently to initial microtubule focusing. It is likely that mammalian acentrosomal spindle systems, including mouse oocytes, rely heavily on NuMA for the establishment of spindle poles, which is a question now testable with the NuMA<sup>&#x00394;22</sup> allele.</p><p>Disruption of dynein function gives rise to defects similar to those we have observed in NuMA<sup>&#x00394;22/&#x00394;22</sup> MEFs, including centrosome&#x02013;spindle uncoupling and, to a lesser extent, a mild degree of kinetochore fiber defocusing during metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heald et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goshima et al., 2005</xref>). In multiple contexts, dynein inhibition causes NuMA to redistribute from spindle poles to along the length of spindle microtubules. This suggests that a major function of spindle-localized dynein in mitosis may be to transport NuMA as a cargo to microtubule minus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gaglio et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merdes et al., 2000</xref>). The rapid kinetics of NuMA localization to spindle poles and the kinetochore fiber&#x02013;independent nature of NuMA accumulation at poles (unpublished data) is consistent with this interpretation. Therefore, much of the phenotype caused by inhibition of dynein function may be a direct result of a failure to properly localize NuMA.</p></sec><sec><title>Function of Eg5 in prometaphase centrosome separation</title><p>In mitotic prophase before nuclear envelope breakdown, two duplicated centrosomes move across the nuclear envelope in a dynein-dependent manner to diametrically oppose each other in anticipation of bipolar spindle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gonczy et al., 1999</xref>). Maintenance of centrosome separation after nuclear envelope breakdown requires activity of the plus end&#x02013;directed motor Eg5, which acts to slide apart antiparallel microtubules that emanate directly from centrosomes. Inhibition of Eg5 activity causes centrosome collapse after nuclear envelope breakdown, triggering an extended mitotic delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Skoufias et al., 2006</xref>). Surprisingly, we demonstrate that centrosome separation fails after restoration of Eg5 activity in monopolar NuMA<sup>&#x00394;22/&#x00394;22</sup> cells, indicating a novel function for NuMA in mitosis. Anchoring of kinetochore fibers at the spindle pole may be critical to allow Eg5 to drive initial separation of juxtaposed centrosomes. Once this occurs, overlapping antiparallel arrays of microtubules are formed between centrosomes, providing forces to drive further centrosome separation. Consistent with this interpretation, in the absence of stable kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule interactions, centrosome separation after release from monopolarity is also inhibited. Thus, we provide a demonstration that Eg5-dependent centrosome separation requires the two-point attachment of microtubules at kinetochores and centrosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromosome segregation in the absence of focused poles</title><p>The striking spindle defects observed in NuMA<sup>&#x00394;22/&#x00394;22</sup> fibroblasts did not delay progression through mitosis. Because a single unattached kinetochore is capable of delaying anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rieder et al., 1994</xref>), this indicates that microtubule capture by kinetochores occurs efficiently in the absence of functional NuMA. Furthermore, bulk chromosome segregation was observed to occur normally on spindles with detached centrosomes and defocused poles. These observations indicate that pole focusing is not an absolute requirement for (a) all kinetochores to be attached to spindle microtubules and (b) the bulk of chromosomes to be aligned and segregated in anaphase. Indeed, plant cells carry out faithful mitoses without centrosomes, using spindles without discernibly focused poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Franklin and Cande, 1999</xref>). Additionally, mechanical severing of kinetochore fibers between spindle poles and kinetochores has been shown to not prevent continued poleward chromosome movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nicklas, 1989</xref>).</p><p>Although bulk chromosome segregation occurs normally, most NuMA<sup>&#x00394;22/&#x00394;22</sup> cells exhibited modest chromosome alignment defects, such as an elongated spindle and reduced tension across sister kinetochores. These defects are likely to result in chromosome segregation errors that explain the requirement of NuMA-dependent pole focusing for mouse embryonic viability and normal cellular proliferation. This is consistent with chromosome missegregation driving embryonic lethality (e.g., from loss of the centromere motor/tether CENP-E; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Putkey et al., 2002</xref>). Alternatively, the early lethality of NuMA<sup>&#x00394;22/&#x00394;22</sup> embryos may result from missegregation of centrosomes or centrioles as spindle cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pickett-Heaps 1969</xref>), which are not required for mitotic spindle function but are essential for normal embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chatzimeletiou et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, our evidence collectively demonstrates that NuMA and its role in focusing spindle poles is a required component of normal mammalian mitotic progression and embryonic development.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Construction of NuMA-targeted mice</title><p>A mouse 129S6/SvEvTac bacterial artificial chromosome genomic library (RPCI-22; Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA) was screened for the NuMA gene with a probe to the largest exon of NuMA.
