An important mechanism for receptor downregulation <italic>in vivo</italic> is via the inward budding of receptors into intralumenal vesicles to form specialized endosomes called multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that subsequently fuse with lysosomes, degrading their cargo. This process requires four heterooligomeric protein complexes collectively termed the ESCRT machinery. In yeast, ESCRT-I is a heterotetrameric complex comprised of three conserved subunits and a fourth subunit for which identifiable metazoan homologs were lacking. Using <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we identify MVB-12, a fourth metazoan ESCRT-I subunit. Depletion of MVB-12 slows the kinetics of receptor downregulation <italic>in vivo</italic>, but to a lesser extent than inhibition of other ESCRT-I subunits. Consistent with these findings, targeting of MVB-12 to membranes requires the other ESCRT-I subunits, but MVB-12 is not required to target the remaining ESCRT-I components. Both endogenous and recombinant ESCRT-I are stable complexes with a 1:1:1:1 subunit stoichiometry. MVB-12 has two human homologs that co-localize and co-immunoprecipitate with the ESCRT-I component TSG101. Thus, MVB-12 is a conserved core component of metazoan ESCRT-I that regulates its activity during MVB biogenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The binding of mitogenic growth factors to cell surface receptors in eukaryotic cells initiates signaling cascades that influence fundamental processes including cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Schlessinger1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Vivekanand1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the MVB pathway, ESCRT-I functions early, along with ESCRT-0 and -II, in the recognition and sorting of mono-ubiquitylated cargo and the formation of intralumenal vesicles. In budding yeast, ESCRT-I was originally characterized as a heterotrimeric complex containing three proteins Vps23p, Vps28p, and Vps37p, that all have clearly conserved metazoan orthologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Katzmann2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Disruption of any of these broadly conserved ESCRT-I components results in a severe phenotype in which morphologically normal MVBs fail to form. Recently, a fourth yeast ESCRT-I subunit, Mvb12p, whose deletion results in a less severe phenotype characterized by a partial sorting defect was described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Chu1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Kostelansky1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike other ESCRT-I components, Mvb12p lacks clear homologs in metazoans. However, both yeast and mammalian ESCRT-I exhibit similar sizing profiles by gel filtration chromatography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Katzmann2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Kostelansky1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Bache2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that metazoans may also possess a fourth subunit.</p><p>Here, we use <italic>C. elegans</italic> to identify and functionally characterize a new subunit of metazoan ESCRT-I. In addition to the three conserved subunits (TSG-101, VPS-28, and VPS-37), tandem affinity purification of VPS-37 revealed the presence of a fourth <italic>C. elegans</italic> ESCRT-I subunit that we name MVB-12. MVB-12 is conserved among metazoans, but is &#x0223c;3 fold larger and bears no clear sequence similarity to the yeast protein Mvb12p. Hydrodynamic analysis of endogenous and recombinant ESCRT-I reveals that both are stable heterotetrameric complexes, with a native molecular weight of &#x0223c;125 kD, reflecting a 1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1 association of the four subunits. Depletion of MVB-12 slows the kinetics of cell surface receptor downregulation, consistent with a function in ESCRT-mediated MVB sorting. We also identify two human homologs of MVB-12, MVB12A and MVB12B, that both associate with human ESCRT-I <italic>in vivo</italic>. Together, our data indicate that metazoans, like yeast, possess a fourth subunit that regulates ESCRT-I function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ESCRT-I functions in the downregulation of cell surface proteins in C. elegans</title><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, oocyte ovulation and fertilization is accompanied by a series of membrane remodeling events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Greenstein1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> that include the internalization and subsequent degradation of several cell surface markers including the LDL-like yolk receptor RME-2 and CAV-1, a member of the caveolin protein family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Sato1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Grant1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The reproducible kinetics of these events with respect to ovulation makes this an excellent system to define the molecular components necessary for the downregulation and subsequent degradation of cell surface proteins. To study the contribution of the ESCRT machinery to the downregulation of cell surface proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we began by examining the role of ESCRT-I, a heterooligomeric complex required for the internalization of cell surface proteins into intralumenal vesicles to form specialized endosomes called multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that fuse with lysosomes to degrade their cargo. Blast searches identified <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologs for each of the three components of the ESCRT-I complex previously shown to be conserved between yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000956-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). To characterize the role of ESCRT-I in the dynamics of cell surface proteins during the oocyte to embryo transition, we began by analyzing GFP:CAV-1. In control oocytes prior to fertilization, GFP:CAV-1 is concentrated in intracellular vesicles and large ring-like cytoplasmic structures as well as localizing weakly to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000956-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, control, -1 oocyte). Immediately after oocytes pass through the spermatheca and are fertilized, the amount of GFP:CAV-1 on the cell surface rapidly increases, followed by its internalization and degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Sato1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Since, adult <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites ovulate approximately every 20 minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-McCarter1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, examination of the string of newly fertilized embryos present in an adult worm provides a convenient means of monitoring the timecourse of the changes in the GFP:CAV-1 distribution. Newly fertilized embryos exhibited bright GFP:CAV-1 fluorescence, initially at the cell surface and subsequently on internal membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000956-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, control, &#x0002b;1 embryo), but embryos beyond the 2-cell stage, approximately 90 minutes post fertilization, lacked visible fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000956-g001">Fig 1C</xref>, &#x0002b;3 and &#x0002b;4 embryos). Individual depletions of the three conserved ESCRT-I components did not affect the post-fertilization increase in the amount of GFP:CAV-1 on the cell surface or its subsequent re-internalization. However, embryos depleted of each component exhibited a substantial delay in the degradation of internalized GFP:CAV-1, which remained on internal membranes well beyond the two cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000956-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). We also observed similar inhibition of the degradation of internalized RME-2:GFP (described in detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000956-g004">Fig. 4</xref> below). We conclude that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ESCRT-I complex has a conserved role in the degradation of internalized cell surface proteins that can be conveniently visualized by monitoring the fate of proteins normally targeted for degradation following fertilization.</p><fig id="pone-0000956-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000956.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>ESCRT-I components mediate degradation of the cell surface protein GFP:CAV-1 after its internalization.</title><p>(A) Table listing the known subunits of ESCRT-I in <italic>S. cerevisiae, H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

Since depletion of the other three ESCRT-I subunits inhibits the degradation of internalized cell surface proteins, we wanted to determine if depletion of MVB-12 also affects this process. To characterize the effects of MVB-12 depletion, we examined the degradation of a GFP fusion with the LDL-like receptor RME-2. Unlike GFP:CAV-1, which is variably degraded between 30 and 90 minutes post-fertilization, the dynamics of RME-2:GFP are highly reproducible. Within 20 min of ovulation in control zygotes, the entire population of RME-2:GFP has been internalized from the plasma membrane, and is observed coincident with RFP:RAB-5 positive early endosomes en route to degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000956-g004">Fig. 4A&#x02013;C</xref>). By 35 minutes post ovulation, more than 90&#x00025; of RME-2:GFP positive endosomes are no longer positive for RFP:RAB-5, indicating that the RME-2:GFP has progressed beyond the early endosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000956-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>), and after an additional 30 minutes (&#x0223c;65 minutes post ovulation), more than 90&#x00025; of the total RME-2:GFP fluorescence present 10 minutes post ovulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000956-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>) has been lost, indicating that the RME-2:GFP has been largely degraded. The internalization of RME-2:GFP from the plasma membrane occurred with relatively normal kinetics following depletion of either TSG-101 or MVB-12, however delays in the ability of RME-2:GFP to progress beyond RFP:RAB-5 positive structures and in its degradation were observed for both conditions. In TSG-101 depleted embryos, RME-2:GFP continued to localize to RFP:RAB-5 positive compartments more than 100 minutes post ovulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000956-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) and RME-2:GFP fluorescence was still detected more than 150 minutes post ovulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000956-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). In contrast, depletion of MVB-12 resulted in more moderate defects. In MVB-12 depleted embryos, the progression of RME-2:GFP to a post RFP:RAB-5 compartment was delayed by &#x0223c;10 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000956-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) and an intermediate delay in RME-2:GFP degradation was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000956-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). Cumulatively, these results indicate that although MVB-12 is not essential for the degradation of internalized cell surface proteins, it accelerates the kinetics of this process, consistent with a role for MVB-12 in modulating ESCRT-I activity. It is interesting that inhibition of the fourth yeast subunit, Mvb12p, also exhibits a relatively subtle defect in comparison to loss of the other ESCRT-I subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Chu1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Kostelansky1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, exhibiting only a partial defect in MVB sorting.

Here we use <italic>C. elegans</italic> to identify and characterize a fourth subunit of the metazoan ESCRT-I complex. In addition to the known components TSG-101, VPS-28, and VPS-37, tandem affinity purification of ESCRT-I from embryos followed by mass spectrometry identified MVB-12. Like the other subunits of ESCRT-I, MVB-12 requires TSG-101 to localize to endosomal membranes and the AAA-type ATPase VPS-4 for its subsequent release and recycling. A comparison of the hydrodynamic properties of endogenous and purified recombinant ESCRT-I indicates that MVB-12 is a stable subunit of the complex, which exhibits a 1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1 subunit stoichiometry. Depletion of MVB-12 perturbs receptor downregulation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, although not as severely as other ESCRT-I subunits. Based on its primary sequence, we also identified two human homologs of MVB-12, both of which interact with ESCRT-I in HeLa cells and likely define new subunits of human ESCRT-I. Our data suggest that MVB-12 enhances ESCRT-I activity <italic>in vivo</italic> and define a potentially new target for affecting receptor signaling and/or viral budding in human disease.</p><p>The metazoan fourth subunits are &#x0223c;3 fold larger and bear no clear sequence similarity to the fourth subunit previously identified in yeast. Despite our use of a common nomenclature, the dissimilarities raise the interesting question of why three of the ESCRT-I subunits exhibit broad conservation among eukaryotes, whereas the fourth exhibits a high degree of divergence. Our data suggest that there will likely be commonalities in both the way that the divergent fourth subunits associate with the three conserved subunits and in their function. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, like deletion of Mvb12p which results in a partial defect in MVB sorting that is relatively subtle in comparison to loss of other ESCRT-I subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Chu1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Kostelansky1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, depletion of MVB-12 delays but does not block receptor downregulation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, unlike the much more severe phenotype seen following depletion of other ESCRT-I subunits. Second, both the yeast and <italic>C. elegans</italic> ESCRT-I are heterotetrameric complexes with 1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1&#x02236;1 subunit stoichiometries. Third, the behavior of both complexes, as well as human ESCRT-I, during gel filtration chromatography is similar, yielding an apparent molecular weight of 300&#x02013;450 kD. Based on structural studies, yeast ESCRT-I adopts an elongated conformation that predicts its elution volume on the gel filtration column <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Kostelansky1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The similar gel filtration elution profiles of yeast, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammalian ESCRT-I would suggest that the metazoan complex retains a similar conformation. However, a crystal structure of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> or human ESCRT-I complex will be necessary to determine how the larger fourth subunit is incorporated into the ESCRT-I complex.</p><p>Despite the similarities, the dramatic divergence of a single component of a conserved trafficking complex between fungi and metazoans raises the possibility that the fourth subunit has evolved unique functions in the two systems. Consistent with this idea, MVB12A was recently identified in a proteomics screen for substrates that are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, and was shown to function in EGF receptor downregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Konishi1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The absence of tyrosine kinases prohibits an analogous event from occurring in yeast. Alternatively, the fourth subunits of ESCRT-I could function as cargo specificity factors, which would likely vary between organisms. Consistent with this idea, loss of Mvb12p in yeast affects the sorting of particular cargos more severely than others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Oestreich1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Notably, mammals express two different fourth subunits that only exhibit &#x0223c;30&#x00025; identity at the protein level.

Immunofluorescence of HeLa cells was performed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Bache2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, using monoclonal &#x003b1;-TSG101 and GFP antibodies at a concentration of 1 &#x000b5;g/ml. For live analysis, worms were anesthetized in 0.1&#x00025; tricane (Sigma), mounted on agarose pads, and imaged at 20&#x000b0;C on a spinning disc confocal (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E) microscope equipped with a Nikon 60X, 1.4 NA Planapo oil objective lens and a Hamamatsu Orca-ER CCD camera. Quantification of fluorescence intensity measurements was performed using Metamorph software. HeLa cells were grown on 35-mm glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek) maintained at 37&#x000b0;C for time-lapse imaging using spinning disk confocal microscopy. The human VPS4 constructs used in our studies were generously provided by Phyllis Hanson (Washington University, St. Louis, MO).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Mass spectrometry and biochemistry</title><p>Adult hermaphrodites expressing GFP<sup>LAP</sup>:VPS-37 were grown synchronously in liquid culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Cheeseman1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and washed in lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes at pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM KCl, and 10&#x00025; glycerol).

Extracts were generated, and VPS-37 interacting proteins isolated as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Cheeseman1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Mass spectrometry was performed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Audhya2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, using the most recent version of the predicted <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins (Wormpep111). Protein expression in BL21 (DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG for 3 hr at 25&#x000b0;C. Cells corresponding to 3 liters of culture were lysed by sonication in 40 mLs of Lysis Buffer (50 mM Na Phosphate &#x0005b;pH 8.0&#x0005d;, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.1&#x00025; Tween-20, 5 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol) and centrifuged at 20,000 RPM for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Clarified lysates were incubated in batch with 1 mL of Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) for 60 minutes. The resin was subsequently loaded into a column, washed with 200 mL of Lysis Buffer containing 500 mM NaCl, and eluted with buffer containing 50 mM Na Phosphate (pH 7.0), 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, and 5 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol. The eluted protein was exchanged into buffer containing 50 mM Na Phosphate &#x0005b;pH 7.0&#x0005d;, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol using an EconoPac PD10 desalting column (BioRad) and applied to a Superose 6 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. Prior to gel filtration, embryo extracts were similarly desalted into buffer containing 50 mM Na Phosphate &#x0005b;pH 7.0&#x0005d;, 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol. The Stokes radius of each protein complex was calculated from its elution volume based on the elution profiles of standards of known stokes radii (chymotrypsin A, ovalbumin, aldolase, catalase, ferritin and thyroglobulin) run on the same column. Sucrose gradients (5&#x02013;20&#x00025;) were poured as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000956-Oegema2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> and fractionated from the top by hand. Sedimentation values were calculated by comparing the position of the peak with that of standards of known S-value (bovine serum albumin, aldolase, catalase, and thyroglobulin) run on a separate gradient processed in parallel.
