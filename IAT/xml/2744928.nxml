However, in the process of explaining how endotoxin activated monocytes are able to induce apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells when co-cultured, we uncovered a transcellular apoptosis inducing pathway that utilizes caspase-1 containing microvesicles. Endotoxin stimulated monocytes induce the cell death of VSMCs but this activity is found in 100,000 g pellets of cell free supernatants of these monocytes. This activity is not a direct effect of endotoxin, and is inhibited by the caspase-1 inhibitor YVADcmk but not by inhibitors of Fas-L, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18. Importantly, the apoptosis inducing activity co-purifies with 100 nm sized microvesicles as determined by TEM of the pellets. These microvesicles contain caspase-1 and caspase-1 encapsulation is required since disruption of microvesicular integrity destroys the apoptotic activity but not the caspase-1 enzymatic activity. Thus, monocytes are capable of delivering a cell death message which depends upon the release of microvesicles containing functional caspase-1. This transcellular apoptosis induction pathway describes a novel pathway for inflammation induced programmed cell death.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Caspase-1 was first described as the IL-1 converting enzyme responsible for processing and hence activating proIL-1&#x003b2; to its active form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Howard1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Thornberry1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is now recognized that caspase-1 regulation depends upon the assembly of a protein complex, now termed the inflammasome. This structure is centered upon the adapter molecule ASC and typically another member of the NOD-like receptor or RIG-I receptor family that is thought to provide an intracellular danger sensing function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Martinon1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Shaw1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

This assembly autoactivates caspase-1 by a proximity mediated process with the resultant release from the cell of processed IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Yamin1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Elliott1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, it is now generally recognized that with caspase-1 activation, not only is IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 processed and released by these danger sensing macrophages, but many of the inflammasome components themselves are also released, notably caspase-1 and ASC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Gavrilin1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although caspase-1 is generally categorized as an &#x0201c;inflammatory&#x0201d; caspase by virtue of its activation of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18, it is now clear that caspase-1 also plays a role in certain forms of cell death, e.g. sepsis induced lymphocyte apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Sarkar1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and bacterial induced pyroptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Brennan1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Cookson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

These molecules are released in microvesicle packets that have the capacity to deliver a cell death message to proliferating smooth muscle cells. This cell death message is dependent upon the catalytic function of caspase-1 and upon the integrity of the microvesicle capsules. This novel pathway of caspase-1 mediated cell death adds a novel twist to the characterized functions of caspase-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Contact independent apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells by monocytes</title><p>Since monocytes take up residence with vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in atherosclerotic plaques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Ludewig1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Imanishi1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture model to analyze the monocyte ability to induce VSMC death.

Monocytes induced by endotoxin are capable of releasing caspase-1 encapsulated in microvesicles that has the capacity to target an external cell, in this case proliferating vascular smooth muscle cells, for programmed cell death.</p><p>VSMC apoptosis occurs in all stages of atherosclerosis and is triggered by a combination of factors and conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Ludewig1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Imanishi1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Because monocytes are the key inflammatory cells present in atherosclerotic plaques, we hypothesized that monocytes might provide the stimulus for VSMC apoptosis. We reasoned that this apoptotic event may be a critical component of atherosclerotic plaque rupture. We therefore developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of VSMC monocyte interactions to study potential mechanisms of the apoptotic event. Our findings document for the first time the novel role of monocyte-derived, microvesicular caspase-1 in the induction of VSMC apoptosis. Whereas monocytes cocultured with VSMC induced no significant cell death, remarkable VSMC death was induced by LPS treatment of the cocultures or when VSMCs were cocultured with conditioned medium from monocytes stimulated with LPS. Importantly, LPS in the absence of monocytes did not induce VSMC death. This apoptosis was completely abrogated when monocytes were pretreated with a specific caspase-1 inhibitor, YVADcmk.</p><p>Since it is generally believed that caspase-1's apoptotic function involves an enzymatic cleavage of cytosolic substrates, we wondered whether the cell death inducing activity from monocytes was packaged in vesicles. That is, encapsulation of caspase-1 would provide a means for both protecting the caspase-1 prior to cytosolic delivery and allowing its entry into the cytosol of targeted cells. Our findings support the concept that monocytes release microvesicles which carry active caspase-1 into the cytosol of targeted smooth muscle cells and induce apoptosis. We believe that our studies are the first to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Microvesicles have been known to be shed by cells during activation or apoptosis and to carry different factors and proteins. Monocyte/macrophage derived MVs have been reported to transport biologically significant amounts of phosphatidylserine and tissue factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Distler1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-McKechnie1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Martinez1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Watanabe1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Of note, monocyte/macrophage derived MVs have been found in human atherosclerotic lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Distler1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Martinez1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Boyle1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, caspase-1 has also been reported to be enhanced in the plaque regions associated with an increase in infiltration of monocytes and macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Boyle1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Whether this encapsulation of active caspase-1 is important in the actual events related to plaque rupture remain to be shown. However, our data provide clear evidence to support the packaging of exogenous caspase-1 into microvesicles. These particles have the potential to contribute to smooth muscle cell death in plaques. Interestingly, the release of caspase-1 in vesicles parallels what we know about the release of the caspase-1 substrates IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18. IL-1&#x003b2; release has been hypothesized to occur in the form of small packages termed microvesicles or vesicular bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Carta1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Qu1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore, reasonable to hypothesize that caspase-1 release from cells might also require vesiculation. In this context, the present study confirms that active caspase-1 is released by activated monocytes in microparticles less than 0.1 &#x000b5;m and that this encapsulation is critical for its apoptotic function. Support for the need for caspase-1 encapsulation derives from our finding that mechanical disruption of microvesicles completely abrogates their apoptotic potential.</p><p>Members of the caspase-related protease family have been shown to play an important role in apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Yuan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Sarkar1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Cookson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Miura1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Friedlander1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. However the specific role of caspase-1 in apoptosis is controversial. Caspase-1 knockout animals are born healthy without detectable morphological abnormalities, whereas caspase-3 deficient animals have major birth defects, particularly neurological defects which imply a role for caspase-3 in developmental apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Wang1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Friedlander1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, we have previously documented that spontaneous monocyte apoptosis is not dependent upon caspase-1 but upon caspase-3 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Fahy1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, over expression of caspase-1, in a rat fibroblast cell line, induces an apoptosis which is blocked by crmA, a cow pox virus protein that inhibits caspase-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Gagliardini1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. The involvement of caspase-1 in neuronal cell apoptosis is also well established. Gagliardini <italic>et al</italic>, 1994, observed the ability of a caspase-1 inhibitor to prevent apoptosis induced by nerve growth factor deprivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-VanDerVelden1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, caspase-1 has been implicated in the death of Salmonella infected dendritic cells and monocyte derived macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-VanDerVelden1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Work from our own laboratory has shown the unique role of caspase-1 in regulating sepsis survival by regulating lymphocyte apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Sarkar1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Fahy2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the present work lends support to the notion that caspase-1 is important in at least selected forms of programmed cell death. Our findings suggest that caspase-1 directly regulates the apoptosis of smooth muscle cells and that encapsulation of this active caspae-1 in microvesicles is critical for its function.</p><p>Other potential mechanisms to explain the VSCM apoptosis by the monocyte product include the concomitant release of potent cytokines. Caspase-1 is known to be principally responsible for the production of mature IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 from their precursor forms. These inflammatory cytokines have been linked to organ injury and failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Sarkar1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Fahy2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Casey1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in this context, we found no statistical difference between apoptosis of smooth muscle cells that were subjected to conditioned medium after blockade of both IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18.</p><p>Lastly, and perhaps linked to the apoptosis concept, is the possibility that caspase-1 has important effects on the host intracellular defense system. This idea is supported by the growing body of evidence that places caspase-1 at the center of complex of regulatory proteins termed the inflammasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Martinon1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Martinon2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. It is believed that caspase-1 interacts with various members of these novel molecules via its caspase recruitment domain or CARD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Martinon1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Shaw1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. It is likely that caspase-1 may play a central role in the structural integrity, organization and/or regulation of these intracellular protein complexes. For example, caspase-1 is known to interact with RIP2, a kinase that is important in upstream activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, via CARDs on both molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Sarkar2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Kobayashi1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. We have recently demonstrated that caspase-1 may also function as a scaffolding molecule that promotes RIP2 mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007140-Sarkar2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate that caspase-1 plays a central role in the regulation of apoptosis. This novel apoptotic event is dependent upon encapsulation of exogenous caspase-1 into released microvesicles that allow targeting of the active enzyme to the cytosol of different cells, in this study vascular smooth muscle cells. Future studies will need to determine whether this mechanism is targeted to specific cells or acts via a concentration dependent stochastic process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Escherichia coli strain 0127:B8, Westphal preparation, was obtained from Difco (Detroit, MI).
