Although the resultant disease in these cases was often severe or fatal, transmission of avian influenza viruses between humans is rare. The precise nature of the barrier blocking human-to-human spread is unknown. It is clear, however, that efficient human-to-human transmission of an antigenically novel influenza virus would result in a pandemic. Influenza viruses with changes at amino acids 627 or 701 of the PB2 protein have been isolated from human cases of highly pathogenic H5 and H7 avian influenza. Herein, we have used the guinea pig model to test the contributions of PB2 627 and 701 to mammalian transmission. To this end, viruses carrying mutations at these positions were generated in the A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and A/Viet Nam/1203/04 (H5N1) backgrounds. In the context of either rPan99 or rVN1203, mutation of lysine 627 to the avian consensus residue glutamic acid was found to decrease transmission. Introduction of an asparagine at position 701, in conjunction with the K627E mutation, resulted in a phenotype more similar to that of the parental strains, suggesting that this residue can compensate for the lack of 627K in terms of increasing transmission in mammals. Thus, our data show that PB2 amino acids 627 and 701 are determinants of mammalian inter-host transmission in diverse virus backgrounds.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>To cause a pandemic, an influenza virus must transmit efficiently from human to human. The viral factors that enable person-to-person spread of influenza viruses remain elusive. Using the guinea pig, an animal which we have previously shown to model the human transmission of influenza, we have identified two specific residues in the viral polymerase, at PB2 positions 627 and 701, that can contribute to efficient transmission. Interestingly, the two adaptive mutations examined act independently to achieve the same phenotype. Furthermore, these residues impact the transmission of both H3N2 and H5N1 subtype influenza viruses in the context of a mammalian host. The common importance of these amino acids to two diverse virus strains&#x02014;the human-adapted H3N2 and the more avian-like H5N1&#x02014;indicates that their mutation may be a common route to the development of a transmission-competent virus. These findings suggest one feature that contributes to the making of a pandemic influenza virus.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Repeated introductions of avian H5N1 influenza viruses into the human population have resulted in more than 380 reported cases of severe disease since 2003. Greater than half of these cases have been fatal, highlighting the extreme pathogenicity of H5N1 influenza in humans. Furthermore, high viral loads have been detected in clinical specimens collected from infected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-deJong1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, H5N1 influenza viruses do not transmit efficiently from person-to-person. Prior to the 1997 and ongoing 2003 outbreaks of H5N1 zoonoses, it was generally assumed that an influenza virus with the traits of efficient viral growth and pathogenicity in a given host species would transmit between individuals of that species. The phenotype of H5N1 viruses in humans has changed that view: it is now clear that specific viral factors are required to support inter-host transmission. The consequences of human-to-human spread of H5N1 influenza viruses would be of pandemic proportions; for this reason, significant effort has been expended in recent years towards the identification of molecular determinants of transmission. As a result of these efforts, it has become clear that transmissibility among humans is a complex and polygenic trait <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Maines1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Neumann1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Due to its importance in determining viral host range and pathogenicity, the viral polymerase complex has also been suggested to play a role in transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Neumann1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Hatta1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, but this hypothesis has not been tested directly. Additional viral proteins as well as host and environmental factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Lowen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Lowen2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> are also likely to impact the success of human-to-human spread of influenza viruses.</p><p>Amino acid 627 of the PB2 protein is almost exclusively a lysine in human influenza isolates and a glutamic acid in avian influenza isolates. This residue was first recognized as a determinant of host range in 1993 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Subbarao1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, and was later shown to contribute to the temperature sensitivity of avian viral replication in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Massin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In particular, the introduction of a lysine at position 627 of an avian virus PB2 protein greatly improved replication of a minigenome segment in cells incubated at 33&#x000b0;C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Massin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This finding has also been confirmed in the context of infected cell cultures: the growth of A/Viet Nam/1204/04 virus (VN1204; H5N1) in mammalian cell lines is improved at 33&#x000b0;C, but not 37&#x000b0;C or 41&#x000b0;C, by the single amino acid change, PB2 E627K. Furthermore, rVN1204 possessing 627K was found to grow more efficiently in the nasal turbinates of mice than the wild-type virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Hatta1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. A recently reported observation provides some insight into the mechanism underlying the effects of the E to K change: the introduction of E at 627 into the WSN PB2 appears to decrease its association with the NP protein, in mammalian but not avian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Mehle1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to affecting host range and tissue tropism, PB2 627K has also been identified as a major pathogenicity determinant of H5N1 and H7N7 subtype influenza viruses in mammalian hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Hatta2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Maines2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Perhaps the most striking aspect of the polymorphism at PB2 627 is the rapidity with which lysine at this position arises when an avian influenza virus infects either a mouse or a human. A single passage in mice has been reported to be sufficient for an E627K variant to dominate the resultant H5N1 virus population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Hatta1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Mase1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of PB2 627K has furthermore been identified in multiple human isolates of H5N1 viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-deJong1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Puthavathana1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Smith1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Similarly to E627K, a change of PB2 amino acid 701 from aspartic acid to asparagine has been implicated in expanding the host range of avian (or avian-like) H5N1 and H7N7 subtype viruses to include mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Li1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Gabriel1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-deJong1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, an asparagine at PB2 701 is a common feature of avian-like H3N2 swine viruses circulating in Europe. A mechanism has recently been proposed to explain the contribution of D701N to improved growth of a mouse adapted avian-like H7N7 virus, SC35M, in mammalian cell culture: D701N appears to enhance the binding of PB2 to importin &#x003b1;1 and correspondingly increase PB2 levels in the nucleus in mammalian, but not avian, cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Gabriel2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A potential correlation between the polymorphisms at PB2 positions 627 and 701 was observed in H5N1 viruses collected from humans in 2004&#x02013;2005. de Jong et al. reported that, among twelve clinical isolates, eight possessed 627K while a distinct three viruses carried 701N. The authors suggested that 701N may compensate for the lack of 627K in the context of mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-deJong1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Herein, we have evaluated two hypotheses: i) PB2 627K promotes the transmission of influenza viruses between mammals through improved growth in the upper respiratory tract, and ii) an asparagine at PB2 701 can functionally replace 627K in supporting viral growth and transmission in mammals. We used the guinea pig model to test the effects of polymorphisms at PB2 positions 627 and 701 on aerosol transmission of the recombinant human H3N2 isolate, A/Panama/2007/99 (rPan99), which we have previously shown to transmit with high efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Lowen3">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, and on contact transmission of the recombinant human H5N1 isolate, A/Viet Nam/1203/04 (rVN1203). We show that rVN1203 transmits with moderate efficiency by the contact route in the guinea pig model. Furthermore, the mutation K627E decreases the transmission efficiency of both rPan99 and rVN1203 viruses. Contrary to previous reports and to our first hypothesis, we did not, however, observe a marked difference between the 627K and 627E containing viruses in terms of peak viral titers attained <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our second hypothesis did prove correct in that combination of glutamic acid at 627 with an aspartic acid to asparagine change at position 701 rescues the phenotype of the 627E viruses: rPan99 virus with 627E&#x0002b;701N transmits with similar efficiency to the parental rPan99 virus, while the rVN1203 627E 701N virus transmits with higher efficiency than the wild-type strain. Our data show that specific adaptations of the viral polymerase to the mammalian host support the transmission of influenza viruses of diverse lineage, revealing one viral trait that could contribute to the making of a pandemic strain.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Rescue and in vitro characterization of recombinant viruses</title><p>Reverse genetics systems for Pan99 and VN1203 viruses were used to generate recombinant viruses which encode the mutations K627E alone or K627E and D701N combined, in their respective PB2 segments. All four mutant viruses and the two recombinant parental viruses were successfully recovered from cDNA transfection. Reverse transcription followed by PCR and sequencing of the PB2 gene segment of each virus confirmed that the expected sequence was present. As sequencing was only performed on the PB2 segment, it cannot be formally excluded that random mutation of the remaining segments may have contributed to the phenotypes observed.

Each experiment involved eight guinea pigs: four infected intranasally with 1000 PFU of the appropriate virus, and four exposed animals. The rPan99 wild-type virus transmitted to all eight exposed guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000252-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), as expected based on previous results with the non-recombinant Pan99 virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Lowen1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Lowen3">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Transmission to contact animals, as measured by isolation of virus in nasal washings, was verified by hemagglutination inhibition assay of paired sera for each guinea pig (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000252-t002">Table 2</xref>). To confirm that the mutant viruses had not reverted to the wild-type PB2 sequence prior to transmission, the PB2 genes of isolates from two exposed guinea pigs were sequenced for each virus. All transmitted viruses examined retained the introduced mutations. Thus, in the background of a human H3N2 isolate, mutation of PB2 residue 627 from K to E decreases the efficiency of transmission, while the introduction of D701N alongside K627E results in a phenotype more similar to that of the wild-type virus.</p><fig id="ppat-1000252-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000252.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Aerosol transmission of rPan99 wild-type, rPan99 627E and rPan99 627E 701N viruses in guinea pigs.</title><p>Nasal wash titers are plotted as a function of time post-inoculation.

rVN1203, rVN1203 627E, and rVN1203 627E 701N</title><p>To test whether the introduction of K627E or K627E D701N mutations would also alter the transmissibility of the rVN1203 virus, contact transmission experiments were performed in guinea pigs. Each experiment involved eight guinea pigs: four infected intranasally with 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of the appropriate virus, and four exposed animals. In this case, each exposed guinea pig was placed in direct contact with an inoculated animal by placing them in the same cage at 24 h p.i. It is important to note that a different experimental set up (aerosol versus contact transmission experiments), including a different inoculum dose, was used for the experiments with the rVN1203-based viruses, relative to the experiments with the rPan99-based viruses. Thus, the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000252-g004">Figure 4</xref> should not be compared directly to those presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000252-g005">Figure 5</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000252-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, the rVN1203 wild-type virus transmitted rapidly to three of four contact guinea pigs. In contrast, the rVN1203 PB2 627E mutant transmitted to only one contact animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000252-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). While this result suggests that this single amino acid change &#x02013; PB2 K627E &#x02013; reduces the transmission potential of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in a mammalian species (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.09, Student's t-test), an increased number of replicates would be required to prove a statistically significant reduction in transmission. Furthermore, due to the space constraints and high cost of housing animals under BSL3-enhanced containment, we did not retain guinea pigs infected with VN1203 virus for the three weeks required to obtain convalescent sera for HI assays in order to assess transmission to contact animals by seroconversion.</p><fig id="ppat-1000252-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000252.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Contact transmission of rVN1203 wild-type, rVN1203 627E and rVN1203 627E 701N viruses in guinea pigs.</title><p>Nasal wash titers are plotted as a function of time post-inoculation.

In contrast, virus isolated from three of the inoculated animals late in the course of infection (day 6 p.i.) exhibited large plaque phenotypes, suggesting reversion had occurred. The sequencing of one of these isolates confirmed the presence of lysine at PB2 627. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000252-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, the rVN1203 627E 701N double mutant virus spread to all four contact guinea pigs. Although slightly more efficient (100&#x00025; compared to 75&#x00025; for the wild-type virus), transmission of the rVN1203 627E 701N double mutant virus appeared to occur with slower kinetics than the wild-type, based on the relatively low titers isolated from contact animals 24 h after the initiation of contact. Taking into account the virus titers shed by the inoculated animals and the 50&#x00025; infectious doses of the wild-type and double mutant viruses (see below and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000252-t003">Table 3</xref>), it is unclear why the kinetics of transmission differ. Again, sequencing of the PB2 gene of one transmitted virus indicated that both the K627E and D701N mutations were retained. Thus, the amino acid change PB2 D701N favors the transmission of an H5N1 virus in a mammalian host and this mutation fully compensates for the lack of a lysine at position 627 in terms of transmission by the contact route.</p><table-wrap id="ppat-1000252-t003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000252.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Guinea pig 50&#x00025; infectious dose of wild-type and PB2 mutant viruses.</title></caption><graphic id="ppat-1000252-t003-3" xlink:href="ppat.1000252.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="ppat-1000252-t003-3"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">rWild-type<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt104">&#x0002a;</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PB2 627E<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt104">&#x0002a;</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PB2 627E 701N<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt104">&#x0002a;</xref></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pan99 background</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">215</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VN1203 background</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt104"><label>&#x0002a;</label><p>GPID50 values are shown in units of PFU/guinea pig.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Despite productive growth of all three VN1203-based viruses in the guinea pig respiratory tract, clinical signs were not observed following either intranasal inoculation or infection through contact transmission. The average peak nasal wash titers (reached on day 2 p.i.) of guinea pigs intranasally inoculated with the rVN1203 wild-type and 627E mutant viruses were similar, at approximately 2.3&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> PFU/ml. The titers of the double mutant virus shed by inoculated guinea pigs at day 2 p.i. were higher, at about 1.1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> PFU/ml. Statistical analysis indicated that only the difference between the wild-type and double mutant virus was significant, with a p value of 0.044 (Student's t-test). Overall, the data do not convincingly show that enhanced shedding from the upper respiratory tract contributes to improved transmission of the rVN1203 wild-type virus. In a separate experiment designed to investigate a possible role in transmission of shedding in the feces, we collected rectal swab samples from guinea pigs inoculated with wild-type rVN1203 virus on days 2, 4, and 6 post-infection. No virus was detected in these rectal swab samples, despite efficient isolation of virus from the upper respiratory tract of the same animals. <italic>50&#x00025;</italic></p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Infectious dose of rPan99 and rVN1203-based viruses in guinea pigs</title><p>In both the rPan99 and rVN1203 backgrounds, the identities of PB2 residues 627 and 701 had a clear effect on transmission. Nevertheless, contrary to our expectations, mutation of these amino acids in the rVN1203 background did not have a striking effect on peak viral growth in the upper respiratory tract of guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000252-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In the rPan99 background, differences in shedding titers were seen on day 2 p.i., which may have contributed to the transmission phenotypes observed. The effect, however, was limited to day 2 p.i., with similar peak titers being reached by all three viruses by day 4 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000252-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000252-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We therefore reasoned that the reduction in transmissibility may be due to an effect on the recipient, as well as possibly the donor, host in the transmission equation. In other words, we predicted that the 50&#x00025; infectious dose (ID<sub>50</sub>) of the PB2 627E containing viruses would be higher than either the wild-type or the double mutant viruses. To test this prediction, we inoculated groups of four guinea pigs with 10-fold serial dilutions of each of the six recombinant viruses to determine the GPID<sub>50</sub> in each case. The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000252-t003">Table 3</xref>. In both virus backgrounds, the GPID<sub>50</sub> of the wild-type and 627E 701N double mutant viruses were found to be very similar or the same. In contrast, the rPan99 627E virus had a GPID<sub>50</sub> of approximately 10-fold higher, and the rVN1203 627E virus had a GPID<sub>50</sub> of approximately 7-fold higher than the corresponding wild-type viruses. Although the differences are marginal, it is possible that decreased infectivity contributes to the inefficient transmission phenotypes of both 627E-containing viruses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the context of an influenza virus which is well adapted to the human host, rPan99, and an avian-like influenza virus isolated from a human host, rVN1203, we have shown that polymorphisms at residues 627 and 701 of PB2 influence transmission among guinea pigs. In addition, we have tested the hypothesis proffered by de Jong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-deJong1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> that, with respect to adaptation of an avian virus to a mammalian host, D701N can functionally replace E627K. We found that, when PB2 627 is a glutamic acid residue, the D701N mutation not only improves viral growth in mammalian cells, but enhances transmission between guinea pigs.</p><p>Using minigenome systems and infected cell cultures, the introduction of the E627K mutation into an avian PB2 gene has previously been shown to increase polymerase activity and viral growth at 33&#x000b0;C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Hatta1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Massin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. With the mutation of the wild-type K627 to E in the rVN1203 background, we saw a marked reduction in plaque size at both 33&#x000b0;C and 37&#x000b0;C. The degree to which the plaque size decreased relative to the rVN1203 wild-type virus was greater at 33&#x000b0;C, however, as would be expected based on earlier reports. In the rPan99 background, the reduction in plaque size observed with the K627E mutation was again seen at both temperatures and was more subtle than for rVN1203. The observation that the fully human-adapted virus rPan99 was better able to tolerate the PB2 K627E mutation and maintain plaque formation at 33&#x000b0;C than the more avian-like rVN1203 virus may indicate that Pan99 has developed degenerate mechanisms to permit growth at the lower temperature of 33&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> growth of the rPan99 627E virus was impaired relative to the wild-type, but only early (day 2) after infection. Although improved growth in the upper respiratory tract early after infection may act to increase the efficiency of transmission, the fact that &#x02013; at 4 d p.i. &#x02013; the rPan99 627E and rPan99 627E 701N mutant viruses reach similar peak titers to the wild-type may argue against this as a mechanism for the improved transmission of the wild-type virus. In addition, contrary to recent findings in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Hatta2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, we did not observe marked differences in the viral titers reached by rVN1203 wild-type, rVN1203 627E and rVN1203 627E 701N viruses in the upper respiratory tract of guinea pigs. We did, however, see a clear effect of the PB2 mutations on transmission in the rVN1203 background, as well as in the rPan99 background. We hypothesized that the observed transmission phenotypes might arise from differences in infectivity. Determination of the GPID<sub>50</sub> values of the three rVN1203- and the three rPan99-based viruses did reveal that higher doses of the 627E mutant viruses are required to productively infect guinea pigs. Although suggestive, the differences observed (approximately 7-fold for rVN1203 and 10-fold for rPan99) may be within the range of error of the GPID<sub>50</sub> assay. Thus, the mechanism underlying the decreased transmission efficiencies of rVN1203 PB2 627E and rPan99 PB2 627E viruses relative to the corresponding wild-type and double mutant viruses remains uncertain. Our data suggest that reduced viral growth in the nasal passages or decreased infectivity may play a role, but do not allow us to draw firm conclusions on this point. One additional possibility is that, despite reaching similar peak titers in nasal lavage, the 627E mutant viruses are not shed into the air as efficiently as the wild-type and double mutant viruses.</p><p>For all three rVN1203 viruses, the viral growth kinetics observed in inoculated animals were markedly different from those in the contact animals.

Further support for the idea that 701N can compensate for a lack of 627K in mammalian hosts is found in the published sequences of swine influenza PB2 genes. Among the avian-like H3N2 viruses circulating in swine, European isolates for which sequences are available in Genbank carry 627E with 701N, while Asian isolates predominantly carry 627K with 701D. Although the number of transmission events is low, it may also be of note that three swine influenza viruses isolated from humans in Asia possessed PB2 627E and 701N <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Gregory1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Komadina1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In wild birds, H5N1 viruses carrying PB2 627K arose during the Qinghai Lake outbreak in 2005; descendants of these viruses retaining possession of 627K continue to circulate among wild waterfowl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000252-Chen1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, although our data show that PB2 627K or 701N is necessary for optimal transmission of either human- or avian-adapted viruses between guinea pigs, these mutations are not sufficient to support human-to-human spread of H5N1 influenza.
