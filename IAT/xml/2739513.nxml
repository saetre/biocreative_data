Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based regenerative therapy is currently regarded as an alternative approach to salvage the MI hearts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, a major challenge to MSCs therapy is that transplanted cells undergo apoptosis, as they are exposed to an extremely harsh microenvironment in the infarcted heart. The efficiency of MSCs transplantation is limited by lower survival rate of MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Therefore, protection of MSCs against apoptosis is critical for successful cellular therapy. Novel strategies are being developed to maximize biologic and functional properties of MSCs, such as the preparation of cells in special bioscaffolds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], preconditioning of cells in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and genetic transfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of molecules which play an important role in the innate immune system for the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by immune cells, initiating a primary response toward invading pathogen and recruitment of the adaptive immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Recent research found that MSCs express TLR molecules 1 to 8. Pam3Cys, a prototypic ligand for TLR2, induced proliferation of MSCs and regulated their differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the antigenic component of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall and is known as the ligand of Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4). In our previous study, we found that 1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml LPS could protect MSCs against apoptosis induced by oxidative stress, and enhance the proliferation of MSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, whether LPS could protect MSCs against apoptosis and increase the survival rate of engrafted MSCs in the infarcted myocardium need to be further investigated.</p><p>In the present study, we preconditioned MSCs with 1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml LPS, then transplanted them into ischemic myocardium, and observed the survival and cardiac protective capacity of MSCs in a rat acute myocardial infarction model. Furthermore, we tried to explore potential mechanisms and the role of TLR4 in the signal pathway of LPS-induced cardiac protection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animal preparation</title><p>Adult male C57BL/10J mice (wild type, 6-8 weeks, 25-30 g) and C57BL/10ScNJ mice (TLR4 gene deleted type, 6-8 weeks, 25-30 g) were provided by the Model Animal Research Centre of Nanjing University (Nanjing, China). Adult female Wistar rats (210-250 g) were purchased from Slac company (Shanghai, China). The procedure was performed in accordance with the "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals" (NIH Publication No. 85-23, National Academy Press, Washington, DC, revised 1996). The study protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanjing Medical University.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation, expansion and labeling of MSCs</title><p>Wild MSCs (wMSCs) were harvested from male C57BL/10J mice, and TLR4 gene deleted MSCs (tMSCs) were isolated from male C57BL/10ScNJ mice, respectively. Isolation of MSCs from mice was performed as previously described with minor modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Briefly, mice were sacrificed humanely and femurs were aseptically harvested. Whole marrow cells were obtained by flushing the bone marrow cavity with low glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (L-DMEM, Hyclone, USA). Cells were centrifuged at 1000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>for 5 minutes and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellet was then re-suspended with L-DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 U/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere. After 24 hours, non-adherent cells in suspension were discarded and culture media was replaced every three or four days thereafter. When MSCs reached 80%-90% of confluence, they were trypsinized by the addition of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and then re-plated in culture flasks at a density of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. Cells between passages 4 and 5 were utilized for experiment. Cells were confirmed to be MSCs by cell surface markers with flow cytometry analysis: CD14<sup>-</sup>; CD29<sup>+</sup>; CD34<sup>-</sup>; CD44<sup>+</sup>; CD45<sup>-</sup>, and CD105<sup>+</sup>.</p><p>To label MSCs with 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3'3'-testramethylindo-carbocyanine perchlorate (DiI), 2 &#x003bc;g/ml DiI was added to MSCs suspension and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes, then at 4&#x000b0;C for 15 minutes with occasional mixing. MSCs labeled with DiI were washed 3 times with PBS. All cells were kept frozen until use.</p></sec><sec><title>VEGF assessment by Enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</title><p>wMSCs and tMSCs were plated in 24 well plates respectively at a concentration of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well/ml and incubated with serum-free L-DMEM.

Cells were subsequently exposed to 5 nmol/L pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) or not, which was an inhibitor of NF-&#x003ba;B. After 48 hours of incubation, supernatants were harvested. Concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in supernatants was determined by VEGF ELISA kits (R&#x00026;D Systems) according to the instruction of the manufacturer. Experiments were repeated three times for verification of results.</p></sec><sec><title>Myocardial infarction model and MSCs transplantation</title><p>Female Wistar rats were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection and mechanically ventilated. Under a sterile condition, the heart was exposed through a left thoracotomy, and the left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated at just below the atrioventricular border. Successful ligation was identified by cyanosis of the left ventricular anterior wall and ST-T elevation on electrocardiogram. The rats were allowed to recover under care. Before transplantation, LPS-preconditioned nMSCs and tMSCs were exposed to 1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml LPS for 48 hours and collected. 80 rats were used in our experiment. 12 rats died after AMI, and 8 rats died within 7 days after AMI. One week after AMI, remaining 60 rats were divided into 4 groups randomly and given an intramyocardial injection with one of the following treatments: 30 &#x003bc;l PBS (control group, n = 15), 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>wMSCs/30 &#x003bc;l (wMSCs group, n = 15), 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>LPS-preconditioned wMSCs/30 &#x003bc;l (LPS-wMSCs group, n = 15), or 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>LPS-preconditioned tMSCs/30 &#x003bc;l (LPS-tMSCs group, n = 15). 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>MSCs were injected into two sites of the myocardium with a bent 26-gauge needle, one within the infarct area and the other in the myocardium bordering the ischemic area. At the end of experiment, the chest was closed, and animals were weaned from the ventilator and allowed to recover. Three weeks after cells transplantation, the rats were sacrificed and hearts from different groups were harvested for the following experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional assessment by echocardiography</title><p>Three weeks after cells transplantation, the rats were undergone cardiac function assessment by transthoracic echocardiography with 12-MHz phased-array transducer (Hewlett Packard). The heart was imaged in the cross-sectional mode in parasternal long- and short-axis views of the left ventricle (LV). Average LV end-diastolic diameter (LVDd), LV end-systolic diameter (LVDs), LV ejection Fraction (LVEF) and LV fractional shortening (FS) were measured from three consecutive cardiac cycles. All measurements were done by two experienced echocardiographer who were blinded to treatment assignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Fibrosis assessment by Masson's trichrome</title><p>To detect fibrosis in cardiac muscle, the LV myocardium (n = 5, each) was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, cut transversely, embedded in paraffin, and stained with Masson's trichrome. Ten anterolateral sections from each heart were evaluated in their entirety and quantified. Fibrosis was determined by measuring the collagen area as a proportion of the total area under observation. These morphometric studies were performed by two examiners who were blinded to treatment assignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of survival of engrafted MSCs</title><p>Hearts were harvested, soaked in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4&#x000b0;C and then embedded in Tissue-Tak OCT (Sakura).

Briefly, after the animals were killed, hearts from different groups were removed and DNA was isolated using Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (QIAGEN). Specific primers were designed based on the GeneBank sequences of the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome5 of the rat (sense 5'-GAGGCACAAGTTGGCTCAACA-3'; antisense 5'-CTCCTGCAAAAAG-GGCCTTT-3') [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

Apoptotic cells were identified by brown colour in their nuclei. Tissue sections were examined microscopically and the percentage of apoptotic cells per total cells was determined in eight randomly chosen fields.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemical assay</title><p>Rats from each group were sacrificed 3 weeks after cells transplantation. Heart muscle samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 &#x003bc;m intervals. Endothelial cells were identified by the expression of von Willebrand Factor (vWF). Immunohistology was performed with specific primary antibody against vWF (1:100, abcom). Five fields on the slide presenting infarcted area from each heart were randomly chosen for counting stained blood vessels under microscope (&#x000d7;100, Olympus CX-21).

This low survival may limit the sustained reparative capacity of stem cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Enhanced survival of transplanted stem cells may increase their cytoprotective efficacy. Our previous study had suggested that 1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml LPS could protect MSCs from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and improve the survival of MSCs via TLR4 and PI3K/Akt pathway. After pretreated by 1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml LPS, MSCs strengthened the power against oxidative stress and inflammatory environment in infarcted area. In present study, we also found that survival ratio of transplanted MSCs was elevated in infarcted myocardium after LPS preconditioning by detecting the <italic>sry </italic>gene in the donor heart.</p><p>Recent studies have indicated that paracrine mechanism, carried out by the cells through the release of soluble cellular factors, might be a critical mechanism of tissue repair and functional improvement after MSCs transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. VEGF is a crucial paracrine factor in MSCs-mediated cardioprotection. In addition to its potent angiogenic function, VEGF can stimulate proliferation, delay senescence, suppress apoptosis and promote survival of various cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It has reported that MSCs exposed to LPS could increase expression of VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In <italic>in vitro </italic>study, we demonstrated that a significant level of VEGF was detected in the culture medium of LPS-treated MSCs. In <italic>in vivo </italic>study, Western bolt analysis also implied that LPS-preconditioning MSCs transplantation released more VEGF in infarcted myocardium than that without LPS preconditioning. As a result of VEGF secretion, the vascular density was increased in LPS-preconditioning group than that without LPS-preconditioning. Furthermore, the protected cardiac function and the reduced apoptosis of myocardium in infarcted heart were also related with expression of VEGF. Thus, we demonstrated that LPS-preconditioning promoted the release of VEGF, which in turn improved the effect of MSCs transplantation in the infarcted area.</p><p>Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream target serine/threonine kinase Akt are now recognized as one of the most critical pathways in regulating cellular activation, inflammatory responses and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Activation of PI3K/Akt-dependent signalling has been shown to prevent cardiac myocyte apoptosis and protect the myocardium from AMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Akt is activated by site-specific phosphorylation. In our study, we found that the level of phosphor-Akt was elevated and the apoptosis of myocardium was reduced in LPS-wMSCs group compared with that in wMSCs group. So we demonstrated that LPS-preconditioned MSCs resulted in significantly increased levels of phospho-Akt in the myocardium which positively correlated with cardioprotection. Our results indicated that effect of LPS-conditioned MSCs transplantation was mediated partially through a PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanism.</p><p>TLRs are a conservative family of receptors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and promote the activation of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that the heart expresses TLR4 mRNA and protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and TLR4 plays a role in myocardial dysfunction during bacterial sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, a low dose of LPS (0.2 mg/kg) preconditioning induced cardioprotection in a rodent model of ischaemia/reperfusion injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Preconditioning, injury-induced protection from subsequent injury, has been proven to be a powerful form of cardioprotection. Jiang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] preconditioned MSCs with hypoxia, transplanted the stem cells into ischemic myocardium, and observed enhanced survival and cytoprotective capacity. Guo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] preconditioned MSCs with IGF-1 and found enhancement of the number of MSCs attracted into the infarcted heart. In the present study, we found LPS-preconditioning could enhance survival of MSCs, stimulate expression of VEGF and activate PI3K/Akt pathway. Conversely, TLR4-deleted MSCs (tMSCs) released less VEGF and exerted less functions in reducing apoptosis of myocardium than LPS-preconditioning wMSCs. TLR-mediated signalling activates NF-&#x003ba;B, which plays a critical role in regulating expression of genes, such as VEGF. In our <italic>in vitro </italic>study, we found that NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition prevented secretion of VEGF under the LPS condition. So we concluded that TLR4/NF-&#x003ba;B signalling pathway played an important role in cardioprotection performed by LPS preconditioning. LPS preconditioning could promote expression of other cytokines, such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The exact effects of these cytokines in infarcted heart need a further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that LPS preconditioning can enhance survival of MSCs, stimulate expression of VEGF, and activate PI3K/Akt pathway. LPS preconditioning before MSCs transplantation leads to superior therapeutic neovascularization and recovery of cardiac function. Therefore, LPS preconditioning provides a novel strategy in maximizing biologic and functional properties of MSCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YY carried out the main experiment and drafted the manuscript.
