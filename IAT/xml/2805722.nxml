Mutations in <italic>hclB</italic> lead to defects in the visual system and altered sensitivity to the action of ivermectin. To investigate whether this member of the Cys-loop receptors is common across the Insecta, we analysed the genomes of seven other insect species (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera) and revealed orthologues of <italic>hclB</italic> in all of them. Sequence comparisons showed high identity levels between the orthologues, indicating similar constraints and conserved function between the species. Two <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> mutants, <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup> (P293S) and <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> (W111*, a null mutation) were tested for the lapse into, and recovery from, paralysis induced by high temperature or the anaesthetic action of halothane. At 41&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, the <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> flies lapsed into coma faster than wild-type or the <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup> flies, while both mutants recovered more slowly. A substantially impaired recovery rate was also observed in <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup> after anaesthesia with halothane. Enhanced synaptic signalling at low-intensity light stimuli was registered on electroretinograms recorded from the two mutant strains. Our results suggest that HCLB may play an essential and conserved role in insect neurophysiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Histamine receptor</kwd><kwd>Anaesthesia</kwd><kwd>Avermectin</kwd><kwd>Visual signalling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Fast neurotransmission mediated by histamine (<xref rid="bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hardie, 1987, 1989a</xref>) is a common signalling mechanism in arthropod visual pathways (<xref rid="bib12 bib22 bib27 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Hardie, 1989b; Nassel, 1999; Stuart, 1999; Stuart et al., 2007</xref>). Two genes, <italic>hclA</italic> and <italic>hclB</italic> (the genetic nomenclature is according to <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2002</xref>), each encoding a distinct ionotropic histamine receptor subunit, were recently identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="bib6 bib7 bib29 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2002; Gisselmann et al., 2002; Witte et al., 2002; Zheng et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> expression studies demonstrated the formation of homomeric HCLA and HCLB chloride channels (<xref rid="bib7 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Gisselmann et al., 2002; Zheng et al., 2002</xref>), or heteromeric HCLA/HCLB channels (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2002</xref>), all of which responded to histamine. Heterologously expressed HCLB and HCLA/HCLB channels are also been activated by the macrocyclic lactone, ivermectin (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2002</xref>), whose mode of action is the specific and essentially irreversible activation of ligand-gated chloride channels. The two subunits have the highest sequence identity (30&#x02013;40%) to mammalian glycine and GABA receptors.</p><p>In the visual system, HCLA is expressed in the large monopolar cells (LMCs), while HCLB is exclusively localized to the glial cells in the lamina (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pantazis et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>hclA</italic> (initially known as <italic>ort</italic>) mutations lead to defective vision, documented as electroretinogram (ERG) records lacking the on- and off-transient components (<xref rid="bib19 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Koenig and Merriam, 1977; O&#x02019;Tousa et al., 1989</xref>). The studies of <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Heisenberg (1971)</xref> and <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Coombe (1986)</xref> demonstrated that the lack of these transient components is the result of impaired synaptic transmission between the photoreceptors and their targets, the large monopolar cells in the lamina, which is consistent with the expression data. By contrast, ERG records from <italic>hclB</italic> mutants have been reported to contain both components; the on-transients only (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pantazis et al., 2008</xref>) or both on- and off-transients (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Yusein et al., 2008</xref>) having higher amplitudes than those from control flies. At the same time, the LMCs response to low-intensity brief flashes, where the on- and off-components are not separated, were shown to be less sensitive than the corresponding responses of the controls (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pantazis et al., 2008</xref>). It was suggested that the HCLB channels participate in the modulation of the visual responses. However, it remains unknown if the sensitivity of on- and off-transient responses in all <italic>hclB</italic> mutants is affected in a similar way.</p><p>The use of the reporter gene strategy (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al., 2006</xref>) allowed the mapping the expression of these proteins in many other cells of adult brain and the thoracic ganglia. It is well-known that mutations in a single synaptic protein may result in diverse neurological effects, as reported for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> voltage-sensitive sodium channel <italic>paralytic</italic> (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Loughney et al., 1989</xref>), where mutations result in hypersensitivity to increased temperature and defects in olfaction, circadian rhythms and courtship (reviewed in: <xref rid="bib30 bib26 bib31 bib8" ref-type="bibr">Wu and Ganetzky, 1992; Smith, 1996; Young, 1998; Greenspan and Ferveur, 2000</xref>). Known non-visual phenotypes of the <italic>ort</italic> mutant flies include abnormal responses to mechanical shock (bang sensitivity) or diethyl ether (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Iovchev et al., 2002</xref>), and mutant-specific temperature preferences (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al., 2006</xref>), all implying that HCLA has functions outside the visual system. <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al. (2006)</xref> also described the first <italic>hclB</italic> null mutant (<italic>HisCl1</italic><sup><italic>134</italic></sup>) and demonstrated that it not only prefers a higher temperature than normal flies, but also has a reduced tolerance for high temperatures. Recently, we identified two new <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants, <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup>(P293S) and <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>(W111*, a null mutation), and showed that they have allele-specific visual system phenotypes and altered susceptibility to ivermectin (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Yusein et al., 2008</xref>). Since the proline residue at position 293 affected in <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup> is highly conserved across the ligand-gated chloride channel family, we explore here the effect of its substitution on the tolerance of flies to high temperature. As it is known that the HCLA subunit is involved in the response to anaesthesia (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Iovchev et al., 2002</xref>), we also explored the influence of HCLB-containing channels on sensitivity to the anaesthetic agent, halothane.</p><p>We show that mutations in <italic>hclB</italic> lead to allele-specific responses of mutant flies to both high temperature and anaesthesia. We also demonstrate that the absolute sensitivity of both on- and off-transient responses in the ERG is increased to almost the same degree in the <italic>hclB</italic> mutants. The high degree of identity of HCLB orthologues from various insect species allows us to conclude that the gene has an important role in nervous systems across the Insecta.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Drosophila stocks</title><p>Two strains with mutant <italic>hclB</italic> alleles having the genotype: <italic>st hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup><italic>/TM3</italic>, <italic>Sb</italic> and <italic>st hclB</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>/TM3</italic>, <italic>Sb</italic> were described in <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Yusein et al.

To reveal the genus-specific and interspecific polymorphisms we identified and analysed HCLBs from the genomes of three <italic>Drosophilidae</italic> and four non-<italic>Drosophilidae</italic> species (see Section <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">2</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B shows the sequence conservation among seven HCLBs studied, when compared to the Dm-HCLB sequence. The amino-acid sequence identity between the HCLBs (vs. Dm-HCLB) in <italic>Drosophilidae</italic> species was more than 92%.

Sequence alignments among all species revealed a pattern of evolutionary changes: highly identity in the N-terminal receptor domain and TMs1&#x02013;4, with a more variable intracellular domain. The roughly 62aa long intracellular loop domain is the most variable part of the protein, with amino-acid identities ranging from 90 to 98% between drosophilid species to 63% between <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic> and other insects.</p></sec><sec><label>3.2</label><title>Altered tolerance for high temperature in hclB mutants</title><p>The three test genotypes had very similar genetic background, produced by crossing of strains with flies <italic>Df(3R)E79/MRS</italic>, <italic>Sb</italic>.

From the <italic>V</italic>/log&#x000a0;<italic>I</italic> functions, the 0.5&#x000a0;mV thresholds of the two ERG responses were derived for sensitivity assessment.</p><p>Original representative ERG records of a control fly as well as of the two <italic>hclB</italic> mutants are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A. The amplitudes of the on- and off-transients of the mutants were greater than the wild-type flies. In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> the intensity-response curves and 0.5&#x000a0;mV thresholds of the ERG on-transients (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B) and off-transients (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C) are presented. It is clearly seen that the curves of the two mutants are shifted to the left along the stimulus intensity scale and that the 0.5&#x000a0;mV thresholds of both on- and off-transients of the mutants are lower than the threshold of the wild-type flies. This indicated a higher absolute sensitivity of both transients in the <italic>hclB</italic> mutants. The sensitivity of on- and off-responses was increased to a similar degree. There was no significant difference in the absolute sensitivity of the transient responses between the two <italic>hclB</italic> mutants. In no point along the stimulus intensity scale could we obtain a lower sensitivity of the responses from <italic>hclB</italic> mutant flies, as was reported by <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pantazis et al. (2008)</xref> for LMCs from the <italic>hisCl1</italic><sup><italic>134</italic></sup> null mutant.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>When HCLBs from Insecta species were compared with <italic>Dm-HCLB</italic>, substitutions at several amino-acid residues were found in the sequences of their N-terminal domains, mainly concentrated near to the signal peptide. The high level identity between the N-terminal domains and the near to hundred percent identity of the membrane-spanning regions of all the compared insects indicate their significance for HCLB function. The TM2 is important in forming of the channel gate (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Saul et al., 1999</xref>), in controlling ionic selectivity (<xref rid="bib4 bib2" ref-type="bibr">Corringer et al., 1999; Carland et al., 2004</xref>), and in forming the binding sites for agents such as insecticides (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Ffrench-Constant et al., 1993</xref>) and anaesthetics (<xref rid="bib20 bib17" ref-type="bibr">Lobo et al., 2004; Jenkins et al., 2001</xref>). In <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup> mutant flies the P293S substitution affects a highly conserved amino-acid in this domain, leading us to predict that in this mutant HCLB<italic>-</italic>containing channels have an altered function. All sites for N-glycosylation are completely conserved across all the species we examined. The importance of N-linked glycosylation was shown by the finding that glycosylation of glycine receptor &#x003b1;1-subunits is a necessary prerequisite for homomeric receptor assembly and that receptor assembly is required for transit from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and subsequently to the cell membrane (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Griffon et al., 1999</xref>). Several replacements were also found in the large intracellular loop. The intracellular loop between TM3&#x02013;4 of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors has been determined to act as a downstream filter controlling the ion flow (conductance) into the cytoplasm. Charged residues framing these ion portals appear to determine the efficiency with which ions are transported (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kelley et al., 2003</xref>). The high degree of conservation of protein sequences observed across Insecta species for both HCLA (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Iovchev et al., 2006</xref>) and HCLB (observed in this study) indicate that both have an equally important and conserved function.</p><p>Histaminergic mutants have a changed tolerance to high temperature. They were knocked-down faster and recovered from heat shock paralysis much slower compared with the control (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hong et al., 2006</xref>). These authors concluded that the defects in the histamine-signalling genes can cause low tolerance to high temperature or lower the upper thermal limit and that the fine regulation of temperature preferences could be controlled by circadian clock neurons where they found <italic>hclB</italic> expression. We independently confirm their results for a null mutant of <italic>hclB</italic> (with <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>) and also provide new information by examination of <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup> (P293S). It was shown that proline residue in this position is important both for charge selectivity (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Corringer et al., 1999</xref>) and desensitization (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Saul et al., 1999</xref>) of the channel. Proline is known to facilitate conformational changes via <italic>cis</italic>&#x02013;<italic>trans</italic> isomerization of the peptide bond and to disrupt secondary structure motifs. By topological analysis it was predicted that an amino-acid substitution P250T in human glycine receptor &#x003b1;1 subunit leads to the loss of an angular polypeptide structure, thereby destabilizing open channel conformations (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Saul et al., 1999</xref>). The P293S mutation in <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup> is in the equivalent position to the P250T mutation in the human glycine receptor. All these observations suggest that HCLB-containing channels in <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup> flies could have an altered function.</p><p>We observed an intermediate phenotype of <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup> flies in the recovery after heat shock experiments &#x02013; the flies recovered slower than control but faster than <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> suggesting that the allele might be hypomorphic. Interestingly, the <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup> mutants responded to heat shock in a similar way to control flies in the knock-down analysis. It might be that the function of HCLB in <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup> is sufficient for knock-down like control flies but inadequate for recovery, and this might be influenced by the composition of the channels involved in these neuronal circuits, whether they are homomeric or heteromeric (HCLB/HCLA).</p><p>We also studied the influence of the HCLB-containing channels on the circuits involved in anaesthesia and recovery after treatment with halothane. Heat- and anaesthesia-induced paralysis seemed very similar: the <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup> null mutants fell fast while the response of <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup> flies was similar to controls. A possible explanation is that these responses are due to one common neuronal circuit, because of the similar endpoints used in two experiments. However, the recovery of mutants after two treatments was different. <italic>hclB</italic> null mutants (which possess only HCLA channels) have a wild-type time of recovery after anaesthesia with halothane unlike <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup> mutants that have prolonged recovery. On other hand, null mutants in <italic>hclA</italic>, which have only HCLB channels, show a substantially prolonged recovery after treatment with diethyl ether (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Iovchev et al., 2002</xref>). These findings suggest that HCLB-containing channels are candidate components of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> response to volatile anaesthetics. However it needs further investigations to determinate whether they are direct targets for anaesthetics, like some other members of the Cys-loop superfamily, or whether they modulate anaesthesia by other, indirect, mechanisms. Certain amino-acids in TMs1&#x02013;3 of the glycine receptor are critical for anaesthetics effects and some of them are accessible only at open state of channel. The mechanism by which anaesthetics act on the receptor could be through occupation of the anaesthetic binding cavity formed by their membrane-spanning domains, preventing the closing of the channel (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Lobo et al., 2004</xref>). A similar cavity has been found in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins et al., 2001</xref>). The observed altered anaesthetic phenotype in <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup> mutants are of interest for further investigations in view of the fact that the P293S substitution could affect the potential anaesthetic binding cavity in HCLB-contained channels.</p><p>The visual responses of several <italic>hclB</italic> mutants have been studied so far: two null mutants <italic>hisCl1</italic><sup><italic>134</italic></sup> (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pantazis et al., 2008</xref>) and <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup>, as well as <italic>hclB</italic><sup><italic>T1</italic></sup> (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Yusein et al., 2008</xref>). In the present study we demonstrated that the absolute sensitivity of both on- and off-transients, estimated by their 0.5&#x000a0;mV thresholds, was increased to almost the same degree. This is in agreement with the results obtained in our previous study (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Yusein et al., 2008</xref>). In no point along the stimulus intensity scale could we obtain a lower sensitivity of the mutant responses, as reported by <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pantazis et al. (2008)</xref> for the null mutant <italic>hisCl1</italic><sup><italic>134</italic></sup>. A possible explanation of this discrepancy might a difference in the <italic>hisCl1</italic><sup><italic>134</italic></sup> flies background. In our study flies with wild-type eye colour only were used, while <italic>hisCl1</italic><sup><italic>134</italic></sup> are actually double mutant <italic>white</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup>; <italic>hisCl1</italic><sup><italic>134</italic></sup>. More recently it has been reported that <italic>white</italic> mutants have about half the wild-type amount of histamine in the head (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Borycz et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>white</italic> protein is expressed in lamina epithelial glia, at the same place where <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pantazis et al. (2008)</xref> found HCLB. <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Borycz et al. (2008)</xref> propose that histamine uptake by the epithelial glia might be <italic>white</italic> dependent. A genetic interaction between <italic>white</italic> and <italic>hclB</italic> therefore seems possible. In our preliminary studies on double mutants <italic>st hclB</italic>, the mutation in <italic>scarlet</italic>, known to be a binding partner of <italic>white</italic>, altered the effect of the <italic>hclB</italic> mutation on the on-transient amplitude (unpublished data). In spite of the discrepancies mentioned, the results of this study as well as of the previous studies, show that HCLB-mediated influences are involved in the sensitivity control of the visual responses, which may be important for keeping the responses out of saturation. As the HCLB channels have been immunolabeled exclusively in the lamina glial cells (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Pantazis et al., 2008</xref>), the contribution of the glial cells to the sensitivity control seems to be important. We can only speculate if the glial cells exert their effects through neurotransmitter clearance, changes in the resistance (current distribution) or some other effects, dependent on the involvement of the glial cells in the lamina cell circuitry.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Nadya Velikova, Anelia Balacheva, Elena Markova and Margarita Sotirova for technical help.
