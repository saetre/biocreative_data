We conducted a large-scale evaluation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes for cancer to identify common variants that influence bladder cancer risk. An Illumina GoldenGate assay was used to genotype 1,433 SNPs within or near 386 genes in 1,086 cases and 1,033 controls in Spain. The most significant finding was in the 5&#x02032; UTR of <italic>VEGF</italic> (rs25648, <italic>p</italic> for likelihood ratio test, 2 degrees of freedom &#x0003d; 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>). To further investigate the region, we analyzed 29 additional SNPs in <italic>VEGF,</italic> selected to saturate the promoter and 5&#x02032; UTR and to tag common genetic variation in this gene. Three additional SNPs in the promoter region (rs833052, rs1109324, and rs1547651) were associated with increased risk for bladder cancer: odds ratio (95&#x00025; confidence interval): 2.52 (1.06&#x02013;5.97), 2.74 (1.26&#x02013;5.98), and 3.02 (1.36&#x02013;6.63), respectively; and a polymorphism in intron 2 (rs3024994) was associated with reduced risk: 0.65 (0.46&#x02013;0.91). Two of the promoter SNPs and the intron 2 SNP showed linkage disequilibrium with rs25648. Haplotype analyses revealed three blocks of linkage disequilibrium with significant associations for two blocks including the promoter and 5&#x02032; UTR (global <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02 and 0.009, respectively). These findings are biologically plausible since <italic>VEGF</italic> is critical in angiogenesis, which is important for tumor growth, its elevated expression in bladder tumors correlates with tumor progression, and specific 5&#x02032; UTR haplotypes have been shown to influence promoter activity. Associations between bladder cancer risk and other genes in this report were not robust based on false discovery rate calculations. In conclusion, this large-scale evaluation of candidate cancer genes has identified common genetic variants in the regulatory regions of <italic>VEGF</italic> that could be associated with bladder cancer risk.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>This article reports findings from a large-scale evaluation of common variation in candidate genes for cancer to identify variants that influence bladder cancer risk.

Consistent with SNP analyses, this haplotype was also associated with a reduction in risk. Two other haplotypes carried at least one variant for three correlated SNPs individually associated with risk (rs1109324, rs1547651, and rs25648). Both haplotypes were associated with increases in risk, although the association for the haplotye carrying only the rs25648 variant (GAGATGCGTCGGCCCCC) was not significant, possibly due to its low frequency in the population (1.0&#x00025; of controls) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030029-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, haplotype analyses cannot help distinguish which of the three correlated SNPs is most important in determining risk.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>An exploratory analysis of 1,433 SNPs in or near 386 genes involved in cancer-related pathways using the GoldenGate assay led to the identification of novel associations for several promising genes, the most notable finding, a 5&#x02032; UTR SNP in <italic>VEGF.</italic> Subsequent analyses that captured nearly all common variants in this gene showed additional associations with SNPs in the promoter and intron 2, providing further evidence for the importance of variation in regulatory elements of <italic>VEGF</italic> and bladder cancer risk.</p><p>The association of common genetic variation in <italic>VEGF</italic> with bladder cancer risk is biologically plausible for several reasons: (1) <italic>VEGF</italic> has been identified as a critical factor in angiogenesis required for tumor growth, (2) <italic>VEGF</italic> expression in bladder tumors has been related to tumor progression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030029-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, and (3) in vitro studies have suggested that common haplotypes in the 5&#x02032; region of <italic>VEGF</italic> alter gene expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030029-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. A large block of LD that extended from the promoter to intron 5 included the 5&#x02032; UTR SNP (rs25648) that demonstrated the strongest association with bladder cancer risk in our initial screen. This SNP showed a departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls (<italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003d; 0.002), which was not observed for two correlated SNPs in the promoter region (rs1109324 and rs1547651; <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003e; 0.80 between the 5&#x02032; UTR and promoter SNPs) also associated with risk. We did not observe more deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium than expected by chance in our control population, the deviation for rs25648 was not observed in other Caucasian populations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030029-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov">http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov</ext-link>), and quality control samples did not show evidence for genotype errors; therefore, this departure is likely to have occurred by chance. The observed magnitude of the association for rs25648 was larger than for the two promoter SNPs; however, this difference was less apparent after re-estimation of ORs assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, suggesting that it might have occurred by chance.</p><p>Carriers of the 5&#x02032; UTR SNP (rs25648) have been found to have increased VEGF mRNA levels in adenocarcinoma tissues of patients with colorectal adenocarcinomas &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030029-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Although there are no functional studies of the two promoter SNPs associated with bladder cancer risk in our study population, previous studies have shown that variant genotypes or haplotypes falling in the same block of LD (rs699947, rs1570360, rs833061, and rs2010963) were associated with (1) higher induced gene expression from hypoxia in transient transfection assays &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030029-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;; (2) higher VEGF production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030029-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030029-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;; (3) increased promoter activity and responsiveness to phorbol esters in breast cancer cell lines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030029-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;; and (4) tumor aggressiveness in breast cancer patients &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030029-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally, the SNP in intron 2 (rs3024994) associated with reduced risk fell in the same block of LD but showed low correlation with other SNPs, and there are no published studies on its functional significance.</p><p>Only one SNP in <italic>VEGF</italic> (rs699947) has been previously evaluated in relation to bladder cancer risk in a small study of 153 bladder cancer patients and 153 controls in South Korea &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030029-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Consistent with our results, this study found no association between this SNP and bladder cancer risk.

However, based on FDR calculations, taking into account all genes evaluated in this report, the additional associations were not robust and thus should be pursued in additional study populations.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale evaluation of candidate genes in bladder cancer using highly multiplexed technologies. Our data demonstrate that these technologies provide high quality data and that they can be useful in identifying genetic susceptibly factors. In particular, we provide reasonable evidence for an association between common variants in the promoter and 5&#x02032; UTR of <italic>VEGF</italic> and bladder cancer risk. Further work is required to replicate the findings in other populations and to identify the potential causal variant by more detailed genetic mapping, including sequencing and functional characterization of variants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study population.</title><p>The study population has been previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030029-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. Briefly, cases were patients participating in the Spanish Bladder Cancer Study diagnosed with histologically confirmed bladder carcinoma in 1998&#x02013;2001, aged 21&#x02013;80 y (mean &#x0005b;sd&#x0005d; &#x0003d; 66 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030029-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; y), of which 87&#x00025; were males. Controls were selected from patients admitted to participating hospitals for diagnoses believed to be unrelated to the exposures of interest, individually matched to the cases by age at interview within 5-y categories, gender, ethnicity, and region. Demographic and risk factor information was collected at the hospitals using computer-assisted personal interviews. A total of 1,219 cases (84&#x00025; of eligible cases) and 1,271 controls (88&#x00025; of eligible controls) agreed to participate in the study and were interviewed. Of these, 1,188 (97&#x00025;) cases and 1,173 (92&#x00025;) controls provided a blood or buccal cell sample for DNA extraction. Adequate amounts of DNA for genotyping were available from 1,116 cases (including eight from buccal cells) and 1,043 controls (including 36 from buccal cells). Further exclusions were made to reduce heterogeneity (cases with nontransitional histology and nonwhite subjects), or because of DNA contamination or lack of information on smoking status. After exclusions, the available samples for genotype analysis were 1,086 cases and 1,033 controls.</p><p>We obtained informed consent from potential participants in accordance with the National Cancer Institute and local institutional review boards.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Genotyping.</title><p>A GoldenGate assay (Illumina, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.illumina.com">http://www.illumina.com</ext-link>) was developed using SNPs in the SNP500Cancer project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov">http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov</ext-link>) with previous re-sequence analysis and plausible evidence that the gene is related to carcinogenic processes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030029-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. SNP selection favored nonsynonymous SNPs, those previously evaluated in relation to cancer risk, or those with evidence for functional significance. The GoldenGate assay was designed to examine 1,536 SNPs based on an initial screen of 3,072 SNPs drawn from the SNP500Cancer database (November 2004) and subsequently analyzed in the unrelated HapMap Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) Utah samples. Of the 1,536 assays chosen for this study, 103 were dropped from the analysis because of low MAF or assay problems. Thus, we obtained data on 1,433 SNPs in or near 386 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030029-st001">Table S1</xref>). DNA samples from cases and controls were randomly sorted, including 69 duplicated DNA samples for genotyping quality control.</p><p>Based on our primary analysis that showed the strongest association of bladder cancer with an SNP in <italic>VEGF,</italic> we performed a comprehensive evaluation of common variation in this gene. We initially selected 31 SNPs spanning 20 kb 5&#x02032; of the start of transcription to 10 kb 3&#x02032; of the end of exon 8 of the <italic>VEGF</italic> gene using the following methods: (1) 15 tag SNPs were chosen based on the aggressive tagging algorithm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030029-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x02265; 0.80, MAF &#x02265; 0.05) using genotype data from the unrelated HapMap CEPH Utah individuals; (2) 16 SNPs from the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database were added as &#x0201c;fill-in&#x0201d; to ensure the inclusion of an SNP every 2&#x02013;5 kb across the region, particularly in the 5&#x02032; region. iPLEX (Sequenom, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sequenom.com">http://www.sequenom.com</ext-link>) assays were designed and optimized with the SNP500Cancer set of 102 individuals.

Out of 29, 28 assays were optimized on iPLEX and one SNP (rs699947) that could not be included was analyzed using TaqMan (Applied Biosystems, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.appliedbiosystems.com">http://www.appliedbiosystems.com</ext-link>). Because of restricted amounts of DNA available and poor assay performance for a small subset of samples and exclusions for data analyses described earlier (cases with nontransitional histology, nonwhite subjects, and lack of information on smoking status), a total of 926 cases and 900 controls were included in the analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>For each individual SNP, we estimated OR and 95&#x00025; CI using logistic regression models adjusting for gender, age at interview in 5-y categories, region, and smoking status (never, occasional, former, and current; see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030029-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d; for details on the definition of these variables).
