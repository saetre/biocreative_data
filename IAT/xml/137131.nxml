Four Hu proteins, HuD, HuC, HuB&#x0002f;Hel-N1 and HuR, have been identified in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c4">4</xref>).

Hu proteins contain three RNA-binding domains (RBDs) of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-consensus sequence family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c13">13</xref>), and are also called ELAV-like proteins, as they share extensive similarity with <italic>Drosophila</italic> ELAV protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c14">14</xref>). The amino acid sequence of RBDs is well conserved among all of the Hu proteins, and two of these RBDs are located in tandem and separated from the third one near the C-terminus by a linker region that is somewhat diverse in Hu proteins.</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated that mammalian Hu proteins bind specifically to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR) of various mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c20">20</xref>). It was shown that RBD1 and RBD2 are responsible for the binding to AREs <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c21">21</xref>). In addition to ARE-binding, Hu proteins also bind to the poly(A) sequence through RBD3 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c22">22</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that Hu proteins specifically recognize ARE-containing mRNAs by simultaneous binding to AREs and the poly(A) tail, and regulate the expression of the bound mRNAs post-transcriptionally. Indeed, several recent studies have implicated Hu proteins in such post-transcriptional regulation via the stabilization or enhanced translation of various mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c26">26</xref>). In addition, it was demonstrated that the neuron-specific Hu proteins positively regulate neuronal differentiation of two neuronal cell lines, rat PC12 and mouse embryonal carcinoma P19, possibly by post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs of neuronal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c29">29</xref>). However, how neuron-specific Hu proteins achieve such post-transcriptional gene regulation remains unclear, although it was reported previously that HuB associates with polysomes and the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c31">31</xref>).</p><p>In this study, to gain insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the function of Hu proteins, we took advantage of the yeast two-hybrid system to identify the proteins that interact with neuron-specific Hu proteins, and found that Hu proteins can interact with themselves. Further <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses demonstrated multimer formation of HuB and HuD in mammalian cells. Our findings suggest that the Hu complex may act as a site where stabilization and&#x0002f;or efficient translation of ARE-containing mRNAs occur.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid analysis</title><p>Yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out using the MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 2 (Clontech).

Although neuron-specific Hu proteins have been reported to regulate the stability or translation of several mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c34">34</xref>), the molecular mechanism underlying such post-transcriptional regulation remains unclear. To gain insights into the mechanism, it should be important to identify the proteins that interact with neuron-specific Hu proteins. In order to identify such proteins, we used the yeast two-hybrid system in this study. As all neuron-specific Hu proteins are highly expressed in brain tissues containing maturely differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c10">10</xref>), we used a human fetal brain cDNA library for the two-hybrid screening. When we used mouse HuB as bait (mouse HuB is 99&#x00025; identical to human HuB in amino acid sequence) and screened 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> transformants of the library, we were successful in obtaining one positive clone encoding a fragment of human HuC (HuC&#x0002a;) that contained all RBDs but lacked the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues. Based on the result that mouse HuB can interact with human HuC in yeast, we thought that neuron-specific Hu proteins may interact with each other and form a homo- or hetero-complex, since the amino acid sequences of all Hu proteins are well conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c3">3</xref>). We then examined, by two-hybrid analysis, whether HuB could interact with itself or other members of Hu proteins. As expected, the results showed that HuB can interact with itself, HuD and HuC in yeast (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f1">1</xref>A).</p><p>There is a difference in expression profiles during neuronal development among three neuron-specific Hu proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c10">10</xref>). However, several similarities are also found between HuB and HuD: for example, similar subcellular localization and almost the same neurite-inducing activity when overexpressed into PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c28">28</xref>). Therefore, we further examined the interaction properties of HuD to clarify whether HuD could show the same homo- and hetero-complex formation as HuB. To confirm the homo- or hetero- interaction between Hu proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>, we prepared three GST-fusion proteins, GST&#x02013;HuD, GST&#x02013;HuC and GST&#x02013;HuB, and tested their interaction with <italic>in vitro</italic> translated HuD in the presence of RNase. In this experiment, we added RNase A to exclude the possibility of indirect interaction that might occur by bridging via RNA. All GST-fusion proteins, but not GST alone, pulled down the <italic>in vitro</italic> translated HuD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f1">1</xref>B). We cannot exclude strictly the possibility of indirect interaction via poly(A) RNA which might be present in the pull-down reactions, since RNase A does not cleave poly(A) sequence. However, we found that a mutant HuD, HuDmt, with almost no poly(A) binding activity still interacted with GST&#x02013;HuD at almost the same degree as the <italic>in vitro</italic> translated HuD did with GST&#x02013;HuD in the presence of RNase A (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f3">3</xref>D). Therefore, we concluded that the interaction between Hu proteins is basically mediated by protein&#x02013;protein interaction.</p><p>Next, we examined whether the Hu interaction occurs in mammalian cells. To do this, we utilized epitope-tagged Hu proteins. FLAG-tagged HuD (FLAG&#x02013;HuD) was transfected into HeLa cells together with T7-tagged HuD (T7&#x02013;HuD), HuB (T7&#x02013;HuB) or HuC (T7&#x02013;HuC), and then the cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody in the absence of RNase A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f1">1</xref>C). The anti-FLAG antibody pulled down all T7-tagged Hu proteins. Conversely, immunoprecipitation of the same extracts with anti-T7 antibody also pulled down FLAG&#x02013;HuD. The same results were obtained when PC12 cells were used for the immunoprecipitation analysis (data not shown). These results indicate that the interaction between Hu proteins also occurs in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec><title>RBDs are responsible for the interaction between Hu proteins</title><p>To identify the region responsible for the self-interaction of Hu proteins, we constructed several deletion mutants of HuC and tested their interaction with HuB using the two-hybrid system (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f2">2</xref>). HuC fragments containing only the third RBD (CRBD3) or both the second and third RBDs (CRBD2&#x0002b;3) strongly interacted with HuB, as did the full-length HuC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f2">2</xref>B). The fragment containing the first and second RBDs (CRBD1&#x0002b;2) also interacted moderately with HuB, although fragments containing the first RBD (CRBD1) or the second RBD (CRBD2) alone showed only very weak interaction with HuB. Further analysis showed that CRBD3 strongly interacted with itself or CRBD1&#x0002b;2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f2">2</xref>C). It should be noted that the linker region between RBD2 and RBD3 of HuC did not show such an interaction. Thus, these results suggest that the RBDs of Hu proteins function as self-interaction domains.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficient interaction between Hu proteins requires RNA-binding activity</title><p>Several RNA-binding proteins have been reported to self-associate via their RNA-binding regions, including RBDs, KH-motifs and other RNA-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c39">39</xref>). Some of these proteins require RNA for their efficient interaction, whereas others do not. Therefore, we further tested the possible involvement of RNA in the Hu interaction using mammalian cell extracts, although the interaction between Hu proteins occurs in the absence of RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f1">1</xref>B). To do this, T7&#x02013;HuD and FLAG&#x02013;HuD were expressed independently in HeLa cells, and the two cell extracts were mixed with or without RNase treatment, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-T7 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f3">3</xref>A and B). The HuD&#x02013;HuD interaction occurred efficiently in the absence of RNase treatment. In contrast, the interaction became very weak after RNase treatment. The same result was obtained with PC12 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that some cellular RNA(s) strongly activates the Hu interaction, although Hu proteins have a weak intrinsic ability to interact together even in the absence of such RNA.</p><p>If the RNA-bound forms of Hu proteins have increased self-interaction, mutant Hu proteins with reduced RNA-binding activity would be expected to show only an intrinsic ability to interact with other Hu proteins. To test this possibility, we constructed an HuD mutant (HuDmt) that has reduced RNA-binding activity because it contains amino acid substitutions in the RNP1 motif, which is known to be essential for RNA binding, of all RBDs. The substituted amino acid residues are expected to be solvent-exposed and it is thought that the mutation to these sites does not destroy the overall domain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c40">40</xref>). In our case, these substitutions were found to abolish the RNA-binding activity of HuD, since the HuDmt showed almost no binding to poly(U) RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f3">3</xref>C) and to poly(A) RNA (data not shown). As expected, HuDmt showed significantly reduced ability to interact with GST&#x02013;HuD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f3">3</xref>D). This result is consistent with our prediction that efficient interaction between Hu proteins occurs only when they bind to some cellular RNA. Considering the RNA-binding specificity of Hu proteins, it is possible that the occupation of RBDs by ARE-containing mRNAs may promote some conformational change of the domains that results in more efficient interaction of Hu proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Complex formation of Hu proteins in mammalian cells</title><p>The results described above indicate that Hu proteins can form homo- and hetero-complexes in cells. To detect such complexes more directly in mammalian cells, we performed <italic>in situ</italic> chemical crosslinking analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c33">33</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f4">4</xref>). PC12 cells expressing T7&#x02013;HuD were treated with thio-specific (BMH) or amine-specific (DSS) chemical crosslinking reagents, and the resultant crosslinked complexes in the cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-T7 antibody. In addition to the monomeric HuD of 41 kDa, three specific crosslinked complexes could be detected using either of the crosslinkers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f4">4</xref>A). Two of the complexes had molecular masses of &#x0223c;80 and 120 kDa, and were likely to be the dimer and trimer of HuD, respectively.</p><p>To confirm this conclusion, we examined the crosslinked complexes of two kinds of HuD deletion constructs, RBD1-del and RBD3-del, which are smaller than the wild-type HuD by &#x0223c;9 kDa because of deletion of the first RBD and the third RBD, respectively. As in the case of wild-type HuD, the crosslinked complexes of the dimer and trimer of both deletion constructs could be detected as judged by their molecular masses (which reflected the difference in size from those of the wild-type HuD) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f4">4</xref>B), indicating that the two crosslinked complexes of HuD are the dimer and trimer. Although RBD3-del lacked RBD3 that was suggested as a strong self-interaction region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f2">2</xref>), it could form multimeric complexes. The formation of multimeric complexes of RBD3-del may be mediated by the region between RBD1 and RBD2 (RBD1&#x0002b;2), since the region has a moderate interaction activity with Hu protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f2">2</xref>). Another crosslinked complex of &#x0223c;90 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f4">4</xref>A, indicated by X) is clearly different from the homo-oligomers of HuD. This crosslinked complex, like the dimer and trimer of HuD, was not sensitive to treatment with RNase or phosphatase (data not shown). In addition, a crosslinked complex corresponding to the X complex (X&#x02032;) could be detected for RBD1-del but not for RBD3-del (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f4">4</xref>B). Therefore, although we do not know the identity of the X complex of HuD at present, it may contain some protein(s) that associate with the third RBD of HuD.</p><p>The same crosslinked complexes were also detected when HeLa cells were used (data not shown), indicating that these complexes are not cell specific. Therefore, we concluded that HuD exists in mammalian cells as dimer and trimer complexes, as well as in the monomer form. We also examined the complex formation of other neuron-specific Hu proteins and found that under the same conditions as described above for HuD, HuB can form dimers but not trimers, whereas HuC cannot form any complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f4">4</xref>C). In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f4">4</xref>E, the positions of cysteine residues within Hu proteins and ELAV are shown, which are the possible sites for chemical crosslinking by BMH. As the RBD1 deletion mutant of HuD can form multimeric complexes efficiently (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f4">4</xref>B), it is most likely that efficient chemical crosslinking between HuD molecules by BMH occurs within RBD3. Two cysteine residues within RBD3 are well conserved among Hu proteins, indicating that different complex formation among neuron-specific Hu proteins is not due to the chemical specificity of the crosslinker, but due to the intrinsic property of each Hu protein. These results also show that the crosslinked product X is specific for HuD. No biochemical feature specific for any one of the neuron-specific Hu proteins has been reported previously. Thus, the differential complex formation among Hu proteins revealed in this study is the first biochemical evidence that suggests a functional difference of the neuron-specific Hu proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, under the same crosslinking conditions as for HuD, ubiquitously expressed Hu protein, HuR, showed only the dimer formation, like HuB, whereas <italic>Drosophila</italic> ELAV did not show any complex formation, like HuC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f4">4</xref>D). Although it has been shown recently that HuR associates with several specific proteins in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c41">41</xref>), we could not detect such interactions in our <italic>in situ</italic> crosslinking assay. HuR and ELAV have been demonstrated to be involved in mRNA stabilization and alternative splicing regulation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c43">43</xref>). The inability to form complexes may indicate that HuC has a function distinct from the control of mRNA stability and&#x0002f;or translation, perhaps acting as a splicing regulator, like ELAV.</p></sec><sec><title>Multimeric HuD complexes retain RNA-binding activity and interact with Hu proteins</title><p>Since Hu proteins can bind to RNAs containing AREs or U-rich sequences <italic>in vitro</italic>, we examined whether the crosslinked complexes of HuD retain such an RNA-binding activity. To do this, we prepared HeLa cell extracts containing the crosslinked T7&#x02013;HuD complexes, and then tested their binding to poly(U) RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f5">5</xref>A). The three crosslinked complexes of HuD strongly bound to poly(U) RNA, as did monomeric T7&#x02013;HuD. This indicates that the dimer and trimer complexes of HuD retain the same RNA-binding activity as monomeric HuD. In addition, the RNA-binding ability of the dimer and trimer complexes of HuD implies that the RNA- and protein-binding surfaces of HuD, which may be located within RBDs, are essentially different. This is consistent with our interpretation that the inefficient interaction between HuD and HuDmt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f3">3</xref>D) is primarily caused by the RNA-binding deficiency of HuDmt, which leads to the inability to form an appropriate conformation for efficient protein&#x02013;protein interaction. Moreover, the crosslinked complexes of HuD still retain the ability to interact with HuD and HuB proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f5">5</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Granular distribution of HuD in cells</title><p>The results described above suggested that multiple HuD molecules form a large complex in cells which includes various ARE-containing mRNAs. Indeed, close inspection of immunostaining views revealed that wild-type HuD showed granular distribution when it was expressed in two neurogenic cell lines, PC12 and SH-SY5Y (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f6">6</xref>, left). Consistent with its very low protein&#x02013;protein interaction ability, HuDmt was distributed almost uniformly in the cytoplasm of both cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf567f6">6</xref>, right). It should be noted that HuDmt has almost no neurite-inducing activity in PC12 cells (data not shown). It is likely that the granule formation of wild-type HuD reflects multimeric complex formation of the proteins together with some ARE-containing mRNAs. Previously, it was demonstrated that human ELAV-like protein Hel-N1&#x0002f; Hel-N2 also exists as granular RNP complexes associated with polysomes and the cytoskeleton in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c31">31</xref>). Those authors&#x02019; interpretation of this granular distribution was that multiple Hel-N1 molecules might assemble at their target site on some mRNA, and that the factor responsible for this nucleation is their target sequences. Based on the results of our present study, we propose that protein&#x02013;protein interaction between Hu proteins is the principal nucleation factor for the formation of such granular RNP complexes and that the RNP complex is comprised of multiple Hu molecules and ARE-containing mRNAs.</p><p>To date, various RNA-binding proteins have been reported to form dimers or multimer complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c44">44</xref>), and their important roles in regulating splicing or development have been discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c44">44</xref>). However, to our knowledge, there are few reports about multimerization of RNA-binding proteins that are involved in neuronal differentiation. Our results suggest that multimerization of two neuron-specific Hu proteins also has an important effect on their function <italic>in vivo</italic>. Considering that Hu proteins have been implicated in the stabilization and&#x0002f;or enhanced translation of ARE-containing mRNA, one can speculate that Hu proteins that bind to ARE-containing mRNAs assemble efficiently via protein&#x02013;protein interaction, which is facilitated by RNA binding, and eventually form large RNP complexes. Then, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf567c31">31</xref>), these complexes efficiently interact with the translational apparatus so that the stability and&#x0002f;or translation of such mRNA(s) is up-regulated. In addition to such post-transcriptional regulation, it is possible that granular RNP complexes of Hu proteins may contribute to the temporal storage of ARE-containing mRNA(s) whose immediate and high expression in response to extracellular signals is needed for proper neuronal functions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf567f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Protein&#x02013;protein interaction between Hu proteins.
