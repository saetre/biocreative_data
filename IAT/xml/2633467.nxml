Its outermost layer is the corneal epithelium, which plays a significant role in maintaining transparency. Corneal epithelium undergoes continuous self-renewal, through the actions of the stem cells in the palisades of Vogt in the corneal limbus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. These slow cycling, relatively undifferentiated, limbal stem cells have high proliferative potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. The limbal stem cells generate transient amplifying cells (TAC) that migrate to the central cornea, which is devoid of stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. The TAC, with only limited proliferative capacity, subsequently enter into a terminal differentiation pathway.</p><p>A deficiency of limbal stem cells, caused by chemical trauma (chemical injury) or by eye diseases such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, is a major cause of visual impairment in humans. In persons with limbal stem cell deficiency, the adjacent conjunctival cells migrate to the cornea, causing corneal opacification and subsequent functional blindness. Since limbal stem cells are required to restore the corneal epithelium, conventional corneal transplantation is unsuccessful for the above diseases. Recent therapeutic interventions demonstrate that stem cell allograft transplantation can restore vision in patients with limbal stem cell deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. The ex vivo expansion of limbal stem cells was a significant milestone for restoration of corneal epithelial integrity through transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. However, since the limbal epithelium consists of three cell types: stem cells, TAC, and differentiated cells, isolating a pure population of stem cells is difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>].</p><p>Although a wide variety of stem cell markers have been proposed, no known marker or method is available to differentiate stem cells from TAC in the corneal epithelium. However, advances in stem cell research in hematopoietic, neural, and epidermal systems help us to borrow some of the stem/progenitor cell markers and might also be usable as limbal stem cell markers. In a hematopoietic system, stem cells can be isolated using specific markers and with side scatter as the main parameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Beta-1 integrin showed a two- to threefold increase in intensity in epidermal stem cells, compared with the epidermal TAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. This same phenomenon is observed in human hair follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. Because corneal epithelium and epidermal keratinocytes have similar characteristics, we undertook an immunohistochemical characterization of the &#x003b2;-1 integrin and &#x003b1;-6 integrin. Some reports suggest that the G2 subtype member of the ATP binding cassette transporter (ABCG2) may act as a stem cell marker since it is expressed exclusively in the limbal zone and believed to be responsible for the side population phenotype of the ocular surface epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>] which exhibits stem cell properties. We also analyzed the expression pattern of ABCG2 in the limbal and central corneal epithelium.</p><p>Previous reports suggest the role played by Notch family members in maintaining stem cells in neural and hematopoietic systems might also apply to corneal epithelial stem cells. Notch transmembrane receptor 1 (Notch 1) and the other family members are highly conserved, and play crucial roles in determining cell fates and developmental processes through cell to cell interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. In the presence of the ligand, notch receptors undergo sequential proteolytic cleavage steps that ultimately release the intracellular domain from the membrane. Modulation of the Notch pathway revealed its role in differentiation, proliferation, and self-renewal mainly in the neural and hematopoietic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. In the hematopoietic system, Notch receptors are found in early stem cells and their ligands are found in the bone marrow stroma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Notch members are reportedly essential for maintenance, but not for the generation, of neural stem cells in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. In mice, the Notch signals have a profound effect on the proliferative potential of the progenitors in the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. Inactivation of Notch-1 in young mice caused the development of opaque plaques in the cornea, leading to blindness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Impaired differentiation of prostatic epithelial cells was found in Notch-1 conditional knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Because Notch-1 plays an active role in maintaining progenitor cells in an undifferentiated manner in several systems, we decided to evaluate its role in limbal stem cells to determine whether it could be a marker for isolating and enriching stem cells to improve transplantation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Epilife corneal growth medium was purchased from Cascade Biologicals (Portland, OR). Notch-1 and Notch-2 antibodies were purchased from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA), and &#x003b1;-6 integrin (GOH3) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). GAPDH antibody, &#x003b2;-1 integrin antibody, and ABCG2 antibody were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA).The secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence and the HRP conjugated secondary antibody for western blotting were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA).

All tissues used for this study were stored for less than 4 days in preservative (Optisol-GS; Baush and Lomb, Rochester, NY). Human tissue was handled according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Explant culture was done according to established protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>] after minor modifications. Briefly, the central portions of cornea were removed by careful trephination. The excess sclera, conjunctiva, and iris were also removed. The limbal rim was cut into pieces of about 2x2 mm<sup>2</sup>. Each piece was put on a cover slip inside a culture dish and covered with a drop of Epilife growth media with human corneal growth supplement (HCGS). The explants were then cultured in the same media. Only primary cultures were used in this experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Immunofluorescence staining was performed according to previously reported methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. In brief, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and then washed and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 15 min. The cells were incubated in primary antibody (&#x003b1;-6 1:50, &#x003b2;-1 1:100, Notch-1 1:10, and ABCG2 1:20) for 1 h at 37 &#x000b0;C, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline 3 times for 5 min each. The cells were then incubated in secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:40 for 45 min, washed 3 times, and mounted with antifade mounting medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cryosectioned corneal buttons were stained with the antibodies using a similar protocol and analyzed by confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Oberkochen, Germany). The epithelial sheet was removed from the stroma by dispase digestion using the established protocol and processed for whole mount [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. Briefly, after the rims were rubbed off, the endothelium and uvea were put in dispase 50 mg/ml for 18 h at 4 &#x000b0;C with moderate shaking. Under a dissecting microscope, the already loose epithelial sheet was separated with a flat-edged spatula. The whole mount was stained for &#x003b2;-1 integrin, Notch-1, and ABCG2. All immunofluorescence was performed with negative controls by incubating the sections with PBS in place of the primary antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Notch-1 cDNA, obtained as a gift from Dr. Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas, was transfected into the Cos-7 cell line. The Cos-7 cells were plated one day before transfection. When the cells attained 60-80% confluence, they were transfected with DNA-TransFectin (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA) complex (a reaction mixture consisted of 2 ug of Notch 1 plasmid DNA in 100 &#x003bc;l of the media and 8 &#x003bc;l of the TransFectin reagent). Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were collected and lysed for protein extraction and used for western blotting. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (BioRad). Identical amounts of protein were separated on 10% SDS/PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). The transfer was monitored by a prestained protein molecular weight marker (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After transfer, blots were probed with hybridoma supernatant for Notch-1 at a dilution of 1:10, then incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rat antibody for Notch-1. Immunodetection was performed using the chemiluminescence method according to manufacture's reccomendations (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with GAPDH antibody to visualize equal protein loading.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Intensity of the &#x003b2;-1 integrin staining was increased in the limbal region where limbal stem cells reside.

The corneal zone was almost devoid of Notch-1-expressing cells. Notch-2 showed no specific staining in the limbal or corneal zones (data not shown). In tissue sections, the expression pattern of Notch-1 was clearly in the membrane.</p><p>Immunofluorescence detected the expression of ABCG2 protein in the limbal epithelia, but the central cornea was devoid of cells expressing ABCG2. The antigenicity was not only in the basal cells in the limbus, some of the proximal cells also showed positive staining. Interestingly, double staining with Notch-1 and ABCG2 demonstrated that some of the ABCG2-positive cells also expressed Notch-1. The number of cells positive for both was limited and all Notch-1 positive cells coexpressed ABCG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="f3" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Colocalization of ABCG2 and Notch-1 in the human Limbo-corneal epithelium. <bold>A</bold>: When the whole mount was double stained with ABCG2 and Notch-1, subsets of cells were positive for both.

Western blot analysis revealed a band of approximately 300 kDa that might be full-length Notch-1 expressed in ARH77. Because the ARH 77 showed some processed forms of Notch other than the 110 kDa (data not shown), we transfected the Notch-1 into the Cos-7 cell line.

We sought to separate a true stem cell population from the limbal epithelium, which may not include the TAC. &#x003b2;-1 and &#x003b1;-6 integrins are known to show an intensity difference in the staining of epidermal keratinocytes, with bright cells in the basal region. We observed a similar staining pattern with brightly stained &#x003b2;-1 and &#x003b1;-6 cells in limbal basal cells compared to the basal or suprabasal corneal cells. Our results with &#x003b2;-1 integrin were analogous to Jensen's epidermal stem cell findings of a two- to threefold increase in &#x003b2;-1 intensity compared to that seen in TAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. A recent study of limbal stem cells revealed abundant integrin beta-1 expression by cell membranes of corneal and limbal epithelia with a much higher level of expression by the limbal basal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Earlier, &#x003b1;-6 integrin was also proposed as a stem cell marker since epidermal keratinocytes, which have a high level of &#x003b1;-6 integrin expression, showed stem cell characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. &#x003b1;-6 and &#x003b2;-1 bright cells had much more specific properties of stem cells when compared to &#x003b2;-1 positive and &#x003b1;-6 marginal cells, indicating that &#x003b1;-6 integrin was a potential epidermal stem cell marker. However, the alpha-6 integrin in corneal epithelial stem cells was found more in the suprabasal cells of the limbus than in the limbal basal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Our corneal epithelium study showed a different pattern, comparable to &#x003b2;-1 integrin staining, with brighter cells in the limbal basal region rather than in the suprabasal region. Since integrins mediate cell matrix adhesion, the abundance of &#x003b2;-1 and &#x003b1;-6 integrin in the limbal basal cells may help explain the strong adhesion of the limbal basal cells to the extra cellular matrix. This is evident in the resistance of the limbus to shear forces compared to the central corneal cells. At this stage it is difficult to differentiate between the stem cells and the TAC in the corneal epithelium. All markers we have tried have been inconclusive.</p><p>Notch-1 is known to play an important role in maintenance of undifferentiated cells in neural and hematopoietic systems. We hypothesized that Notch-1 may be present only in the limbal basal cells, especially in the stem cells of the corneal epithelium. It is likely that Notch-1 plays a role in keeping corneal stem cells in an undifferentiated manner in the limbal epithelium, as it was expressed only in a small group of cells in the limbal basal region and was undetected in the central corneal cells. Our findings demonstrate that Notch-1 antibody is specific, It showed a full-length 300 kDA band with Notch-1-transfected COS 7 cells. Our results also showed additional bands, other than 300 kDa, in western blot analysis, a finding that has also been reported in baby hamster kidney cells transfected with Notch-1. The most prominent among the processed forms was 110 kDa, and a precursor/product relationship was found between full-length Notch and the 110 kDa Notch fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. A similar pattern of expression was seen in rat retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>].</p><p>The Notch-1 signal identified in the cytoplasm and nucleus in cultured cells might be an activated form of Notch-1. The activated form is usually found in differentiated cells. Immunohistochemical analysis has regularly failed to reveal the nuclear translocation of Notch-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>], but, in rare instances, Notch-1 was expressed in the nucleus in differentiated human cervical epithelium and in some human cervical neoplasms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. There are also reports of the Notch-1 signal in the nucleus in differentiated neurons in the rat retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. In our studies, the staining pattern was similar in sections of corneal limbal region and in whole mount. In both cases the signal was entirely found in a few cells in the limbal basal region, and very specifically membrane staining. When the Notch signal in the culture is compared with the sections of limbus and whole mount, the cells with Notch -1 expression in the limbal basal region might be undifferentiated cells with stem cell properties. We have identified cells which coexpress ABCG2 and Notch-1. Expression of ABCG2 was previously suggested as a corneal stem cell marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>] and the side population cells over expressed the ABCG2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Prostatic stem cells also expressed ABCG2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>], but the prostatic transient amplifying cells stained negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. Several studies identified an ABCG2-dependent side population in a wide variety of adult tissues in different species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. A recent report demonstrated the presence of an ABCG2-dependent side population of cells in the human periodontal ligaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. In limbal basal cells the ABCG2 expression was found to be high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>] and considered to be stem cell-associated marker. Connexin 43 (Cx43) marginal cells from the limbal basal region expressed more ABCG2-positive cells compared to Cx43 positive cells, with little to no positive staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. One critical question that needs to be addressed is whether TAC stain negative for ABCG2. In the present study we found that ABCG2-positive cells were found more in the limbal region compared to Notch-1 positive cells. Given the limited number of Notch-1 and ABCG2-double positive cells, Notch-1 may be a potential stem cell marker</p><p>Notch keeps cells in their proliferative state by inhibiting differentiation, as was found with the crypts of intestinal cells in the mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. The Notch family members and their ligands maintain a balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. Notch receptors are expressed in hematopoietic cells, and they control stem cell induction and lineage cell fate decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>]. The Notch signaling pathway is active in adult hematopoietic stem cells and is down regulated in terminally differentiated progeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. Our study found the same phenomenon, with Notch-1 expressed in the limbal basal cells but barely detected in the terminally differentiated corneal epithelial layer. Notch pathway activation inhibits myogenic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>]. Notch is also thought to contribute to neural precursor cell maintenance, inhibiting the differentiation of these cells to neurons and oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>]. It is likely that Notch-1 plays a similar role in keeping corneal stem cells in an undifferentiated manner in the limbal epithelium. Our data provide a rationale for future work to focus on the role of Notch members in the development and maintenance of corneal stem cells. Manipulating the Notch pathway may provide a way to enrich stem cells, thus providing new therapeutic strategies to treat corneal stem cell deficiencies. Further studies are underway to examine the role of Notch-1 in corneal development.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas (Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Charlestown, MA) for kindly providing the Notch cDNA and Dr Alan L Epstein (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) for providing the myeloma cell lines.
