This specialized cell division generates gametes, such as sperm and eggs, with a single copy of the genome, so that fertilization restores diploidy. In order for chromosomes to segregate correctly during meiosis, homologs usually must undergo crossing over (genetic exchange) during meiotic prophase. How crossovers are coupled to large-scale changes in chromosome structure is not well understood. Our work shows that the protein ZHP-3 localizes to crossovers late in prophase, coincident with a transition in which chromosomes initiate progressive restructuring around the crossover. We have found that a ZHP-3-GFP fusion protein is competent to promote genetic exchange but not proper segregation. Chromosomes from these mutant animals exhibit defects in this late-prophase restructuring, suggesting that alterations in chromosome architecture that typically accompany crossovers have not occurred. We propose that ZHP-3 acts at crossovers to coordinate genetic exchange with higher order changes in chromosome structure that promote proper chromosome segregation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiosis generates haploid gametes from diploid cells by coupling a single round of replication with two successive chromosomes segregation events: meiosis I, in which homologous chromosomes segregate away from each other and meiosis II, in which sister chromatids are partitioned. To ensure proper homolog disjunction, physical linkages must be introduced between homologs by processes that occur during meiotic prophase: homolog pairing, the assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC), and crossover recombination. Together these mechanisms introduce the chiasmata that link homologs together until anaphase I. Defects in any of these processes produce meiotic chromosome segregation defects that lead to inviability among the resulting zygotes, and can also result in developmental defects and cancer predisposition.</p><p>In budding yeast, the Zip3 protein appears to couple crossover recombination and synapsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Agarwal1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, SC disassembly occurs asymmetrically, with loss of central element proteins along one &#x0201c;arm&#x0201d; of each chromosome pair. This asymmetry is thought to be directed by sites of crossover recombination, and to guide the subchromosomal localization of components, including the aurora kinase AIR-2, which regulate the orderly release of cohesion and proper chromosome segregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Nabeshima1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Concomitant with or soon after desynapsis, chromosome arms condense and re-orient around the site of a crossover to form a compact, cruciform bivalent.

However, many details of this dynamic restructuring remain poorly understood.</p><p>The work presented here implicates ZHP-3 as an important player in these events in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We find that the protein exhibits dynamic localization during meiotic prophase, localizing along the SC in early pachytene, asymmetrically on the SC in late pachytene, and at foci in late pachytene/diplotene. These foci number six per nucleus in wild-type hermaphrodites and mark the boundary of asymmetric SC disassembly during diplotene/diakinesis. Analysis of mutants that exhibit perturbed number and placement of crossovers further supports the idea that ZHP-3 foci correspond to sites of reciprocal exchange.</p><p>We have found that a ZHP-3-GFP fusion protein expressed from a low-copy-number transgene that has been stably integrated into the genome (<italic>zhp-3::gfp</italic>) largely recapitulates the localization of endogenous ZHP-3 and partially complements a <italic>zhp-3</italic> null allele in a temperature-sensitive manner. Mutant animals expressing only ZHP-3-GFP produce elevated numbers of inviable embryos and male progeny, both indicative of meiotic chromosome missegregation. Cytological analysis indicates that oocytes expressing the fusion protein in the absence of wild-type ZHP-3 show defects in SC disassembly and bivalent structure, which likely account for their segregation defects. Nevertheless, this fusion protein promotes reciprocal exchange at nearly wild-type frequencies in the absence of endogenous ZHP-3. Together these observations suggest that crossovers are not sufficient to ensure proper homolog segregation, and that ZHP-3 performs an essential function after crossover formation which is compromised in the fusion protein. A mutation in the gene encoding the SUMO polypeptide, <italic>smo-1</italic>, results in defects resembling those seen in <italic>zhp-3::gfp</italic> mutants at higher temperatures, and exacerbates meiotic defects when combined with the <italic>zhp-3::gfp</italic> allele.</p><p>We propose that ZHP-3 has two separable roles during <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis, promoting crossover formation and mediating the appropriate restructuring of bivalents so that chiasmata ensure proper segregation. We suggest that this second role reflects a conserved function of the protein in coordinating recombination with synaptonemal complex morphogenesis; in contrast to its <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> counterpart, Zip3, which appears to couple crossover recombination with synaptonemal complex assembly, <italic>C. elegans</italic> ZHP-3 coordinates recombination with SC disassembly and bivalent formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ZHP-3 Localization Is Dynamic during Meiotic Prophase</title><p>The localization of ZHP-3 was previously analyzed using a GFP fusion protein expressed from a high-copy array integrated into the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Jantsch1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. To understand its role in more detail, we generated polyclonal antibodies to localize the endogenous protein. The spatial and temporal organization of meiotic nuclei in the worm germline facilitates analysis of protein localization as a function of progression through meiotic prophase (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). During early prophase, we observed that ZHP-3 protein localized along the synaptonemal complex (SC), similar to previous observations. The protein was initially detected on chromosomes in early pachytene. Although its localization to the SC required the loading of central element components, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Jantsch1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, it initially appeared as puncta along continuous stretches of SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g001">Figure 1B, C and E</xref>). This preceded complete synapsis, since ZHP-3 localized to synapsed chromosome regions in the presence of unsynapsed chromosomes, which did not stain with ZHP-3 (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g001">Figure 1D and E</xref>). ZHP-3 then accumulated along the SC so that by mid-pachytene, it had spread along the full length of the SC. However, by contrast to the axial and central element proteins (respectively) HTP-3 and SYP-1, its appearance was not uniform along the length of the SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g001">Figure 1F, G</xref> and data not shown). By late pachytene, localization along the length of the SC became more restricted, such that each synapsed homolog pair showed an extensive stretch of SYP-1 lacking ZHP-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g001">Figure 1H&#x02013;K</xref>). Three-dimensional reconstruction of pairs of homologs revealed that ZHP-3 was asymmetrically localized from an interstitial point to one end of the SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g001">Figure 1L</xref>). The presence of SYP-1 along the full length of these synapsed chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g001">Figure 1L and M</xref>) indicates that this shift in ZHP-3 localization precedes the crossover-dependent asymmetric disassembly of the SC that accompanies the transition from late pachytene to diplotene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Nabeshima1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutations that prevent complete synapsis and thereby extend the region of polarized nuclear morphology (<italic>e.g.</italic>, pairing center deficiencies or <italic>him-8</italic> mutants) also delayed the shift in ZHP-3 distribution, extending the region of nuclei that retain ZHP-3 localization along the length of the SC (data not shown).</p><fig id="pgen-1000235-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000235.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>ZHP-3 shows dynamic localization during meiotic prophase.</title><p>(A) Wild-type gonad stained with DAPI and antibodies against SYP-1 and ZHP-3.

We established that the trangene does not result in meiotic defects in animals carrying either one or two copies of the endogenous gene. Hermaphrodites expressing both the endogenous gene and the transgene produced broods indistinguishable from wild-type animals in number, embryonic viability and frequency of male self-progeny at 15&#x000b0;, 20&#x000b0; and 25&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000235-t001">Table 1</xref>). This indicates that 1) the fusion protein does not result in a dominant negative effect at any temperature, and 2) expression of ZHP-3 from the <italic>pie-1</italic> promoter does not interfere with embryonic development. These properties, together with the prominence of ZHP-3-GFP foci at late pachytene, make the fusion protein a neutral and valuable cytological reporter for crossover formation when the endogenous gene product is also present (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g001">Figures 1G with 3D</xref>).

This value was very similar to that obtained by quantification of endogenous ZHP-3 immunofluorescence: 38.5&#x00025; of germline nuclei in these animals exhibited greater than five ZHP-3 foci. In this experiment, care was taken to limit analysis to late pachytene nuclei with prominent foci, and this is reflected in the small number of nuclei counted (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;52). Importantly, whether the endogenous or fusion protein was used as a marker, this cytological assay revealed a higher frequency of multiple crossover events on autosomes than the 5.6&#x00025; of chromosomes previously detected by SNP-based analysis of progeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Carlton1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This may indicate that nuclei with multiple crossovers are enriched among the population of oocytes that are eventually culled by apoptosis, or that multiple crossover events may frequently escape detection by SNP analysis due to their chromosomal distribution.</p><p>We also quantified ZHP-3-GFP foci at 20&#x000b0; in <italic>zim-1</italic> mutants, in which two pairs of autosomes fail to synapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Phillips1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. This experiment allowed us to address two questions: 1) Does autosomal asynapsis result in an increased frequency of multiple crossovers on other chromosomes? and 2) Does a greater number of unsynapsed chromosomes result in a more severe defect in crossover control? Most nuclei (65&#x00025;) showed four ZHP-3-GFP foci, but 17&#x00025; and 16&#x00025; of nuclei contained five and six ZHP-3-GFP foci, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). This revealed that the ability of an unsynapsed chromosome to increase crossing-over on other chromosomes is not limited to situations in which <italic>X</italic> chromosomes are asynapsed, and the severity of the defect is similar whether one pair or two pairs of chromosomes are prevented from synapsing. Similar to <italic>meDf2</italic> mutants, 35&#x00025; of oocytes in <italic>zim-1</italic> mutants had more than one crossover per synapsed chromosome pair. Interestingly, we rarely saw more than six ZHP-3-GFP foci in meiotic nuclei of either mutant analyzed: 2.14&#x00025; in <italic>meDf2</italic> (1.78&#x00025; with seven foci per nucleus and 0.36&#x00025; with eight) and 1.38&#x00025; in <italic>zim-1</italic> mutants (0.69&#x00025; with seven foci per nucleus and 0.69&#x00025; with eight), compared to 1.37&#x00025; in wild-type hermaphrodites (all with seven foci per nucleus). This suggests the existence of a mechanism to constrain the total number of crossovers.

We tested this by localizing the ZHP-3-GFP fusion protein in the germlines of worms propagated at the different temperatures. To our surprise, not only did we detect similar levels of protein at all temperatures, but we also observed similar numbers of foci at late pachytene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g004">Figure 4B, D</xref> and data not shown). At 15&#x000b0;, foci were visible in late pachytene meiotic nuclei, much as when the fusion protein is present along with the endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). At 20&#x000b0; and 25&#x000b0;, ZHP-3-GFP foci were detectable but co-existed with stretches of ZHP-3-GFP along the length of the SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g004">Figure 4D</xref> and data not shown). Gonads from animals grown at higher temperatures also showed more extensive regions of nuclei with polarized morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that meiotic progression may be perturbed in these situations despite complete synapsis (data not shown). We quantified foci in animals grown at 15&#x000b0; and 20&#x000b0;; this was not done at 25&#x000b0; because of the abundance of ZHP-3-GFP along the SC at this temperature. Most oocytes displayed five or six foci, with a mean number of 5.15 at both temperatures, suggesting that similar numbers of crossovers are completed at 15&#x000b0; and 20&#x000b0; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g004">Figure 4E</xref>).

This incongruity suggests that the bivalents that do form in <italic>zhp-3::gfp</italic> mutants are not functional for proper chromosome segregation. This idea is further supported by the defects in bivalent structure, as visualized by DAPI and HTP-3 staining, we observe in <italic>zhp-3::gfp</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g006">Figures 6V and W</xref>).</p><p>In light of the defects in SC disassembly and bivalent structure that we observed in <italic>zhp-3::gfp</italic> mutants, we favor the hypothesis that after promoting crossover formation, ZHP-3 remains localized to the site of the crossover to regulate SC disassembly and bivalent formation to produce stable bivalents with functional chiasmata. The temperature sensitivity we observe may be explained by ZHP-3-GFP's loss of function at higher temperatures. Alternatively, it may reflect an increased requirement for ZHP-3 function at higher temperature, potentially analogous to the barrier to crossover formation in budding yeast sporulated at 33&#x000b0;C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Borner1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We interpret our data to indicate that <italic>zhp-3::gfp</italic> mutants have four classes of chromosome configurations during late meiotic prophase: 1) univalents which have not undergone crossing-over. These are most likely to be <italic>X</italic> chromosomes, given the significant reduction in recombination we observe on the <italic>X</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g004">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000235-t003">Table 3</xref>); 2) univalents that have undergone recombination but failed to maintain their linkage during disrupted bivalent differentiation, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g006">Figure 6Q&#x02013;T</xref>); 3) bivalents that have recombined but undergone defective bivalent differentiation, preventing their proper segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g006">Figures 6M&#x02013;P</xref>); and 4) functional bivalents that can be segregated correctly. With increasing temperature (or reduction of SUMO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), <italic>zhp-3::gfp</italic> is less able to coordinate crossover formation with large-scale changes in chromosome structure that accompany bivalent differentiation. Consequently, class 4 becomes more rare and classes 2 and 3 more prevalent, resulting in meiotic chromosome missegregation and an increased frequency of inviable and male self-progeny. Class 1 is likely to remain constant given the small differences in recombination frequency on both the <italic>X</italic> and autosomes between 15&#x000b0; and 20&#x000b0; in <italic>zhp-3::gfp</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g004">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000235-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>The inability of class 3 bivalents to segregate correctly may be structural. Defective bivalent differentiation may produce a bivalent that is topologically or structurally unable to segregate due to altered chromosome morphology. An alternate explanation may be that defective bivalent differentiation prevents the proper localization of factors required for chromosome segregation. The proper localization of AIR-2 on bivalents in <italic>zhp-3::gfp</italic> mutants argues against the latter explanation but since it is only one of many factors required to correctly segregate chromosomes, we cannot discount the possibility that other proteins mislocalize on these bivalents. The low penetrance of the chiasma instability phenotype (why don't all the bivalents fall apart?) may be explained by the location of crossovers: crossovers located more internally on the chromosome may have a higher likelihood of maintaining some kind of linkage, albeit an aberrant one, due to additional chromosomal constraints (e.g. topological, cohesin-mediated, etc.) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Chan1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>ZHP-3 may promote SC disassembly and bivalent formation directly or regulate an upstream event that has repercussions for these processes. For example, crossovers at the level of the DNA duplex are thought to be accompanied by exchange at the level of chromosome axes, ensuring axial continuity during chromosome segregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Zickler1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, exchange is thought to be finalized later, perhaps not until pachytene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Kleckner1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. An inability to couple genetic exchange with necessary alterations in chromosome architecture may produce defective bivalents unable to maintain chiasmata or undergo proper chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>What Underlies the Dynamics of ZHP-3 Localization?</title><p>The localization of ZHP-3 changes dramatically during meiotic prophase, first along the length of the synaptonemal complex, then asymmetrically on the SC, eventually concentrating at sites of crossover recombination. This change in localization occurs after the established role of ZHP-3 in promoting crossover recombination events in the early stages of meiotic prophase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Jantsch1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. We have argued above that this shift in localization reflects an additional role for ZHP-3 in late meiotic prophase. However, additional events in this stage of meiosis may also impact ZHP-3 localization.</p><p>The redistribution of ZHP-3 during pachytene coincides with a key transition point in meiotic prophase in which chromosomes crossover intermediates are fully resolved to generate chiasmata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Schwacha1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Schwacha2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> and any remaining DSBs are repaired by an alternate mechanism in which the sister chromatid is available as a template <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Hayashi1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that the presence of ZHP-3 along the SC may be linked to the mode of DSB repair, and specifically to crossover competence. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the change in localization is abrogated at restrictive temperature in a MAP kinase mutant (<italic>mpk-1(ga111ts))</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000235.s002">Figure S2</xref>), which disrupts this switch in the mode of recombinational repair at the end of prophase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Hayashi1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. The delay in ZHP-3 relocalization in mutants with disrupted crossover control further supports a relationship between recombination status and ZHP-3 targeting. However, the asymmetric localization of ZHP-3 on the SC is unlikely to be necessary for this switch, since mutants that fail to make crossovers (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>msh-5(me23)</italic> mutants) are thought to repair DSBs by this alternate pathway, and this apparently occurs without relocalization of ZHP-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000235-g002">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Colaiacovo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, the change in ZHP-3 localization might be a response to other MAP kinase-regulated events. For example, physical assays in budding yeast indicate that the resolution of double Holliday junctions (DHJs) occurs late in pachytene, just prior to SC disassembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Schwacha1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Schwacha2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

The pachytene arrest seen in <italic>mpk-1</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000235-Church1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> makes it difficult to address the role of the MAP kinase pathway in crossover resolution.
