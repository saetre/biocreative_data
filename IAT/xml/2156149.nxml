In humans, mRNA expressed by the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein gene is alternatively spliced resulting in at least nine unique protein isoforms. In this study, we investigated the sub-cellular localisation and membrane trafficking of six isoforms by cloning them into mammalian expression vectors. Confocal microscopy revealed that these protein products are expressed in different cellular compartments. While two full-length isoforms (25.6 and 25.1) are expressed at the cell surface, three alternatively spliced forms (22.7, 21.0 and 20.5) have a more intracellular distribution, localising to the endoplasmic reticulum and/or endosomes. Isoform 16.3, which lacks a transmembrane domain, is secreted. A switch in the sub-cellular localisation of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein may have profound effects on receptor:ligand interactions and consequently the function of the protein. The structural features of the alternative isoforms and their differential, sub-cellular expression patterns could dictate the exposure of major immunogenic determinants within the central nervous system. Our findings highlight myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein splicing as a factor that could be critical to the phenotypic expression of multiple sclerosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>cellular trafficking</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>myelin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common, chronic disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) often triggered in young adults. Pathogenesis is characterised by inflammation, destruction of the myelin sheath and axonal degeneration, resulting in a disabling condition. MS is thought to be an immune mediated disease (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Sospedra and Martin 2005</xref>). T-cell responses to many myelin proteins including myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) are observed in MS patients and are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Despite constituting only &#x0223c;0.05% of the total myelin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Johns and Bernard 1999</xref>), MOG is a highly significant B cell autoantigen in MS, with antibodies against MOG contributing to myelin destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Schluesener <italic>et al.</italic> 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Linington <italic>et al.</italic> 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Litzenburger <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Storch <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>). Therefore, MOG is a unique antigen as it triggers both inflammatory T-cell responses and demyelinating B-cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Iglesias <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>).</p><p>Despite the strong evidence of MOG as an autoantigen, its precise function remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Johns and Bernard 1999</xref>). MOG is known to dimerise, however, its interactions with other cellular proteins are undefined. MOG is generally thought of as a membrane-spanning glycoprotein found on the outermost surface of the myelin sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Brunner <italic>et al.</italic> 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Scolding <italic>et al.</italic> 1989</xref>). It has an unusual protein topology; after the extracellular IgV domain, MOG contains a hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) domain, a cytoplasmic loop, a second hydrophobic membrane associate region, followed by a cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kroepfl <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">della Gaspera <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Composition of investigated myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) transcripts and their products.

The mRNA product of the human MOG gene, but not the mouse or rat analogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Gardinier <italic>et al.</italic> 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Daubas <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>), can undergo significant differential splicing, potentially resulting in 17 protein isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hilton <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Pham-Dinh <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Ballenthin and Gardinier 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Delarasse <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). The MOG splice variants are capable of being translated into functional proteins, hence, it is important to consider the roles that individual isoforms play in the CNS, and in MS. The expression of alternative MOG isoforms could modulate protein interactions, the activity of the major isoform, the sub-cellular localisation of MOG, and consequently myelin maintenance.</p><p>The major splice forms investigated to date are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Alpha 1, the major variant investigated thus far, and beta 1 are full-length isoforms, encoding proteins of 25.1 and 25.6 kDa, respectively. These two isoforms vary only in their C-terminal amino acids encoded by exon 10; the C-terminal amino acids encoded by the 10A exon are RNPF, while those encoded by the 10B exon are LFHLEALSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Splice forms alpha 4 and beta 4 utilise exon 3, an <italic>Alu</italic>-encoded sequence that contains a stop codon. As none of the later exons contribute to the protein produced, these two variants result in the same truncated protein product, MOG 16.3 that lacks a TM domain. This product is predicted to be secreted. The other variants lack exon 8, which is believed to encode a membrane associated region, and use alternative intron/exons boundaries to produce a variety of alternative cytoplasmic tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The resulting protein isoforms are predicted to be 22.7, 22.2, 21.0, 20.5 and 20.2 kDa in size (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl1"

To this end, the different MOG isoforms were cloned into expression vectors and transiently expressed in HeLa cells. After metabolic labelling of MOG transfected HeLa cells, samples were chased for 0&#x02013;240 min, and then the MOG isoforms were immunoprecipitated with the MOG-specific mAb 8.18C5. The samples were subsequently treated with Endo H, an enzyme that does not cleave processed N-linked sugars, a modification indicative of transit to the medial Golgi. This revealed that export of isoform 25.6, 25.1 and 22.7 to the Golgi apparatus was similar, with each protein gaining &#x0223c;50% Endo H resistance in 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2a</xref>). In contrast, isoform 21.0 remained totally Endo H sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2a</xref>), suggesting that the majority of MOG 21.0 protein was retained in the ER. Similar results were obtained with MOG 20.5, with the majority of the protein remaining Endo H sensitive after 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2a</xref>). The three exported forms, 25.6, 25.1 and 22.7 contain a potential membrane-associated region in their cytoplasmic tails, specifically sharing a motif VLGP&#x000d7;V. In contrast, the two isoforms that exhibited slower export, 21.0 and 20.5, lack this region/motif. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic tail encoding the VLGP&#x000d7;V motif is essential for the export of MOG isoforms from the ER.</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Rates of export of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) isoforms.

The pulse/chase analysis suggested that MOG 16.3 was indeed secreted from transfected HeLa cells since the protein disappeared over the chase time to very low levels after 4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2a</xref>). The secretion of MOG 16.3 was confirmed by the detection of GFP tagged MOG 16.3, but not the other isoforms, from culture supernatant of transfected HeLa cells by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2b</xref>). Interestingly, a novel band of &#x0223c;30 kDa was associated with the MOG 16.3 isoform at the 30 min chase period.

MOG 21.0 had a reticular pattern of expression, which co-localised perfectly with the ER marker calreticulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Therefore, MOG 21.0 was mainly retained in the ER with very little cell surface expression. This result fits with the slow rates of export of MOG 21.0 as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2a</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>MOG 22.7 is internalised into the endocytic system</title><p>MOG 22.7 was capable of being expressed at the cell surface showing co-localisation with CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). However, much of the protein was found in distinct vesicles. To characterise the type of vesicle more thoroughly we compared the localisation of MOG 22.7 with a variety of cell markers including those for the ER (calreticulin), <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi (GM130), <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi (TGN-46), endosomes (Vps26), mitochondria (ATP synthase), early endosomes (EEA1) and lysosomes (LAMP2). MOG 22.7 co-localised with markers of the endocytic pathway including EEA1, Vps26 and LAMP2 (data not shown). As MOG 22.7 showed a similar rate of export to the Golgi as the two surface expressed isoforms MOG 25.6 and 25.1, and was expressed at the cell surface, we suspected that MOG 22.7 had been internalised from the cell surface into the endocytic vesicles. To visualise this we incubated MOG transfected cells with 8.18C5 at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 h to detect only surface expressed MOG and to follow its internalisation over the time period. The cells were then fixed and permeabilised, and stained with endocytic markers. Using this method, we clearly detected MOG 22.7 at the cell surface and observed its internalisation into the endocytic system, where it co-localised significantly with the endocytic marker Vps26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4a</xref>). As a control, we examined the internalisation of the surface expressed MOG 25.6, finding very little of this MOG isoform co-localising with Vps26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4a</xref>). Therefore, after export through the Golgi to the cell surface, MOG 22.7 is internalised into the endocytic system.</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and endosomal localisation of specific isoforms.

Thus, although this isoform is mainly expressed in the ER, any MOG 21.0 released to the cell surface was internalised into endosomes. As the two isoforms internalised into endosomes both have the 10B tail these results suggest that an endosomal-targeting motif is present in the 10B tail. However, such a motif is only functional in the absence of exon 8, as isoform 25.6 was not significantly internalised into endosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>MOG 20.5 is predominately expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum</title><p>The MOG 20.5 was found at low levels at the cell surface where it co-localised with CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). However, this isoform was mainly found in large &#x0201c;donut-shaped&#x0201d; structures, which often accumulated around the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>). Initially, we thought that these were vesicles of the endocytic/lysosomal system. However, staining with markers for these compartments revealed only little co-localisation.

The mutant form of PMP-22 is retained in the ER, causing sequestration of another ER chaperone calnexin, and is associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth-related neuropathies. In MOG 20.5 expressing cells, we find that the distribution of the ER chaperone calreticulin was altered. These structures may be caused by misfolding of MOG 20.5 and the sequestration of calreticulin. Some of the MOG 21.0 that we initially found in a reticular pattern in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>) could also be observed in these &#x0201c;donut-shaped&#x0201d; structures in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Similar subcellular localisations are observed in the oligodendrocyte cell line MO3.13</title><p>To determine if the striking differences in trafficking, that we observed in HeLa cells, were also found in oligodendrocytes, we transfected the various MOG constructs into MO3.13 cells, an immature oligodendrocyte cell line that does not endogenously express MOG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">McLaurin <italic>et al.</italic> 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Buntinx <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>).

These myelin protein genes clearly have additional functions in a number of different cell types that are unrelated to myelination.

In this study, we have shown that variation in the cytoplasmic tail of MOG significantly affects the rate of export and the site of expression of MOG proteins (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> for summary of cellular distribution). Efficient anterograde trafficking of membrane-bound forms of MOG to the cell surface appears to be dependent on having a VLGP&#x000d7;V motif, encoded by exon 7 and 8 and found in MOG 25.6, 25.1 and 22.7. Internalisation of MOG into the endocytic system appears to be promoted by the 10B tail, encoding amino acids LFHLEALSG, in the absence of exon 8, as observed for 21.0 and 22.7. Such intrinsic alternative splicing machinery may operate to regulate the surface expression of MOG. In addition we have shown that MOG 16.3 can be secreted when expressed in HeLa cells. As this may have important implications for the pathogenesis of MS, the confirmation of secreted isoforms of MOG in humans, such as by immunoprecipitation of MOG from cerebrospinal fluid, is required.</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Summary of MOG isoform localisation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Isoform</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cellular localisation</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glycosylation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Surface</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Endo H resistant</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Surface</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Endo H resistant</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mainly ER.

Many of the proposed functions of MOG have been based on its surface localisation on oligodendrocytes. However, secreted MOG released into the cerebrospinal fluid could allow alternative interactions at distant sites. Expression of MOG in the ER and endocytic system also expands the potential functions and interactions of MOG. In addition to a role in cellular transport, cytoplasmic tail residues are important in signalling. Ligation of surface expressed MOG induces signalling cascades resulting in the induction of survival signals, changes in cytosketal integrity or the activation of stress-related pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Marta <italic>et al.</italic> 2005b</xref>). However, there is potential for secreted MOG to mask such MOG-induced responses. In addition, ligation of MOG with alternative cytoplasmic tails could have profound effects on these events and may trigger alternative responses. With the recent identification of another 11 MOG transcripts, alternative sites of expression, function and signalling events of MOG products unquestionably arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Delarasse <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>).</p><p>MOG is an important antigen in MS pathogenesis, activating both T and B lymphocyte responses.

B cell responses to MOG are considered key to the demyelination of oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Iglesias <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). Secreted forms of MOG could interact with these demyelinating antibodies and complement, potentially inhibiting their pathogenic effect on oligodendrocytes. The death of oligodendrocytes, proposed to be the first trigger in relapsing and remitting MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Barnett and Prineas 2004</xref>), could expose novel MOG epitopes from the cytoplasmic tail or may reveal alternatively glycosylated forms of MOG, which could be recognised by pathogenic antibodies to the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Marta <italic>et al.</italic> 2005a</xref>).
