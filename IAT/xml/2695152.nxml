Here we demonstrate that MOPr desensitization can be observed in single rat brainstem locus coeruleus (LC) neurons following either prolonged (&#x0003e; 4 h) exposure to morphine <italic>in vitro</italic> or following treatment of animals with morphine <italic>in vivo</italic> for 3 days. Analysis of receptor function by an operational model indicated that with either treatment morphine could induce a profound degree (70&#x02013;80%) of loss of receptor function. Ongoing PKC activity in the MOPr-expressing neurons themselves, primarily by PKC&#x003b1;, was required to maintain morphine-induced MOPr desensitization, because exposure to PKC inhibitors for only the last 30&#x02013;50 min of exposure to morphine reduced the MOPr desensitization that was induced both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The presence of morphine was also required for maintenance of desensitization, as washout of morphine for &#x0003e; 2 h reversed MOPr desensitization. MOPr desensitization was homologous, as there was no change in &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor or ORL1 receptor function. These results demonstrate that prolonged morphine treatment induces extensive homologous desensitization of MOPrs in mature neurons, that this desensitization has a significant PKC-dependent component and that this desensitization underlies the maintenance of morphine tolerance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>desensitization</kwd><kwd>morphine</kwd><kwd>opiates</kwd><kwd>tolerance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The analgesic, respiratory depressant and rewarding effects of morphine occur through activation of &#x003bc;-opioid receptors (MOPrs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Matthes <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Romberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).

For many G-protein-coupled receptors prolonged exposure to an agonist results in rapid receptor desensitization through a variety of mechanisms that may involve specific kinases (GRKs) or second messenger kinases, such as protein kinase C (PKC) and A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kelly <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Initial studies suggested that morphine does not induce MOPr desensitization in mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Alvarez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), leading to the suggestion that receptor desensitization was not involved in morphine tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Finn &#x00026; Whistler, 2001</xref>). More recently, however, morphine-induced MOPr desensitization has been observed in mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bailey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dang &#x00026; Williams, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virk &#x00026; Williams, 2008</xref>), although the extent of the desensitization is less than that observed with other opioids.</p><p>Our work studying acute MOPr desensitization of recombinant MOPrs and endogenous MOPrs in mature brain neurons has revealed a PKC-dependent component of morphine-induced MOPr desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bailey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), whereas for the opioid peptide, DAMGO, desensitization was almost entirely through a GRK-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). There is also evidence to suggest that <italic>in vivo</italic> different opioids induce tolerance by different mechanisms. In GRK3 knockout mice the antinociceptive tolerance that develops to fentanyl was markedly reduced, but that which develops to morphine was not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Terman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). A number of studies have reported that PKC is involved in morphine-induced tolerance <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Inoue &#x00026; Ueda, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Zeitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Bohn <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Hua <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">2007</xref>). However, such <italic>in vivo</italic> studies do not delineate where in the sequence of intracellular events PKC acts to induce such tolerance.</p><p>In this study we have determined the role PKC-induced MOPr desensitization plays in the tolerance to morphine that develops in mature neurons on prolonged exposure to the drug <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. To do this we have developed a protocol with which the level of MOPr desensitization can be determined in adult mammalian neurons in the continued presence of the drug. This approach has allowed us to study the time-course of development of MOPr desensitization at the single cell level in brain slices exposed to morphine <italic>in vitro</italic>, and to compare the MOPr desensitization observed <italic>in vitro</italic> with that observed in brain slices prepared from animals chronically treated with morphine (i.e. <italic>ex vivo</italic>). We found that with both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> morphine pre-treatment the major component of MOPr desensitization requires ongoing PKC activity to be maintained, whereas incubation of slices with DAMGO induced MOPr desensitization that was not PKC dependent. Analysis of the data using an operational model of drug agonism has allowed us to assess and compare the actual loss of MOPr function that underlies the tolerance that developed to both agonists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><sec><title>Brain slice preparation</title><p>Male Wistar rats (130&#x02013;170 g) were killed by cervical dislocation, and horizontal brain slices (200&#x02013;250 &#x003bc;m thick) containing the locus coeruleus (LC) were prepared as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bailey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).

To do this we made use of the fact that morphine is a partial agonist at MOPrs in LC neurons having a lower maximum response than other opioids such as Met-Enkephalin and DAMGO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A and B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Alvarez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bailey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). A basic tenet of receptor theory is that for a partial agonist the maximum response is produced only when all of the available receptors are occupied, and therefore any loss of MOPr function as would occur if receptors were desensitized would result in a decrease in the maximum response to the partial agonist. Therefore, any deficit in receptor function caused by drug treatments would be seen as a decrease in the maximum response to morphine (measured by applying a receptor-saturating concentration, 30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>, of morphine).</p><p>In preliminary experiments on drug-na&#x000ef;ve slices we demonstrated that a receptor-saturating concentration of morphine (30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) evoked a K<sup>+</sup> current that was 94 &#x000b1; 13% of the maximum response evoked by NA in the same neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). In all our experiments the opioid responses have been normalized to the maximum NA response (NA; 100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) mediated through &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors in the same neuron to control for variations in current amplitudes between neurons. MOPrs and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors couple to the same set of GIRK channels in LC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">North &#x00026; Williams, 1985</xref>). Following washout of the morphine for 3 min, application of a receptor-saturating concentration of the full agonist, DAMGO (10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>), evoked a response of 149 &#x000b1; 15% of the maximum response to NA. These values for the maximum responses evoked by morphine and DAMGO administered sequentially to the same neurons are not different from those in slices where neurons were exposed to only one of the opioids. This demonstrates that it is possible in the same neuron to obtain maximum response amplitudes for morphine and DAMGO.</p></sec><sec><title>MOPr desensitization following prolonged exposure to morphine in vitro</title><p>Slices containing the LC were incubated for 6&#x02013;9 h in 1 or 30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine or control aCSF, and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed under the same conditions.

Morphine (30 &#x003bc;<sc>m)</sc> was chosen as it is a receptor-saturating concentration of morphine.

Morphine (30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) and DAMGO (10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) were then applied sequentially to obtain the maximum responses to each drug, and naloxone (1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) applied to return the holding current to the true baseline level from which opioid-evoked current amplitudes could be measured. Pooled data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1E</xref>) show that 6&#x02013;9 h pre-incubation in 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine alone caused no statistically significant decrease in the maximum response to morphine, compared with data from slices incubated in control aCSF for 6&#x02013;9 h. In contrast, when LC slices were incubated with 30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine for periods up to 6&#x02013;9 h there was a gradual decrease in the maximum response to morphine over time that first became statistically significant at the 4&#x02013;6 h time-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1E</xref>); after 6&#x02013;9 h pre-incubation the maximum response to morphine had decreased by 63 &#x000b1; 7%. Note, unlike rapid MOPr desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bailey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), that produced by prolonged exposure to 30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine was observed without the need to activate PKC with oxotremorine-M (oxo-M) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). To ensure that the desensitization induced by the prolonged exposure to 30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine had not in some non-specific way interfered with G-protein coupling or potassium channel function, we also measured the amplitude of the maximum NA-evoked current. There was no change in the amplitude of the maximum NA-evoked current following exposure of LC slices to either 1 or 30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine for up to 9 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1F</xref> and Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1, A</xref>). It is concluded therefore that exposure of LC neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> to 30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> but not 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine, alone for 6&#x02013;9 h, induces significant homologous MOPr desensitization.</p><p>Because 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine alone did not induce MOPr desensitization, we next examined the effect of PKC activation on the development of MOPr desensitization during prolonged exposure to 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine. Slices were incubated for 6&#x02013;9 h with morphine (1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) as well as oxo-M (10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) to activate PKC. In control experiments 6&#x02013;9 h incubation with oxo-M alone had no effect on the maximum response to morphine, whereas following exposure to morphine plus oxo-M the maximum response to morphine was decreased to 46 &#x000b1; 8% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). The effect of oxo-M could be mimicked by activating PKC with the phorbol ester, PMA. When slices were incubated with both morphine (1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) and PMA (1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>), the maximum response to morphine was reduced by 52 &#x000b1; 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>). Like oxo-M, PMA alone (6&#x02013;9 h) had no effect. Thus, MOPr desensitization can be induced by prolonged exposure to 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine <italic>in vitro</italic>, but only when the PKC activity in LC neurons is enhanced above the basal level in isolated neurons. The decrease in responsiveness was selective to the MOPr, as the NA responses were unaffected by any pre-treatment (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1, C</xref>). In acute exposure (7 min) experiments, 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine did not induce MOPr desensitization in the absence or presence of PKC activation by PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>), indicating that, even when PKC is activated, 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine causes MOPr desensitization only after prolonged exposure to the drug.</p><p>Whilst prolonged exposure to morphine 30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> alone, or morphine 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>+ oxo-M or PMA, reduced the maximum response to morphine and thus revealed a loss of functional MOPrs, only 30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine pre-treatment resulted in a decrease in the maximum response to the full agonist DAMGO (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1, B and D</xref>). As a high-efficacy agonist, DAMGO has a significant spare receptor reserve in LC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Osborne &#x00026; Williams, 1995</xref>), such that, in comparison to the partial agonist morphine, a greater amount of MOPr desensitization is required to produce a decrease in the maximum DAMGO response.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of PKC in maintaining MOPr desensitization during prolonged <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure to morphine</title><p>To examine whether ongoing PKC activity was required to maintain MOPr desensitization, we investigated whether PKC inhibitors could reverse morphine-induced MOPr desensitization after desensitization had already been induced.

The loss of MOPr function induced by acute morphine was less, even in the presence of PKC activation. Thus, a 7-min exposure to morphine (1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) in the absence or presence of PMA induced no loss of MOPr function (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>), whereas over the same time period 30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine in the presence of PMA reduced MOPr function by 53%.</p><p>.</p><p>Treatment for 6&#x02013;9 h with 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine alone caused no significant decrease in MOPr function; however, when neurons were incubated with 1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine and either oxo-M (10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) or PMA (1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>), receptor function was decreased by 70% and 74%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5G</xref>). Prolonged <italic>in vitro</italic> exposure to 30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine alone did cause profound loss of MOPr function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5F</xref>), but this occurred more slowly than with DAMGO. Following 6&#x02013;9 h treatment with 30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> morphine, there was an 82% loss of MOPr function, which compares to that induced by acute (10 min) DAMGO. In neurons from animals pre-treated with morphine, MOPr receptor function was decreased by 71%, which is the same as that observed with <italic>in vitro</italic> morphine plus PMA or oxo-M treatment.</p><p>It appears therefore that exposure to DAMGO induces MOPr desensitization that is both rapid in onset and extensive, whereas morphine-induced MOPr desensitization develops more slowly, requires ongoing PKC activation, but both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> morphine treatment can induce a similar level of loss of receptor function.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>A central finding of this study is that prolonged exposure of mature neurons to morphine causes profound MOPr desensitization. It had been suggested that morphine produces tolerance because it does not induce rapid MOPr desensitization and that morphine tolerance occurs following subsequent, as yet unknown, adaptive changes caused by prolonged MOPr signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Finn &#x00026; Whistler, 2001</xref>). Our data would refute that hypothesis. Morphine does induce homologous MOPr desensitization, following prolonged <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> morphine treatment. This finding re-confirms the view that MOPr desensitization contributes to morphine tolerance.</p><p>To circumvent problems in the interpretation of opioid agonist-induced desensitization data (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Connor <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), we specifically designed our experiments so that we could investigate agonist coupling and desensitization immediately following long-term <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> morphine treatments, in the absence of complications due to drug withdrawal. Indeed, after 2&#x02013;4 h morphine withdrawal <italic>in vitro</italic>, MOPr desensitization was reversed. This suggests that the MOPr desensitization we observed was somewhat transient, in contrast with that seen by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Christie <italic>et al.</italic> (1987)</xref> where MOPr desensitization was still seen in rat LC neurons up to 6 h after morphine withdrawal <italic>in vitro</italic>. In that study the chronic morphine treatment used higher doses than in this study (&#x0003e; 2700 mg/kg morphine pellets over 7 days vs 200 mg/kg emulsion over 3 days), and possibly in their experiments the level of chronic treatment induced additional adaptive mechanisms, such as enhanced GRK and arrestin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Terwilliger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>) or receptor downregulation that may result in longer-lasting MOPr desensitization.</p><p>Further, there have been recent studies in LC and periaqueductal grey neurons demonstrating that, following <italic>in vitro</italic> withdrawal from chronic morphine treatment, MOPrs exhibit enhanced agonist-induced desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dang &#x00026; Williams, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Ingram <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). These studies suggest the possibility that morphine withdrawal and/or higher levels of morphine tolerance may induce additional adaptive mechanisms, such as effects on GRKs or RGS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Terwilliger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gold <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Our data with PKC inhibitors reversing morphine-induced desensitization appear somewhat at odds with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dang &#x00026; Williams, 2005</xref>. In their paper, using sharp electrode recording, they observed that a relatively high concentration of chelerythrine enhanced the desensitization induced by morphine-6-glucuronide. We have shown in this paper and previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bailey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>) that a range of structurally different PKC inhibitors reverse morphine-induced desensitization.</p><p>To obtain a quantitative measure of functional MOPr loss, we subjected the data to operational analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Black <italic>et al.</italic>, 1985</xref>) to obtain a quantitative measure of functional MOPr loss. This revealed that prolonged exposure to morphine both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> resulted in up to an 82% loss in MOPr function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Christie <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>). Although the desensitization induced by morphine was slightly less than that induced by DAMGO and developed over a longer time period, it is evident that prolonged morphine exposure can induce robust loss of MOPr function in adult mammalian neurons. Importantly, MOPr desensitization occurs at the level of the MOPr and not downstream of the receptor, as the NA-induced K<sup>+</sup>-current in the same neurons was unaffected. &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-Adrenoceptors and MOPrs couple to the same set of K<sup>+</sup> channels in LC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">North &#x00026; Williams, 1985</xref>).</p><p>Inhibitors of PKC significantly reversed MOPr desensitization even after the desensitization had been allowed to develop (over 3 days of morphine treatment <italic>in vivo</italic> and 6&#x02013;9 h morphine treatment <italic>in vitro</italic>). This shows that for morphine desensitization to persist, ongoing PKC activity is required. Crucially, this finding is paralleled in previous studies of morphine analgesia tolerance <italic>in vivo</italic> where PKC inhibitors were able to reverse tolerance even when they were first administered after 3 days of morphine exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> morphine analgesia tolerance can be potentiated by a PP2A phosphatase inhibitor, indicating that the level of tolerance is dependent upon the balance between ongoing MOPr phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gabra <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>PKC exists as multiple isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Way <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), many of which are expressed in CNS neurons. In LC neurons a single conventional PKC isoform, PKC&#x003b1;, appears to be responsible for the PKC component of morphine-induced MOPr desensitization. However, PKC&#x003b1; is not the only isoform that may be involved in morphine-induced MOPr desensitization, and it is entirely possible that in different neuronal populations other isoforms of PKC may be involved. Indeed, <italic>in vivo</italic>, there is evidence from analgesia studies that morphine tolerance may involve not only PKC&#x003b1; but also PKC&#x003b5; and PKC&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Zeitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Hua <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Newton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Smith <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In LC neurons DAMGO induces rapid (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>=150 s) MOPr desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Harris &#x00026; Williams, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bailey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). We have reported that in HEK-293 cells rapid DAMGO-induced MOPr desensitization is GRK-mediated because it is blocked by overexpression of a GRK2 dominant negative mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In the present experiments we sought to determine whether, on prolonged exposure to DAMGO, a PKC component of MOPr desensitization was revealed. This does not appear to be the case because treatment with a PKC inhibitor that blocked morphine-induced MOPr desensitization failed to alter the DAMGO-induced desensitization following 6&#x02013;9 h pre-treatment with DAMGO. Furthermore, it might have been expected that DAMGO would induce less MOPr desensitization than morphine given that DAMGO induces not only MOPr desensitization but also MOPr internalization that would result in MOPr resensitization by dephosphorylation and then re-insertion of reactivated receptors into the plasma membrane, whereas morphine induces much less MOPr internalization. However, we found that a receptor-saturating concentration of DAMGO induced an almost complete loss of MOPr function.</p><p>In LC neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> under conditions of low PKC activity, a component of morphine-induced rapid MOPr desensitization persists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bailey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dang &#x00026; Williams, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virk &#x00026; Williams, 2008</xref>). This could be because there is, in addition to PKC-mediated desensitization, a component of morphine desensitization that is GRK-mediated. This might also explain why, in our <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments where neurons had been exposed to morphine for 3 days, the PKC inhibitor did not completely reverse MOPr desensitization, and why a small, but significant amount of receptor internalization was induced by morphine in HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Haberstock-Debic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The present results, together with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bailey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), reveal that there are four main factors that determine the development of MOPr desensitization: the nature of the agonist ligand; the degree of receptor occupancy; the duration of morphine treatment; and the level of PKC activation. LC neurons in the slice preparation can be considered to be in a &#x02018;basal state&#x02019;, where PKC activity is lower than in the same neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>, as <italic>in vivo</italic> ongoing synaptic activity will activate Gq-coupled metabotropic receptors and Ca<sup>2 +</sup>-permeable ionotropic receptors that would elevate PKC activity. Prolonged exposure to a sub-maximal, therapeutically relevant concentration of morphine (1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) induced MOPr desensitization <italic>in vitro</italic> only when PKC activity was elevated. In contrast, when slices were prepared from morphine-pre-treated rats and maintained in this concentration of morphine, profound MOPr desensitization was observed that could be reversed by inhibiting PKC. Comparable levels of MOPr desensitization in the brain have been reported using agonist-induced [<sup>35</sup>S]GTP&#x003b3;S autoradiography following chronic morphine administration to rats, although the molecular mechanism of desensitization was not identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Sim <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>).</p><p>There is now also good evidence to indicate that endogenous levels of PKC play a major role in morphine tolerance <italic>in vivo</italic>.
