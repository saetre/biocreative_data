The ds-cDNA11S was inserted and cloned into the Pst I site of pBR-322 using E. coli RR1 as host. Colony filter hybridization and restriction mapping was used to demonstrate that a 620 NTP long insert in a plasmid clone (pSV2) represents the almost full length structural gene coding for a precursor to the seminal vesicle secretion protein IV (SVS IV). The entire insert was sequenced and the coding region was matched with the known amino acid sequence. Most of the signal peptide sequence was derived from the DNA sequence. The insert in pSV2 was labelled and used to study the effect of testosterone on the accumulation of mRNA SVS IV. Administration of testosterone to castrated rats resulted in the induction of mRNA SVS IV from a few molecules per cell to levels of over 100,000 after 96 h of hormone treatment.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0192-a" xlink:role="939"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0193-a" xlink:role="940"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0188.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="935"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0189.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="936"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0190.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="937"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0191.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="938"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="939"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="940"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="941"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="942"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0196.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="943"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0197.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="944"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0198.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="945"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00397-0199.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="946"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
