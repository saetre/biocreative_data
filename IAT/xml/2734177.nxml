Unlike for enzymatically induced site-specific DSBs, little is known about processing of random &#x0201c;dirty-ended&#x0201d; DSBs created by DNA damaging agents such as ionizing radiation. Here we present a novel system for monitoring early events in the repair of random DSBs, based on our finding that single-strand tails generated by resection at the ends of large molecules in budding yeast decreases mobility during pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We utilized this &#x0201c;PFGE-shift&#x0201d; to follow the fate of both ends of linear molecules generated by a single random DSB in circular chromosomes. Within 10 min after &#x003b3;-irradiation of G2/M arrested WT cells, there is a near-synchronous PFGE-shift of the linearized circular molecules, corresponding to resection of a few hundred bases. Resection at the radiation-induced DSBs continues so that by the time of significant repair of DSBs at 1 hr there is about 1&#x02013;2 kb resection per DSB end. The PFGE-shift is comparable in WT and recombination-defective <italic>rad52</italic> and <italic>rad51</italic> strains but somewhat delayed in <italic>exo1</italic> mutants. However, in <italic>rad50</italic> and <italic>mre11</italic> null mutants the initiation and generation of resected ends at radiation-induced DSB ends is greatly reduced in G2/M. Thus, the Rad50/Mre11/Xrs2 complex is responsible for rapid processing of most damaged ends into substrates that subsequently undergo recombinational repair. A similar requirement was found for <italic>RAD50</italic> in asynchronously growing cells. Among the few molecules exhibiting shift in the <italic>rad50</italic> mutant, the residual resection is consistent with resection at only one of the DSB ends. Surprisingly, within 1 hr after irradiation, double-length linear molecules are detected in the WT and <italic>rad50</italic>, but not in <italic>rad52</italic>, strains that are likely due to crossovers that are largely resection- and <italic>RAD50-</italic>independent.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in chromosomal DNA are common sources of genomic change that may be beneficial or deleterious to an organism, from yeast to humans. While they can arise through programmed cellular events, DSBs are frequently associated with defective chromosomal replication, and they are induced by various types of DNA damaging agents such as those employed in cancer therapy, especially ionizing radiation. Elaborate systems have evolved for DSB recognition and subsequent repair, either by homologous recombination or by direct joining of ends. Although much is known about repair mechanisms associated with defined, artificially produced DSBs, there is a relative dearth of information about events surrounding random DSBs. Using a novel, yeast-based system that is applicable to other organisms, we have addressed resection at DSBs, considered a first step in repair. We provide the first direct evidence that cells possess a highly efficient system for recognition and initiation of resection at &#x003b3;-radiation&#x02013;induced dirty ends and that the resection is largely dependent on the Rad50/Mre11/Xrs2 complex, identified by the <italic>RAD50</italic> gene. The system provides unique opportunities to address other components in resection and repair as well as to identify the contribution of random DSBs and resection to genome instability resulting from other DNA damaging agents.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in chromosomal DNA are common sources of genetic change that may be deleterious or beneficial to an organism. They can arise as direct and processed lesions, errors during replication such as fork collapse, unprotected telomere ends, and they can be integral to programmed developmental processes including meiosis and immunoglobulin rearrangements. The two well-established repair mechanisms, recombination and endjoining, can be distinguished on the basis of requirements for homology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Shrivastav1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> where the former involves homologous interactions between sister chromatids or homologous chromosomes.

Based initially on early studies in yeast, there is an elaborate system for recombinational repair of IR-induced breaks whose components extend to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Sonoda1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Resnick1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. For the case of radiation, the ends can be considered as &#x0201c;dirty&#x0201d; in that there is often associated base damage, while in model systems that produce a DSB by an endogenous nuclease (such as HO-endonuclease in yeast), the breaks are &#x0201c;clean&#x0201d; and can even undergo ligation via end-joining processes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Daley1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>). Based on a combination of genetics, biochemistry, and repair studies using defined DSBs the early steps in recombinational repair can be broken down into resection of DSBs, binding by single-strand binding proteins, replacement by Rad51 type recombinase proteins, strand invasion and DNA synthesis or an alternative Rad51 independent/Rad52 dependent strand annealing process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Krogh1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>For the case of random, multiply induced lesions, as for IR or DSB-inducing chemicals, the presence of breaks is typically signaled by the appearance of H2AX chromatin modification in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Rogakou1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Stucki1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> as well as the development of foci associated with various steps in repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Lisby1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

There is an approximate random production of DSBs with an efficiency of 0.083 DSBs/mb/krad, which corresponds to &#x0223c;2.0 DSBs/per haploid G2 cell per krad. This estimate is based on changes in amounts of unbroken chromosomes of different sizes over the range of 10 to 40 krad (this DSB determination is referred to as &#x0201c;Stained gel, multiple band method&#x0201d; in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; see example in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000656.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). A comparable value of 0.053 DSBs/mb/krad over a 10 to 60 krad range was obtained using our recently developed system for measuring break efficiency in a circular Chr III as compared to a linear Chr II, both of which contain a common <italic>LEU2</italic> sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Ma1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000656.s001">Figure S1B</xref>).

Similar observations (data not shown) were made with chromosomes I (230 kb), II (813 kb), III (340 kb), V (576) and VIII (565 kb).

Presented are results following the 37&#x000b0;C incubation, a condition that results in 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; resection at telomeres (see text). Samples were collected at the indicated times and prepared for PFGE (TAFE). By 3 hrs, when 97% of cells in the 37&#x000b0;C culture were arrested in G2, novel bands appear in lanes from the 37&#x000b0;C time course at positions corresponding to molecular weights of approximately 25 to 40 kb above many of the known chromosomal bands (left image). The specific chromosomal shifts were confirmed by Southerns using the Chr I specific <italic>FLO1</italic> probe (right image) and other probes specific for chromosomes II, III, V, and VIII (data not shown). These PFGE-shifts were not detected by either stained gels or Southerns for cells incubated at the permissive 23&#x000b0;C temperature (data not shown). (B) PFGE-shift associated with HO-induced DSB. Resection at a unique HO-endonuclease&#x02013;induced site-specific DSB in Chr III leads to PFGE-shift in broken chromosome fragments. Following growth of WT cells in YEP-lactate media and G2/M arrest in nocodazole for 3 hrs, galactose was added (2% final concentration) to induce HO-endonuclease, resulting in a DSB at <italic>MAT</italic>a (strain AM919). Chromosomes were separated by PFGE. &#x0005b;Because of differences in PFGE-CHEF running conditions for the HO-induced break system, the &#x0201c;apparent&#x0201d; MW shift is different than would be observed for the conditions used in the other PFGE experiments that are described in this paper.&#x0005d; A Southern transfer of the CHEF gel was hybridized with an <italic>ADE1</italic> probe that identifies Chr III and also cross-hybridizes at its native position in Chr I (which also serves as internal standard) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-VanHulle1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

Circular Chr III from unirradiated cells (&#x0201c;no &#x003b3;&#x0201d;) remained trapped in the plug. Chr III molecules with only one DSB migrate at a position corresponding to 300 kb (&#x0201c;0&#x0201d; hr lane). Less than 10 min after returning cells to YPDA, most of the molecules in the band shifted to an apparent molecular weight that is greater than 300 kb. By 2 hrs the band reached a position of maximum shift corresponding to an apparent MW of approximately &#x0201c;430&#x0201d; kb. Smearing under the linear Chr III band is due to multiple DSBs in Chr III. (B) The PFGE-shift is due to resection based on digestion by mung bean nuclease. PFGE plugs from an experiment involving 80 krad to <italic>rad52</italic>&#x00394; cells and postirradiation incubation (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) were run on a CHEF gel under conditions to maximize resolution of the linearized 300 kb Chr III (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The probe used for this Southern labels the lambda DNA ladder as well as the <italic>LEU2</italic> sequence on Chr III. As seen in the left group of lanes, there is a PFGE-shift of Chr III linearized with a single random DSB within 30 min postirradiation incubation. Duplicates of these plugs were treated with mung bean nuclease to remove 3&#x02032; single-strand tails. As shown in the group of lanes on the right, the nuclease treatment resulted in molecules from the &#x02265;0.5 hrs incubation exhibiting faster PFGE mobility. By 6 hrs, the average size of the <italic>trimmed</italic> linearized Chr III was reduced by &#x0223c;15&#x02013;20 kb, corresponding to an average resection rate of &#x0223c;1.5 kb per DSB end per hr. (C) Rapid PFGE-shift and appearance of novel bands in WT cells. WT cells were arrested at G2/M by nocodazole, irradiated with 80 krads and returned to YPDA media. Plugs were prepared at the indicated times and run on PFGE (TAFE; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The probe used for this Southern corresponded to the <italic>LEU2</italic> sequence on chromosome III, which is circular at the beginning of experiment, but becomes linear following radiation-induced breakage (similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition to the non-resected (M) and resected (M&#x0002a;&#x0002a;) bands seen in <italic>rad52</italic>, two additional bands referred to as D and D&#x0002a;&#x0002a; appear within 30 min after irradiation. The D band corresponds to an MW that is twice that of the non-shifted linear monomer. Since the appearance of D and D&#x0002a;&#x0002a; are <italic>RAD52</italic>-dependent, these are considered to be recombinant molecules (discussed in text). Band D&#x0002a;&#x0002a; is proposed to be a linear dimer with both ends resected. &#x0005b;The &#x0201c;no <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>&#x0201d; lane is from a different part of the same gel. The DNA in the well of the last lane did not transfer well. The &#x0201c;&#x0223c;0.2 hr&#x0201d; time point is not precise because EDTA was not added although cells were put on ice. The amount of linear ChrIII detected in the &#x0201c;no <italic>&#x003b3;</italic>&#x0201d; lane is &#x0003c;3% of that in the well.&#x0005d; (D) Resection in WT cells is the source of the PFGE-shift in ChrIII containing a random &#x003b3;-induced single DSB.

The faint smear extending above the linear non-resected M band, detectable by &#x0223c;1 hr indicates limited resection and/or resection possibly of only one end of these molecules as discussed in the text. (B) The limited PFGE-shift in <italic>rad50&#x00394;</italic> after 80 krad differs from <italic>rad51&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic>. The smear of broken Chr III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) was characterized by PFGE (CHEF; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Comparisons were made with the PFGE shift found with the <italic>rad51&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic> mutants. (The stained gel is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g002">Figure 2A</xref>.) For <italic>rad50&#x00394;</italic> (center lanes) no band is observed corresponding to the typical M&#x0002a;&#x0002a; band seen with <italic>rad51&#x00394;</italic> (left) or <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic> (right) mutants. Instead, there is a slow accumulation of a faint band (M&#x0002a;) with a PFGE-shift corresponding to &#x0223c;40 kb increase in apparent molecular weight. (C) The effect of mung bean nuclease treatment on the mobility of broken Chr III. PFGE plugs from an experiment involving 80 krad to <italic>rad50&#x00394;</italic> and postirradiation incubation (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) were run on a CHEF gel under conditions that maximize resolution of the linearized 300 kb Chr III (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). A slight smear is observed above the linearized monomer band in the no MBN lanes (<italic>i.e.</italic>, at 2 and 3 hrs after 80 krads). Mung bean nuclease (+MBN lanes) removes the smear and yields tighter &#x0223c;300 kb bands, indicating that the smear is due to resection. However, unlike for <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), the products of the MBN treatment did not run at a detectably faster rate than the unresected monomer in the 0 hour lane, indicating that little resection had occurred. The &#x0201c;&#x003bb;&#x0201d; lanes correspond to 48.5 kb lambda DNA ladder.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000656.g005"/></fig><p>To establish that the PFGE-shift of the &#x003b3;&#x02212;linearized molecules was actually due to resection, the plugs of <italic>rad52</italic> chromosomal DNA used for PFGE were treated with mung bean nuclease (MBN) to digest single strand tails (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, treatment of chromosomal DNAs from cells that had been incubated after irradiation resulted in reduction in the apparent MW whereas MBN did not change the mobility of &#x003b3;&#x02212;linearized molecules at time &#x0201c;0,&#x0201d; consistent with MBN acting only on ssDNA. (The small amount of linear Chr III DNA from the unirradiated cells is somewhat increased by MBN, possibly indicating that some circular molecules in the plugs have single strand regions; the PFGE-CHEF conditions used in these experiments were modified to expand opportunities to see chromosomal changes.) With increased postirradiation incubation, the size of the molecules after MBN was decreased. Based on the average size of molecules after MBN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, right side), resection proceeds at a rate of &#x0223c;1.5 to 2 kb/hour from each end (assuming equal rates from each end). For example, the size of the MBN treated molecules at 6 hrs is &#x0223c;280 kb (versus &#x0223c;300 kb at the beginning), corresponding to 10 kb resection/DSB end/6 hours.</p><p>Using these PFGE conditions, the retardation in mobility of the resected, &#x003b3;&#x02212;linearized chromosomes appears to plateau at &#x0223c;1 hr (compare 1 and 6 hr in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g004">Figure 4B</xref> left side). The PFGE-shift of radiation broken molecules observed at early times (10&#x02013;15 min) corresponds to at most hundreds of bases (not detectable as a change in linear size after MBN treatment). A plateau for mobility shift was also found for resection at HO-induced DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) where resection occurs at only one end of each broken chromosome III fragment.</p><p>Thus, PFGE-shift provides a robust assay for detecting early events in resection at IR-induced random DSBs in <italic>rad52</italic> and <italic>rad51</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In addition it provides an estimate of the proportion of molecules resected.

However, unlike for the <italic>rad52</italic> mutant, within the next hour the amount of unit-sized linear DNA is reduced, consistent with repair in WT cells. As expected, the MBN treatment of the shifted DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) led to a reduction in size demonstrating that the apparent increased molecular weight in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g004">Figure 4C</xref> was due to resected ends. The small reduction in size after MBN treatment is consistent with the &#x0223c;1.5 to 2 kb per hour resection rate observed for <italic>rad52</italic> over 6 hours.

Treatment of the plugs from the <italic>rad50&#x00394;</italic> mutant with MBN decreases the slight smear of the linear Chr III band, indicating that the shifted material is due to resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Based on the persistence of a large portion of unshifted and, therefore, unresected 300 kb molecules from the <italic>rad50&#x00394;</italic> cells, the MRX complex is concluded to be essential for the rapid initiation of resection of radiation induced DSBs in WT, <italic>rad52</italic> and <italic>-51</italic> G2/M arrested cells (also growing cells; data not shown).</p><fig id="pgen-1000656-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000656.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>The PFGE-shift associated with a random &#x003b3;-induced single DSB after low doses or HO-endonuclease produced DSBs.</title><p>(A) PFGE-shift associated with a single radiation-induced DSB in circular Chr V in WT but not <italic>rad50&#x00394;</italic> cells.

At lower doses where there are fewer DSB ends, the resection may also occur at the other broken end, eventually giving rise to the fully shifted molecules.

Within 30 minutes after 80 krad to WT, <italic>rad52</italic> and <italic>rad51</italic> strains, most linearized molecules are detected in a well-defined &#x0223c;430 kb PFGE-shift band. This contrasts with the <italic>rad50&#x00394;</italic> mutant where the relatively few molecules that are resected after 80 krad exhibit limited PFGE shift (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g004">Figures 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g005">5A, and 5B</xref>). For lower doses (20 and 30 krad, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g006">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000656-g007">Figure 7</xref>) to the <italic>rad50&#x00394;</italic> mutant there is a similar pattern within the first two hours after radiation. However, by four hours, a much slower moving &#x0223c;430 kb PFGE-shift band is also observed which is comparable to that found in the WT and <italic>rad50&#x00394;</italic> cells. We propose, based on the dramatic difference in PFGE for one-end vs two-end resected &#x003bb; DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000656.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), that the initial slow-moving band may be due to one-end resection, possibly by Exo1. The even slower-moving band appearing at later times which is comparable to that seen with <italic>rad52</italic> and WT cells would be due to the opportunity for resection at both ends of the linearized circular molecule with time after irradiation. Based on this interpretation, the MRX would assure coordinated resection at both ends of a DSB and efficient recombinational repair, possibly preventing half-crossovers (discussed below; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000656.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Since two distinct bands are detected with time after induction of a DSB, the results cannot be simply explained as being due to increasing time to carry out resection. The observation that both MRX and Exo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Lobachev2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> (Nakai and Resnick, unpublished) are largely responsible for preventing a single DSB from transitioning to a cytologically detectable chromosome break supports the view that tethering DSB ends might influence opportunities for resection.</p><p>Additional proteins may also prove important in resection at &#x003b3;-induced DSBs such as Sae2, an endonuclease that associates with MRX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Lengsfeld1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, the helicase Sgs1 implicated in recombination and repair of DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Watt1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Ui1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, the combination of Sgs1 and Dna2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Zhu1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as Pso2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Lam1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref> which have little direct impact on radiation resistance.

In WT cells, there was a rapid appearance of linear dimer molecules formed between sister chromatids and subsequent disappearance (presumably a result of completed repair) that was <italic>RAD52</italic> dependent. Surprisingly, dimer molecules were also formed at early times in the <italic>rad50</italic> strain, suggesting that at least some steps in recombination in the G2/M cells could occur with, at most, limited resection.

It is unlikely that the recombinants are due to single strand annealing, especially at low doses, since the breaks would have to be in the same vicinity on the sister chromatids; the recombinants are actually detected shortly after irradiation when there would be at most only a small amount of resection, especially in the <italic>rad50</italic> mutant.

In a one-hit model one sister is broken and the other is not, in which case the initiation of recombinational repair involving one of the ends will lead to a transient half crossover in the WT. Processing of only one end in the <italic>rad50</italic> mutants at early times (as suggested above) may preclude the opportunity for full crossovers.

(A) Stained gel, multiple band method. As described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, for each band corresponding to chromosome Y, the fraction of chromosomes remaining unbroken (<italic>F<sub>ChrY</sub></italic>) after a given dose is simply the intensity of the Chr Y irradiated band divided by the intensity of the corresponding band in the 0 krad control lane. Therefore, the average number of DSBs, <italic>N<sub>ChrY</sub></italic>, per molecule for any chromosome Y is equal to &#x02212;ln <italic>F<sub>ChrY</sub></italic>. The values for <italic>F<sub>ChrY</sub></italic> and <italic>N<sub>ChrY</sub></italic> at a given dose (i.e., each lane corresponds to a dose) are expected to be accurate to the extent that equal amounts of total DNA were loaded in the 0 krad lane as in the lanes with irradiated DNA. Plotting the experimentally determined values of <italic>N<sub>ChrY</sub></italic> vs MW for a given dose is expected to result in straight line whose slope is in units of DSBs/mb. Presented in (A) is an example of PFGE band intensities (SybrGold) for different chromosomes from cells receiving no irradiation or 30 krad, along with <italic>F<sub>ChrY</sub></italic> and <italic>N<sub>ChrY</sub></italic> values which are shown in the table in (A). These values are plotted against MW and yield a slope of 2.2 DSBs/mb at 30 krad. In the following discussion, we establish that the slope is actually independent of the total amount of DNA loaded in each lane even though individual <italic>N<sub>ChrY</sub></italic> values are influenced by relative amounts of DNA between the lanes. <italic>N<sub>ChrY</sub></italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;Fraction of unbroken ChrY remaining after gamma (irradiated peak/unirradiated peak) <italic>N<sub>ChrY</sub></italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;number of DSBs per ChrY&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;ln <italic>F<sub>ChrY</sub></italic>. This applies to situations where the amounts of DNA in the irradiated and unirradiated lanes are equal. Now consider that there is a difference (factor <italic>R</italic>) in loading between the irradiated and unirradiated lanes. This would affect the amount of material in all bands to the same extent. Therefore, the measured value <italic>F&#x02032;<sub>ChrY</sub></italic> is really <italic>R</italic> times the true value of <italic>F<sub>ChrY</sub></italic> (i.e., when there is equal loading), and the measured value <italic>N&#x02032;<sub>ChrY</sub></italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;lnR <italic>F<sub>ChrY</sub></italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;(lnR+ln <italic>F<sub>ChrY</sub></italic>). Since the value <italic>R</italic> is the same for all bands in the lane with irradiated DNA, all measured values of <italic>N&#x02032;<sub>ChrY</sub></italic> obtained for different chromosomes Y will differ from the true value of <italic>N<sub>ChrY</sub></italic> by the same quantity (&#x02212;ln <italic>R</italic>) and the resulting slope (DSBs per mb) would be the same as if there was no loading difference between lanes. (B) Estimating DSB frequency using probe to common sequence in linear Chr II and circular Chr III. In the method described by Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Ma1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, a <italic>LEU2</italic>-probe, which identifies Chr II and Chr III, is used in Southern hybridization of a pulsed-field gel. Circular chromosome III molecules remain trapped in the well. However, a single random break in circular chromosome III results in full-length linearized chromosome III molecules that can migrate out of the well and form a unique band (as indicated). For the linear chromosome II (Chr II), one or more breaks result in fragmentation and disappearance of material from the linear chromosome II band. The ratio between the amount of the remaining intact chromosome II band and the damaged-induced linearized chromosome III band is used to calculate the DSBs/G2 cell by the equation shown (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Ma1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>; also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

(Figures are adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000656-Lao1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref> in their study of double-strand break mediated recombination in meiosis.) (A) In the wild type cells, a single DSB in one of two sister chromatids can be repaired via resection, strand invasion, strand extension by DNA synthesis, reannealing with complementary resected end and resolvase resolution of a Holiday junction to generate a circular dimer. A temporary half crossover could occur through migration of the Holiday junction and resolvase activity (lower part of (A)). (B) In cells with little or no resection of at least one end of a DSB, opportunities for completion of recombinational repair of a single DSB are reduced. Very limited resection or helicase generation of short single strand regions might allow recombinational interactions, resulting in half crossovers. (C) Pairs of sister chromatids each with a DSB could result in a linear dimer if only one is repaired. At low doses the likelihood of a cell having a single DSB in each sister chromatid is low. With increased dose, a single DSB in each chromatid becomes more likely. However, this scenario (a single DSB in each sister chromatid or two breaks in one sister and none in the other) eventually becomes less likely at increasingly higher doses that induce multiple DSBs per chromatid.</p><p>(1.03 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000656.s005.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000656.s006"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Primers used for generation of probes used in this study.</p><p>(0.18 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000656.s006.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to the following for useful discussions and also critical reading of the manuscript: Drs.
