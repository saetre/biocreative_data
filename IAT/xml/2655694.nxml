Even though <italic>dAdar</italic> has been extensively studied, the complete adult expression pattern has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we investigate mature transcripts of <italic>dAdar</italic> arising from different promoters. Two predominant isoforms of <italic>dAdar</italic> are expressed in gonads and <italic>dAdar</italic> is transcribed from both the embryonic and the adult promoters. Furthermore, full-length transcripts containing the alternatively spliced exon-1 are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The splicing factor B52/SRp55 binds within the alternative spliced exon 3a and plays a role in this alternative splicing event.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (<italic>dAdar</italic>) is an RNA editing enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine. Inosine base pairs with cytosine and is translated as if it were guanosine. Therefore, RNA editing can alter the codon composition and thereby increase the coding capacity of the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Alternative splicing and RNA editing are the main pathways which increase proteome complexity post-transcriptionally. Editing can alter the protein coding sequence, thereby affecting the function of the protein or affect the splicing of pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>). It can also influence its own protein expression such as in the negative autoregulation of rodent ADAR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila Adar</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Moreover, the loss of <italic>Adar</italic> activity has been shown to be important for normal behavior both in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and to be critical for mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p><italic>Drosophila Adar</italic> lies at the tip of the X chromosome within a region that resides in an ecdysone inducible chromosomal puff. Enhanced transcription from the 4A promoter was observed during pupal development and proposed to be due to an increase in ecdysone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In adult flies, the ovary and the supporting cells of the oocyte were shown to be the major steroidogenic tissue. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>There are multiple promoters for the <italic>dAdar</italic> gene. Expression occurs from the 4A promoter during all the stages of development, whereas 4B is only actively transcribed from the pupal stage and in adults. The mRNAs that are expressed encode a complex combination of alternative spliced isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). There are two mutually excluded alternatively spliced exons, -4a, and -4b at the 5&#x02032;-end, in addition to alternatively spliced exons -1 and exon 3a. Exon 3a arises from the extension of exon 3 due to the selection of a distal non-canonical GC at the 5&#x02032; splice site. Inclusion or exclusion of exon 3a changes the spacing between the dsRNA binding domain of <italic>dADAR</italic> resulting in altered binding capability on the dsRNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In addition, transcripts including 3a exon were shown <italic>in vivo</italic> to lack self-editing of exon 7 that lies within the deaminase domain. By editing its own transcript, <italic>dADAR</italic> generates an enzyme that is catalytically less active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The biological function of alternative exon-1 has yet to be determined.</p><p>Members of SR family of proteins have been shown to be required for splice site selection. Here, we identify a binding site for B52/SRp55 within exon 3a of <italic>dAdar</italic> and demonstrate its role in splicing this exon. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, B52/SRp55 was shown to control eye development and to regulate the alternative splicing of many transcripts involved in brain organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>To date, all known transcripts that are edited by ADARs have been detected in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Although editing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> occurs primarily in adult nervous system, ADAR is expressed in other organs and the complete adult expression pattern has not been defined. In this article, we investigate the expression pattern and the alternative splicing of <italic>dAdar</italic> in the gonads. <italic>dAdar</italic> is expressed from both the early and late promoter and there is a tissue-specific inclusion of exon-1.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title>Primers</title><p><italic>dAdar</italic> Exon 2 sense</p><p>5&#x02032;-TACACGCACCTCTATTCACG-3&#x02032;</p><p><italic>dAdar</italic> Exon 4 antisense</p><p>5&#x02032;-TGACCGTCAACAGTAATAGC-3&#x02032;</p><p><italic>dAdar</italic> Exon -4a sense</p><p>5&#x02032;-TCAATAATTAGAGCAAAAAG-3&#x02032;</p><p><italic>dAdar</italic> Exon -4b sense</p><p>5&#x02032;-GTGTGTAGTGCACTTTTGGCCAGCC-3&#x02032;</p><p><italic>rp 49</italic> sense</p><p>5&#x02032;-GCGGGTGCGCTTGTTCGATCC-3&#x02032;</p><p><italic>rp 49</italic> antisense</p><p>5&#x02032;-CCAAGGACTTCATCCGCCACC-3&#x02032;</p><p><italic>egl</italic> Exon 2 sense</p><p>5&#x02032;-TGACGTTCGTCTTCTTCCTGG-3&#x02032;</p><p><italic>egl</italic> Exon 4 antisense</p><p>5&#x02032;- ATCCGTCATGTTCTCGCAGCC-3&#x02032;</p><p>B52/SRp55 Binding site WT sense 5&#x02032;-GAATTAATAC</p><p>GACTCACTATAGGGAGACTACCTCGCTT</p><p>GAACAACCCACGTTTTGCATGAGTCAG-3&#x02032;</p><p>B52/SRp55 binding site WT as 5&#x02032;-TCTGACTCATGCAAAACGTGGGTTGTTCAAGCGAGGTAG-3&#x02032;</p><p>B52/SRp55 Binding site MUT sense 5&#x02032;-GAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACTACCTCGCTTGTACATCTCACTTTTTTTCATCAGTCAGA-3&#x02032;</p><p>B52/SRp55 Binding site MUT antisense</p><p>5&#x02032;-TCTGACTCATGAAAAAAGTGAGATGT ACAAGCGAGGTAG-3&#x02032;</p><p>T7 B52/SRp55 dsRNA sense 5&#x02032;-GAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACATCAAAAATGGCTACGGCT-3&#x02032;</p><p>T7 B52/SRp55 dsRNA as 5&#x02032;-GAATTAATACGACTC ACTATAGGGAGAAGCTCGGTGTCATCCAACTT-3&#x02032;</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of RNA templates for pull-down and dsRNA experiments</title><p>RNA templates for pull-down experiments were made by annealing the oligonucleotides listed above, that encode a T7 polymerase sequence followed by either the wild-type or mutant binding site for B52/SRp55.

The consequence of differential 5&#x02032;ss choice is that two isoforms are produced.

Total RNA was prepared from the head, thorax, leg and abdomen of adult male and female <italic>Oregon R</italic> flies. RT&#x02013;PCR analysis was performed with specific primers in exon 2 and 4 that were located close to the region of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b). As shown in Figure1b, the head, thorax and leg of both male and female displayed the same splicing profile. In particular, the spliced variant that includes exon 3a was expressed at a lower level in comparison to the main transcript that excludes it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b, lanes 1&#x02013;6). However, in both male and female abdomens the opposite was observed and expression of the transcript containing 3a was the major isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b, lanes 7 and 8). Therefore, these results demonstrate that the alternative splicing of exon 3/3a of <italic>dAdar</italic> in the tagmata is regulated.</p><p>The adult abdomen has a different embryological origin from the rest of the body as it is derived from nests of histoblasts located in the embryonic and larval epidermis. This is also the compartment where the gonads are located. Therefore, we investigated the alternative splicing of Adar within the abdomen. Abdomens were microdissected and the testis and ovary were isolated. By RT&#x02013;PCR analysis, we found the same splicing pattern as previously observed for the whole abdomen of the flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c, lanes 1 and 3). The expression pattern of <italic>dAdar</italic> exon 3/3a transcripts from the body of flies without the testis or ovaries was analyzed as a control. As it is clearly shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>c, the gonads have a specific splicing profile that is distinct from the bodies, suggesting that <italic>dAdar</italic> transcripts containing exon 3a are mainly expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> gonads.</p></sec><sec><title>Alternative splicing of <italic>dAdar</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> gonads</title><p>Transcripts of <italic>dAdar</italic> originate from either an embryonic or an adult promoter and this generates mRNAs with two mutually excluded exons, -4a and -4b at the 5&#x02032;-end, together with a complex combination of spliced isoforms. Four major isoforms were shown to be expressed from the early promoter (4A) that correspond to either the inclusion or exclusion of the alternative exons -1 and 3a. However, from the late promoter (4B), only two isoforms are transcribed.

Therefore, exon 3a could be differently expressed in the adult females during this developmental stage in the ovary. To test this hypothesis, we microdissected the ovary and testis and analyzed the splicing pattern of exon 3/3a by RT&#x02013;PCR. This time-course analysis revealed a significant increase in the spliced variants containing exon 3a in the gonads by day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>b).

As the biological role of RNA editing is principally in the adult nervous system in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, to date most of the research on the expression pattern and the alternative splicing of <italic>dAdar</italic> has focused primarily on the brain. Indeed, the complete adult expression pattern has yet to be elucidated. The splicing pattern of the <italic>dAdar</italic> transcripts in the thorax and legs resembles that already characterized for the fly brain. However, <italic>dAdar</italic> is also expressed in the gonads where the splicing mechanism favors the inclusion of the alternative exon 3a. Interestingly, <italic>dAdar</italic> is expressed from both the early and adult promoters in testis and ovaries and full-length transcripts containing both alternatively spliced exons 3a and -1 are expressed in a tissue-specific manner as this transcripts is primarily expressed in the ovaries.</p><p>The alternative 3a exon is only present in transcripts that originate from the 4A promoter. Therefore, a time course of the expression of exon 3/3a was performed and the number of transcripts including exon 3a was observed to increase by day 3 after eclosion. A concurrent increase in the number of oocytes and supporting nurse cells was observed in the ovaries during this time course. A direct correlation can be drawn between the use of promoter 4A and the increased level of ecdysone produced by the nurse cells. This is consistent with the <italic>dAdar</italic> locus being located in an ecdysone inducible puff region near the <italic>BrC</italic> complex, which encodes transcription factors that also respond to this steroidogenic hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). This increased usage of the 4A <italic>dAdar</italic> promoter was also observed during the pupal stage as ecdysone regulates larval development and metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In adult females, ecdysone is also produced in the nurse cells in the ovary. Therefore, we propose that enhanced activity from the 4A promoter is a consequence of an increased level of the ecdysone produced by these nurse cells.</p><p>As transcripts of a related protein <italic>dAdat</italic> (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> t-RNA editing enzyme) were shown to be produced by the nurse cells and loaded into the egg before the fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), we wanted to determine if <italic>dAdar</italic> could be detected during oogenesis. Full-length transcripts of <italic>dAdar</italic> were detected from early stages in oocyte development through to unfertilized mature eggs. One question that needs to be address is whether the predominant transcripts expressed in gonads are translated into functional proteins. However, this will remain unanswered until better <italic>dADAR</italic> antibodies are available. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the oocyte nucleus has been shown to be transcriptionally inactive during most of stages of oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The embryo receives maternally provided transcriptional input from the two other cell sources in the oocyte: the nurse cells and the somatic follicle cells. Therefore, in the future it will be interesting to understand the contribution to <italic>dAdar</italic> expression both from the nurse cells and the somatic follicle cells.</p><p>Recently, additional roles for editing enzymes have been proposed in relation to <italic>Alu</italic> elements, siRNA and miRNA function. ADARs can edit noncoding RNAs and can affect the processing of miRNAs such as pri-miR-142 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) or affect the seed sequence as occurs in miR-376 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), so that the miRNA is redirected to silence a different set of transcripts. Therefore, it is interesting to consider that <italic>dADAR</italic> could interact with noncoding RNAs and retarget the silencing machinery to transcripts that are required to be inactivated during the oocyte development.</p><p>To determine which splicing factor could regulate the alternative splicing of exon 3/3a, we analyzed the nucleotide sequence of exon 3a. The B52/SRp55 binding sequence obtained by SELEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) is very similar to the sequence we found in exon 3a that has a hairpin configuration with the protein binding site exposed in a loop and the guanosine residue that is critical for RNA structure. We demonstrated that B52/SRp55 specifically binds within exon 3a. Depletion of B52/SRp55 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell line by RNAi demonstrates that this splicing factor controls the inclusion of the exon 3a as its downregulation promotes the exclusion of exon 3a. However, we cannot conclude that the increase level of inclusion of exon 3a present in <italic>dAdar</italic> transcripts in the gonads is due to an increase in B52/SRp55 protein. Indeed, in testis and ovary the expression level of B52/SRp55 does not change during the developmental stages that have been analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>c). This result suggests that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> gonads additional splicing factors participate in the complex splicing mechanism that regulates the alternative splicing of exon 3a. These results confirm previous reports that B52/SRp55 together with other splicing factors participate in the recognition of the distal 5&#x02032;ss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). B52/SRp55 was previously been shown to control eye development and to regulate the splicing of many transcripts involved in brain organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Here, we describe a novel function for B52/SRp55 to regulate the splicing of the exon3/3a in Adar transcripts in testis and ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>The inclusion or exclusion of exon 3 in <italic>dAdar</italic> transcripts was demonstrated to affect both the binding and editing activity of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> no transcripts have been isolated that contain exon 3a and are edited in the deaminase domain. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcripts including the 3a isoform were shown to have reduced self-editing in exon 7 that lies within the deaminase domain. In addition, the exon 3a containing transcript introduces an additional 38 amino acids between dsRBM 1 and dsRBM 2 that generates two distinct enzymes. The spacing between the binding domains with exon 3a is very similar to the distance between the binding domains of ADAR2, whereas when this exon is excluded the distance is reminiscence of the distance between the dsRNA binding domains found in ADAR1. This conservation in the spacing of the dsRNA binding domains suggests that it is important for function. It has also been shown that the different isoforms of <italic>dAdar</italic> can form heterodimers and this can change its binding capability on the dsRNA target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Therefore, in the gonads different isoforms of <italic>dAdar</italic> with different editing activity could specifically edit transcripts that are expressed there and as a consequence modify the properties of the encoded proteins.</p><p>In ovaries, the inclusion of the alternative exon-1 results in a protein being expressed that has an additional 12 amino acids at the amino-terminal. This exon introduces an alternative in-frame translational start site that is preferentially transcribed from the early promoter. It has previously been shown that the use of alternative translational starts can regulate several cytokine family proteins whose expression level has to be fine tuned to maintain their physiological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Therefore, the question arises could this be a form of regulation of <italic>dAdar</italic> in the ovary that is in addition to autoediting? This regulation would represent a coordinated translational&#x02013;transcriptional control that regulates alternative splicing and therefore the activity of the editing enzyme in the ovary.</p><p>New editing targets have recently been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Several of these novel edited transcripts were shown to be involved in ion homeostasis, cytoskeletal components and signal transduction pathway and they may be edited in the gonads and have a biological role there.</p><p>In the gonads, development continues throughout the lifetime of the animal and the pathway involves the coordinated division and differentiation of a large number of cells. This site of extensive adult development probably requires a fine tune regulation of <italic>dAdar</italic>.</p><p>It is possible that the presence of different spliced isoforms of <italic>dAdar</italic>, may reflect differences in <italic>dAdar</italic> substrate specificity. Indeed, the tissue-specific alternative splicing of <italic>dAdar</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> gonads may expand the repertoire of ADAR targets beyond the brain to <italic>Drosophila</italic> gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn1080/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Telethon Onlus Foundation, Italy (GGP06147); European Community Grant (EURASNET-LSHG-CT-2005-518<italic>&#x02031;</italic>238); MRC (U.1275.01.005.00001.01).
