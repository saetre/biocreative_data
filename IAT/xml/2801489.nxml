During branching morphogenesis, the epithelial cells interact with the surrounding mesenchyme and organize into polarized monolayers with their apical pole facing the tube lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. How this process takes place and is regulated in exocrine tissues such as the pancreas and salivary glands remains poorly understood.</p><p>In the mouse, the pancreas originates from a pre-patterned endodermal epithelium located in a caudal region of the foregut that is to become the duodenum. Between embryonic days (e) 8.5 and e9.5, two outgrowths develop from the dorsal and ventral sides of this endodermal region, and form epithelial buds surrounded by mesenchyme. From e9.5-e10.5 onwards, the pancreatic bud cells proliferate, differentiate and undergo extensive morphogenesis to generate ductal structures called primitive ducts. The latter then expand, and give rise to the endocrine islets of Langerhans and to a branched ductal network that drains the secretions of the exocrine acini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The submandibular glands (SMG) also derive from the foregut endoderm. Their development starts around e11.5 by formation of two epithelial thickenings beneath the tongue. These thickenings protrude into the underlying mesenchyme. Around e13.5, small clefts appear at the periphery of the budding epithelial mass, and after continuous proliferation and repetitive clefting, a tree-like network of ducts whose branches end in acini is generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Regulation of epithelial morphogenesis in the pancreas and SMG is controlled by the surrounding mesenchyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Moreover, gene inactivation studies and <italic>ex vivo </italic>culture experiments have identified several signaling molecules that regulate SMG branching morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the developing pancreas, gene inactivation studies inhibiting FGF10, EGF, or Rbpj expression revealed impaired branching morphogenesis. However, these studies focused on the role of the signaling molecules on pancreatic cell differentiation and not on the mechanisms of branching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Stromal cell-Derived Factor-1 (SDF-1, also called CXCL12 or PBSF) is a secreted protein of the &#x003b1;-chemokine family, and a potent chemoattractant for many cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Whereas SDF-1 is the sole ligand for the chemokine CXC-motif receptor 4 (CXCR4), CXCR7 can bind SDF-1 and CXCL11/I-TAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. <italic>Sdf1 </italic>and <italic>cxcr4 </italic>knockout mice die perinatally and display profound defects in the hematopoietic and nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], whereas <italic>cxcr7 </italic>knockout embryos die at birth due to defects in heart formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. No role has been ascribed to SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling in the SMG. In contrast, two functions for SDF-1 signaling in adult pancreas have been proposed. One day before birth, when pancreatic cells still differentiate and extensive islet neogenesis occurs, CXCR4 is expressed in endocrine cells and in some ductal cells, whereas SDF-1 is only found in endocrine cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The same expression pattern persists in adult pancreas. Using a genetic model of endocrine pancreas regeneration (mice expressing IFN-&#x003b3; under the control of the insulin gene promoter), it was proposed that SDF-1 is involved in endocrine cell renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. More recently, it has been shown that SDF-1 promotes &#x003b2;-cell survival, via activation of Akt, in adult mouse islets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, it is not known if SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling plays a role in early pancreas development.</p><p>In this paper we show that pancreatic epithelial morphogenesis occurs according to a sequence of two opposite epithelial transitions. During the first transition the monolayer of endodermal cells lining the primitive gut gives rise to two pancreatic buds, each composed of a mass of non polarized epithelial cells. During the second transition, this mass reorganizes into branched polarized epithelial monolayers that further differentiate into ducts and acini. Similar sequential transitions were described earlier in the SMG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the pancreas and SMG, <italic>sdf1 </italic>was expressed by the mesenchyme and <italic>cxcr4 </italic>by the epithelial cells. Using embryonic explants of pancreas and SMG, and mice deficient in SDF-1 signaling, we uncovered a new role for SDF-1 in branching morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Primitive duct morphogenesis and cell polarization during pancreas development</title><p>To obtain a better insight into the regulation of branching morphogenesis in developing pancreas, we first analyzed primitive duct morphogenesis and epithelial cell polarization. We visualized epithelial cells (E-cadherin), their apical pole lining the lumen (mucin-1), and the basal lamina (laminin) separating the epithelial cells from the mesenchyme on sections from e10.5 to e15.5 pancreas (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). At e10.5 and e11.5, the pancreatic buds had a globular shape, and most epithelial cells were not polarized, as they were not lined by laminin (basal marker) and did not show mucin-1 (apical marker). At e12.5, the shape of the pancreas became irregular. Lumina of primitive ducts, still surrounded by several layers of epithelial cells became detectable from e13.5 onwards. The pancreas then progressively gave rise to the primitive ductal network, composed of a polarized and monolayered epithelium surrounded by mesenchyme. At e15.5, all epithelial cells were polarized and showed apical, lateral and basal domains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Very few apoptotic cells were detected during these stages, and they were exclusively localized in the non-epithelial compartment (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). We concluded that the formation of the primitive pancreatic ductal network occurs by remodeling of a globular mass of epithelial cells, rather than from iterative branching of a monolayer.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Remodeling of the pancreatic epithelial cell mass into polarized monolayers</bold>. Pancreatic sections from e10.5 to e15.5 embryos were examined by immunofluorescence using antibodies directed against E-cadherin, mucin-1 and laminin. Pancreatic development starts by the formation of a mass of non-polarized epithelial cells (e10.5-e11.5). This mass is then remodeled (e12.5-e13.5) and finally every epithelial cell become polarized, with its basal pole contacting laminin and its apical pole facing a lumen (e14.5-e15.5). * indicates the central duct, in connection with the duodenum.

In addition to the central duct lumen (asterisk in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), intense mucin-1 stainings also appeared as dots at the periphery of the pancreatic buds (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). These stainings corresponded to small developing lumina, called here secondary lumina. Three-dimensional confocal reconstructions were generated to determine the spatial relationship between these secondary lumina and the central duct lumen. No connection between the central and the peripheral lumina were detected, indicating that the latter are blind and independent from the central lumen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>; white arrowhead, b to g; red arrowhead, f to k; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Furthermore, a section through the e11.5 pancreatic bud stained for E-cadherin and mucin-1 expression showed that the cells of the outer layer are morphologically different from internal cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The outer cells had a cylindrical shape and a basal nucleus. Their apical pole faced the peripheral lumina, as shown by mucin-1 staining (arrows in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In addition, the localization of two intracellular markers in this outer epithelial layer was typical of polarized cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). The Golgi marker GM-130 was found on the apical side of the nucleus, and the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) detected by pericentrin staining was located in the subapical region of the cells. In contrast, except for the cells that lined the central duct lumen, the internal cells of the pancreatic bud showed no mucin-1 expression and the localization of the Golgi and MTOC was random. Altogether, these data indicated that the pancreatic bud is a compact epithelial mass, in which the cells are not polarized, except for the outer cells which all have basal and lateral membrane domains; some cells also posses an apical domain.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The pancreatic buds consist of an epithelial cell mass with peripheral lumina</bold>.

The latter play a role in cell adhesion and in the establishment and maintenance of apico-basal polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. To this end, we studied the localization of the tight junction-specific protein ZO-1 from e10.5 to e15.5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Despite the continuous presence of adherens junctions (E-cadherin) between pancreatic epithelial cells, strong ZO-1 staining was not detected in the pancreas before e12.5. From that stage on, ZO-1 was progressively seen in cells facing a lumen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Therefore, ZO-1 localization at the tight junctions was subsequent to the onset of polarization of peripheral cells in the e11.5 pancreatic bud and was concomitant with the remodeling of the epithelial bud into a monolayered epithelium lining the primitive duct lumina.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Primitive duct morphogenesis occurs by transition from epithelial mass to monolayers in the pancreas and in the SMG</bold>.

Both organs show that duct development occurs by remodeling of a mass of epithelial cells into polarized monolayers. Before remodeling, E-cadherin is expressed all around the cells, whereas it is restricted to the baso-lateral membranes in the monolayered epithelium. In the latter, ZO-1 (tight junction) separates the E-cadherin-negative apical pole from the E-cadherin-positive lateral domains (insets). * indicates the central duct, in connection with the duodenum (A).

High magnification pictures of epithelial cell monolayers clearly demonstrated that ZO-1 separates the apical domain (now devoid of E-cadherin staining) from the lateral domain (insets in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4 are expressed in developing pancreas and SMG</title><p>The mesenchyme is a source of morphogenesis-inducing signals in the pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and in the SMG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, we looked for mesenchymal factors that could regulate epithelial morphogenesis in these organs and considered SDF-1 as a candidate. Indeed, this chemokine and its G protein-coupled receptor CXCR4 have been proposed to control cell movement in many developing organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], including the endoderm during zebrafish gastrulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

We first investigated the expression pattern of SDF-1 and CXCR4 in the pancreas by performing <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization experiments.

Identical results were obtained with explants from e11.5 embryos (data not shown), and the effect of AMD3100 was dose-dependent, since milder anomalies were observed at 10 &#x003bc;M than at 20 &#x003bc;M. Thus, at the end of the culture, the AMD3100-treated explants resembled the e12.5 pancreas before the onset of remodeling into a monolayered epithelium (compare AMD3100 panels of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> with Day 0 panels of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). AMD3100 treatment did not change the proliferation or the apoptosis index (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4A, B</xref>) and this was supported by the normal size of these explants. Immunostaining with antibodies against insulin, glucagon or carboxypeptidase-A revealed normal differentiation in the explants treated with AMD3100 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4C</xref>). From these experiments we concluded that SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling is potentially required for the remodeling of the epithelial cell mass into primitive pancreatic ducts lined by a monolayered epithelium.</p></sec><sec><title>SDF-1 signaling controls SMG branching morphogenesis</title><p>To investigate if SDF-1 modulates branching morphogenesis of other exocrine glands, we addressed the role of SDF-1 signaling in SMG epithelial morphogenesis. As shown above, this organ develops according to the same two-stage epithelial transition as in the pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We resorted to cultures of e13.5 embryonic explants, as described earlier by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The SMG epithelial bud surrounded by its mesenchyme was excised and cultured on filter for up to 3 days in the presence of SDF-1 and SDF-1 antagonists. Similarly to the pancreas, gain-of-function experiments with exogenous SDF-1 did not affect SMG branching (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). However, upon AMD3100 treatment, morphogenesis of the SMG was impaired (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The size of the glands was smaller and the number of epithelial buds was reduced, as compared to control glands, indicating that SDF-1 signaling is required for branching. Quantification of the number of buds in AMD3100-treated explants revealed a reduction in the budding index (number of buds at day 1, 2 or 3 divided by the number of buds at day 0), as early as one day after the onset of the treatment, and culminating at 80% reduction after 3 days, as compared to control cultures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). As CXCR7 was also expressed in the blood vessels surrounding the SMG (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), the SDF-1 antagonist CCX733, which prevents SDF-1 from binding to CXCR7, was also tested. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, CCX733 inhibited SMG morphogenesis by reducing the number of epithelial buds. This was confirmed by a 60% reduction in the budding index as compared to controls after 3 days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). These experiments suggested a role for SDF-1 signaling via CXCR4 and CXCR7 in the branching morphogenesis of the SMG.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>SDF-1 signaling controls SMG branching morphogenesis</bold>.

Control and SDF-1-treated cultures show that the epithelium has invaded the whole culture and forms a complex arborescence. In contrast, treatment of the SMG explants with 20 &#x003bc;M AMD3100 inhibits epithelial branching morphogenesis, as seen by the failure to colonize the explant mesenchyme and the reduced number of buds. Similarly, CCX733 reduces the branching as well as the invasion of the mesenchyme.

As SDF-1 signaling can control both cell survival and cell proliferation in different cell types, blocking SDF-1 binding to CXCR4 with AMD3100 could explain the reduced size of the glands. Therefore, we performed immunodetection of phosphohistone H3, a marker of mitosis, and of activated caspase 3, a marker of cell apoptosis, in control, AMD3100- and CCX733-treated explants. Quantification of these stainings revealed that proliferation was not affected when SDF-1 signaling was abrogated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). However, apoptosis showed a three-fold increase in the epithelial buds of AMD3100-treated explants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). This observation could explain the reduced size of the SMG epithelium. We then assessed whether the increase in apoptosis was the cause of the branching defect. For this, we cultured explants in the presence of AMD3100 alone or in combination with a general inhibitor of caspases. Apoptosis was effectively prevented as revealed by the near complete absence of activated caspase 3 staining on sections from caspase inhibitor-treated explants (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). However, in the explants co-cultured with AMD3100 and the caspases inhibitor, the branching defect was still observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>), indicating that the reduced branching activity is not a consequence of increased apoptosis. Since SDF-1 did not affect cell survival in developing pancreas (see above) but did control branching morphogenesis of the pancreas, we conclude that SDF-1 has differential effects on organ development, but that it has common effects on epithelial branching.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>SDF-1 signaling promotes epithelial cell survival in the SMG</bold>.

SDF-1 is expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding the epithelium and its receptor CXCR4 is found in the epithelial cells of the pancreas. SDF-1 signaling promotes branching morphogenesis of the pancreas <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also provide <italic>in vitro </italic>evidence that SMG morphogenesis is controlled by SDF-1.</p><p>Previous models depicting pancreatic duct morphogenesis in mammals suggest that it results from the branching of a polarized epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. We show here that formation of the primitive ductal network is not initiated by iterative branching of a tubular structure extending from the gut (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The pancreatic bud at e10.5-e11.5 consists of a globular mass of epithelial cells with a central duct lumen. This lumen, connected to the gut tube lumen, forms extensions within the pancreatic bud, and is surrounded by several layers of cells. These cells are linked by adherens junctions (E-cadherin), but lack tight junctions (ZO-1). At this stage, we observe that some cells at the periphery of the mass show apico-basal polarity and delineate blind lumina (secondary lumina). Based on these observations, we propose that primitive duct branches arise from extensions of the central gut-derived duct that fuse with secondary lumina that appear at e11.5. Interestingly, this process bears resemblance with lumen development in the zebrafish gut tube and exocrine pancreas. Indeed, in these organs the lumen arises by fusion of multiple lumina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. After the formation of primitive ducts, further branching and expansion of the pancreatic ducts occur by iterative lateral branching, as illustrated by Puri and Hebrok [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. This is also similar to the development of the mouse SMG, where the epithelial cells first form a mass that becomes remodeled into a monolayered epithelium. Like in the pancreas, epithelial cells in the SMG express E-cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin. ZO-1 is only detectable when cells are lining a lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Development and banching morphogenesis of the pancreas</bold>. Pancreatic specification of polarized endodermal cells leads to the formation of a multilayered and then globular mass of epithelial cells with a central duct lumen (pancreatic bud). This lumen, connected to the gut tube lumen, forms extensions within the pancreatic bud, and is surrounded by several layers of cells, linked by adherens junctions (E-cadherin), but lacking tight junctions (ZO-1). Around e11.5, before remodeling of the mass, some cells at the periphery acquire apico-basal polarity and delineate blind lumina (secondary lumina). Initial branching morphogenesis events result from the coalescence of secondary and central lumina, allowing the progression towards epithelial monolayers.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-9-66-9"/></fig><p>The time-course and 3-D analysis of embryonic pancreas development indicated that an initial phase of polarization occurs in cells of the outermost layer of the pancreatic bud at e11.5. This precedes remodeling of the bud, suggesting that, at the onset of pancreas development, remodeling may be triggered by the acquisition of polarity and not the reverse. Beyond this stage, acquisition of apico-basal polarity and primitive duct formation cannot be dissociated morphologically but must be orchestrated by several regulators acting on distinct aspects. Indeed, in our culture explants, blocking SDF-1 signaling did not prevent epithelial cells in the mass to acquire apical characteristics such as assembly of tight junction complexes and primary cilia (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref> and data not shown). Nevertheless, this polarization program could not go to completion, as the cells remained clustered and most of them did not acquire a basal domain.</p><p>During the remodeling of the pancreatic globular mass, the epithelium is in contact with the mesenchyme. The latter tissue has been proposed to provide signals that control epithelial proliferation, differentiation and morphogenesis. We have identified here SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling as a potential regulator of branching morphogenesis. Indeed, SDF-1 and its receptor, CXCR4, are expressed in embryonic pancreas in a complementary fashion. When epithelial cells are still organized as a non polarized mass, SDF-1 is expressed in the mesenchyme whereas CXCR4 is localized in the epithelium. Moreover, when SDF-1 signaling is inhibited by pharmacological means or by CXCR4 genetic deficiency, pancreas morphogenesis is perturbed. These data are consistent with a model in which the mesenchymally-produced SDF-1 promotes epithelial remodeling and thus primitive duct morphogenesis. While this work was under review, Ueland and collaborators demonstrated that SDF-1 controls epithelial kidney morphogenesis in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Our data in the pancreas and SMG, together with those of Ueland et al. demonstrate the role of SDF-1 in epithelial branching morphogenesis. The molecular nature of the branching defects does not involve a change in the proliferation or apoptosis indexes (this study), but may be explained by a change in the migration potential of epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>].</p><p>There is no perfect overlap between the results obtained with the pharmacological inhibition and with genetic inactivation of SDF-1 signaling in the pancreas. Pharmacological inhibition of SDF-1 signaling <italic>in vitro </italic>severely repressed branching morphogenesis, but genetic deficiency in <italic>Sdf1-/- </italic>pancreas showed more modest effects <italic>in vivo</italic>. Also, the effect of <italic>cxcr4 </italic>gene ablation only led to abnormal pancreas morphogenesis when the organ was cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>. We suggest that compensatory pathways may be active <italic>in vivo </italic>but not <italic>in vitro</italic>. In our culture system, endothelial cells are present and organized around the epithelium like in vivo, the main difference being that there is no blood circulation in the endothelial network in vitro. We suggest that signal(s) coming directly or indirectly from the circulation could participate in the control of epithelial branching morphogenesis of the pancreas and SMG. Such a model would further extend the role of the vasculature in pancreas development, since others previously showed that blood flow through the aorta is required for dorsal pancreas budding from the endoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>In developing SMG, CXCR4 is expressed in the epithelium and SDF-1 in the mesenchyme, like in the pancreas. This suggests that SDF-1 controls branching morphogenesis by a direct mechanism on the epithelium. Importantly, CXCR7 is detected in endothelial cells of the SMG, but not in the pancreas. In SMG explants, we observed a branching defect when SDF-1 binding to CXCR7 was inhibited by CCX733. This suggests that SDF-1 can also indirectly control epithelial branching morphogenesis, via the endothelium. Activation of CXCR7 in the endothelium may induce the production of an unidentified factor which in turn would signal to the epithelium and act in parallel to or amplify the direct SDF-1 effects on epithelial morphogenesis. In the SMG we also noticed a difference between the effects of pharmacological inhibition of SDF-1 and genetic deficiencies induced by inactivation of the <italic>sdf1 </italic>or <italic>cxcr4 </italic>genes. <italic>In vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>development of cultured <italic>cxcr4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>and <italic>sdf1</italic><sup>-/- </sup>SMG was normal, unlike development of AMD3100- or CCX733-treated explants. This suggests the existence of other ligands that could bind CXCR7, or alternative signaling pathways with which SDF-1/CXCR4/7 might interact in this organ. It has been reported that migrating muscle progenitors cells reach the anlage of the tongue in <italic>cxcr4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>or <italic>gab1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, but not in the double-mutant mice. A crosstalk between G-protein-coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors may contribute to compensatory mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>Finally, when SDF-1 signaling was blocked, the size of the epithelium was reduced in the SMG but not in the pancreas. Although SDF-1 is important for survival of insulin-producing &#x003b2;-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], we did not observe any effect of SDF-1 signaling on cell survival early in pancreas development, even when e12.5 explants were cultured in the absence of serum (data not shown). This indicates that the survival signals are different in the two organs. A role for SDF-1 in cell survival has already been described in several systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. We excluded the possibility that the role of SDF-1 in cell survival in SMG coincided with its role in branching morphogenesis, thereby indicating that SDF-1 plays distinct roles in the SMG.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the present work shows that the formation of primitive ducts in the pancreas depends on remodeling of a globular mass of epithelial cells, as described earlier in SMG. Our data also identify SDF-1 as a factor that may promote the transition from a mass of epithelial cells towards monolayers in the pancreas and SMG. Understanding the mechanisms of such epithelial transition is relevant to carcinogenesis, which is associated with loss of epithelial polarity and formation of a mass of cells that fills the ductal lumen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6J <italic>cxcr4 </italic>+/- mice were obtained from, and genotyped according to The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, MA).
