Recently, it was shown that an increase in <italic>SNCA</italic> copy numbers leads to elevated levels of wild-type <italic>SNCA-</italic>mRNA and protein and is sufficient to cause early-onset, familial PD. A critical question concerning the molecular pathogenesis of PD is what contributory role, if any, is played by the <italic>SNCA</italic> gene in sporadic PD. The expansion of <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1, an upstream, polymorphic microsatellite of the <italic>SNCA</italic> gene, is associated with elevated risk for sporadic PD. However, whether <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 is the causal variant and the underlying mechanism with which its effect is mediated by remained elusive. We report here the effects of three distinct <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 variants in the brains of 72 mice transgenic for the entire human <italic>SNCA</italic> locus. Human <italic>SNCA</italic>-mRNA and protein levels were increased 1.7- and 1.25-fold, respectively, in homozygotes for the expanded, PD risk-conferring allele compared with homozygotes for the shorter, protective allele. When adjusting for the total SNCA-protein concentration (endogenous mouse and transgenic human) expressed in each brain, the expanded risk allele contributed 2.6-fold more to the SNCA steady-state than the shorter allele. Furthermore, targeted deletion of Rep1 resulted in the lowest human <italic>SNCA-</italic>mRNA and protein concentrations in murine brain. In contrast, the Rep1 effect was not observed in blood lysates from the same mice. These results demonstrate that Rep1 regulates human <italic>SNCA</italic> expression by enhancing its transcription in the adult nervous system and suggest that homozygosity for the expanded Rep1 allele may mimic locus multiplication, thereby elevating PD risk.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>&#x003b1;-Synuclein (<italic>SNCA)</italic> (GenBank: AF163864; Ensembl: ENSG00000145335; OMIM, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man: MIM 163890) gene mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C3">3</xref>) and copy number variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C8">8</xref>) have been implicated in the development of rare forms of familial Parkinson disease (PD, MIM 168600). Moreover, a recent genome-wide association study provided further support for the role of <italic>SNCA</italic> in familial PD susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C9">9</xref>). Recently published evidence showed that an increase in <italic>SNCA</italic> copy numbers leads to elevated levels of wild-type (WT) SNCA protein <italic>in vivo</italic> and is sufficient to cause early-onset, familial PD. Whereas the triplication of the WT <italic>SNCA</italic> locus leads to 2-fold overexpression of <italic>SNCA</italic>-mRNA and protein, duplication results in a 1.5-fold elevation. Duplication results in lower penetrance than is seen with triplication, a slightly later onset of the disease and a &#x02018;milder&#x02019; phenotype that is essentially indistinguishable from sporadic PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C11">11</xref>). Furthermore, PD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, MIM 127750) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are seen as prototypes of human &#x02018;synucleinopathies&#x02019;, which are characterized by intracellular SNCA inclusions. These aggregates have been identified in neuronal Lewy bodies and neurites, two pathological hallmark lesions of both PD and DLB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C12">12</xref>), and in glial inclusions, a characteristic of MSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C13">13</xref>). Moreover, elevated <italic>SNCA</italic>-mRNA levels have been reported in midbrain tissue homogenates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C14">14</xref>) and in dopaminergic neurons from sporadic PD cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C15">15</xref>). These observations emphasize the critical importance of <italic>SNCA</italic> dosage and expression levels in the pathogenesis of PD and related synucleinopathies.</p><p>Several association studies have demonstrated that genetic variability across the <italic>SNCA</italic> locus, including its promoter, is associated with altered susceptibility to sporadic PD (PDGene database, <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.pdgene.org/">http://www.pdgene.org/</uri>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C19">19</xref>). To date, the most studied <italic>SNCA</italic> genetic variation is Rep1 (GenBank D4S3481), a complex polymorphic microsatellite repeat site located &#x0223c;10 kb upstream of the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C21">21</xref>). The overwhelming majority of these association studies, including a large meta-analysis, have shown that certain alleles of <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 confer increased risk to develop late-onset, &#x02018;idiopathic&#x02019; PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C25">25</xref>). Previously, we attempted to determine whether this genetic association correlated with any biological function. Using a reporter assay in a transiently transfected neuronal cell culture model, we demonstrated that the <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 had a reproducible effect on regulating transcriptional activity; there, certain allele lengths showed a nearly 3-fold change in expression of the reporter construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C27">27</xref>). Given that multiplications of <italic>SNCA</italic> have been implicated in heritable PD, where elevated dosage increases penetrance and lowers age-of-onset, we hypothesized that a subtle increase in SNCA expression over decades confers an elevated risk for late-onset, sporadic PD. We posited that the strong genetic association of <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 allele expansion with PD risk could be the consequence of a <italic>cis</italic>-acting mechanism on the transcriptional regulation of <italic>SNCA</italic>. Moreover, it was recently suggested that the <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 genotype may also affect SNCA protein levels in human blood samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C28">28</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used a transgenic mouse model to examine three distinct Rep1 variants within the human <italic>SNCA</italic> locus to establish the relevance of the Rep1 element in the regulation of <italic>SNCA</italic> expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. We engineered the two most frequent alleles that have been reported in both Caucasian and Asian populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C23">23</xref>), i.e. the expanded, 261 bp-long Rep1 allele (&#x0223c;68% in control whites) and its shorter 259 bp variant (&#x0223c;27%), into a bacterial P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) containing the entire human <italic>SNCA</italic> gene. We also engineered an artificial allele consisting of a deletion of the Rep1 repeat within the same PAC. We then compared <italic>SNCA</italic>-mRNA and protein levels in the brain and blood specimens of transgenic mice carrying the 261 and 259 bp and the Rep1-deletion alleles in order to compare the effect of the different alleles on the expression of the <italic>SNCA</italic> gene <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Characterization of transgenic mouse lines to examine three distinct <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 genotypes</title><p>We generated transgenic mice lines for three distinct <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 genotypes carrying the 146 kb-large PAC 27M07. The PAC contains the entire human <italic>SNCA</italic> gene and 34 kb of its upstream region, including the <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 site located within &#x0223c;10 kb of the transcription start site (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP265F1">1</xref>). Each genotype examined contained a different allele at the <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 site. These included the two naturally occurring variants, Rep1-261 bp and Rep1-259 bp, which carried the following sequence combinations, (TC)<sub>10</sub>(T)<sub>2</sub>(TC)<sub>10</sub>(TA)<sub>8</sub>(CA)<sub>11</sub> and (TC)<sub>10</sub>(T)<sub>2</sub>(TC)<sub>10</sub>(TA)<sub>8</sub>(CA)<sub>10</sub>, respectively, and one artificial allele in which the <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 repeat has been deleted altogether, &#x00394;-Rep1. Importantly, these PAC clones harbored &#x0223c;34 kb of non-coding DNA located upstream of exon 1, thereby reducing possible integration site effects on transcription. Nevertheless, to further minimize any confounding effect of genome integration site by our PAC variants on subsequent transgene expression, we decided to generate two independent lines for each of the three genotypes. Transcription and translation of human <italic>SNCA</italic> in the mouse brain was confirmed at the F1 generation, as shown, for example, in the Rep1-261/261-carrying line &#x02018;A&#x02019; in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP265F2">2</xref>B and C.

To this end, we employed quantitative real-time PCR using genomic DNA from animals in each line by targeting two different regions of the human PAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C29">29</xref>). We calculated that the relative transgene copy numbers in the different lines shown here ranged from 1 to 7 transgene copies per haploid genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp265/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>).</p><fig id="DDP265F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>A schematic presentation of the PAC (27M07) used to generate the transgenic mice lines.

Following the observation of variable SNCA signals in routine western blotting experiments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP265F4">4</xref>A), which represents a low throughput and non-linear method of signal detection, we employed an extensively validated, sandwich-type enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) protocol for the quantification of SNCA in each mouse brain (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP265F4">4</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C33">33</xref>).

Gene expression studies in humans, especially when they involve the analysis of post-mortem brain, often introduce several confounding variables, e.g. differences in genetic background, age, environmental exposures (including pharmacotherapy), length of illness and importantly, variability in post-mortem interval and tissue handling. All of these factors can affect mRNA and protein stability, and thus their measureable abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C37">37</xref>). In order to overcome the combination of these confounding factors involved in studying mRNA and protein levels in human post-mortem tissue, we took the novel approach of studying human gene expression in a transgenic mouse model. Transgenic mouse models have been used, almost exclusively, to study the effect of mutations in coding gene sequences. Here, we generated a transgenic model, which carries the entire human genomic region of the <italic>SNCA</italic> gene, to study the effect of a variation located &#x0223c;10 kb upstream of the transcription start site within the putative promoter/enhancer region and to dissect its contribution to human <italic>SNCA</italic> expression levels <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>A critical question concerning the molecular pathogenesis of PD is what contributory role, if any, is played by the <italic>SNCA</italic> gene in sporadic PD. Several studies conferred an association of common <italic>SNCA</italic> polymorphisms in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; regions of the gene locus with PD susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C19">19</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C38">38</xref>); however, the causal variant/s and hence the underlying mechanism/s remained elusive. We hypothesized that altered regulation of <italic>SNCA</italic> gene expression levels is important in the development of sporadic PD in a significant subset of patients; these include subjects who do not express a mutant SNCA protein and who do not carry an elevated <italic>SNCA</italic> gene dosage in their genome. One important mechanism that modulates gene expression levels is transcriptional efficiency. Markers across the 5&#x02032; region of <italic>SNCA</italic> that were associated with increased odds ratio to develop PD are in almost complete linkage disequilibrium with each other, which makes pinpointing the biologically relevant variant within an associated 5&#x02032; region challenging. In this study, we provide evidence for a contributory role of the <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 variant in the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>SNCA</italic> gene and in their effects on <italic>SNCA</italic>-mRNA and protein levels in mouse brain. We found a positive correlation between <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 allele lengths at the <italic>SNCA</italic> enhancer/promoter region and human <italic>SNCA</italic>-mRNA as well as protein levels in the brains of these transgenic mice. Although we are cognizant of the potential limitations by using whole-brain homogenates rather than region-specific specimens (that are of relevance to PD pathogenesis), we purposefully sought to minimize any introduction of inaccuracies stemming from variability in tissue dissection and to accommodate a larger number of animals in our quantitative assays. Our results show that allele Rep1-261 bp, which confers increased risk to develop late-onset, sporadic PD, was significantly correlated with higher <italic>SNCA</italic> levels relative to the protective allele Rep1-259 bp (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Intriguingly, our collective data suggest that the carrier status of Rep1-261 bp homozygosity within an otherwise WT complement of two <italic>SNCA</italic> gene copies results in a 1.7-fold elevation of <italic>SNCA</italic>-mRNA and a 1.25-fold elevation in the protein level, suggesting that variability in translational efficiency had only a limited effect. Therefore, Rep1-261 bp homozygosity may be functionally equivalent to the situation of subjects with <italic>SNCA</italic> locus duplication who carry three <italic>SNCA</italic> copies, which results in 1.5-fold elevation. We therefore speculate that Rep1-261 bp homozygosity confers a critical gain-of-function mechanism in PD penetrance and in the expressivity of synucleinopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C6">6</xref>).</p><p>Although the biological effect of the Rep1 expansion was observed in the most relevant organ to PD expression, i.e. the brain, its contribution appeared specific because its enhancer role was not recorded in the corresponding blood specimens. Of note, Fuchs <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C28">28</xref>) recently reported a positive genotype-to-phenotype effect for Rep1 repeat length in human blood samples, where homozygotes of the protective, shorter allele had lower concentrations of SNCA protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells; intriguingly, and in agreement with our finding, these authors observed no effect at the mRNA level in peripheral blood. At the current time, we cannot exclude a modulatory effect by the Rep1 genotype on SNCA protein levels in peripheral blood (as suggested by Fuchs <italic>et al</italic>.), because the human protein concentrations in our transgenic mouse blood were unexpectedly low, which could have put any significant variation below the limit of detection. The discrepancy between the Fuchs <italic>et al</italic>. and our study may also be explained by a variety of other factors; chief among them are the differences in donor species and sample sizes, the methods of blood collection and processing and, last but not least, the differences between the ELISA protocols employed.</p><p>The quantification of peripheral <italic>SNCA</italic>-mRNA levels together with the characterization of the Rep1 genotype has also been explored in the context of alcohol use-related disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C39">39</xref>); the most recent study suggests an independent (but not a pairwise) association of Rep1 genotype and alcohol abuse with PD risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C40">40</xref>). Clearly, larger cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of carefully collected cohorts and validated, standardized protocols are now needed to further investigate these neuropsychatric conditions. This aspect is particularly relevant for PD biomarker efforts that seek to correlate variations in the transcriptome and/or proteome of venous blood with the clinical phenotype of living donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C41">41</xref>). Overall, the observed neuro-specific effect of the Rep1 element <italic>in vivo</italic> using a mouse model is consistent with our previous cellular results. Using a luciferase reporter system, we had observed that the construct harboring the expanded allele at the <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 site generated the highest luciferase activity specifically in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C27">27</xref>).</p><p>Our results lend support for the overall biological significance of <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1, thereby suggesting that many of the observed associations between the <italic>SNCA</italic> 5&#x02032; region and PD susceptibility could possibly be explained by variations in <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 genotype. We predict that the association of the 261 bp-long risk allele with sporadic PD is conferred by direct upregulation of <italic>SNCA</italic> transcription, and that the protective allele 259 bp acts through the lowering of its expression rate. Here, we chose to focus on the two most common Rep1 alleles; we acknowledge the role that other variants may play, such as the rare PD-associated 263 bp-long Rep1 variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C25">25</xref>). Additional Rep1 allelic variants will be analyzed using newly created transgenic mice in future studies. Likewise, it will be of interest to determine whether our PAC mice will develop any neuropathological and behavioral features of human synucleinopathies toward the end of their lifespan that are currently not seen in those transgenic models that are based solely on an <italic>SNCA</italic> cDNA construct design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C43">43</xref>). At the age of 8 weeks, we have observed no readily recognizable alteration in the behavior of the mice used in this study.</p><p>In our previous work, we identified a transcription factor, poly(ADP-ribose) transferase/polymerase-1 (PARP-1, MIM 173870), which specifically bound to Rep1 and modulated <italic>SNCA</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C44">44</xref>). It will be interesting to explore whether the variability in <italic>SNCA</italic> regulation (as mediated by Rep1 alleles) rests on altered binding efficiency of PARP-1 to Rep1 sequences that vary in length. Alternatively, our observed Rep1 expansion effect could also be explained by interaction/s with <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements during chromatin unfolding, which precedes <italic>SNCA</italic> gene transcription, for example, with the recently discovered GATA motif within intron 1. This intronic GATA site is selectively occupied by GATA-2 (MIM 137295) protein in neurons and by GATA-1 (MIM 305371) in erythroid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C34">34</xref>).</p><p>The transgenic mouse approach we have pursued here could serve as a valuable model system for a variety of future studies in the PD field, including those that examine gene&#x02013;environment interactions, such as the protective effects of smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C46">46</xref>); our approach may also serve proof of concept studies, such as those that target the reduction of human SNCA levels <italic>in vivo</italic> either through the specific modulation of mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C47">47</xref>) or through the acceleration of SNCA degradation by candidate enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C48">48</xref>).

Alleles were defined according to the length of the PCR product in concordance to the conventional nomenclature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C25">25</xref>). The PCR fragments were sequenced and then cloned into a recombineering vector for site-directed recombination in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> into the <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 locus in PAC 27M07. A third PAC was recombineered in which the <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 repeat had been precisely deleted, heretofore referred to as &#x00394;-Rep1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C27">27</xref>).

F1s heterozygous for the intact human PAC transgenes were crossed to produce homozygotes for each allelic variant transgene. Mice homozygous for the human transgene harboring 261 and 259 bp <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 alleles and the deleted allele are referred to as 261/261, 259/259, &#x00394;/&#x00394; mice, respectively. Of note, one of the &#x00394;-Rep1 lines, &#x02018;B&#x02019;, was non-viable probably due to insertion site effect, thus for this line, the analysis was performed using heterozygous mice, and the transgene copy number was corrected accordingly (see below). Two lines were generated from each genotype (i.e. a total of six lines). Six male and six female F2s homozygous from each transgenic line, 72 mice in total, were sacrificed at the age of 8 weeks for sample collection. Blood was collected from the orbital sinus, and subsequently, the whole brain was harvested. It is important to note that all mouse lines shared an identical genetic background, which included the WT murine <italic>snca</italic> locus, and were reared in the same environment. In addition, all of the mice underwent identical blood collection and brain-harvesting procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>DNA analysis of transgenic mice</title><p>We used DNA from mouse tails to confirm the founders. The <italic>SNCA</italic>-Rep1 genotypes were verified by direct sequence analysis of the polymorphic repeat and its flanking region. The intactness of the PAC transgenes in each founder animal and its transmission to the F1 generation were assayed by a routine series of 10 PCR assays along the transgene sequence. Primer sequences and PCR conditions for genotyping are available upon request. FISH was used to estimate transgene copy number in the F1 generation. Briefly, the human-PAC targeting construct and a mouse BAC covering comparable size sequence from mouse chromosome 9 were used as probes. Interphase preparations from leukocytes and metaphase preparations from spleen cells were generated by standard air-drying technique, and FISH was performed with labeled DNA prepared by nick translation using spectrum orange-dUTP (red) or spectrum green-dUTP (green) (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL, USA) essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C53">53</xref>). On each slide, 100 ng of labeled probe was applied. Ten microliters of a hybridization mixture containing the labeled DNA in 50% formamide, 2&#x000d7; SSC and 10% dextran sulfate were denatured at 75&#x000b0;C for 10 min and then incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min for preannealing. Slides were denatured and hybridized for at least 18 h and counterstained with DAPI&#x02013;Antifade before viewing. The relative number of the transgene-DNA copies was estimated by comparison of the signal intensity from the transgenic versus the endogenous probes.</p><p>Routine genotyping of all the newborn (F1 and F2 generations mice) was performed by PCR with one of the primer sets used in the founder analysis. To differentiate between F2 homozygous and heterozygous animals, we performed FISH analysis as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Determination of the relative transgene copy number</title><p>To assay for transgene dosage, genomic DNA was extracted from F1 mice liver by standard Qiagen protocol and quantitative real-time PCR targeting two different regions along the human PAC, i.e. human-<italic>SNCA</italic> exons 2 and 6, was performed on the ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The &#x003b2;-actin gene was amplified as an endogenous reference for the quantification of the human-SNCA transgene using ABI MGB probe and primer set assay-by-demand ID Mm00607939_s1 (Applied Biosystems). The assay-by-design primers and probes sequences for SNCA exon 2 and exon 6 were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP265C29">29</xref>). TaqMan MGB probes for human SNCA exon 2, exon 6 and mouse &#x003b2;-actin were labeled with 6-FAM. PCR was carried out with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix using 10 or 50 ng genomic DNA, 900 n<sc>m</sc> primers and 250 n<sc>m</sc> probes in a total reaction volume of 20 &#x000b5;l. The reactions for the test <italic>SNCA</italic> loci and the reference &#x003b2;-actin locus were prepared and run in parallel. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min, 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s and 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min (40 cycles). Each genomic DNA sample was assayed in two different gDNA amounts (10 and 50 ng), running each amount in duplicate and the entire assay was repeated twice. The cycle in the log phase of PCR amplification at which a significant fluorescence threshold was reached (Ct) was used to quantify each exon. For each transgenic line, the dosage of PAC transgene relative to &#x003b2;<italic>-</italic>actin and normalized to control DNA was determined for each exon using the 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup> method. A value was considered as a single copy if it was within the range of 0.8&#x02013;1.2. Greater copy numbers were calculated as ratios relative to a single copy value. A standard curve was generated using gDNA 0.1, 1, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 150 ng, and a regression curve was calculated for each assay (exon 2 and exon 6). In addition, the slope of the relative efficiency plot for SNCA exons 2 and 6 and the reference control &#x003b2;-actin was determined to validate the assays (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp265/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S5</ext-link>). The transgene copy number was calculated relative to the endogenous mouse &#x003b2;-actin (<italic>Act</italic>) gene, and all copy number variations were expressed relative to having one copy number per haploid genome (ratio of 0.8&#x02013;1.2 for homozygous transgene relative to diploid mouse &#x003b2;-actin gene). The copy number of the only heterozygous &#x00394;-Rep1 transgenic line &#x02018;B&#x02019; was adjusted accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from half whole brain and whole blood (200 &#x000b5;l) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) followed by purification with RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, and the 260/280 nm ratio determined the quality of the purification. In addition, the quality of the sample and the lack of significant degradation products were confirmed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer.

In addition, the slope of the relative efficiency plot for <italic>SNCA</italic> and each internal control was determined to validate the assays. The slope in the relative efficiency plot for mouse <italic>Syp</italic> and human <italic>SNCA</italic> in brain (0.045) and for mouse <italic>Gapdh</italic> and human <italic>SNCA</italic> in blood (0.1) were the smallest, showing a standard value required for the validation of the relative quantitative method (Figs&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP265F3">3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP265F6">6</xref>A).
