Initial studies determined that A3G induces extensive mutation of nascent HIV-1 cDNA during reverse transcription. It has been proposed that this triggers the degradation of the viral DNA, but there is now mounting evidence that this mechanism may not be correct. Here, we use a natural endogenous reverse transcriptase assay to show that, in cell-free virus particles, A3G is able to inhibit HIV-1 cDNA accumulation not only in the absence of hypermutation but also without the apparent need for any target cell factors. We find that although reverse transcription initiates in the presence of A3G, elongation of the cDNA product is impeded. These data support the model that A3G reduces HIV-1 cDNA levels by inhibiting synthesis rather than by inducing degradation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>APOBEC proteins are cell-encoded factors that inhibit the replication of numerous retroviruses, such as HIV-1, and retrotransposons. In many cases, inhibition is clearly associated with cytidine-to-uridine editing of viral or transposon DNA. On the other hand, a number of studies with particular APOBEC protein/substrate combinations, or engineered proteins that are editing-deficient, have indicated that inhibitory mechanism(s) distinct from editing are also operative. Here, we have analyzed the effects of APOBEC3G, a potent HIV-1 inhibitor, on viral reverse transcription using cell-free viruses (natural endogenous reverse transcriptase assays). We report that APOBEC3G inhibits viral DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent fashion, and does not require editing capabilities to do so. Because the addition of the first nucleotide to the tRNA primer is unaffected by A3G and the magnitude of inhibition increases as later reverse transcription intermediates are measured, we suggest that APOBEC3G acts by impeding the translocation of the reverse transcriptase enzyme along its RNA template, perhaps by binding directly to the RNA. These results provide novel insight into the biological activities of this class of host anti-viral proteins.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>APOBEC3G (A3G) is a potent anti-viral polynucleotide cytidine deaminase, initially identified as the cellular target of the HIV-1 viral infectivity factor (Vif) protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Sheehy1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Since this discovery, many APOBEC proteins from various species have been shown to inhibit the replication of a diverse range of viruses and retrotransposons (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Chiu1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Malim1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> for reviews). However, the exact mechanism(s) by which APOBEC proteins elicit these effects is unresolved, enduringly controversial, and may differ among APOBEC family members.</p><p>Studies on HIV-1 have revealed that in the absence of the Vif protein, human A3G from virus-producing cells is packaged into HIV-1 particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Sheehy2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Yu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Two phenotypes are then observed when these particles infect new target cells: first, nascent viral reverse transcripts are extensively mutated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Harris1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Zhang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Most of the mutations detected are G-to-A changes in the positive sense, coding strand, implying that deamination of cytidines must occur predominantly on the negative sense strand of cDNA. This, in turn, locates A3G to the site and time of reverse transcription. The fixation of such hypermutation in proviral sequences would presumably lead to the expression of inactive or truncated viral proteins, producing non-infectious virions. The second observed phenotype is a reduction in the accumulation of viral cDNA in target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Mangeat1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Bishop1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Luo1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This could occur either by triggering degradation of reverse transcripts or by inhibiting DNA synthesis.</p><p>We, and others, initially proposed a mechanism that linked hypermutation to DNA degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Harris1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Mangeat1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically, the hypothesis was that cellular enzymes known as uracil DNA glycosylases would recognise and remove uracil in the viral cDNA leaving abasic sites. These sites would then be cleaved by cellular apurinic/apyrimidinic endonucleases resulting in the degradation of single-stranded reverse transcripts. However, recent studies have challenged this theory. Several groups have now shown that knocking out or inhibiting the cellular uracil DNA glycosylases UNG2 and SMUG1 does not rescue the defect in viral cDNA accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Kaiser1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Mbisa1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Langlois1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence to suggest that hypermutation can be dispensable for APOBEC-mediated antiviral activity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Holmes1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>). For example, various APOBEC proteins are able to inhibit MMTV, HBV, AAV or retrotransposons with little or no discernible editing activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Chen1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Turelli1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>; A3G expressed in unstimulated CD4&#x0002b; T-cells can inhibit incoming HIV-1 without inducing widespread hypermutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Chiu2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>; levels of mutations detected in HIV-1 do not correlate with the degree of viral inhibition or cDNA levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Bishop1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Langlois1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>; and finally, engineered catalytically inactive APOBEC mutants can still inhibit HIV-1, MMTV, HBV or retrotransposons in cultured cell experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Holmes2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Okeoma1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Turelli1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Bogerd2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Newman1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. In the absence of editing, therefore, what would be the trigger for viral cDNA degradation?</p><p>Alternatively, it is plausible that APOBEC proteins, which are known to bind both RNA and single stranded DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Iwatani2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Chelico1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, may be able to prevent the synthesis of cDNA by interfering with the process of reverse transcription. In this regard, various conflicting reports have suggested that A3G is able to inhibit numerous steps during HIV-1 replication, including primer tRNA annealing, minus and plus strand transfer, primer tRNA processing and removal, DNA elongation, and proviral integration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Mangeat1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Bishop1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Luo1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Guo2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Li1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. It is possible that minor blocks at any (or all) of these steps could, together, accumulate to produce the potent overall inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity. In addition, it has recently been reported that the observed block to HBV replication is not due to A3G-mediated DNA degradation, but instead due to an inhibition of HBV early minus strand DNA synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Nguyen1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Rosler1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have previously shown that A3G and A3F can elicit a pronounced block to early viral DNA accumulation and that this decrease correlates well with the block to viral infectivity although these proteins induce very different levels of hypermutation during HIV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Bishop1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Holmes2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Bishop2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore decided to employ an alternative methodology to examine the effects of APOBEC proteins on the early steps of reverse transcription more closely, namely using using viral particles isolated from cell supernatants to study natural endogenous reverse transcription (nERT). We show here that A3G-mediated inhibition of cDNA accumulation is independent of both the target cell and hypermutation. Using this assay system, we also show there is no defect in tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> priming of reverse transcription in virions. However, a small decrease in the amount of cDNA can already be observed 16 bases after the start of reverse transcription, and this reduction amplifies with distance from the tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> primer. The block to cDNA titrates with A3G concentration and can be induced by endogenous levels of A3G. Together with existing data, our results support the proposal that A3G inhibits the elongation of HIV-1 DNA by reverse transcriptase, probably by steric hindrance, rather than promoting the degradation of viral cDNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Inhibition of cDNA Accumulation Is Independent of Target Cell Type</title><p>We have previously shown that human A3G and A3F inhibit the accumulation of early (strong stop) cDNA products during HIV-1 infection of SupT1 cells (a T-cell line) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Bishop1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Holmes2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

In case the expression of endogenous A3G affected the accumulation of viral cDNA, we chose two so-called permissive T-cell lines that express little or no endogenous A3G, SupT1 and CEM-SS, and one cell line, CEM, known to express A3G and be non-permissive for HIV-1/&#x00394;<italic>vif</italic> replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Sheehy1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Bishop2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Thielen1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. PBMCs include CD4&#x0002b; T-cells, the natural targets of HIV-1 infection, which also express A3G. Cells were harvested at different times after infection and the relative amounts of HIV-1 strong stop cDNA were measured by quantitative (q)PCR.

At the peak of accumulation, the amount of cDNA from these viruses ranged from &#x0223c;2&#x02013;10&#x00025; of the level of cDNA from control viruses made in the absence of A3G. There was no significant difference between PBMCs and T-cell lines, or between permissive and non-permissive cell types, indicating the inhibition of cDNA accumulation under these experimental conditions is independent of endogenous A3G in the target cell, and can occur in a range of different T-cells.</p><fig id="ppat-1000231-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000231.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A3G inhibits HIV-1 cDNA accumulation regardless of target cell type.</title><p>Equivalent amounts of HIV-1/&#x00394;<italic>vif</italic> produced from 293T cells in the presence or absence of human A3G were used to infect SupT1, CEM-SS, CEM, or PBMC target cells.

Under these conditions, reverse transcription of the viral RNA proceeds using the natural tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> primer and virion reverse transcriptase enzyme. We carried out nERT reactions on HIV-1/&#x00394;<italic>vif</italic> produced in 293T cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of A3G, and measured the amount of strong stop cDNA present at various times after the start of the reaction by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). As seen with infections of target cells, the amount of viral cDNA increased with time in all reactions, peaking around 3 h after the addition of nucleotides. Strikingly, the amount of strong stop DNA that accumulated decreased with increasing A3G concentration. Virions made in the presence of the highest dose of A3G (1 &#x000b5;g transfected plasmid; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, purple line) only accumulated &#x0223c;5&#x00025; of the amount detected in virions made in the absence of A3G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, red line).

The decrease in cDNA accumulation also notably correlated with decreasing viral infectivity as measured in a single cycle infection of TZM &#x003b2;-gal reporter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar results were also obtained using an HIV-1 vector system (data not shown), confirming that this phenotype is not specific for the strain of HIV-1 used. Accordingly, because target cell proteins are dispensable for the A3G-mediated suppression of reverse transcript accumulation, we considered the nERT assay to be a simpler, more defined system with which to study this aspect of APOBEC protein function.</p><fig id="ppat-1000231-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000231.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>A3G inhibits HIV-1 cDNA accumulation in the absence of target cells and hypermutation.</title><p>(A) HIV-1/&#x00394;<italic>vif</italic> viruses were generated from 293T transfected with a fixed amount of proviral plasmid (3 &#x000b5;g) and increasing amounts of A3G plasmid (from 0 to 1 &#x000b5;g).

Whilst rapid degradation is still a formal possibility, we have shown that it would have to occur in the absence of hypermutation and be driven entirely by components packaged into the virion from the producer cell. The alternative explanation posits that A3G inhibits the synthesis of cDNA. This could be achieved by A3G inhibiting the annealing of the tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> primer to the primer binding site, preventing reverse transcriptase from recognising the primer and initiating reverse transcription, inducing a specific block (i.e., at a particular site) after initiation of reverse transcription but before the completion of strong stop, or by imparting a general decrease in the processivity of reverse transcriptase itself. To begin to distinguish between these possibilities, we decided to look at the initiation of reverse transcription by setting up a novel assay system.</p><p>As before, HIV-1/&#x00394;<italic>vif</italic> viruses were made in 293T cells in the presence or absence of A3G and nERT reactions were performed. In these reactions, however, the mix of dNTPs was replaced with just biotinylated dCTP: cytidine being the first base added to the tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> primer. If the tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> primer was correctly bound to the genomic RNA, and reverse transcription could be initiated, the addition of dCTP would result in the tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> primer becoming biotinylated. Total RNA from each time point was purified and an aliquot was incubated in streptavidin-coated qPCR plates. This allowed biotinylated dCMP-tRNA to bind specifically to the plate. A set of qPCR standards and an aliquot of total purified RNA for each sample was then added to the plate as controls, and a one-step quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR was performed for tRNA<sup>lys3</sup>. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g004">Figure 4A</xref>. The amount of total tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> was constant for all samples (data not shown), indicating each sample had received equal input virus and all RNA purification steps were similarly efficient. The amount of tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> in the bound samples however, increased with time from trace amounts in the control samples to substantial levels at 30 min, continuing to increase slightly to 2 h (data not shown). The ratio of biotinylated (bound) tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> to total tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> therefore also increased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), implying biotin was being efficiently added to the tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> primer during the nERT reaction. Importantly, although the presence of A3G significantly decreased viral infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), we were unable to detect any difference in the amount of tRNA biotinylation between viruses made in the presence or absence of A3G.

Initially, we attempted to visualise early reverse transcription products on polyacrylamide gels after performing nERT reactions using <sup>32</sup>P-labelled dNTPs. However, this was not sensitive enough to detect small cDNA fragments, other than strong stop DNA, even in the absence of A3G (data not shown). Therefore, to investigate the effect on cDNA elongation, we designed qPCR primers and probes for monitoring different regions within the strong stop cDNA fragment. For the purpose of this analysis, we assumed that if a product amplified, then the template sequence must reach the 5&#x02032; end of the reverse primer for each primer/probe set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

There are two ways this defect could occur; either reverse transcripts could be synthesized but then degraded before they can form integrated provirus, or there could be a block to DNA synthesis. The former mechanism was initially favoured by many since the APOBEC mediated appearance of uracils in DNA could serve as the signal for recognition by cellular DNA repair enzymes and nucleases. However, anti-viral activity is not always associated with hypermutation, (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Holmes1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>), and the enzymes responsible for recognising and removing uracils in DNA are apparently expendable for anti-viral function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Kaiser1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Mbisa1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Langlois1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

While this effect was first noted with A3G, we have shown that it is more pronounced for A3F, as non-editing A3F mutants display antiviral phenotypes that closely match the wild-type protein over a range of concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Holmes2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, since we have previously shown that the accumulation of reverse transcripts correlates well with viral infectivity, we set out to investigate this effect further.</p><p>Initially, we measured cDNA accumulation in different target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Similar results were seen in both permissive and non-permissive cell types, indicating that the presence of endogenous A3G in the target cell causes no additional inhibition, even in activated PBMCs. Moreover, this implied either that any target cell factors involved in diminishing cDNA accumulation are present in all cell types studied or that these effects do not require any target cell factors. To examine this, we established a natural endogenous reverse transcription (nERT) assay and found that the extent of inhibition was highly reminiscent of that seen in target cell infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), revealing that no target cell factors are necessary for the block to cDNA accumulation. Whilst this does not refute a degradative mechanism for cDNA turnover, it does eliminate proteasomal degradation and implies that any endo- or exonucleases involved must be copurified or packaged into viral particles. As cDNA levels were also reduced by deaminase deficient APOBEC variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), an alternative trigger for degradation other than uracils in DNA would be necessary. Theoretically, A3G could cause the specific packaging of an as yet unidentified nuclease responsible for degrading nascent reverse transcripts. However, there is no direct evidence in the literature for A3G-induced degradation and, as we expand upon below, this is not our preferred explanation.</p><p>The fact that the block to cDNA accumulation can be detected in nERT reactions allowed us to investigate this process in ways that are not possible in cells, but resemble HIV-1 infections more closely than reconstitution studies using purified components. For instance, we were able to monitor the initiation of reverse transcription in virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Recently, the Kleiman group have reported that both A3G and A3F prevent tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> primer annealing <italic>in vitro</italic> via an interaction with nucleocapsid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Guo1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Guo2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Yang1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

By using a novel variation of the nERT assay to study reverse transcription initiation in viral particles, we have shown that A3G does not affect the addition of a biotinylated dCTP first base to the tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> primer. We acknowledge that some reverse transcription may have initiated prior to incubation with biotinylated dCTP, but as we detect more than a two log increase in biotinylation after 30 min, we assert that this represents significant initiation in our experiment.</p><p>Although there was no block to the initiation of reverse transcription, we could detect a significant reduction in the level of strong stop cDNA in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and nERT reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g005">5</xref>) in the presence of A3G. This indicates either that there is an early block to reverse transcription or that cDNA is degraded very rapidly. To address whether reverse transcription was inhibited at a particular position or whether elongation was progressively impeded, we designed new qPCR primer/probe sets to measure reverse transcripts shorter than the 137 nucleotide standard strong stop product. The amounts of cDNA detected in the presence of A3G decreased with increasing distance from the tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> primer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), from an &#x0223c;20&#x00025; reduction in cDNA reaching 16 bases to an &#x0223c;35&#x00025; decrease at 36 bases and an &#x0223c;85&#x00025; decrease at 137 bases. Some variation was seen between independent virus preparations (indicated by individual points) most likely reflecting minor differences in A3G expression and packaging. From these data, it therefore appears that there is no single abrupt point of termination to reverse transcription.</p><p>The results of our study are in complete agreement with a recent report from Iwatani et al. who show that purified recombinant A3G is able to inhibit the elongation of exogenous cDNA by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Iwatani1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

The difference in the magnitude of the early effect between different groups has been attributed to differences in A3G expression levels, and we concur with this view since we show clearly that both the levels of early cDNA accumulation and infectivity titrate down with ascending A3G concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>).</p><p>Whilst the levels of endogenous A3G expression and viral incorporation were low in CEM cells, the effect on early cDNA accumulation was consistent with that seen with exogenous A3G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g003">3</xref>). We note, however, that the relative deficit in infectivity imparted by APOBEC proteins in CEM cells is greater than anticipated on the bases of the nERT assay. Unfortunately, we found the efficiency of strand transfer and second strand synthesis to be very low in nERT reactions, and therefore it was not possible to use this system to investigate the effect on later steps in reverse transcription with any degree of quantification or certainty (data not shown). Possible underlying reasons are discussed above, and are a subject for future investigations. Importantly, a mode of action that involves direct binding of A3G to viral RNA would be expected to be sensitive to A3G concentration: if A3G can bind to multiple regions of the RNA genome with equal preference, then the probability of binding to a region within R or U5, and therefore blocking strong stop cDNA synthesis, would increase with A3G concentration. Theoretically, a single molecule of A3G may be all that would be required to inhibit the synthesis of a full length reverse transcript, such that even low levels of endogenous A3G would be sufficient to prevent viral infection.</p><p>Based on recent findings, we suggest that the relative contribution of editing and non-editing effects to the antiviral phenotype of A3G may depend upon its circumstances. If the inhibition of cDNA synthesis is inefficient, the resulting nascent transcripts may still be inactivated via hypermutation and loss of genetic integrity, and the production of such mutated viral sequences has been well documented in both cultured cells and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Mariani1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Harris1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Zhang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Bishop2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Lecossier1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Vartanian1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the editing capability of endogenous A3G in cultured T-cells appears to be reduced compared to A3G produced in 293T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Thielen1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, viral cDNAs recovered from PBMCs infected with HIV-1/&#x00394;<italic>vif</italic> harbour lower levels of G-to-A mutations compared to cDNAs from H9 cells infected with HIV-1/&#x00394;<italic>vif</italic>, both in terms of the number of clones carrying mutations and the number of mutations per clone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Knoepfel1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. This might suggest a lesser role for hypermutation <italic>in vivo</italic>, although this issue requires further investigation. Nevertheless, the capacity to suppress HIV-1 infection via dual mechanisms presumably serves to enhance the potency of this class of antiviral proteins.</p><p>Recently, two groups have shown that HIV-1/&#x00394;<italic>vif</italic> can replicate in stable cell lines expressing deaminase-defective A3G mutants but not wild-type A3G <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Miyagi1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Schumacher1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. They have interpreted these results as proving that deamination is essential for A3G activity. We suggest that such observations should be interpreted with caution as we have shown that the A3G E259Q mutant also has a substantially reduced ability to inhibit cDNA accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000231-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Holmes2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>). An alternative explanation for these findings is that disruption of the deaminase motif of A3G also affects an attribute necessary for inhibiting reverse transcription; since the C-terminal deaminase domain of A3G must engage nucleic acids for the purpose of editing, one possibility is that this defect could be in RNA binding. At present, it is unclear what effects such mutations have on the protein structure and function.</p><p>In this study, we have shown that A3G-mediated inhibition of cDNA accumulation occurs independent of both the target cell and hypermutation. Although there is no defect in tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> priming of reverse transcription, a small decrease in the amount of cDNA can already be observed at 16 bases, and this reduction increases with distance from the tRNA<sup>lys3</sup> primer. These data bolster the argument against a degradative mechanism being responsible for the decreases in viral cDNA that are observed in the presence of A3G, and support the proposal that A3G inhibits the elongation of nascent HIV-1 cDNA by steric hindrance of reverse transcriptase through direct binding to viral genomic RNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid Constructs</title><p>All APOBEC proteins were expressed from pcDNA3.1 as previously described; for WT human A3G <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Sheehy1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, A3G E259Q <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Newman1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, WT A3F and A3F E251Q <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000231-Holmes2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.
