Regulation of these contractile fibers is critical for cell adhesion and motility. The microfilaments within stress fibers are held together by specialized bundling proteins, such as myosin and &#x003b1;-actinin, which can interact simultaneously with two actin filaments. These classical actin-bundling proteins have been studied extensively leading to a basic understanding of their interaction with actin filaments and regulation of stress fibers. One important discovery was the periodic and alternating association of myosin and &#x003b1;-actinin which is clearly visualized as a beaded pattern along stress fibers in cells stained for immunofluoresence microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although it is not understood how this alternating association of myosin and &#x003b1;-actinin with the microfilaments is regulated, it is critical for the contractility of the stress fiber. In addition to myosin and &#x003b1;-actinin, actin stress fibers are decorated with numerous other proteins, associated either directly or through interaction with other actin-binding proteins. Determining the function of these ancillary proteins is important for understanding the regulation of stress fibers.</p><p>Modulation of the actin cytoskeleton by LIM domain proteins is an active and growing field of research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. LIM domains are cysteine-rich sequences of 50&#x02013;60 amino acid residues that contain two tandem zinc fingers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Several LIM proteins have been demonstrated to interact with and/or regulate &#x003b1;-actinin. Vallenius et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] have reported that reversion-induced LIM (RIL) protein associates with &#x003b1;-actinin increasing its binding to actin filaments <italic>in vitro </italic>and may alter actin stress fibers in various cell types. Four and a half LIM domain protein 3 (FHL3) has been demonstrated to disrupt actin stress fibers in C2C12 myoblasts presumably by binding to actin filaments and inhibiting &#x003b1;-actinin bundling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, ENH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], ALP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], Cypher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], CLIM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], CLP-36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], zyxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and the cysteine-rich protein (CRP) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] have also been demonstrated to interact with &#x003b1;-actinin, although it is not clear if these proteins influence &#x003b1;-actinin function.</p><p>The CRP family, which includes CRP1, CRP2, CRP3, and the thymus LIM protein (TLP), is a subgroup of LIM domain proteins containing two LIM domains linked to short glycine-rich repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. CRPs are highly conserved between species with CRP1 from human, chicken, and quail having an amino acid sequence identity greater than 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although the CRPs have different patterns of expression, evidence suggests that they are functionally similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. CRPs are important for cell differentiation presumably by modulating protein-protein interactions involved in transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Outside of the nucleus, CRPs clearly localize to focal adhesions and the actin cytoskeleton, and have been postulated to play a role in controlling these structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>CRP1, CRP2, and CRP3, have all been shown to bind &#x003b1;-actinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Interaction between the two proteins was first reported for CRP1 using affinity chromatography, solution and solid-phase binding assays, and co-immunoprecipitation from cell lysates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A follow up study demonstrated that &#x003b1;-actinin could interact equally with CRP1, CRP2, and CRP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, it was determined that the CRPs were interacting with the actin-binding domain of &#x003b1;-actinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and the &#x003b1;-actinin-binding site was mapped to amino acid residues 62&#x02013;79 of human CRP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Based on the binding assays and co-localization within the cell, it was proposed that the interaction of CRP with &#x003b1;-actinin was responsible, in part, for its localization to the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Recently, Grubinger and Gimona [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] demonstrated that CRP2 binds directly to actin filaments and suggested that CRP2 does not interact with &#x003b1;-actinin. We have found that there are two populations of CRP1 associated with actin stress fibers, one interacting with &#x003b1;-actinin and one that appears to interact directly with the actin filaments. Although, CRPs have been shown to bind to &#x003b1;-actinin and actin filaments, it is not clear how these proteins regulate the actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we show that CRP1 regulates actin filament bundling by directly cross-linking actin filaments and stabilizing the interaction of &#x003b1;-actinin with actin filament bundles.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of CRP1 increases F-actin bundling in REFs</title><p>To determine the influence of CRP1 on the actin cytoskeleton, rat embryonic fibroblasts (REFs) were transfected with increasing concentrations of DNA encoding CFP-CRP1 resulting in increasing levels of expression of the fluorescent fusion protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Expression of CFP-CRP1 was observed in approximately 15% of the cells with levels ranging from 2&#x02013;4 fold that of endogenous CRP1 (data not shown). Consistent with immunostaining for endogenous CRP1 (see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) and previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], CFP-CRP1 was localized diffusely in the cytoplasm, along the actin cytoskeleton, and in the nucleus of some cells (~10%). These results suggest that the CFP tag does not significantly affect the function of the CRP1 protein. Although the morphology of the REFs was unaffected, expression of CFP-CRP1 appeared to increase the bundling of actin microfilaments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, see arrows). If the expression of CFP-CRP1 was resulting in increased actin filament bundling, then CFP-CRP1 would be expected to redistribute to the Triton X-100 insoluble cytoskeletal fraction. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, insoluble CFP-CRP1 increased with expression. In addition, an immunoreactive band migrating below CFP-CRP1 was recognized, presumably a proteolytic fragment. The distribution of actin and &#x003b1;-actinin in the Triton X-100 soluble and insoluble fractions were also examined. However, with a transfection efficiency of only 15%, a significant change in the insolubility of actin and &#x003b1;-actinin was not detected (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of CRP1 increases the bundling of cellular actin filaments</bold>.

In order to test this hypothesis, &#x003b1;-actinin bundling activity was examined in the absence and presence of CRP1. For these experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), actin filament bundling was determined using a sedimentation assay with 2.5 &#x003bc;M &#x003b1;-actinin alone, 2.5 &#x003bc;M CRP1 alone, 1.25 &#x003bc;M &#x003b1;-actinin + 1.25 &#x003bc;M CRP1 (2.5 &#x003bc;M total protein), and 2.5 &#x003bc;M &#x003b1;-actinin + 2.5 &#x003bc;M CRP1 (5.0 &#x003bc;M total protein). Although, CRP1 did not appear to influence the bundling activity of &#x003b1;-actinin, we did find that when CRP1 was added to &#x003b1;-actinin bundled actin filaments, a 2-fold increase in &#x003b1;-actinin was observed in the bundles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These results suggest that CRP1 was stabilizing the interaction of &#x003b1;-actinin with the actin filaments in the bundles.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>CRP1 does not influence the bundling activity of &#x003b1;-actinin</bold>. &#x003b1;-Actinin and CRP1 were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature.

To confirm that CRP1 was bundling the actin filaments, the bundling assay was carried out on glass coverslips and the proteins fixed with 3% formaldehyde followed by staining with rhodamine-phalloidin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C&#x02013;F</xref>).

Since the above results demonstrated that CRP1 could directly bind to and bundle actin filaments, we asked if CRP1 was actually binding to &#x003b1;-actinin along actin stress fibers within the cell. REFs were co-transfected with DNA encoding CFP-CRP1 and YFP-&#x003b1;-actinin. As in previous experiments, approximately 15% of the cells expressed the tagged proteins with greater than 90% of these cells expressing both proteins. In cells fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS using standard protocols, YFP-actinin was observed in its classical beaded pattern along actin stress fibers and within focal adhesions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). CFP-CRP1 was also observed in focal adhesions and along actin stress fibers; however localization along the stress fibers was continuous and not beaded like that of &#x003b1;-actinin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Cells were also fixed with 3% formaldehyde in Triton X-100 buffer in order to remove the soluble cytoplasmic proteins and proteins weakly associated with the cytoskeleton. Using this fixation protocol, CFP-CRP1 was observed to co-localize explicitly with YFP-&#x003b1;-actinin along actin stress fibers and in focal adhesions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Scatter plots are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> to represent localization of the two proteins in the images. For the unextracted cell, the distribution of fluorescence intensity for the two tags is diffuse as a result of the areas in the cell where the two proteins are not co-localized, with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.4. For the extracted cell, the co-localized populations of the two proteins are represented by the characteristic comet shaped scatter plot with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.7.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Two populations of CRP1 are localized along stress fibers</bold>.

An established method for determining the interaction between two localized proteins in a cell involves fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy. In these experiments, we followed the method for photobleaching FRET (pbFRET) described by Karpova et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] using REFs co-expressing CFP-CRP1 (donor) and YFP-&#x003b1;-actinin (acceptor). For this method, the FRET efficiency is determined by measuring the dequenching of the donor emission after selective photobleaching of the acceptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In cells fixed with 3% formaldehyde in Triton X-100 buffer, we consistently observed an increase in CFP emission along actin stress fibers following photobleaching of the YFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A&#x02013;D</xref>). As a control, the CFP emission on a similar region which was not photobleached was also measured. The histogram in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref> shows that the distributions of the FRET efficiencies for the photobleached regions (E<sub>f</sub>) was shifted positively compared to the unbleached control regions (E<sub>c</sub>) with the mean E<sub>f </sub>significantly different from the control E<sub>c </sub>(9.6 &#x000b1; 0.74 vs. 2.9 &#x000b1; 0.61, p &#x0003c; 0.05).

Previously, we have shown that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates the relocation of &#x003b1;-actinin to membrane ruffles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

Recent studies have shown that the nuclear population of CRPs mediates protein-protein interactions regulating transcription and differentiation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although CRPs have been found to bind to &#x003b1;-actinin, zyxin, and actin filaments, little is known about how CRPs regulate the actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we examined the regulation of actin filaments by CRP1 <italic>in vitro </italic>and in cultured cells.</p><p>Expression of CRP1 in fibroblasts resulted in increased actin filament bundling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In addition, we found that CRP1 directly binds to and bundles actin filaments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). CRP2 has recently been reported to bind actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; however, this is the first study to show that any CRP can bundle actin filaments.</p><p>After observing an increase in actin filament bundling in the cells expressing CFP-CRP1, we expected to find that CRP1 was enhancing the bundling activity of &#x003b1;-actinin. However, <italic>in vitro </italic>bundling studies clearly demonstrated that CRP1 had no influence on the ability of &#x003b1;-actinin to bundle actin filaments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Furthermore, these results showed that CRP1 and &#x003b1;-actinin do not compete for binding to actin filaments and therefore must bind at different sites. Interestingly, approximately twice as much CRP1 protein pellets with the actin filament bundles compared to &#x003b1;-actinin. The significance of these findings is not clear, but may reflect differences in the mechanisms by which CRP1 and &#x003b1;-actinin bind and bundle actin filaments. Further studies are necessary to determine how CRP1 is bundling actin filaments.</p><p>Although &#x003b1;-actinin had previously been demonstrated to bind and presumably localize CRP1 to actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the new evidence that CRP1 could directly bind and bundle actin filaments prompted further investigation. Detergent extraction of cells has long been used to improve examination of the cytoskeleton. Previously, we demonstrated that Triton X-100 extraction removes soluble cytoplasmic proteins leaving behind an intact cytoskeleton with associated adhesion and matrix proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Extraction with Triton X-100 has also been used to separate and define adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins based on stable association with the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Triton X-100 extraction of fibroblasts co-expressing CFP-CRP1 and YFP-&#x003b1;-actinin allowed us to differentiate two populations of CRP1 along actin stress fibers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The Triton X-100 resistant population of CRP1 co-localized with &#x003b1;-actinin along stress fibers, whereas the less stable Triton X-100 susceptible population appeared to represent CRP1 which was directly associated with actin filaments. Furthermore, confocal microscopy demonstrated that CFP-CRP1 and YFP-&#x003b1;-actinin were in close enough proximity for FRET between the CFP and YFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Since the tags need to be within ~50&#x000c5; for efficient FRET to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], the results indicate that CRP1 and &#x003b1;-actinin are bound to each other along actin stress fibers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Evidence from this and other studies suggests that the different populations of CRP1 mediate protein-protein interactions unique to each cellular compartment. Nuclear CRP1 regulates interactions between transcription factors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Cytoplasmic CRP1 modulates the actin cytoskeleton by two mechanisms: 1) stabilizing &#x003b1;-actinin interaction with actin bundles and 2) cross-linking actin filaments. Further studies are needed to determine how the different populations of CRP1 coordinate to modulate the function of the cell.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Proteins and DNA constructs</title><p>&#x003b1;-Actinin was purified from chicken gizzard as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Non-muscle actin (99% pure; 80% &#x003b2;-actin, 20% &#x003b3;-actin) was polymerized following the manufacturer's protocol (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO). The plasmid containing chicken CRP1 cloned into the EcoRI site of pBlueScript II KS (pBSIIKS, Stratagene) was generously provided by Mary C. Beckerle (Univ. of Utah) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The EcoRI insert of CRP1-pBSIIKS was sub-cloned into the enhanced cyan fluorescent fusion protein vector pECFP-C1 (BD Biosciences) and the BamHI-HindIII insert sub-cloned into pProEx HTb (Invitrogen). Nucleotide sequences were confirmed by sequence analysis. His-tagged CRP1 protein was expressed in BL21 bacteria and purified using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) following procedures described by the manufacturer. The his tag was cleaved from CRP1 while still bound to the resin using recombinant TEV protease (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The untagged CRP1 protein was concentrated and buffer-exchanged (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) in a centrifugal filter device (Amicon). YFP-&#x003b1;-actinin was constructed by subcloning the &#x003b1;-actinin gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] into the HindIII restriction site of the enhanced yellow fluorescent fusion protein vector pEYFP-N1 (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec><title>F-actin bundling assays</title><p>The bundling of F-actin was determined by sedimentation assays as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

Briefly, 50 &#x003bc;l of assay solution was incubated on a glass coverslip inside a 12-well tissue culture dish. After 30 min, the proteins were fixed by adding 3% formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline for an additional 30 min. Coverslips were then stained and processed for microscopy as described previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and fluorescence microscopy</title><p>Rat embryonic fibroblasts (REFs) were cultured as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Cells were transfected with pECFP-CRP1 and pEYFP-&#x003b1;-actinin using FuGENE 6 (Roche) following manufacturer's protocols. The expression curve of CFP-CRP1 was carried out by varying the ratio of FuGENE to DNA in a final volume of 100 &#x003bc;L serum-free media. The transfection conditions were: 6 &#x003bc;L FuGENE, no DNA; 3 &#x003bc;L FuGENE, 0.5 &#x003bc;g DNA; 3 &#x003bc;L FuGENE, 1.0 &#x003bc;g DNA; 6 &#x003bc;L FuGENE, 1.0 &#x003bc;g DNA; and 6 &#x003bc;L FuGENE, 2.0 &#x003bc;g DNA. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were prepared for fluorescence microscopy or scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% NP-40, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 1 &#x003bc;g/ml leupeptin, and 1 &#x003bc;g/ml aprotinin) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 &#x000d7; g for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C, protein from the supernatant and pellet separated by electrophoresis, and immunoblotted with anti-GFP (Santa Cruz), anti-&#x003b1;-actinin (Chemicon), or anti-actin (Sigma). Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminence (Pierce) and quantified using a KODAK ImageStation 440CF. For fluorescence microscopy, cells were fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 3% formaldehyde (Tousimis) in PBS or in Triton X-100 buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM EDTA, 100 &#x003bc;M Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 &#x003bc;g/mL leupeptin, 1 &#x003bc;g/mL aprotinin, and 0.5 % Triton X-100). Digital images were captured using a Zeiss axiovert 100S microscope equipped with a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera controlled by MetaMorph software. Co-localization studies were carried out using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. The scatter plots and correlation coefficients were determined using Zeiss Physiology Software v3.2.</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy</title><p>REFs were co-transfected with pECFP-CRP1 and pEYFP-&#x003b1;-actinin, cultured for an additional 24 hrs, fixed using 3% formaldehyde in Triton X-100 buffer, and prepared for confocal microscopy as described above. The FRET assays were carried out following the procedure described by Karpova et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Briefly, cells were imaged with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope operated by Zeiss Physiology Software v3.2 using a 63 &#x000d7; 1.3 NA Zeiss oil immersion lens. The microscopy system was configured in multitracking mode to excite the CFP with a 458 nm and YFP with a 514 nm laser line. A region of interest (ROI) containing actin stress fibers was selected for photobleaching. Using the time series function, 5 images of the cell were collected followed by selective photobleaching of the YFP within the ROI with the 514 nm laser line (typically, 150 iterations at 100% laser power was sufficient), and then the collection of 5 additional images. The FRET efficiency was calculated as a percentage using the following formula E = 100 &#x000d7; (I<sub>postbleach </sub>&#x02013; I<sub>prebleach</sub>)/I<sub>prebleach</sub>, where I is the intensity of CFP fluorescence within the ROI. As a control, ROIs were selected from non-bleached regions of the cell.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>The abbreviations used are: RIL, reversion-induced LIM; FHL3, Four and a half LIM domain protein 3; ENH, enigma homologue protein; ALP, actinin-associated LIM protein; CLIM, 36kDa carboxyl terminal LIM domain protein; CRP, cysteine-rich protein; F-actin, filamentous actin; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; REFs, rat embryonic fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TCT carried out the cell and molecular studies.
