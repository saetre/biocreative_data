Nevertheless, additional activities may contribute to the tumour suppressor role of p16<sup>INK4a </sup>and could help explain its specific association with melanoma predisposition.

We found evidence that BRG1 is not required for p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-induced cell cycle inhibition and propose that the p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-BRG1 complex regulates BRG1 chromatin remodelling activity. Importantly, we found frequent loss of BRG1 expression in primary and metastatic melanomas, implicating this novel p16<sup>INK4a </sup>binding partner as an important tumour suppressor in melanoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This data adds to the increasing evidence implicating the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex in tumour development and the association of p16<sup>INK4a </sup>with chromatin remodelling highlights potentially new functions that may be important in melanoma predisposition and chemoresistance.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p16<sup>INK4a </sup>is frequently inactivated in human cancers and is a highly penetrant melanoma susceptibility gene; more than 50 germline mutations have been identified in high-risk melanoma-prone families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The principal function of p16<sup>INK4a </sup>is to inhibit cell cycle progression by preventing the cyclin dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 from phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein, pRb. In the presence of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, pRb remains hypophosphorylated and forms active pRb-E2F transcriptional repressor complexes that silence genes required for S-phase entry. Consequently, ectopic expression of p16<sup>INK4a </sup>promotes pRb-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest and senescence. Moreover, functional p16<sup>INK4a </sup>is commonly maintained in pRb-deficient tumors (reviewed by Sherr &#x00026; Roberts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]), and this underscores the dependency of p16<sup>INK4a </sup>on the pRb pathway.</p><p>Hypophosphorylated pRb can repress gene transcription at least partly by remodelling chromatin structure through its interactions with proteins such as HDAC1, BRM and BRG1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As the catalytic core of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex, the interaction between BRG1 and pRb was proposed to recruit the complex to E2F responsive promoters and enhance pRb transcriptional repressor activity. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] There is also evidence that BRG1 acts upstream of pRb by repressing cyclin D1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and upregulating the expression of the CDK inhibitors p21<sup>Waf1</sup>, p15<sup>INK4b </sup>and p16<sup>INK4a </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] to maintain pRb in an active, hypophosphorylated state. Not surprisingly, BRG1 may function as a tumor suppressor; BRG1 hemizygous mice are susceptible to tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], while complete loss of BRG1 potentiates lung cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and BRG1 is silenced or mutated in human tumor cell lines derived from breast, ovarian, lung, brain and colon cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. BRG1 is also lost in established neuroendocrine carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the cervix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and the loss of BRG1 expression in lung cancer is associated with a poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In this study, it is identified for the first time that BRG1 specifically associates with p16<sup>INK4a </sup><italic>in vivo</italic>, and that both proteins are frequently lost in human melanomas. Although both BRG1 and p16<sup>INK4a </sup>regulate pRb activity we found no evidence that p16<sup>INK4a </sup>and BRG1 co-operate in cell cycle regulation. Targeted silencing of BRG1 did not diminish pRb-dependent p16<sup>INK4a </sup>activities; p16<sup>INK4a </sup>retained potent cell cycle inhibitory activity and induced senescence in the presence and absence of BRG1. Contrary to previous reports, that BRG1-deficient cells are relatively resistant to p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-induced cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], we show that pRb activity is BRG1-independent and thus, BRG1 does not influence p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-mediated cell cycle inhibition. Together with the frequent loss in primary melanomas the novel BRG1 interaction with the melanoma associated tumor suppressor p16<sup>INK4a </sup>implies an important role for BRG1 in melanoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>BRG1 binds p16<sup>INK4a</sup></title><p>From a yeast two-hybrid screen using full-length human p16<sup>INK4a </sup>as bait, we isolated the C-terminal 530 amino acids of the chromatin remodelling factor BRG1 as a potential binding partner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This segment of BRG1 incorporates the ATPase domain, which facilitates ATP hydrolysis, and the bromodomain, which enables binding to acetylated histones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. To confirm that full-length BRG1 also binds p16<sup>INK4a </sup>in human cells, both proteins were co-expressed transiently in U2OS osteosarcoma cells and MYC-tagged p16<sup>INK4a </sup>was specifically co-purified with FLAG-tagged BRG1 in immunoprecipitation assays using a FLAG-specific antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

As expected, neither p16<sup>INK4a </sup>alone nor p16<sup>INK4a </sup>in combination with BRG1 promoted cell cycle arrest in cells deficient for pRb (SAOS-2 and C33A). In contrast, introduction of p16<sup>INK4a </sup>induced potent cell cycle arrest in all cell lines expressing pRb (U2OS, H1299, HCT116, SW-13) even when the cells lacked BRG1 (H1299) or carried a reported mutant form of BRG1 (HCT116) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

We investigated the role of BRG1 in p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-induced senescence. The long term induction of p16<sup>INK4a </sup>in WMM1175_p16<sup>INK4a </sup>cells was not influenced by the BRG1 status, caused pRb hypophosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) and induced senescence-like features in the WMM1175 cells as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). These features included increased cell size and granularity, positive senescence-associated &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity and the appearance of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. Formation of foci coincides with the recruitment of pRb to E2F-responsive promoters and is associated with the stable repression of E2F-target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].

We have now shown that the chromatin remodelling factor BRG1 is a novel binding partner of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>and confirm this interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>. More importantly, we show that loss of BRG1 occurs frequently in primary and metastatic melanomas and propose that BRG1 may play an important role as a tumor suppressor in this cancer.</p><p>We have also shown that p16<sup>INK4a </sup>requires pRb, but not BRG1 to promote cell cycle arrest. This differs from several previous findings in the literature but agrees with others: It has been suggested that the pRb-BRG1 interaction is required for the pRb repression of E2F-target genes such as cyclin E and cyclin A, and thereby cell cycle arrest. According to this hypothesis, cells lacking BRG1 would harbor only inactive pRb, thus conferring resistance to p16<sup>INK4a </sup>induced growth arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These findings differ from those of Bultman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] who did not observe a functional interaction between pRB and BRG1 in their murine models and Kang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], who showed that the BRG1-pRB interaction was not required for BRG1 induced cell cycle arrest in SW-13 cells. In contrast to our work, Kang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] used long-term BRG1 expression, which caused growth arrest in SW-13 cells, and showed that BRG1 bound the p21Waf1 promoter and upregulated its expression 3&#x02013;7 days after BRG1 expression. This was sufficient to induce cell cycle arrest and senescence independent of the BRG1 ability to complex with pRb. In this study we have clearly demonstrated that p16<sup>INK4a </sup>requires pRb, but not BRG1, to promote cell cycle arrest. Our data is mainly based on the thorough analysis of a well-defined melanoma cell model, with inducible physiological relevant expression levels of p16<sup>INK4a </sup>and the use of highly specific BRG1-silencing molecules. In this model, p16<sup>INK4a </sup>induction promotes rapid G1-cell cycle arrest followed by cellular senescence, and these functions were not affected by silencing of BRG1.</p><p>Chromatin changes, which involve chromatin remodelling, are an important step in p16<sup>INK4</sup>/pRb dependent senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It was recently shown that the BRG1 homologue, BRM, forms an initiating component of heterochromatin complexes during the senescence of melanocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. BRG1 has also been implicated in senescence of melanocytes, as it has been identified in the SWI/SNF complex facilitating transcription in response to IGFBP7, the latter itself being an important player in oncogenic BRAF-induced senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, our data show that p16<sup>INK4a </sup>is able to promote senescence in WMM1175 melanoma cells in the absence of BRG1 indicating that the p16<sup>INK4a</sup>/pRb senescence pathway does not require BRG1.</p><p>As the catalytic component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex, BRG1 facilitates unwinding of DNA helices bound to and wrapped around histone structures. The SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex can be recruited by specific DNA binding molecules such as transcriptional activators or repressors and directed to specific DNA targets. For instance, BRG1 promotes p53 dependent transcription by interacting with this tumor suppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], while it functions as a co-repressor of E2F dependent transcription by associating with the E2F transcriptional repressor pRb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, BRG1 has recently been reported to promote transcriptional activity of the melanocyte specific transcription factor MITF-M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. MITF-M plays an important role in melanocyte proliferation and survival (reviewed by Goding) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and activates the expression of p16<sup>INK4a </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It is possible that the p16<sup>INK4a </sup>interaction with BRG1 modulates any one or more of these functions. For example it is tempting to speculate that p16<sup>INK4a </sup>influences MITF-M transcriptional activity via its association with BRG1. This would create an important feedback loop between MITF-M and p16<sup>INK4a</sup>. We are currently investigating the impact of p16<sup>INK4a </sup>on these BRG1 specific chromatin remodelling functions.</p><p>Regardless of the function of the BRG1-p16<sup>INK4a </sup>complex, it is evident that BRG1 expression can be lost relatively early in melanoma development, with a significant proportion (&#x0003e; 70%) of primary melanomas showing no detectable BRG1 expression, while BRM expression was usually maintained in these tumors (&#x0003c; 20% loss). Overall, the rate of BRG1 loss was high in melanomas and comparable to that of p16<sup>INK4a </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], which suggests that selection against BRG1 expression arises relatively early in melanoma genesis. The fact that, additionally to the frequent loss of either tumor suppressor, a high proportion of melanomas show loss of both proteins correlates with our data showing BRG1-independence of the p16<sup>INK4a </sup>cell cycle regulatory functions and this suggests BRG1 independent and dependent functions of p16<sup>INK4a</sup>. BRG1 is proposed to be an important modulator of chromatin in melanocytic cells. In particular, BRG1 promotes transcriptional activity of the melanocyte specific transcription factor MITF-M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], reduction of BRG1 expression in zebrafish embryos leads to a reduction in neural crest derived cells including melanocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and thirdly we found BRG1 expression in normal, primary human melanocytes. Therefore we propose that BRG1 is a vital melanoma associated tumour suppressor, which is frequently lost in the initial stages of the disease.</p><p>The identification of BRG1 as a potential tumor suppressor in melanoma adds to the increasing evidence implicating the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex in tumor development. BRG1 mutations have been identified in small cell lung carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and loss of BRG1 expression or mislocalisation of BRG1 to the cytoplasm has been associated with poor prognosis in this malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Another study showed that 71% of neuroendocrine carcinomas of the cervix had lost BRG1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and BRG1 has been implicated in breast cancer through its role in estrogen receptor dependent transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], its interaction with the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and because BRG1 haploinsufficient mice are prone to mammary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Furthermore, BRG1 is often lost or mutated in various tumor cell lines including cells derived from pancreatic, ovarian, lung, brain and colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In primary melanoma, the chromosomal region of BRG1 (19p13.2) is not deleted at high frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], nevertheless, translocations in this chromosomal region have been associated with the disease in three cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified BRG1 as a novel binding partner of the tumor suppressor p16<sup>INK4a </sup>and confirmed this interaction in normal cells.
