They act as membrane-bound molecular switches cycling between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form. Rab proteins function through a set of effector proteins to which they bind in their active form. Through their effectors, Rab GTPases regulate actin and microtubule-dependent transport, vesicle budding and tethering, and membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ng and Tang, 2008</xref>). Because Rab GTPases can bind to multiple effectors, they are able to regulate and integrate different trafficking events. Through sequential interactions of a Rab GTPase with different downstream effectors, directionality and proofreading can be achieved during membrane transport. The activity of Rab GTPases is temporally and spatially controlled through the action of guanine exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fukuda, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Rab GTPases are prime candidates to regulate synaptic activity as they have been shown to control both endo- and exocytosis events at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Star et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, a recent proteomic analysis of highly purified synaptic vesicles (SVs) revealed that a large set of other Rab GTPases can be copurified with SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that multiple Rabs might be needed for correct SV trafficking and regulated release.</p><p>To find new Rab members involved in neuronal membrane trafficking, we analyzed the expression pattern of all Rab GTPases in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. In agreement with previous studies, we found that UNC-108, the highly conserved RAB-2 homologue in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, shows a very strong neuronal expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mangahas et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting a neuronal function. Although recent studies have focused on the role of UNC-108/RAB-2 in the removal of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mangahas et al., 2008</xref>) and glutamate receptor trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chun et al., 2008</xref>), the precise neuronal defect impairing locomotion was not investigated.</p><p>Rab2 has been shown to localize to the pre-Golgi vesicular tubular compartment and to be required for vesicular transport between the ER and the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tisdale and Balch, 1996</xref>). Subsequently, active Rab2 was shown to also bind to Golgi matrix proteins and Golgi-localized coiled-coil proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Short et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sinka et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, a more general function of Rab2 for Golgi trafficking was proposed. Therefore, it is surprising that <italic>C. elegans unc-108/rab-2</italic> mutants exhibit very specific locomotion defects more indicative of altered signaling at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).</p><p>We report in this study that the locomotory defects of <italic>unc-108/rab-2</italic> mutants result, at least in part, from altered dense core vesicle (DCV) signaling in neurons as the result of defects during DCV biogenesis. RAB-2 activity is specifically required for the retention of cargo in DCVs during maturation, preventing its removal to endosomal compartments. We further identify RIC-19, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of the human diabetes autoantigen ICA69, as a key RAB-2 effector for DCV maturation in neuronal cell somas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>UNC-108/RAB-2 mutations differentially affect protein function and stability</title><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, UNC-108/RAB-2 is ubiquitously expressed but shows the strongest expression in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chun et al., 2008</xref>). The <italic>unc-108</italic> gene is defined by both dominant and recessive alleles, which all display similar locomotory defects. The two dominant <italic>unc-108</italic> alleles, <italic>n501</italic> (D122N) and <italic>n777</italic> (S149F), carry missense mutations within the conserved domains G2 and G3, respectively, which are required for binding of the guanine moiety of GTP or GDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simmer et al., 2003</xref>). Recessive alleles of <italic>unc-108</italic> contain either missense mutations <italic>ce363</italic> (C213S) and <italic>ce365</italic> (I11F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mangahas et al., 2008</xref>) or a deletion <italic>nu415</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chun et al., 2008</xref>). The <italic>nu415</italic> deletion serves as null allele, as it removes the C terminus and is not detectable on Western blots. All other mutant RAB-2 proteins could be detected in mixed staged worm extracts by Western blotting using polyclonal mouse antibodies developed against <italic>C. elegans</italic> RAB-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). However, the protein levels of RAB-2(<italic>ce365</italic>)I11F were slightly reduced, and the amount of RAB-2(<italic>n777</italic>)S149F protein was strongly reduced by &#x0223c;80% compared with wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). Because all mutant RAB-2 proteins were detectable in vivo, it is unlikely that differences in protein levels could account for the functional defects observed.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>UNC-108 is a homologue of human Rab2.</bold> (A) Sequence alignment of Rab2 from <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, and <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

As a control, we used the RAB-2 mutants S20N (impaired in nucleotide exchange and reduced affinity for GTP) and Q65L (dominantly active because of a lack of GTPase activity but not GTP binding; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tisdale, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spinosa et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Both dominant RAB-2 mutations S149F (<italic>n777</italic>) and D122N (<italic>n501</italic>) affected two loops that coordinate the guanine nucleotide; therefore, it is likely that GTP binding was affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Although both mutations led to an increase in the affinity for GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), only the <italic>n501</italic> mutation prevented the hydrolysis of GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Thus, the D122N (<italic>n501</italic>) mutant RAB-2 behaves similar to the constitutively active Q65L mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). Therefore, RAB-2 <italic>n777</italic> and <italic>n501</italic> can be considered constitutively active. Thus, biochemically, <italic>n777</italic> and <italic>n501</italic> can be clearly distinguished from the recessive loss-of-function mutation I11F (<italic>ce365</italic>), which displayed wild type&#x02013;like GTP affinity and hydrolysis rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>RAB-2 mutations change the biochemical properties of the protein.</bold> (A) Rab2 structure with guanine-binding domain labeled in yellow.

Impaired locomotion suggests defects in synaptic transmission at NMJs. Therefore, we tested the cholinergic signaling at NMJs by assaying the response of the dominant <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants to the acetylcholine (ACh) esterase inhibitor aldicarb. Aldicarb prevents the removal of ACh from the synaptic cleft by inhibiting ACh esterase, leading to chronic stimulation of the postsynaptic receptors, resulting in paralysis of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miller et al., 1996</xref>). <italic>n777</italic> and <italic>n501</italic> mutants display a reduced sensitivity to aldicarb as compared with wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). The aldicarb resistance of <italic>n777</italic> and <italic>n501</italic> is comparable with that of <italic>rab-3</italic> mutants, which have been shown to have defects in SV tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gracheva et al., 2008</xref>). To test whether the reduced sensitivity to aldicarb is caused by a functional impairment of the postsynaptic site, we directly activated postsynaptic ACh receptors by applying levamisole. The anthelmintic drug levamisole is an agonist for levamisole-sensitive ACh receptors, leading to paralysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Richmond and Jorgensen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gally et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants displayed a wild type&#x02013;like sensitivity to increasing concentrations of levamisole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>) and were clearly distinguishable from the levamisole resistance of <italic>lev-10</italic> mutants, which lack clustered levamisole receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gally et al., 2004</xref>). We conclude that postsynaptic levamisole-sensitive receptors are largely unaffected by the dominant <italic>unc-108</italic> mutations. To directly test whether dominant <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants exhibit altered synaptic transmission, evoked responses were obtained from the NMJ of dissected worms. The mean amplitude of evoked release was not significantly different from wild type in either <italic>n777</italic> or <italic>n501</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). From these data, we conclude that changes in cholinergic signaling are unlikely to account for the sluggish locomotion and aldicarb resistance of the dominant <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>unc-108</italic> mutants have reduced locomotion and aldicarb sensitivity but not SV release at the NMJ.</bold> (A) The locomotory defects of <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants are synthetically enhanced in <italic>unc-108; egl-3</italic> double mutants to the level of <italic>unc-31/CAPS</italic>.

Furthermore, by analyzing the accumulation of synaptobrevin-GFP (SNB-1&#x02013;GFP)&#x02013;labeled SVs, we showed that the synapse number, shape, and spacing of cholinergic motor neurons projecting axons into the dorsal cord were also comparable with wild type (Fig. S2 B). Therefore, it is unlikely that the behavioral defects in the dominant <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants are caused by defects in motor neuron development or synapse formation.</p><p>To exclude ultrastructural changes at the synapse of <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants, we studied the morphology of presynaptic terminals by high pressure freeze (HPF) EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rostaing et al., 2004</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, the ultrastructure of the active zone as well as the size of SVs were similar to wild type for both the dominant and the recessive <italic>unc-108</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Differences in the distribution of SVs relative to the presynaptic density can also lead to reduced SV exocytosis and thus aldicarb resistance, as seen in <italic>rab-3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gracheva et al., 2008</xref>). An HPF EM analysis of the SV distribution in motor neurons of <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants revealed that the number and distribution of SVs were similar to wild type and clearly distinguishable from <italic>rab-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>; and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). In addition, a precise analysis of the SV distribution directly at the presynaptic density, distinguishing between SVs at the density versus SVs at the membrane, also revealed no differences between <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants and wild type (unpublished data). Furthermore, the mean synaptic area of cholinergic motor neurons as well as the size of SVs were also not affected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).

In addition to SVs, DCVs are secreted from motor neurons. Defects in DCV release, like in the <italic>unc-31</italic>/CAPS mutant, can also lead to slow locomotion similar to <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gracheva et al., 2007</xref>). To analyze DCVs in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants, we used a strain stably expressing a fusion protein between the neuropeptide NLP-21 precursor fused to YFP (NLP-21&#x02013;YFP) in cholinergic motor neurons. It has been previously demonstrated that NLP-21&#x02013;YFP-derived fusion proteins are packaged into DCVs, transported to axons, and released into the body cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sieburth et al., 2007</xref>). Once secreted, NLP-21&#x02013;derived YFP is subsequently endocytosed by six scavenger cells, the coelomocytes, in the body cavity. Thus, the level of YFP fluorescence taken up by coelomocytes can be a direct measure for the amount of YFP fusion protein released.</p><p>In both dominant <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants, the YFP intensity in axons was strongly reduced by 65 &#x000b1; 4% (<italic>n777</italic>) and 80 &#x000b1; 2% (<italic>n501</italic>) as compared with wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). We obtained similar results using the <italic>unc-108(nu415)</italic> null mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). The reduction of NLP-21&#x02013;YFP fluorescence in axons can be rescued by expression of RAB-2 specifically in cholinergic DA motor neurons (unpublished data). Furthermore, the decreased cargo levels in axons are not restricted to NLP-21&#x02013;YFP because tagging FLP-3 or atrial natriuretic factor neuropeptides results in similarly reduced YFP levels in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutant axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edwards et al., 2009</xref>). To test whether the tagged neuropeptide cargo is properly secreted in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants, we measured the intensity of the YFP fluorescence internalized by the coelomocytes and found that it was also decreased by 62 &#x000b1; 7% for <italic>n777</italic> and 76 &#x000b1; 2% for <italic>n501</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Because neither <italic>unc-108</italic> gain-of-function mutation affected the uptake of soluble secreted GFP by coelomocytes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902096/DC1">Fig. S5</ext-link>), the coelomocyte fluorescence intensity could be used as an accurate readout for DCV exocytosis. Because in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants the NLP-21&#x02013;derived YFP taken up by the coelomocytes is reduced to the same levels as the YFP content in axonal DCVs, we conclude that DCV exocytosis by itself is largely unaffected in <italic>unc-108/rab-2</italic> mutants.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>unc-108</italic> mutant DCVs contain less soluble cargo.</bold> (A) Animals carrying integrated array <italic>nuIs183</italic> are expressing NLP-21&#x02013;YFP in motor neurons projecting axons into the DNC.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed synaptic DCV number in motor neurons by HPF EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). For the dominant alleles, the number of DCVs at the synapse was similar to wild type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>), and their distribution was unaffected (not depicted). This suggests that the decrease of axonal NLP-21&#x02013;YFP fluorescence is specifically caused by DCVs containing less NLP-21&#x02013;derived YFP, which would be consistent with less YFP being secreted from motor neurons.</p><p>The loss-of-function alleles exhibited mild but variable reductions of DCVs number per synaptic profile, as analyzed by EM, ranging from 40% in <italic>ce363</italic> to 15% in <italic>nu415</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). However, importantly, the measured reduction of DCVs in the <italic>nu415</italic> null allele was not statistically significant when compared with wild type. However, the mean diameter of the DCVs in some of the loss- and gain-of-function alleles was slightly, but significantly, increased (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). This strongly points to an involvement of RAB-2 in DCV maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>RAB-2 localizes to the Golgi apparatus but not to synapses</title><p>To understand how RAB-2 affects DCV biogenesis or maturation, we studied its subcellular localization. N-terminally fused monomeric YFP (mYFP)&#x02013; or mCherry&#x02013;RAB-2 localized to discrete cytoplasmic puncta in cell bodies of motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). The localization of RAB-2 fusion proteins overlapped with general Golgi markers such as &#x003b1;&#x02013;mannosidase II or COPI vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). However, RAB-2 did not colocalize with makers of the ER (cytochrome b5) or early endosomes (FYVE domain of EEA-1). We also wanted to confirm the localization by analyzing the endogenous RAB-2 protein. For this purpose, we generated monoclonal antibodies against <italic>C. elegans</italic> RAB-2 and localized the endogenous RAB-2 in motor neurons on HPF immuno-EM thin plastic sections. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>, RAB-2 is broadly localized to the Golgi complex with some preference for the early Golgi cisternae. While analyzing 14 neuronal Golgi complexes, we found, on average, 3.3 &#x000b1; 0.9 immunogold labels on the cis side, 1.8 &#x000b1; 0.5 within the medial Golgi, and 1.1 &#x000b1; 0.4 on the trans side. However, some RAB-2 immunogold labeling was also seen on vesicular structures surrounding the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902096/DC1">Fig. S3 E</ext-link>). This RAB-2 staining was specific because it was absent in the <italic>nu415</italic> deletion mutant (Fig. S3 F). Immunogold staining was also detectable on vesicular structures in axons; however, no specific RAB-2 staining was detected on SVs or DCVs or directly at the active zone (unpublished data). Similarly, mCherry&#x02013;RAB-2 was not detected at synapses of motor neurons projecting axons into the dorsal nerve cord (DNC) or at the synapses between the hermaphrodite-specific neuron (HSN) and vulva muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). Therefore, the localization data suggest that RAB-2 functions in neuronal cell somas, including membrane compartments at and around the Golgi and in axons. However, RAB-2 is not required to maintain the structural integrity of the Golgi because the morphology of Golgi complexes in dominant or recessive <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants appeared normal when compared with wild type using HPF EM (Fig. S3, A&#x02013;D).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>RAB-2 localizes to the Golgi apparatus and is not present at the synapses.</bold> (A) Confocal images of motor neuron cell bodies expressing fluorescently tagged RAB-2 along with different intracellular markers are shown.

Neuropeptides are packaged into DCVs at the Golgi as precursors along with their processing enzymes, furin type of proprotein convertases, carboxypeptidases, and amidation enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Husson et al., 2007b</xref>). After cleavage from their precursor, neuropeptides are concentrated and aggregated within maturing DCVs. Moreover, the vesicles must be properly acidified to activate the processing enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morvan and Tooze, 2008</xref>). To investigate neuropeptide processing, we analyzed neuropeptide content in three independent protein extracts, from wild type and <italic>unc-108(n777)</italic> and <italic>(n501)</italic> mutants, by high performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). It has been shown that neuropeptide processing defects can clearly be distinguished by this method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Husson et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2007a</xref>). As shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902096/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>, all detectable neuropeptides are correctly and fully processed in the dominant <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants, including neuropeptide-like protein (NLP)&#x02013;type neuropeptides, as well as the C-terminally modified FMRFamide-like peptides (FLPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, the processing of neuropeptides is not defective in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants. The MALDI-TOF MS method used to analyze and detect neuropeptide in protein extracts from <italic>C. elegans</italic> is not quantitative and therefore allows only qualitative conclusions.</p><p>To test whether mutations in RAB-2 affect neuropeptide levels, we analyzed double mutants of <italic>unc-108/rab-2</italic> with <italic>egl-3</italic>, a proprotein convertase required for proteolytically liberating neuropeptides from their precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kass et al., 2001</xref>). In the absence of EGL-3 activity, no active neuropeptides were detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Husson et al., 2006</xref>). If <italic>egl-3</italic> and <italic>unc-108</italic> are involved in the same pathway required for neuropeptides, an <italic>egl-3; unc-108</italic> double mutant should display the same phenotype as <italic>egl-3</italic> single mutants. However, <italic>egl-3; unc-108</italic> double mutants showed a strong enhancement of the locomotory defects, reducing locomotion to the level of an <italic>unc-31</italic>/CAPS mutant, which is defective in DCV release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Both dominant and recessive <italic>unc-108</italic> alleles showed the same strong synthetic interaction with <italic>egl-3</italic>. This suggests that <italic>unc-108</italic> and <italic>egl-3</italic> act in parallel pathways for DCV signaling. Thus, it is unlikely that <italic>unc-108</italic> mutations strongly affect neuropeptide signaling, which is in agreement with our MALDI-TOF MS analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>RAB-2 mutations affect DCV maturation</title><p>DCVs are generated at the late Golgi, most likely within the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morvan and Tooze, 2008</xref>). Neuropeptide precursors, processing enzymes, and accessory proteins needed for DCV exocytosis have to be sorted into transport vesicles that subsequently bud off the Golgi apparatus. However, during the sorting and packaging process, constitutive secretory cargo, lysosomal enzymes, and other membrane proteins are copackaged into DCV precursors, forming immature DCV (iDCVs). To become fully functional, this inappropriate cargo has to be removed by clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking and delivered to the endosomal system. This remodeling allows for iDCV maturation into a mature DCV (mDCV).</p><p>In <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants, this process is likely to be perturbed. Indeed, although the number of DCVs did not change in dominant <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants, the DCVs contained less NLP-21&#x02013;YFP-derived cargo. One possibility is that after the processing of the NLP-21&#x02013;YFP fusion protein, the soluble YFP is less efficiently retained in iDCV and is sorted to the endosomal system during maturation. Therefore, one would expect to see aberrant NLP-21&#x02013;YFP accumulation in the cell bodies of <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 (C and D)</xref>, the neuronal cell bodies of <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants contained mostly large NLP-21&#x02013;YFP-positive vesicular structures, as opposed to the small vesicles seen in wild type. These structures often reached sizes &#x0003e;0.8 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>, which were never observed in wild-type neuronal cell bodies. To determine the identity of these NLP-21&#x02013;YFP-positive vesicular structures, we tested their colocalization with various subcellular markers. In wild-type neuronal cell bodies of the ventral nerve cord (VNC), most of the NLP-21&#x02013;YFP overlapped with RAB-2 and the early endosomal marker RAB-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Almost no overlap was seen with the late endosomal marker RAB-7 or the lysosomal marker LMP-1. This suggests that most of the NLP-21&#x02013;derived YFP accumulated at the Golgi and early endosomes.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold>In <italic>unc-108</italic>, NLP-21&#x02013;YFP enters the late endosomal compartment.</bold> (A and B) To identify NLP-21&#x02013;YFP-positive vesicular structures in wild type (A) and <italic>unc-108(n501)</italic> strains (B) carrying the NLP-21&#x02013;YFP integrated array, different intracellular markers were expressed panneuronally: RAB-2, syn-6 (iDCVs), RAB-5 (early endosome), RAB-7 (late endosome), and LMP-1 (lysosome).

Accordingly, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, dominant and recessive <italic>unc-108/rab-2</italic> mutants display locomotory defects, which are indicative of changes in signaling at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park and Horvitz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simmer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mangahas et al., 2008</xref>). However, only the recessive loss-of-function alleles are also defective in the removal of apoptotic cells and fluid phase endocytosis in the intestine and coelomocytes as well as glutamate receptor trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mangahas et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests that RAB-2 might be involved in several cellular processes with specific requirements for different levels of RAB-2 activity.</p><p>We show that the dominant RAB-2 mutations <italic>(n501)</italic> D122N and <italic>(n777)</italic> S149F, positioned in the conserved G2 and G3 domains that stabilize GTP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Paduch et al., 2001</xref>), biochemically behave like the engineered dominant-active GTP-bound RAB-2(Q65L) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tisdale, 1999</xref>).

Thus, the dominant <italic>rab-2</italic> alleles might still supply enough RAB-2 function for endocytotic trafficking and engulfment events and might therefore be best suited to study the neuronal defects.</p></sec><sec><title>RAB-2 affects locomotion through the regulation of DCV signaling</title><p>An extensive HPF EM analysis showed that the synaptic morphology as well as the SV and DCV number and distribution at the NMJ are unaltered in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). We further demonstrated that mutations in RAB-2 specifically affect the maturation but not the release of DCVs. Because <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants have impaired retention of soluble and transmembrane cargo during DCV maturation, a reasonable hypothesis is that neuropeptide function is impaired in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants, and this may cause the locomotory defect. However, this seems unlikely for several reasons. First, the DCV maturation defect in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants does not affect the aggregated neuropeptide core of the vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Second, the levels of native, processed FMRFamide neuropeptides in the axons of <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants are normal based on antibody staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edwards et al., 2009</xref>). This is in agreement with a MALDI-TOF MS analysis that showed that neuropeptide processing is not affected in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants (Table S1). This suggests that functional and processing-competent DCVs are generated. Third, knocking out peptide processing by inactivation of the proprotein convertase EGL-3 in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants causes a strong synthetic enhancement of the locomotory defect indistinguishable from <italic>unc-31</italic>/CAPS null mutants, which lack DCV release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). This strongly suggests that most, if not all, neuropeptide function remains intact in <italic>unc-108</italic> null mutants. Therefore, it seems likely that neuropeptides, once aggregated within DCVs, are retained and protected from loss in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants.</p><p>Therefore, the DCV maturation defect in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants may affect a DCV function unrelated to neuropeptides. One possibility is that RAB-2 affects the sorting of G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors (GPCRs) and/or their accessory proteins needed for GPCR function and specificity into DCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bermak and Zhou, 2001</xref>). Interestingly, expression of dominant Rab2(Q65L) in cell culture and siRNA-mediated down-regulation of Rab2 have been shown to both inhibit cell surface expression and signaling of &#x003b1;,&#x003b2;-adrenergic and angiotensin II type 1 GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dong and Wu, 2007</xref>). Indeed, the DCV maturation defect in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants is not restricted to soluble proteins, as the DCV-specific transmembrane protein IDA-1/IA-2 is also affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edwards et al., 2009</xref>). Another candidate for the missing factor would include soluble neurotrophins or growth factors secreted via the regulated secretory pathway.</p><p>Thus, in addition to neuropeptides yet unidentified, GPCRs or growth factors could be cotransported and released from DCVs. Because of the DCV maturation defects in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants, one or more of these factors may be lost or excluded from <italic>unc-108</italic> DCVs. Thus, we propose that the lack of DCV cargo caused by mistrafficking during DCV maturation results in signaling defects at the NMJ, leading to reduced locomotion.</p></sec><sec><title>Molecular function of RAB-2 during DCV maturation</title><p>Rab2 has been shown to regulate vesicular transport and sorting at the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chavrier et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tisdale and Balch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tisdale and Jackson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tisdale, 1999</xref>). Consistently, we were not able to detect RAB-2 at synapses but found it abundantly localized at neuronal Golgi complexes and on vesicular structures surrounding the Golgi and in axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Thus, RAB-2 may affect trafficking events that originate at the Golgi or the closely associated endosomal system. DCVs are generated at the late Golgi, most likely within the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tooze et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morvan and Tooze, 2008</xref>). Here, neuropeptide precursors, processing enzymes, and accessory proteins needed for DCV exocytosis have to be sorted into transport containers that subsequently bud off the Golgi. Our findings that, in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants, the number of synaptic DCVs as well as the processing of neuropeptides are not affected make it unlikely that RAB-2 is required for the initial generation of iDCV. The fact that, in some recessive alleles, the DCV diameter is more variable and slightly enlarged suggests that RAB-2 might rather affect the fidelity of DCV maturation. In all <italic>unc-108</italic> alleles, we observed DCV cargo NLP-21&#x02013;YFP to colocalize more strongly with late endosomal and lysosomal markers as compared with wild-type neurons, suggesting that DCV cargo is inappropriately lost from maturing DCVs. Accordingly, the axonal NLP-21&#x02013;YFP fluorescence intensity could be rescued by blocking early endosomal function through expression of the GTP-bound RAB-5(Q78L) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). This strongly suggests that Rab2 is required to retain specific cargo during DCV maturation.</p><p>In addition to proneuropeptides and associated processing enzymes, constitutive secretory cargo, lysosomal enzymes, and other membrane proteins are also copackaged into DCV precursors, forming iDCV budding off the Golgi. To become fully functional, this inappropriate cargo has to be removed from iDCVs by clathrin-mediated remodeling to allow maturation into mDCVs. This proofreading mechanism is important to ensure the generation of mDCVs that contain biologically active neuropeptides and undergo productive membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tooze et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morvan and Tooze, 2008</xref>). In particular, after exit from the Golgi apparatus, iDCVs have been reported to undergo syn-6&#x02013;dependent homotypic fusions to form a functionally distinct compartment from the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wendler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morvan and Tooze, 2008</xref>). Later on, syn-6 must be removed from iDCVs because it is no longer detectable on mDCVs. The cargo that is removed from the iDCV compartment by clathrin-coated vesicles is sorted to endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morvan and Tooze, 2008</xref>). We propose that in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants, this sorting step is affected such that cargo that would normally stay in maturing DCVs, such as soluble cargo-like growth factors or yet unidentified GPCRs, are lost to the endosomal system.</p><p>Acidification has also been shown to be important for retention of cargo and processed neuropeptides in maturing iDCVs. Neutralization of acidic compartments causes missorting of mDCV cargo and subsequent secretion from the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moore et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, a recessive <italic>unc-108</italic> mutation has been demonstrated to be defective in the acidification of the phagosomal lumen, resulting in engulfment defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mangahas et al., 2008</xref>). However, because proprotein convertases are only active under acidic pH conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morvan and Tooze, 2008</xref>), severe defects in the acidification of iDCV would also lead to neuropeptide processing defects, which are not observed in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutations (Table S1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edwards et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we favor a model in which RAB-2 stabilizes membrane domains required for the retention of cargo in maturing DCVs.</p><p>Interestingly, Rab2, has recently been shown to bind to multiple Golgi-localized coiled-coil proteins (Golgins) and Golgi matrix proteins in a GTP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Short et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burguete et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sinka et al., 2008</xref>). Golgins mark the identity of specific Golgi regions, whereas Golgi matrix proteins are required to maintain the structural integrity of the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Panic et al., 2003</xref>). The interactions of activated Rab2 with multiple Golgins might confer retention of Rab2-labeled membrane domains in close proximity to the Golgi stack and prevent their diffusion to the cell periphery or endosomes. This local enrichment might also promote homotypic membrane fusion and rearrangement events necessary for efficient maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tooze et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, Rab2 could also help to orchestrate a dynamic network of functional interactions required for efficient maturation of DCVs. Because Rab2 is the most highly conserved Rab GTPase, its function for DCV maturation is likely to be conserved throughout evolution.</p></sec><sec><title>RAB-2 cooperates with its effector RIC-19 during DCV maturation</title><p>Once activated, Rab GTPases recruit effector molecules to target membranes.

Like ICA69, RIC-19 localizes to the Golgi but not to vesicles (mDCVs or SVs) at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spitzenberger et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, RIC-19/ICA69 is recruited to the Golgi by activated Rab2 through direct interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spitzenberger et al., 2003</xref>). The involvement of ICA69 in DCV maturation is also supported by the fact that ICA69 partially colocalizes with immature secretory granules but dissociates from secretory granule membranes during further maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spitzenberger et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistically, ICA69/RIC-19 might create or stabilize membrane domains on iDCVs during maturation through its BAR (Bim/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain, which is known to recognize curved membranes found on vesicles and tubular carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Habermann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zimmerberg and McLaughlin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallop and McMahon, 2005</xref>). Several BAR domain&#x02013;containing homo- and heterodimeric proteins have also been shown to interact with Rab GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Habermann, 2004</xref>). The membrane domains generated by ICA69/RIC-19 together with RAB-2 might be necessary to retain specific cargo in iDCVs and prevent their missorting to the endosomal pathway. Although our data strongly suggest that RIC-19 and RAB-2 act together, we find different requirements for RAB-2 and RIC-19 during DCV maturation. Whereas in <italic>unc-108</italic> mutants the size of DCVs is slightly increased and more variable, it is similar to wild type in <italic>ric-19</italic> mutants. This suggests that Rab2 might have additional functions during DCV maturation. Alternatively, RIC-19 might still be able to associate with iDCV membranes in the absence of RAB-2 via its BAR domain in a curvature-dependent mechanism or through electrostatic interactions with the lipid bilayer. The interaction with RAB-2 might then be specifically required to stabilize these membrane domains to make them productive for sorting and the retention of cargo.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains</title><p>If not otherwise stated, strains were grown at 20&#x000b0;C as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brenner, 1974</xref>).
