The choice of this cell line was dictated by two considerations; first of all, a transformed line is a tool that can be kept and used by several teams; second, JEG-3 cells are considered as a good model for trophoblasts, and have been used in numerous studies on this topic. Interestingly, JEG-3 cultures release human chorionic gonadotrophin, human placental lactogen, progesterone, and are able to transform steroid precursors into estrone and estradiol. They have been profusely used to investigate molecular aspects of trophoblast function.</p><p>Nine stable clones expressing STOX1 were obtained, with overexpressions ranging from 2 to 30 fold, as shown by qRT-PCR. Total RNA was prepared from the AA6 cell line (overexpressing STOX1 30 times) and the BD3 cell line (stably transfected with the empty pCMX vector). mRNAs were used as templates to label cDNA that was hybridized to Affymetrix arrays (u133 2.0) encompassing 53,000 human transcripts. The results have been deposited as a GEO dataset, with the accession number GSE13475. Among the 53,000 transcripts, 22,980 were expressed at a sufficient level to allow their detection and analysis.

This proportion was highly significant compared to other families of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003905-t001">Table 1</xref>), and associated with an excess of induced transcripts.

(B) Comparison of the expression levels of the microarray and of the qRT-PCR results for the same series of 13 genes. For AA6, the cell line from which the cDNA hybridized on the microarrays was obtained, the correlation is excellent (R&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.944). For the second line AB1, overexpressing STOX1 at a milder level, the correlation is also very good (R&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.829). In this case, the overall expression is nevertheless lower as shown by the linear regression. This suggests that at least in some cases, the deregulations induced by STOX1 overexpression are somehow proportional to this overexpression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0003905.g002"/></fig><p>Next, we analyzed systematically the promoter composition of transcription factors whose expression is affected by STOX1 using Genomatix (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genomatix.de">www.genomatix.de</ext-link>). We contrasted the group formed by induced (55 promoters) and repressed (39 promoters) transcription factors with non-modified genes (49 promoters) by a Student t-test (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003905.s001">Table S1</xref>). For binding sites present on average more than once in each promoter, the forkhead binding site (V&#x00024;FKHD) was the most significant (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0044) after V&#x00024;BRNF, a binding site for POU transcription factors (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0022). This observation is consistent with the idea that STOX1 belongs to the enlarged FOX family. We then performed ChIP experiments (four independent experiments) followed by qPCR using primers from the promoters of genes strongly induced by <italic>STOX1</italic> overexpression and enriched in FKHD binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003905-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Thirteen different promoters corresponding to the 8 genes <italic>COL6A3</italic>, <italic>S100A4</italic>, <italic>TMEM45a</italic>, <italic>ARRDC3</italic>, <italic>TNFSF10</italic>, <italic>ALOX5</italic>, <italic>EBI3</italic> and <italic>PLCB1</italic> (induced 28-, 19-, 15-, 15-, 9-, 13-, 12-, and 11 fold, respectively), were recovered using the Genomatix Gene2Promoter function. For several genes, multiple putative promoters were identified by the program (up to 4 for <italic>ARRDC3</italic>) and primers surrounding the putative forkhead binding sites were designed. Among the thirteen putative promoters, seven were significantly enriched after chromatin IP and corresponded to 6 genes out of 8. In the case of <italic>ARRDC3</italic>, only one promoter was significantly enriched by immunoprecipitation. This approach confirmed that <italic>STOX1</italic> binds the promoter of these genes as a transcription factor involved in their regulation.</p><fig id="pone-0003905-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003905.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Thirteen promoters encompassing putative binding sites for Forkhead containing transcription factors were quantified by qPCR after Chromatin Immunoprecipitation, using a novel anti-STOX1 polyclonal antibody.</title><p>For several genes alternative putative promoters were identified by Genomatix, and only some of the promoters appeared enriched.

Among these few studies, only one to the best of our knowledge was deposited as accessible GEO Profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003905-Nishizawa1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. We extracted the 500 genes that were the most different between normal and preeclamptic placentas from this study.

These values enabled us to show very significant differences between the expected proportions of induced or repressed genes if the distribution was random (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003905.s003">Table S3</xref>). The data were also analyzed by a linear regression approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003905-g004">Figure 4</xref>). To achieve this, the induction ratio of the 265 genes found to be transcriptionnally modified in the preeclampsia study of Nishizawa and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003905-Nishizawa1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, were plotted against the ratio of induction/down-regulation of the same genes in the JEG-3 cells overexpressing <italic>STOX1</italic>. Strikingly, the correlation applied between genes whose expression is affected by STOX1 and preeclampsia-modified genes was highly significant (r&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.295, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9.8 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003905-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

Interestingly, among the modified genes, we found i) hCG (induced 2.25 fold for CGA and 3.23 fold for CGB, the hCG-specific polypeptide), one of the well-known overexpressed genes in preeclamptic placentas, ii) endoglin (induced 2.23 fold), which is the earliest serum marker observed as induced by preeclampsia in patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003905-Venkatesha1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, iii) ERVW1 (syncitin, induced 2.03-fold), an endo-retrovirus known to be crucial for the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003905-Dupressoir1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as iv) GCM1 (decreased 3.4-fold), known as the most specific transcription factor for trophoblast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003905-Rinkenberger1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, and specifically down-regulated in preeclamptic placentas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003905-Chen1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, overexpression of STOX1 stimulates EBI3 (&#x000d7;12.0-fold), an interleukin&#x02013;12 p40 expressed at very high level by syncytiotrophoblasts and extra villous trophoblasts throughout human pregnancy, and involved in implantation. It is presented by HLA-G, suggesting that it is an immunomodulator, possibly involved in NK cell regulation able to modulate proliferation and migration processes &#x0005b;16; 17&#x0005d;</p><p>Similar to other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003905-Berends1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003905-Kivinen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> challenging the role of STOX1 in preeclampsia, we sequenced 20 patients and 20 controls but could not find any association with the Y153H polymorphism described in the first study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003905-vanDijk1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, neither find any transcriptional effects differentiating normal and pathological placentas (data not shown). We hypothesize that the reported polymorphism is in linkage disequilibrium with the true causal mutation. It is interesting to notice that STOX1 in mice and humans contains a very long first intron (&#x0223c;50 kb), which has not been sequenced, and could contain elements regulating the mRNA splicing, shown to be important for STOX1 sub-cellular localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003905-vanDijk1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the transcription level did not vary between normal and pathological placentas, our results suggest that STOX1 is involved in very early events of placental development, which could not be addressed by analyzing term or near-term placentas. Another problem reported by Iglesias-Plata is the non-imprinted status of STOX1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003905-IglesiasPlatas1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, a close examination of their sequencing data suggests that there could be a quantitative difference in allelic expression in fetal and placental tissues. This could be explained by cell-type heterogeneity of its imprinted status in the placenta. Although they also show that the first CpG island located in the first exon is unmethylated, other distant regulatory regions could be altered as reported for the IGF2/H19 system.</p><p>Caution is warranted when extrapolating results obtained in a cellular model to the general trophoblast population. However, JEG-3 cells constitute an interesting and reliable model of trophoblast function, as suggested by ancient and recent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003905-AlNasiry1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The results of the present study, substantiate this idea, since the main result is a strong and significant correlation between a specific alteration of the JEG-3 transcriptome and preeclampsia-induced transcriptional modifications in the placenta. Clearly, while this correlation is highly significant, the rest of the variability could be explained by the action of other pathways involved in preeclampsia, as well as by modifications of other cell types present in the placental villi. In this context in vitro transformation of cytotrophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblast, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003905-Kliman1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003905-Mondon1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> seem to show a specific and exclusive expression of <italic>STOX1</italic> in the former (Rigourd et al, in preparation). It would mean that the syncytialisation process abruptly inactivates the expression of STOX1, the underlying mechanisms remaining elusive. Since hypoxia, or more generally brutal variation in oxygen pressure, are considered as major actors of preeclampsia pathogenesis &#x0005b;23; 10; 24&#x0005d;, it was interesting to match the microarray result with HIF1&#x003b1; induction. However, HIF1&#x003b1; was not at all modified at the transcriptional level by <italic>STOX1</italic> overexpression. This does not disqualify an effect on the stabilization of the HIF1&#x003b1; protein, which could then participate in the gene induction effects. Also, using cDNA from placental explants put in hypoxia, we could not see any induction of <italic>STOX1</italic> expression (data not shown). Hypoxia-induced genes were nevertheless found elevated in preeclampsia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003905-Vaiman1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and were significantly correlated with gene-induction in the JEG-3 cells overexpressing <italic>STOX1</italic> (present study). Therefore, the link between hypoxia and <italic>STOX1</italic> exists, but probably in a subtle form. In conclusion, our study indicates that STOX1 deserves further investigation for its role in the aetiology of preeclampsia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Patients and ethics</title><p>All the placentas from the patients were collected from four Parisian maternities (Cochin, St Antoine, Institut de Pu&#x000e9;riculture and St Vincent de Paul).
