Sit4 and the Sap proteins are ubiquitously conserved and their human orthologs, PP6 and three PP6R proteins, share significant sequence identity with their yeast counterparts. However, relatively little is known about the functions of the PP6 and PP6R proteins in mammalian cells. Here we demonstrate that the human PP6R proteins physically interact with Sit4 when expressed in yeast cells. Remarkably, expression of PP6R2 and PP6R3 but not expression of PP6R1 rescues the growth defect and rapamycin hypersensitivity of yeast cells lacking all four Saps, and these effects require Sit4. Moreover, PP6R2 and PP6R3 enhance cyclin G<sub>1</sub> gene expression and DNA synthesis, and partially abrogate the G<sub>1</sub> cell cycle delay and the budding defect of the yeast quadruple <italic>sap</italic> mutant strain. In contrast, the human PP6R proteins only modestly support nitrogen catabolite gene expression and are unable to restore normal levels of eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation in the quadruple <italic>sap</italic> mutant strain. These results illustrate that the human PP6-associated proteins are capable of providing distinct rapamycin-sensitive and Sit4-dependent Sap functions in the heterologous context of the yeast cell. We hypothesize that the human Saps may play analogous roles in mTORC1-PP6 signaling events in metazoans.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein dephosphorylation is an essential enzymatic activity through which cell signaling in response to diverse cues is processed and cellular events evoked by protein phosphorylation are mechanistically reversed.

Based on amino acid sequence identity and functional analysis, the four Saps can be classified into two distinct subgroups: Sap185 and Sap190 are more similar to each other than to Sap155 and Sap4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006331-Luke1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Also Sap185 and Sap190 share similar functions not shared with Sap155 and Sap4. Thus, Sap185 and Sap190 function together with Sit4 to provide an essential role in the absence of Bem2 (most likely in regulating the Pkc1-cell integrity pathway), and are required for eIF2&#x003b1; dephosphorylation and to render yeast cells sensitive to the toxin zymocin (produced by <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006331-Rohde1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006331-Torres1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006331-Luke1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006331-Jablonowski1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, based on these criteria Sap4 is less functionally effective than the other three Saps and, similar to cells lacking the four Saps, cells expressing only Sap4 (<italic>sap155 sap185 sap190</italic> triple mutant cells) grow poorly, show defects in NCR gene expression, and are hypersensitive to rapamycin and resistant to zymocin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006331-DiComo1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006331-Rohde1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006331-Jablonowski1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

While the observed PP6R interaction with Sit4 is robust in cells devoid of Sap proteins, this interaction is reduced for PP6R2 and PP6R3 in yeast cells expressing the endogenous Sap155 and Sap4, supporting earlier results that the Sap155-Sit4 interaction is quite stable and not subject to competition from the other yeast Saps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006331-Luke1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

The growth improvement afforded by the PP6R2 and PP6R3 proteins in the quadruple <italic>sap</italic> mutant is correlated with a decrease in the fraction of cells with a 1N DNA content and concomitant increase in cells with 2N DNA content, and more efficient budding. Furthermore, PP6R3 expression is able to enhance bud emergence and <italic>CLN1</italic> expression, and increase DNA synthesis upon growth resumption of G<sub>1</sub>-synchronized quadruple <italic>sap</italic> mutant cells.

Thus, the precise mechanisms by which the human PP6Rs abrogate the rapamycin hypersensitivy of the yeast quadruple <italic>sap</italic> mutant do not involve these TORC1 functions. However, rapamycin exposure of cells devoid of Sap function might impose a G<sub>1</sub> block by more than one mechanism and an attractive model is that the PP6Rs ability to support <italic>CLN1</italic> expression in G<sub>1</sub> and DNA synthesis promotes G<sub>1</sub> to S phase cell cycle progression by directly relieving one of these blocks.</p><p>Our results show that PP6R1 differs from PP6R2 and PP6R3, and fails to overcome the growth and budding defects and the rapamycin hypersensitivity observed in the quadruple <italic>sap</italic> yeast mutant.
