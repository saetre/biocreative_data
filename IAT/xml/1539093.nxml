The macula is the central part of the retina (the film-like membrane at the back of the eye), which is the most sensitive and important for sharp central vision. There are two types of advanced AMD: so-called wet, or neovascular, AMD (neovascular means &#x0201c;new vessel&#x0201d;) and dry, or geographic atrophy, AMD (atrophy means &#x0201c;to waste away&#x0201d;). Wet AMD occurs when abnormal, fragile new blood vessels grow under the macula behind the retina. These blood vessels often leak blood and fluid, which lift the macula. Dry AMD occurs as the light-sensitive cells in the macula (the rods and cones) break down. To study this disease further, researchers use animal models. One such animal model is made by using a laser to damage the back of the eye in a mouse, which causes the formation of new vessels. Various treatments can then be tested to see if they have any effect on the damage.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>One theory about AMD is that the immune system may be involved in determining how severe the damage at the back of the eye is, and how much new vessel formation occurs. The researchers wanted to look at the effect of the immune system on AMD, in particular, the effect of one type of cell called a macrophage, and a substance, IL-10, that is secreted from bone marrow cells and that affects how these macrophages work.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers used a mouse strain in which IL-10 was absent, induced damage in the eyes that mimicked AMD, and then looked at what role macrophages had in the eye abnormalities. They found that in the eyes of mice that lacked IL-10, there was reduced new vessel formation and increased numbers of macrophages compared to mice that had normal amounts of IL-10. Also, preventing macrophages from getting into the eyes of such mice by injecting IL-10 into the eyes made the new vessel formation worse, while direct injection of macrophages made it better.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>Although animal models cannot completely replicate disease in humans, they can give us an idea of how diseases might come about and suggest possible treatment strategies. It is possible that inhibiting the effect of IL-10, or other strategies that make macrophages more efficient in the eye, may be a useful treatment for AMD.

However, recent work has focused on the role of chronic inflammation in the development of pathologic processes such as cancer, heart disease, and eye disorders. The macrophage component of inflammation has received attention because of macrophage production of proangiogenic and proinflammatory molecules that can fuel disease progression. In cancer, chronic inflammation has been demonstrated within tumor foci, and a number of studies suggest that tumor-associated macrophages promote the growth, proliferation, and metastasis of neoplastic cells as well as stimulate neovascularization, leading to tumor progression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. Recent research in heart disease has shown that inflammation plays a key role in atherosclerosis. Immune cells have been shown to dominate early atherosclerotic lesions, and molecules produced by these cells accelerate progression of the disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Recent studies of the blinding eye disorder age-related macular degeneration (AMD) also suggest a role for inflammation, specifically macrophages, in promoting this disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

Current estimates of patients affected with AMD are higher than those of patients affected by Alzheimer disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Although both geographic atrophy and neovascularization represent advanced forms of AMD, neovascular AMD is the more aggressive form and accounts for almost 90&#x00025; of blindness from this disease. It is characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which is the development of abnormal blood vessels underneath the retina. Evidence for a disease-promoting role for macrophages in neovascular AMD derives from two sources. First, studies in a mouse model showed that systemic depletion of macrophages using clodronate-filled liposomes blocked neovascularization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Second, certain single nucleotide polymorphisms in complement factor H are observed in a significantly higher percentage of patients with AMD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. These data, along with the discovery of complement factor H in AMD lesions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, have been interpreted to suggest that inflammation promotes CNV.</p><p>Other recent studies suggest that macrophages may be anti-angiogenic. Mice lacking a macrophage recruitment chemokine (ccl-2) had spontaneous CNV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that when macrophages could not be recruited to the eye, animals were more prone to develop CNV. Another study showed that macrophages are essential to the regression of abnormal vasculature in the anterior segment of the eye &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the role of macrophages in pathogenic neovascularization still remains controversial.</p><p>Our study was designed to directly examine the complex role of macrophages in an established mouse model. Although the murine laser model is only a surrogate acute injury model for AMD&#x02014;which is a chronic disease&#x02014;it has been remarkably successful in predicting therapies that have since proven to be efficacious in the treatment of AMD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

The first human anti-VEGF therapy for CNV in AMD was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2005. The efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy in ocular neovascularization was initially studied in an animal laser model and was then tested in two large, randomized double-masked human clinical trials that led to the US Food and Drug Administration approval of anti-VEGF therapy for CNV in AMD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.

The same team of investigators has since completed a phase I trial of adeno-associated virus&#x02013; pigment-epithelium-derived factor administered intravitreally in patients with CNV from AMD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. A preponderance of evidence in the peer-reviewed literature demonstrates that the laser model is a reliable surrogate for understanding the pathophysiology of CNV in AMD. In addition, it has proven to be an excellent model for testing molecules and compounds that successfully treat CNV. The injury to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in AMD is a chronic phenomenon; nevertheless, the laser-mediated injury to the RPE in the mouse model, although acute, might simulate an accelerated phenotype of the chronic disease process. In this paper, we examine the role of innate immunity, specifically macrophage-mediated immunity, in regulating angiogenesis in the eye. We investigate the complex role of macrophages in regulating angiogenesis in an animal model of the human disease AMD and attempt to understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms of CNV that lead to blindness in AMD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mouse Strains</title><p>C57/BL6 (B6), B6-<italic>IL-10</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, B6-<italic>gld,</italic> and B6-<italic>lpr</italic> mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, United States).

IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits T cell and macrophage functions. It is a potent inhibitor of cytokine and chemokine production, including a number of molecules known to attract monocytes and macrophages to sites of inflammation. The absence of IL-10 typically results in substantial increases in inflammation at multiple sites following diverse stimuli &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;.

Consequently, we tested whether our observations in <italic>IL-10</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and wt mice receiving anti-IL-10 were related to the increased inflammatory phenotype observed in these animals.

These <italic>IL-10</italic> Tg mice (or <italic>VMD2-IL-10</italic>) expressed high levels of secreted IL-10 in the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030310-g003">Figure 3</xref>D) compared to transgene-negative mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030310-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), but had completely normal retinal architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030310-g003">Figure 3</xref>E).

This regulation operates through the interaction of CD95L with the Fas antigen (CD95) on the choroidal blood vessels induced to grow by laser treatment.

There is no treatment that can reverse the damage to vision. Consequently, insights into the etiology of CNV associated with AMD, as described in this report, add significantly to the information needed to design effective treatments.</p><p>While it is clear that the immune system can play a role in neovascularization, there has been conflicting evidence regarding the role of the immune system in neovascular AMD. The most popular idea is that macrophages (and inflammation) are proangiogenic. Studies suggesting this used the laser model described here and systemically depleted phagocytic cells by injection of the compound clodronate encapsulated in liposomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Since systemic depletion of phagocytes decreased the level of CNV, the authors concluded that macrophages promote CNV. When we examined this system, we found that liposomes can actually enter developing endothelial cells found in the laser-induced neovascular complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed-0030310-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). These findings, coupled with the fact that liposomes are known to enter a wide variety of other cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, suggest that the effects observed may be due to the toxicity of the clodronate liposomes directly on sprouting endothelial cells.</p><p>A recent study suggested that macrophages may be anti-angiogenic. These authors demonstrated that mice lacking a macrophage recruitment chemokine (ccl-2) had spontaneous CNV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Although these authors did not discuss the possibility, this observation suggests that the inability to recruit macrophages into the eye leads to the development of CNV. Not only do our results support this idea, but we have directly tested it in the laser model of CNV. Our study shows that increased macrophage influx inhibits CNV, while treatments that prevent macrophage entry into the eye suppress the anti-angiogenic response of macrophages. Data from our study complement the natural history of AMD and the etiology of inflammatory eye diseases in humans. Although leukocytes including macrophages, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and other cells of hematopoietic origin have been isolated from samples of CNV and identified by immunohistochemistry or electron microscopy, there is no conclusive evidence about whether these cells are pro- or anti-angiogenic &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b039">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. The possibility remains that these cells represent an epiphenomenon related to the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the subretinal space. Our data demonstrate a novel role for macrophages in the CNV lesions that is of potential therapeutic relevance. Clinical observations show that CNV in uveitis patients, who have significant inflammation in the eye, is less aggressive &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Our findings also complement recent evidence that macrophages are anti-angiogenic during development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d; and in tumors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. Based on this information and the data presented in this report we conclude that inflammation may be protective.</p><p>Recent genetic-linkage-based evidence suggests the potential importance of complement factor H in AMD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the lack of functional data leaves these important observations still open to interpretation, as they are also consistent with the idea that a healthy immune system (e.g., complement pathway) may actually protect against blindness. We would suggest that one explanation for the linkage between complement factor H and AMD might be that polymorphisms that lead to increased AMD are associated with reduced macrophage recruitment to the chorio-retinal tissues. The elderly, who are at risk for the development of AMD, are known to have compromised immune function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, a disabled macrophage response may be an additional risk factor for the development of CNV and blindness. We would further suggest that physiologic immune surveillance and normal macrophage function are critical in controlling pathologic neovascularization.</p><p>The pivotal role for IL-10 in this model is likely related to the anti-inflammatory properties of the cytokine and its ability to inhibit cytokines that attract macrophages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. We can find no effect of IL-10 on endothelial cells (data not shown). Increases in chemotactic cytokines would be predicted when IL-10 is not present, and one would expect that the loss of cytokines that promote infiltration of monocytes or macrophages would predispose to AMD.</p><p>Our studies also demonstrate that macrophages use FasL to inhibit CNV. We have demonstrated previously that FasL expressed on RPE cells is important for the control of CNV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;: mice defective in the expression of FasL on RPE cells had massive increases in CNV. We believe that our current observations complement this finding, since we believe that FasL on both RPE cells and macrophages is necessary. The loss of FasL on RPE cells leads to substantial (5- to 8-fold) increases in CNV &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030310-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, and we would not expect the few macrophages that enter the lesion (10&#x02013;20 per lesion) to be able to control this high level of CNV even if they are FasL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. When FasL is present on the RPE, as occurs in most experiments, the CNV is more modest and then amenable to control by the FasL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> macrophages that infiltrate the lesions. It should be noted that the role of macrophage-expressed FasL was revealed only when we injected large numbers of FasL<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> macrophage into the vitreous (1&#x02013;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>). Therefore, we conclude that RPE-derived FasL and macrophage-derived FasL are important in controlling CNV.</p><p>Our data suggest potential sites for therapeutic intervention in AMD. Since the absence of IL-10 results in increased macrophage influx and reduced neovascularization, novel targeting therapies designed to inhibit local IL-10 function, promote tissue-specific macrophage activity, and/or target the CD95/CD95L pathway should be considered as treatments for neovascular AMD. IL-10 activity in the eye can be inhibited by local administration of neutralizing antibodies, inhibitory RNA, or aptamers. Although the most immediate application for this form of therapy would presumably be in patients with preexisting CNV in order to limit or reverse vision loss, long-term inhibition of IL-10 function in the eye could potentially be used as preventive therapy in patients with dry AMD who are at high risk for developing CNV. In addition to demonstrating that IL-10 is an attractive therapeutic target in AMD, we have also shown that the role of macrophages in angiogenesis might be more complex than previously suggested. The anti-angiogenic functions of macrophages should be considered in evaluating any therapies that might nonselectively neutralize all macrophage effector function because of the potentially devastating consequences on the disease process and vision in patients with AMD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0030310-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Source of IL-10</title><p>Bone marrow chimeras were generated to test the source IL-10. <italic>IL-10</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that were reconstituted with B6 bone marrow (BM) (volume of the neovascular complex: 10,143.9 &#x000b1; 1,962.8 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup>) showed levels of CNV comparable to B6 mice (12,756.7 &#x000b1; 3,744.4 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup>).
