In several teleost species, including representatives of the Salmonidae and Acanthopterygii, but not zebrafish, two or more MyoD paralogues are conserved that are thought to have arisen from distinct, possibly lineage-specific duplication events. Additionally, two MyoD paralogues have been characterised in the allotetraploid frog, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>. This has lead to a confusing nomenclature since MyoD paralogues have been named outside of an appropriate phylogenetic framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Principal Findings</title><p>Here we initially show that directly depicting the evolutionary relationships of teleost MyoD orthologues and paralogues is hindered by the asymmetric evolutionary rate of Acanthopterygian MyoD2 relative to other MyoD proteins. Thus our aim was to confidently position the event from which teleost paralogues arose in different lineages by a comparative investigation of genes neighbouring <italic>myod</italic> across the vertebrates. To this end, we show that genes on the single <italic>myod</italic>-containing chromosome of mammals and birds are retained in both zebrafish and Acanthopterygian teleosts in a striking pattern of double conserved synteny. Further, phylogenetic reconstruction of these neighbouring genes using Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods supported a common origin for teleost paralogues following the split of the Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results strongly suggest that <italic>myod</italic> was duplicated during the basal teleost whole genome duplication event, but was subsequently lost in the Ostariophysi (zebrafish) and Protacanthopterygii lineages. We propose a sensible consensus nomenclature for vertebrate <italic>myod</italic> genes that accommodates polyploidization events in teleost and tetrapod lineages and is justified from a phylogenetic perspective.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) are a family of vertebrate proteins (individually MyoD, Myf5, Mrf4 and Myog), that are potent transcription factors for muscle genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Pownall1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This potency lies in two conserved domains, the basic region and helix-loop-helix (i.e. the bHLH). Ubiquitously expressed E-proteins share the bHLH and dimerise with MRFs through their respective HLH's and the resulting complex then binds via the basic regions to a conserved motif called the e-box, which is widely conserved in the regulatory regions of muscle genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Tapscott1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. MyoD, Myf5 and Mrf4 have overlapping but developmentally distinct functions in the specification and differentiation of myoblasts, whereas Myog and Mrf4 activate and maintain the terminal differentiation of muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Pownall1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-KassarDuchossoy1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The four MRFs are ancient paralogues and thus arose through gene duplication events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Atchley1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Macqueen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been hypothesised that the entire genome of the lineage leading to modern vertebrates has duplicated twice during evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Meyer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. This is thought to explain the prevalence of vertebrate gene families with up to four members relative to basal deuterostome and protostome animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Spring1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, a pattern nicely recapitulated by the MRFs. It was proposed that a single ancestor gene, currently conserved from fruit fly to jellyfish to tunicates, was first duplicated to produce the ancestor genes to MyoD/Myf5 and Mrf4/Myog which subsequently duplicated again, resulting in the current MRFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Atchley1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Macqueen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The teleost genome went through whole genome duplication (WGD) again around 320&#x02013;350 Mya <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-VandePeer1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Jaillon1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, meaning most species can potentially have two paralogues of any Sarcopterygian gene. Furthermore, more recent polyploidization events within specific vertebrate lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Otto1">&#x0005b;reviewed by 10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-LeComber1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> means further copies may have been generated, resulting in additional levels of complexity when resolving phylogenetic relationships of paralogues and orthologues.</p><p>In most diploid tetrapods, including birds, mammals, the frog <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> as well as teleosts of the Ostariophysi superorder, MyoD is represented by a single gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001567-t001">Table 1</xref>). The allotetraploid frog, <italic>X. laevis</italic> has two differentially expressed MyoD paralogues that were originally named Xlmf1 and Xlmf25 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Scales1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001567-t001">Table 1</xref>). Teleost species of the Acanthopterygii superorder also have two differentially expressed paralogues originally denoted MyoD1 (orthologous to the single <italic>myod</italic> gene of the Ostariophysi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Macqueen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>) and MyoD2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Tan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001567-t001">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, two salmonid MyoD duplicates were characterised in rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) and named MyoD and MyoD2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Rescan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently a third salmonid MyoD sequence was characterised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Macqueen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>) the three paralogues have distinct embryonic expression fields that together recapitulate the expression of zebrafish MyoD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Macqueen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that all salmonid paralogues were co-orthologues of Ostariophysi-MyoD/Acanthopterygii-MyoD1 and arose independently of Acanthopterygian MyoD2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Macqueen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Acanthopterygian MyoD2 proteins appeared as an outgroup to both teleost and tetrapod MyoD sequences with 100&#x00025; branch confidence, which does not reflect either a common teleost origin or a lineage specific event. This tree topology is probably an artefact of the asymmetric evolution of MyoD2 relative to other MyoD proteins, obscuring its true phylogenetic position by long branch attraction (LBA) or mutational saturation within the alignment. Here, we initially attempted to correct the suspected aberrant topology, by using several methods of phylogenetic reconstruction, taking actions to reduce LBA and remove mutational saturation. Our next aim was to investigate the chromosomal regions proximal to vertebrate <italic>myod</italic> genes using a comparative-genomic and phylogenetic approach to confidently establish the extent of the duplication event from which Acanthopterygian MyoD1 and MyoD2 paralogues arose. Interestingly, this approach provided strong evidence that a <italic>myod</italic>-containing chromosome duplicated in a common teleost ancestor, probably during the WGD event of basal teleost evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Jaillon1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, which directly contradicted the majority of tree topologies retrieved by direct phylogenetic reconstruction. These results allow us to advocate the use of a sensible nomenclature consensus for vertebrate <italic>myod</italic> genes that accommodates polyploidzation events in teleosts, amphibians and other non-diploid vertebrates.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0001567-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001567.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Details

A more expected position for this protein within a vertebrate MyoD tree topology would be to either branch from all teleost MyoD sequences, if it arose in a common teleost ancestor (e.g. during the teleost WGD), or from Acanthopterygian MyoD1 if a specific <italic>myod</italic> duplication occurred within this lineage as suggested previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Fernandes1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Bayesian, ML and NJ analyses placed the point of MyoD1/MyoD2 duplication as a specific event within the Acanthopterygii when a gamma distribution of among site rate variation was used which is known to be resistant to LBA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Fares1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g001">Fig. 1a&#x02013;c</xref>). Further, Bayesian and ML analyses also placed the duplication as a specific event to Acanthopterygians when among-site substitution rate variation was considered low or uniform (not shown). However, when a NJ tree analysis was performed assuming a uniform distribution of among site rate variation, the tree topology supported a common teleost origin of MyoD1/MyoD2 paralogues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g001">Fig. 1d</xref>). Furthermore, by &#x02018;pushing&#x02019; the gamma distribution parameter in PhyML to consider among-site rate variation as high-extremely high (performing the analysis with a gamma distribution parameter of 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001) the resulting trees still supported an Acanthopterygian specific duplication event. Finally, by removing frequently mutating residues from the alignment before NJ tree reconstruction, a topology was retrieved supporting an Acanthopterygian-specific origin of paralogues (not shown). Thus, the majority of phylogenetic reconstructions performed with the new alignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001567.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) clearly supported an Acanthopterygian specific event. Since the tree topology recorded in the previous phylogenetic analysis (which placed MyoD2 externally to all vertebrate MyoD sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Macqueen1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>) was not retrieved by any method employed here, it is possible that LBA may have affected the original tree reconstruction. Next, we used a comparative genomic approach to study the relationships of genes in neighbourhood to <italic>myod</italic> in several teleosts and two diploid tetrapods, expecting that some signal of <italic>myod</italic> duplication would be retrieved specifically in the Acanthopterygii.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Synteny of vertebrate <italic>myod</italic> genes reveals the true extent of the teleost <italic>myod1</italic>/<italic>myod2</italic> duplication</title><p>Our next aim involved establishing the chromosomal locations of genes in proximity to <italic>myod</italic> in human, relative to their positions in chicken, zebrafish and three Acanthopterygian species. This information was used construct a diagram of conserved synteny across the vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Additionally, since <italic>tropT</italic> and <italic>tropI</italic> genes are in direct 3&#x02032; proximity to all teleost <italic>myod</italic> genes, we also assessed their location in human and chicken genomes. A very high degree of synteny is retained between the <italic>myod</italic> containing regions of human chromosome 11 and chicken chromosome 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Comparing these regions with teleosts, while some inter and intra chromosomal rearrangements have occurred, a striking pattern of double conserved synteny (DCS) is observed where teleost genes are found as either single copies interspersed between two paralogous chromosomal tracts (<italic>otog</italic>, <italic>abcc-8</italic>, <italic>kcnj11</italic>, <italic>pik3c2a</italic>, <italic>rps13</italic>, <italic>sergef</italic>) or as at least two paralogues on both chromosomes (<italic>tropT</italic>, <italic>tropI</italic>, <italic>tph1</italic>, <italic>kcnc1</italic> &#x0005b;zebrafish specific&#x0005d;, <italic>nucb</italic>2, <italic>plekha7</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). This pattern was maintained for genes found in both upstream and downstream proximity to <italic>myod</italic> in human/chicken and importantly, was observed in zebrafish (Ostariophysi) and the three Acanthopterygian species studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). This common pattern of interleaved-DCS in teleosts is most consistent with the duplication of a <italic>myod-</italic>containing chromosome in a common ancestor to zebrafish (Ostariophysi) and the Acanthopterygii, but not tetrapods. We suggest that this occurred during the WGD of basal teleost evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Jaillon1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, on zebrafish chromosome 5, the duplicated <italic>myod2</italic> gene is absent relative to its inferred position from Acanthopterygian genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, black arrow). The differential retention/loss of paralogues in different teleost lineages following the WGD is surprisingly common. For example, it was shown that &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of zebrafish duplicates were retained as single copies in pufferfish genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Woods1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Taylor1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

The Bayesian/ML analyses clustered one of the zebrafish paralogues (Kcnc1-1) with the Acanthopterygian sequences, and its paralogue, Kcnc1-2 (on chr 7) as an outgroup to these sequences, but internally to tetrapod orthologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>).

In teleosts, <italic>trop1</italic> can be found as distinct tandem paralogues (ranging from 2&#x02013;5 in number) just downstream of <italic>myod1</italic>, but also in proximity to Acanthopterygian <italic>myod2</italic> genes and the position where the <italic>myod2</italic> gene of zebrafish was putatively lost (black arrow on chr 7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Conversely, fast muscle specific <italic>tropI</italic> appears as a single gene on chromosomes 11 and 5 in human and chicken genomes. Thus, it seems that <italic>tropI</italic> has been though a series of in-chromosomal (tandem) duplications and a chromosomal duplication specifically during teleost evolution. For ease, we designated the tandem paralogues on each teleost chromosome as a, b, c etc, based solely on their left to right position on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g002">Fig. 2</xref>. To investigate their evolutionary relationships we reconstructed phylogenetic trees of all teleost TropI sequences within the scope of the synteny analysis using Bayesian and ML methods, which produced identical topologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>). Interestingly, teleost sequences orthologous to zebrafish TropI-1c (stickleback-TropI-1c, medaka-TropI-1b, pufferfish-TropI-1b) clustered as an outgroup to all other teleost TropI sequences, with 100&#x00025; branch support from both methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g002">Fig. 2d</xref>). This suggests that these TropI orthologues are the least derived relative to tetrapod TropI and are likely ancestral to all other teleost TropI paralogues, tandem or otherwise. The fact that the next teleost TropI sequences to branch internally to this clade (zebrafish TropI-1d, stickleback TropI-1d, medaka TropI-1a) are found on the same chromosome as the &#x02018;ancestral&#x02019; TropI sequence, likely reflects an ancient tandem duplication event in a common teleost ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g003">Fig. 3,d</xref>). Internal to these braches, are TropI sequences from the paralogous chromosome (i.e. zebrafish chr 7, stickleback group 2 and tiger pufferfish scaf 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>). We argue that this branching reflects the chromosomal duplication event (black star on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>) suggested by trees for other neighbouring genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g003">Fig. 3, a&#x02013;c, f</xref>). Branches found internally to these sequences correspond to TropI sequences found in tandem with the ancestor TropI proteins (i.e. in zebrafish TropI-c and d). Thus to summarize, we suggest that <italic>tropI</italic> duplicated once in tandem prior to the teleost WGD event and other paralogues, either tandem or chromosomal are derived from these ancestral sequences. It is known that MyoD regulates the expression of fast muscle <italic>tropI</italic> genes through interactions with E-proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Lin1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of multiple tandem fast-muscle <italic>tropI</italic> paralogues in close association with <italic>myod</italic> in teleosts but not tetrapods suggests that a selective advantage has arisen in teleost evolution for the tight regulation of multiple copies. Embryonic <italic>in situ</italic> expression data is available for one zebrafish fast skeletal muscle <italic>tropI</italic> gene. The zebrafish probe used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Thisse1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> (denoted <italic>tnni2</italic>) shares 100&#x00025; identity to the putative Ensembl transcript of the <italic>tropI-1d</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) and from mid-somitogenesis accumulated in muscles of the somite, fin buds and head <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Thisse1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> which overlaps spatially and temporally with <italic>myod1</italic> transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Weinberg1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

These findings suggest that this <italic>tropI</italic> gene is likely regulated by <italic>myod1</italic> during embryonic myogenesis. <italic>In situ</italic> expression data is not available for other fast-skeletal <italic>tropI</italic> genes. To gain insight into their regulation we performed tBLASTn searches of the EST database at GenBank using full amino acid translations of each zebrafish <italic>tropI</italic> gene within <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g002">Fig. 2</xref>. A cut-off of 98&#x02013;100&#x00025; sequence identity was considered a positive hit from the returned sequences. Positive hits were returned for each <italic>tropI</italic> gene, confirming that each paralogue is transcribed into an mRNA product. Consistent with the <italic>in situ</italic> data, several hundred positive hits for zebrafish <italic>tropI-1d</italic> were retrieved solely from EST libraries representing embryonic zebrafish tissues. Interestingly, other <italic>tropI</italic> genes were not limited to embryonic tissues and were abundant in cDNA libraries obtained from adult zebrafish brain (<italic>tropI-1c, 1a, 2a, 2b</italic>), skin (<italic>tropI-1c</italic>), eye (<italic>tropI-1b, 2a</italic>), gill (<italic>tropI-1c</italic>), intestine (<italic>tropI-1c</italic>), gut (<italic>tropI-1a</italic>) and cultured myoblasts (<italic>tropI-2b</italic>). Similarly, BLAST searches of Atlantic salmon EST resources at the salmon genome project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.salmongenome.no/">http://www.salmongenome.no/</ext-link>) and the Gene Index Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/">http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/</ext-link>) using the various zebrafish <italic>tropI</italic> amino acid sequences retrieved multiple salmon <italic>trop-I</italic> ESTs from tissue-specific cDNA libraries including fast muscle, slow muscle, gill, heart, skin, brain and eye. These findings suggest that the multiple &#x02018;fast-muscle&#x02019; <italic>tropI</italic> paralogues found in teleosts are not solely involved in the assembly of fast skeletal muscle. Further their expression in multiple tissues is clearly not limited to regulation by muscle-specific transcription factors like <italic>myod</italic>. A more detailed examination of the expression patterns of teleost fast skeletal <italic>tropI</italic> duplicates would be a fruitful future experiment to gain insight into the evolution of <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulation of paralogues following gene duplication.</p><p>The Bayesian/ML trees retrieved for Tph1 and TropT paralogues, were not initially consistent with other trees and either branched one of the zebrafish genes as a sister group to its paralogue (TropT, not shown) or externally to all teleost genes (Tph1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g002">Fig. 2e</xref>). These are possible artefacts arising from different rates of paralogue evolution between zebrafish and Acanthopterygian species. However, employing a gamma distribution of among-site rate variation in the Bayesian analysis did not change the topology of either tree, but did reduce posterior probability values at the suspected aberrant positions (not shown). To test for mutational saturation in these alignments we constructed NJ trees considering all substitution sites and then solely the unsaturated fraction of sites using ASATURA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-VandePeer2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. NJ trees considering all sites retrieved trees very similar to the Bayesian/ML analyses for both Tph1 and TropT (not shown). However, when the unsaturated alignments were analysed, both trees changed in topology, suggesting these alignments were affected by mutational saturation. The &#x02018;unsaturated&#x02019; Tph1 NJ tree topology was changed in a manner consistent with other trees and supported a common origin of teleost paralogues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g002">Fig. 2f</xref>). However, the expected topology was not retrieved for the TropT alignment by this approach and the two zebrafish sequences formed a sister clade with low branch confidence (not shown).</p><p>Thus to summarise, these supporting phylogenies are consistent with the synteny diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), and imply that a <italic>myod</italic> chromosome duplicated in a common teleost ancestor and again suggest that the position of the teleost MyoD1/MyoD2 duplication supported by direct phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) is almost certainly incorrect. These results highlight the importance of avoiding the use of single gene phylogenies when inferring the origin of gene paralogues and advocate the importance of studying the conserved synteny between, and phylogenetic relationships of, neighbouring genes in duplicated and non-duplicated lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Evolution of MyoD paralogues</title><p>To gain insight into the evolutionary rates of MyoD paralogues, a ML analysis was then performed, imposing the suggested correct topology of the teleost WGD (Acanthopterygian MyoD2 sequences branching internally to tetrapod MyoD orthologues but externally to teleost MyoD1 proteins: topology observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g001">Fig. 1d</xref>), but allowing the optimisation of branch lengths.

Conversely, differences in evolutionary rates between teleost MyoD1 orthologues were not significantly different except in one case when tiger pufferfish and zebrafish MyoD1 were compared (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001567.s002">Table S1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0001567-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001567.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Unrooted ML cladogram of vertebrate MyoD amino acid sequences produced in PhyML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Guindon1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> with an imposed &#x02018;correct&#x02019; topology.</title><p>The amino acid alignment was the same as used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g001">Fig. 1</xref>.

Furthermore, species-specific rates of MyoD2 evolution were observed in the Acanthopterygii. This is consistent with a recent genome-wide study, where &#x0223c;600/2500 genes found to be present in the genomes of four different teleosts, showed significantly elevated or retarded rates of evolution in one of the teleost species compared to a human orthologue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001567-Steinke1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>A consensus nomenclature for vertebrate MyoD sequences</title><p>The genomic and phylogenetic results reported here provide strong evidence that a chromosomal region containing <italic>myod</italic> duplicated in a common teleost ancestor, but that <italic>myod2</italic> was lost in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001567-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

The current vertebrate nomenclature is generally author-specific and based on the timing of MyoD discovery and does not account for evolutionary relationships of paralogues that have arisen in different vertebrate lineages. Our results allow us to advocate a consensus nomenclature relevant to all vertebrate <italic>myod</italic> genes. For teleost species that have arisen subsequent to the WGD, <italic>myod</italic> paralogues should be first identified by their orthology to either <italic>myod1</italic> or <italic>myod2</italic> and then more recently derived copies discovered within specific lineages should be named within this framework as <italic>myod1(a/b/</italic>etc<italic>)</italic> or <italic>myod2</italic>(<italic>a/b/</italic>etc). For other vertebrates that did not go through the teleost WGD, including tetrapods, and basal Actinopterygian groups such as the Acipenseridae and Lepisosteidae, <italic>myod</italic> orthologues retained as a single copy should be simply denoted <italic>myod</italic>, whereas lineage specific paralogues should be called <italic>myoda</italic>/<italic>b</italic>/etc (e.g. <italic>X. laevis</italic> MyoDa/b). This evolutionary relevant nomenclature, which is highlighted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001567-t001">Table 1</xref>, provides the simplest way of distinguishing between <italic>myod</italic> paralogues arising from the teleost WGD and those arising from lineage-specific duplication events.
