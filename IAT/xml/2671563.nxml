Using photoaffinity cross-linking of a radioactively labelled quinoline-3-carboxamide compound, we could determine a direct association between human S100A9 and quinoline-3-carboxamides. This interaction was strictly dependent on both Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> and Ca<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup>. We also show that S100A9 in the presence of Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> and Ca<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> is an efficient ligand of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and also an endogenous Toll ligand in that it shows a highly specific interaction with TLR4/MD2. Both these interactions are inhibited by quinoline-3-carboxamides. A clear structure-activity relationship (SAR) emerged with regard to the binding of quinoline-3-carboxamides to S100A9, as well as these compounds potency to inhibit interactions with RAGE or TLR4/MD2. The same SAR was observed when the compound's ability to inhibit acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice in vivo was analysed. Quinoline-3-carboxamides would also inhibit TNF&#x003b1; release in a S100A9-dependent model in vivo, as would antibodies raised against the quinoline-3-carboxamide&#x02013;binding domain of S100A9. Thus, S100A9 appears to be a focal molecule in the control of autoimmune disease via its interactions with proinflammatory mediators. The specific binding of quinoline-3-carboxamides to S100A9 explains the immunomodulatory activity of this class of compounds and defines S100A9 as a novel target for treatment of human autoimmune diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>What molecules and mechanisms underlie the development of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus are largely unknown.

Since no reliable in vitro system has been established for assaying the biological effect of Q compounds, we verified that these linker-containing Q compounds still had biological effect using the in vivo model acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (aEAE) (unpublished data). We also used the FITC-labelled compound (ABR-225356) to investigate binding to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We observed that only the monocyte (CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) fraction was surface stained with ABR-225356 (unpublished data).

The membrane fraction of both cell populations was subsequently prepared, and the proteins separated on two-dimensional gels followed by autoradiography. Labelled proteins found exclusively on gels from the CD14<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell fraction were extracted from the gels and identified using MALDI-TOF (matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight). The most prominent binding protein was identified as S100A9 and was selected for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000097-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In the next step, recombinant human S100A9 was analysed for binding to a defined Q compound (ABR-215757; currently in clinical development for treatment of SLE) using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000097-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, it was evident that recombinant S100A9 bound strongly to ABR-215757 coupled to solid phase. As S100A9, in most cases, is found colocalised with S100A8 at inflammatory sites, we decided to analyze homo- and heterodimeric complexes of S100A8 and S100A9 for their interaction with Q compounds. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000097-g001">Figure 1</xref>D shows that binding was more or less exclusively restricted to homodimeric S100A9, whereas only weak binding was observed for the S100A8/A9 complex, and close to baseline levels for S100A8. Last, we determined that the Q compound/S100A9 interaction could be competed in a dose-dependent way by free compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000097-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Additional proteins were identified using photoaffinity labelling but could not be verified using follow-up SPR analysis. We concluded from these studies that human S100A9 was a potential pharmacological target for Q compounds.</p><p>S100A9 belongs to the S100 family of proteins that are known to be Ca<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> binding proteins and are involved in inflammatory processes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. However, S100A9 has also been shown to bind Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup>, and this interaction might have conformational consequences for the protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore investigated the dependence of the interaction between ABR-215757 and S100A9 for both these divalent ions. When Ca<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> or Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> were titrated in the presence of a fixed concentration of either Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> or Ca<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup>, we found that both ions were required for S100A9 binding to Q compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000097-g001">Figure 1</xref>F). If titration was carried out in the absence of either Ca<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> or Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup>, the binding of S100A9 to ABR-215757 was reduced to baseline values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000097-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). It should also be noted that the levels of Ca<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> or Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> required for optimal S100A9/quinoline interaction are within the concentration range found for these ions in human serum &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. We are aware of the fact that S100A9 is prone to form dimers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d; and complexes of even higher oligomeric states at high concentrations, and therefore expect the interaction between Q compounds and human S100A9 to be occurring primarily with at least bivalent structures of the molecule. This assumption was supported by the complex kinetics and sigmoidal-shaped dose-response curve for S100A9 binding to immobilised Q compound.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Q compounds Inhibit the Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup>-Dependent Interaction between S100A9 and RAGE</title><p>The next question was to gain some understanding concerning the mechanism whereby S100A9 binding by Q compounds could inhibit autoimmune disease. Members of the S100 protein family have been shown to interact with the proinflammatory molecule RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, but to our knowledge, there are no data in the literature showing a direct, physical interaction between RAGE and S100A9. Furthermore, it has been shown that soluble RAGE may alleviate aEAE &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore decided to investigate whether human S100A9 was a human RAGE ligand using SPR. In this study, RAGE was covalently coupled to the sensor chip to allow exposure of the extracellular domain of RAGE to S100A9, thus reconstituting a biological model in which anchored membrane receptor interacts with soluble ligands. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000097-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, S100A9 interacted strongly with immobilised RAGE when injected at the concentration yielding half-maximal binding to ABR-224649, almost a 6-fold higher response compared to the S100A8/A9 heterodimer. Moreover, the binding of S100A8 to RAGE was negligible. The interaction between S100A9 and RAGE was also strictly dependent on the presence of physiological concentrations of both Ca<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> and Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000097-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Given the similarities between the binding conditions for S100A9 interaction with RAGE and Q compounds, we proceeded to test whether a Q compound could compete for RAGE binding to S100A9. Indeed, ABR-215757 in increasing concentrations competed for RAGE-S100A9 binding in the presence of Ca<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> and Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000097-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Furthermore, direct binding of ABR-215757 to RAGE was not observed, indicating that the inhibition of the interaction was mediated by binding of ABR-215757 to S100A9 (unpublished data). In a separate experiment in which human RAGE/Fc and Fc alone were allowed to interact with S100A9 immobilised on the chip, we observed no interaction with Fc alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000097-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A). Thus, under our standard conditions, homodimeric S100A9 is the primary RAGE ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000097-g002">Figure 2</xref>D), as well as target for Q compound binding.</p><fig id="pbio-1000097-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Human S100A9 Binds Human RAGE</title><p>(A) Left: sensorgrams showing association and dissociation phase after injection of 100 nM hS100A9 (upper) and hS100A8/9 (lower) over RAGE immobilized at a density of approximately 3,000 RU (solid lines).

We therefore decided to investigate whether TLR4 could be a possible S100A9 ligand and whether Q compounds could interfere with such interactions. Since TLR4 is inactive in the absence of the coreceptor MD2, we here used a complex of human TLR4 and MD2 for amine coupling to a biosensor chip to be used in a SPR assay. As shown in the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000097-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, S100A9 showed strong binding when injected over immobilised TLR4/MD2 using our standard conditions, and produced a more than 5-fold higher signal than the S100A8/A9 heterodimer. Furthermore, the signal obtained after injection of S100A9 was proportional to the amount of TLR4/MD2 coupled to the solid phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000097-sg007">Figure S7</xref>). We could also demonstrate that the binding of S100A9 to TLR4/MD2 is TLR4 specific since the TLR4/MD2 complex interacted with immobilised S100A9 with high affinity whereas MD2 alone did not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000097-sg004">Figure S4</xref>B). Hence, we can show here for the first time that human S100A9 is an endogenous TLR4 ligand. The interaction between human S100A9 and TLR4/MD2 was strictly dependent on the presence of both Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000097-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) and Ca<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> (unpublished data), which could explain why this interaction has not been previously described. We then proceeded to investigate whether the Q compound ABR-215757 could interfere with human S100A9 binding to TLR4/MD2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000097-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, a dose-dependent inhibition of the interaction was observed, whereas only very weak inhibition was seen with a control substance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000097-sg006">Figure S6</xref>).

This observation indicates that TLR4/MD2, RAGE, and Q compound compete for the same binding region in human S100A9. The TLR4/MD2 complex is known to bind LPS, and therefore we investigated whether LPS could interfere with the binding of human S100A9 to the immobilised human TLR4/MD2 receptor complex. In contrast to the dose-dependent displacement of S100A9 binding by soluble TLR4/MD2, LPS had no effect on this interaction even at 200 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000097-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A).

We first considered the obvious experiment of using S100A9 null mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. To this end, we back-crossed the S100A9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals against C57BL/6 mice and induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) using MOG peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000097-sg008">Figure S8</xref>). We observed that the S100A9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals had a more severe disease than C57BL/6 controls, but still responded to treatment with Q compounds. This was an unexpected result given the very strong SAR between the binding strength of Q compounds to S100A9 and their potency in inhibiting aEAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000097-g005">Figure 5</xref>). However, the absence of an obvious functional phenotype with a specific gene deletion does not necessarily prove that the protein it codes for has an insignificant function in an intact host. The S100 family of proteins is large and complex. For example, whereas S100A12 has been shown to be a RAGE ligand in humans &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, its gene is absent in the mouse genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. S100A8 is expressed almost exclusively as a S100A8/A9 heterodimer, but whereas S100A9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are viable, the S100A8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> genotype is embryonically lethal &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.

Given that S100A9 convey important biological functions, it can be suspected that biological redundancy may occur in the S100A9<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animal, in which another molecule(s), maybe from the S100 family, would serve as a ligand for RAGE, TLR4, and Q compounds. Such a molecule could have very limited function in a genetically intact animal.</p><p>To be able to perform the in vivo validation of S100A9 as a pharmacological target for Q compounds in wild-type animals, we therefore turned to an alternative approach. Hence, we decided to generate a set of monoclonal antibodies to S100A9 that could compete for S100A9 binding to RAGE and TLR4/MD2.

That the target molecule for these compounds, S100A9, interacts with signalling pathways that are early and potent mediators of proinflammatory responses (RAGE and TLR4) could shed some light on the ability of Q compounds to mediate this effect without causing overt suppression of adaptive immunity. It can be speculated that the interference with proinflammatory signalling at the level of antigen-presenting cells may suppress the reactivity of autoimmune T cells. In addition, human S100A9 can now be regarded as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.</p><p>The interactions between S100A9 and Q compound, RAGE, or TLR4/MD2 were all strictly dependent on physiological levels of Ca<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> and Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup>. The interaction between S100A9 and Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> especially appears to induce a dramatic structural change in the protein, which also was shown to significantly affect the binding of the 43/8 monoclonal antibody. It is interesting to note that Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> has been shown to have a profound impact on the structure of other S100 proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Also, elevated levels of Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> are seen at inflammatory sites, and many extracellular proteins contain Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> binding sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, it can be speculated that the elevation of Zn<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup> is a feedforward signal for inflammation and acts by inducing conformational changes in proteins and thereby facilitating novel interactions. That both RAGE and TLR4/MD2 interact with the same surface on human S100A9 and are competed by Q compounds is intriguing. We have investigated several of the mouse and human TLRs for binding to the same interphase on human S100A9 without finding additional targets (unpublished data). However, we expect that other proinflammatory molecules will eventually be shown to interact with the same molecular surface on human S100A9, and are also open for the idea that other forms of S100 protein combinations may bind to proinflammatory mediators. The common theme remains that a molecular form of S100 proteins can interact with several proinflammatory mediators as a mechanism to modulate the quality of the immune response and inflammatory reactions.</p><p>At first glance, the data presented here are in conflict with previously published data &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. In this study, biosensor experiments were conducted with recombinant murine S100A8 immobilized on the chip using amine coupling. Binding to murine TLR4/MD2 fusion protein (mLPS-Trap) was demonstrated, as was the ability of murine S100A8, but not S100A9, to stimulate TNF&#x003b1; production of bone marrow cells from wild-type mice. In the present study, however, S100 proteins were injected over a surface with immobilized TLR4 to preserve the Ca/Zn conformation of S100A9 that is a prerequisite for binding activity. Under these conditions, S100A8 only showed weak interaction with TLR4. The biological reason for this discrepancy may be explained by the fact that the biological function of S100A8 and S100A9 is regulated in a complex manner, which additionally may differ between mice and men. For example, human S100A9 activates integrin affinity of CD11b/CD18 on monocytes, whereas human S100A8 has no effect &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Vice versa, murine S100A8 activated murine macrophages whereas murine S100A9 was inactive. Regulatory effects of human S100A9 on tubulin metabolism are completely abrogated by phosphorylation of S100A9 at threonine 113 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. This MAPK p38-dependent phosphorylation site is not conserved in murine S100A9. It seems therefore likely that murine S100A9 may mediate so far undefined regulatory mechanisms in vivo, which may be responsible for the discrepancy between different experimental findings between mice and men in vivo and in vitro. Activation of the innate immune system is crucial for initiation and amplification of many inflammatory responses and autoimmune diseases. During this process, endogenous danger signals called alarmins or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) play a pivotal role via interaction with specific pattern-recognition receptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. S100A8 and A9 have been identified as important endogenous DAMPs due to their activation of TLR4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, specific blocking of S100 proteins, as presented here, represents the first report of targeted intervention with a DAMP-mediated inflammatory process, which has already shown pharmacological activity in mice and men &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>S100A8 and S100A9 are two members of the S100 protein family. Multivariate analytical tools were used to derive the SAR for the binding activity of a series of Q compounds towards the S100A9 homodimer and the S100A8/9 heterodimer, with the assumption that similar analogs bind to the same binding site in a similar binding mode. The results indicate that the Q compounds bind the S100A9 homodimers with high structural selectivity and that this binding showed a strong correlation to their ability to inhibit autoimmune disease. On the other hand, the correlation between Q compound binding to S100A8/A9 heterodimers and inhibition of autoimmune disease was poor. The bulk of S100A8 and S100A9 protein is expressed as S100A8/A9 heterodimers and most of this protein is found as soluble protein in serum. S100A8 and S100A9 are also expressed on the cell surface of monocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000097-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.
