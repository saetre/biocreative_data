Three loci have been identified at chromosomes 2q31, 22q13.31 and 14q11.2-q12, and have been designated as SPD1, SPD2 and SPD3, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Unique expansion mutations in a <underline>pol</underline>y <underline>a</underline>lanine <underline>r</underline>epeat (PolAR) of HOXD13 have been implicated in SPD1 families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Interestingly, all mutations discovered in at least 31 SPD1 families reported so far, were &#x02264; 7 alanine residue expansions. This observation has lead to a suggestion that expansion mutations &#x02264; 6 alanine residues do not cause the SPD1 malformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, no clinical evidence has emerged to support this hypothesis.</p><p>Within SPD1 families, there exists a broad spectrum of inter- and intra-familial phenotypic manifestations. Even though, for the phenotypes segregating in large families unique clinical categories have been proposed which remain mutually exclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Here, we describe a large Pakistani and an Indian family with SPD1, identify four distinctive clinical categories of the phenotype in the affected subjects, and give evidence for a minor foot phenotype being a part of the SPD1 clinical spectrum. We observe identical 7 alanine expansion mutations in HOXD13 in the affected subjects in both families. We further show that two normal variants of PolAR are segregating in both families and that an expansion of two alanine residues in PolAR is not associated with the SPD1 malformation.</p></sec><sec><title>Case study</title><sec><title>Pakistani family</title><p>This large family originates from the Thal desert in Eastern Punjab, Pakistan.

The upstream and downstream regions flanking the first and last exon were amplified with the primer pairs: 5' &#x02192; 3' (F1-agagggagagagggctagag, R1-ctacaacggcagaagaggac; F5-cttagaagccattcggttgt, R5-cagtaccttcagcctcctgt).

A shared haplotype was present in all the affected subjects and in six of the apparently normal individuals, revealing a decreased penetrance (VII-18, VII-26, VIII-22, VIII-24, VIII-29, VIII-37) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, a close examination of the radiograms of one of the apparently normal subjects (VIII-24) in fact established the presence of partially developed proximal second metatarsal within the first metatarsal spaces (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Subsequent mutation screening of <italic>HOXD13 </italic>showed a 21 bp expansion in the imperfect GCN triplet-repeat of exon 1, c.297_317dupGCAGCGGCGGCTGCGGCGGCG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). This mutation resulted in an addition of 7 alanine residues between the 11<sup>th </sup>and 12<sup>th </sup>alanine in PolAR. Subject IX-20 was found to be homozygous for this mutation, which explains his severe limb phenotype showing a bizarre arrangement of all digital elements of hands and hypo-/dys-plastic tarsals and metatarsals in feet (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D</xref>). Owing to the homozygous mutant status of this subject, his apparently unaffected mother (VIII-33) is an obligate carrier. However, her genetic status could not be established due to lack of a blood sample.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Molecular analysis of HOXD13</bold>. <bold>A, B</bold>: DNA electropherograms of the GCN-region of <italic>HOXD13 </italic>exon 1, depicting two normal repeat variants. <bold>C</bold>, SPD1 associated duplication of 21 bp in homozygous affected subject (IX-20) in the Pakistani kindred, results in an addition of seven alanine residues. <bold>D</bold>, Indian pedigree with SPD1; the part of the pedigree analyzed is highlighted in red. <bold>E</bold>, Normal repeat polymorphisms and the expansion mutation are evident by allele separation of the exon 1 PCR product flanking the GCN region.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2350-8-78-4"/></fig><p>The mutation screening in the Indian Family also revealed an identical 21 bp expansion in the GCN triplet-repeat segregating with the phenotype (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). Remarkably, in both Pakistani and Indian families we also observed two normal variants of triplet-repeat sequence (45 bp and 51 bp), resulting in 15 and 17 alanine residues, respectively, in PolAR of the HOXD13 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, E</xref>). The 6 bp repeat expansion was observed in five subjects in the Pakistani kindred (VII-18, VII-19, VII-25, VIII-34, IX-23) and in two subjects in the Indian family (IV-8, V-3), c.288_293dupGCGGCA. In both families, the expansion was segregating in affected as well as unaffected subjects, revealing that it is not linked to the malformation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). This 6 bp expansion was not observed in two additional large SPD1 families (data not shown), depicting the rarity of this variant. In exon 1, we found two synonymous sequence variants in the Pakistani family (c.180G &#x02192; A; p.A60A, c.378C &#x02192; T; p.G126G) and one in the Indian family (c.666G &#x02192; A; p.Q222Q). No mutation was observed in exon 2 in either family.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Among all non-syndromic syndactyly types SPD is clinically and genetically the most heterogeneous malformation. However, in large families it is possible to group the affected subjects on the basis of clinical variants. For instance, four distinct clinical categories have been appreciated in a large Turkish family showing SPD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Typical SPD phenotype and various milder variants were also observed in a panel of SPD1 families reported by Goodman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Likewise, in the Asian families we have identified four distinctive clinical categories (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B, C, D</xref>). At present there is no specific molecular explanation for the occurrence of discrete clinical variants in SPD1 families. However, variations in the genetic backgrounds reflecting the presence of modifier loci in different families or in different loops of the same family could be involved. It might also well be that stochasticity in <italic>HOXD13 </italic>dosage during development could results in the phenotypic variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>A milder foot phenotype (partially developed metatarsals), observed in two families with less explicit SPD features has been advocated as a separate entity associated with deletion mutations in <italic>HOXD13 </italic>outside the PolAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast, we suggest that this clinical variant is a part of the SPD1 phenotypic spectrum. First, this milder foot phenotype was observed in a large Turkish SPD1 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Then, a Caucasian family with this phenotype was reported in which typical SPD clinical features were present in only few affected subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Finally, in the present Pakistani family we observe this milder foot phenotype as well. The frequent recurrence of this clinical variant with SPD1 leads us to conclude that it is in fact a milder phenotypic manifestation of SPD1 and not a separate entity in itself. Additionally, the presence of this variant calls for a more thorough phenotypic assessment in SPD1 families involving close radiological evaluation.</p><p>The PolAR expansion mutations in HOXD13 are believed to confer gain-of-function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, this gain-of-function is confined to expansion with a threshold total length of 22 alanine residues in PolAR (i.e., expansion of &#x02265; 7 alanines). Therefore, it has been argued that the expansions of &#x02264; 6 alanine residues remain without clinical consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Our findings in two Asian families provide for the first time molecular evidence to reinforce this hypothesis, as we show that there is repeat polymorphism in PolAR and that an addition of 2 alanine residues in the PolAR is not associated with the SPD1 phenotype. The presence of identical repeat polymorphisms and mutations in two geographically different families is a rare finding. The observation in the Pakistani family shows that the mutation as well as the normal repeat polymorphism in PolAR are inherited meiotically stable over ~6 generations. Nonetheless, our data does not indicate the 2 alanine repeat expansion in itself has a modifier effect on SPD1 phenotype. The phenotype in subjects harbouring both a 7 alanine expansion and a 2 alanine expansion <italic>in trans </italic>is not remarkably distinct from the typical SPD phenotype. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that polyalanine contractions of two and four alanine residues have been described previously without obvious pathogenic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], however, a 7 alanine residues contraction has been shown to be associated with brachydactyly/syndactyly phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Since the proposal of purely clinical classification of non-syndromic syndactylies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], the phenotypic spectrum of SPD has broadened extensively (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]). In certain instances, it overlaps with other well-characterized syndactyly types. For instance, isolated webbing of 3/4 fingers (MIM 185900) has been observed in the panel of SPD1 families reported by Goodman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and is also present in the present two Asian families. Secondly, another separate entity, isolated 2/3 toes cutaneous syndactyly, has also been observed in SPD1 family subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The phenotypic overlap of SPD1 with clinically and genetically distinct syndactylies calls for further investigations. It is quite likely that there is a crosstalk between <italic>HOXD13 </italic>and the type I syndactyly locus (or loci) in defining the limb phenotype. We are embarking upon further studies in order to understand this clinical and genetic heterogeneity observed in synpolydactyly families.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Synpolydactyly is clinically and genetically very heterogeneous; however distinct non-overlapping clinical variants have been identified in families with synpolydactyly type I (SPD1). When a minor variant occurs as a predominant phenotype in a given family, it should not be considered as a separate entity. The expansion of two alanine residues in the polyalanine repeat of HOXD13 is not associated with an SPD phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SM and MW recruited the Pakistani family subjects, SH and WA coordinated.
