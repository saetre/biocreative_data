Family, twin, and adoption studies have demonstrated that schizophrenia is predominantly a genetic disorder, with a high heritability (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b01">1</xref>&#x0005d;). Multiple genetic and nongenetic factors are likely to be involved &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b02">2</xref>&#x0005d;. As part of a genome-wide search for loci contributing to risk for schizophrenia, we previously reported linkage, with a maximum heterogeneity lod score of 6.5, to chromosome 1q21-1q22 (SCZD9) in a group of 22 medium-sized Canadian families that were selected for study because multiple relatives were clinically diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;. We have also reported the results of fine linkage mapping of this 1q21-1q22 region in the same sample of individuals, narrowing the region most likely to harbor this susceptibility locus to approximately 1 Mb between APOA2 and D1S2675, again with a maximum multipoint heterogeneity lod score of 6.5 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b04">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Other studies have also reported linkage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b05">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b08">8</xref>&#x0005d; and linkage disequilibrium (LD) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b09">9</xref>&#x0005d; of schizophrenia to this region. More recently, we have tested markers from this region for evidence of LD to schizophrenia, identifying significant LD with several markers within the gene for carboxyl-terminal PDZ ligand of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (CAPON; also termed nitric oxide synthase 1 &#x0005b;neuronal&#x0005d; adaptor protein &#x0005b;NOS1AP&#x0005d;) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within <italic>CAPON</italic> to schizophrenia has recently been replicated in the Chinese Han population &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b11">11</xref>&#x0005d;, although with association detected in the Chinese sample to SNPs located more distal in the gene than the SNPs associated in the Canadian sample.</p><p>CAPON is an attractive candidate for schizophrenia susceptibility. CAPON was first identified in the rat as a neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) binding protein, capable of disrupting the association of nNOS with the postsynaptic density scaffolding proteins PSD93 and PSD95 through the binding of the carboxyl terminus of CAPON to nNOS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b12">12</xref>&#x0005d;. The interaction of nNOS with PSD93 and PSD95 is important in targeting nNOS to the postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) complex and facilitates the tight coupling between activation of the NMDAR and nNOS, allowing nNOS activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the NMDAR and producing NMDAR-mediated NO release into the synaptic structures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;. This places CAPON at the scene of NMDAR glutamate neurotransmission, long proposed to be involved in schizophrenia (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;). CAPON can also serve as an nNOS adaptor protein, with the amino terminus binding either to a direct target of NO-mediated activation by S-nitrosylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b16">16</xref>&#x0005d; or to Synapsin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d;, resulting in the localization of nNOS to the presynaptic terminals.</p><p>Sequencing of the coding region of <italic>CAPON</italic> in individuals from the Canadian linkage sample failed to identify any coding mutations associated with illness &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b10">10</xref>&#x0005d;, consistent with current results for other candidate genes for schizophrenia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>CAPON</italic> has a large, approximately 300-kb genomic extent, only 1.5 kb of which represents coding sequence. Therefore, there are many potential sites for regulatory sequences that could be disrupted and lead to altered gene expression. In this study, we screened a human cDNA library to identify possible alternative splice forms of <italic>CAPON,</italic> documented <italic>CAPON</italic> mRNA and protein expression in postmortem tissue from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of human brains, and investigated the expression of <italic>CAPON</italic> by quantitative real-time PCR in the Stanley Array Collection, derived from DLPFCs of individuals with schizophrenia and with bipolar disorder, and a set who were psychiatrically normal controls.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification and Characterization of CAPON Transcripts</title><p>A human fetal brain arrayed cDNA library (Origene Technologies, Rockville, Maryland, United States; #LLFB-1001) was screened using the supplier's protocol.

Exon 10 sequence was chosen for screening purposes to identify alternative transcripts that also contained the nNOS-binding PDZ domain. Individual positive clones were sequenced on a CEQ 8000 (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, California, United States). The transcript for the previously undescribed short isoform was further characterized by 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; RACE, performed with RACE-ready cDNA from human brain (Ambion, Austin, Texas, United States). For each reaction, a pair of nested PCR primers were designed from short-form 5&#x02032; UTR sequences (5RACES, 5&#x02032;- TTAGAGGTTCCTGGAGGGTGGTGC-3&#x02032;; 5RACESn, 5&#x02032;- TTGAGTCCAAGGAGAGGGTAGTGG-3&#x02032;) and 3&#x02032; UTR sequence (3RACE1, 5&#x02032;- AATGAATGCAAGCTGATAGCTGAGACTG-3&#x02032;; 3RACE1n, 5&#x02032;- TGAATCACTGCCACTTGGGTCAGG-3&#x02032;; 3RACE2, 5&#x02032;- AGAAGGAAGAACCAGGAAAGTGAGATCC-3&#x02032;; 3RACE2n, 5&#x02032;- ATCCAGTGTGGCTGAGCCTACCTAGC-3&#x02032;; and 3RACE3, 5&#x02032;- ATGTGGATGGAGAGGGCTTGT-3&#x02032;; 3RACE3n, 5&#x02032;- GTGAGGAAGGCCGCTTCTAAAT-3&#x02032;) and were used in conjunction with a set of universal nested primers (supplied).

This is a collection of biomaterials derived from postmortem brain specimens from 35 individuals with schizophrenia, 35 individuals with bipolar disorder, and 35 psychiatrically normal controls. Diagnoses were made by two senior psychiatrists, applying DSM-IV criteria to medical records, and, when necessary, telephone interviews with family members. Diagnoses of unaffected controls were based on structured interviews by a senior psychiatrist with family member(s) to rule out DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses of psychiatric clinical syndromes.</p><p>Specimens were collected, with informed consent from next of kin, by participating medical examiners between January 1995 and June 2002. The specimens were collected, processed, and stored in a standardized way. Exclusion criteria for all specimens included: (1) significant structural brain pathology on postmortem examination by a qualified neuropathologist, or by premortem imaging; (2) history of significant focal neurological signs premortem; (3) history of central nervous system disease that could be expected to alter gene expression in a persistent way; (4) documented IQ under 70; or (5) poor RNA quality. RNA integrity and purity were determined with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, California, United States). Degradation was defined as a shift in the RNA size distribution toward smaller fragments and a decrease in fluorescence signal of ribosomal peaks. Additional exclusion criteria for unaffected controls included age less than 30 (thus, still in the period of maximum risk) and substance abuse within 1 y of death or evidence of significant alcohol-related changes in the liver.</p><p>DNA and RNA from Brodmann's area 46 (in the DLPFC) was available for all individuals in the collection. Genotyping and expression analyses were conducted with the samples coded to keep investigators blind to diagnostic status. After the blind was broken, diagnostic status and a range of clinical variables were provided for analysis. These included gender, race, age at time of death, age of onset, postmortem interval (PMI), brain pH, total brain weight, hemisphere used for RNA extraction, smoking status at time of death (coded as nonsmoking for individuals who smoked previously but had quit), antipsychotic status at time of death, and lifetime antipsychotic exposure in fluphenazine milligram equivalents. In addition, lifetime alcohol and substance use were each rated on a scale of 0 to 5 using the categories &#x0201c;little or none,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;social,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;moderate past,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;moderate present,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;heavy past,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;heavy present.&#x0201d; Total sample storage time was calculated from date of death to date of experiment, so it represents the sum of storage time of the brain tissue prior to RNA extraction and storage time of the extracted RNA. Overall, the sample was 66&#x00025; male, with a mean age at death of 44 y (standard deviation &#x0005b;SD&#x0005d; 8.9 y, range 19&#x02013;64 y), and was predominantly Caucasian (97&#x00025;). The mean PMI was 33 h (SD 16 h, range 9&#x02013;84 h), and the mean storage time was 5.0 y (SD 1.9 y, range 2.1&#x02013;9.7 y). Smoking status at time of death was available for 67 individuals, with 72&#x00025; of the sample smokers. Lifetime alcohol use estimates were available on all but one patient, with 57&#x00025; of the sample reporting no, little, or social use, 17&#x00025; reporting past or present moderate use, and 26&#x00025; reporting past or present heavy use. Lifetime substance use estimates were available on all but two individuals, with 65&#x00025; of the sample reporting no, little, or social use, 16&#x00025; reporting past or present moderate use, and 19&#x00025; reporting past or present heavy use. The mean age of onset for the schizophrenia group was 21.3 y (SD 6.1 y, range 9&#x02013;34 y) and for the bipolar group was 25.1 y (SD 9.1 y, range 14&#x02013;48 y).

Individuals ranged in age from 53 to 90 years at time of death (mean 67.4 y, SD 16.4 y). Samples were recovered and frozen after a mean PMI of 21.5 h (SD 3.0 h, range 17.8&#x02013;26.0 h). Specimens were shipped frozen for protein and RNA extraction in our laboratory. Mean storage time prior to extraction for these specimens was 3.0 y (SD 1.4 y, range 1.9&#x02013;5.3 y); protein and RNA was quantified within 1 wk of extraction. To assure a similar composition of each sample for protein and RNA extractions, samples were first ground while still frozen into a fine powder using liquid nitrogen and a mortar and pestle. Aliquots of this homogeneous powder were then used for protein and RNA extraction as below.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Preparation and Western Blotting of Human Brain Homogenates</title><p>Tissue from Brodmann's area 46 (DLPFC) from the Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center samples was homogenized with 10 times the equivalent volume per weight of TEE (25 mM Tris-HCl &#x0005b;pH 7.4&#x0005d;, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM PMSF) using a serrated Teflon pestle. Ten micrograms of protein were loaded and resolved on a 12&#x00025; SDS polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, United States) in transfer buffer lacking SDS, which was determined to interfere with detection of the short isoform of CAPON (CAPON-S). Blots were probed with a rabbit antibody to CAPON (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California, United States; #R-300) and visualized using ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States) with a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. For actin normalization, blots were incubated in strip buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl &#x0005b;pH 7.4&#x0005d;, 2&#x00025; SDS, and 90 &#x003bc;M &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol) at 65 &#x000b0;C for 20 min with agitation, followed by probing with a rabbit antibody to actin (the antigen corresponds to amino acids 20&#x02013;33, conserved in all actin isoforms; Sigma, Saint Louis, Missouri, United States) using the procedure described above. To ensure that quantification used an exposure that was within the linear range of the film used to image the blot, a series of images with increasing exposure time to the blot were developed. The intensity of the bands on each image was quantified using Image Pro image analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, Maryland, United States) and plotted to determined at what exposure time the darkest band intensities were no longer in the linear range. Nonsaturated exposures were then used to determine the ratio of CAPON to actin.

This primer pair produces a 338-bp product that spans the boundary of exons 7 and 8. The primers specific for the short form were designed using Primer Express Software Version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States). The forward primer (Short-F: 5&#x02032;- CATTCATGTCCCTCTCTTCTCTC-3&#x02032;) is located in the 5&#x02032; coding sequence that is unique to the short form transcript, the reverse primer (Short-R, 5&#x02032;- AATGCAGGTCCTCTGGCTTAG-3&#x02032;) is located within exon 10, and the pair produces a 321-bp product that spans the boundary of exons 9 and 10. The housekeeping gene <italic>ACTB,</italic> the gene encoding beta-actin, was used as reference gene to normalize the total RNA input. The forward (b-actin-F, 5&#x02032;- CATCCTCACCCTGAAGTACCC-3&#x02032;) and reverse (b-actin-R, 5&#x02032;- GAGAAGATGACCCAGATCATGTTT-3&#x02032;) primers produce a 184-bp product that spans the boundary of exons 3 and 4. Real-time PCR analysis was conducted using 1 &#x003bc;l of a 1:5 dilution of cDNA, 0.1 &#x003bc;M of each primer, and 5 &#x003bc;l of SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a total reaction volume of 10 &#x003bc;l in a 384-well plate on an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems). Samples were initially warmed to 50 &#x000b0;C for 2 min, then the AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase was activated by heating to 95 &#x000b0;C for 10 min. PCR amplification was performed with 40&#x02013;50 cycles of 95 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, 58 &#x000b0;C (full-length experiments) or 61 &#x000b0;C (short-form experiments) for 40 s, and 72 &#x000b0;C for 1 min. Each real-time PCR assay was repeated three times. The standard curve used for determining the relative quantity of each isoform in each sample was constructed by the amplification of serial dilutions of pooled brain cDNA.

Three clones (&#x0201c;<italic>CAPON</italic> full-length&#x0201d;) contained inserts of approximately 2.5 kb, corresponding to exons 1&#x02013;10, as previously described in the NCBI reference sequence for <italic>CAPON</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;, except that exon 4 from these clones was missing the first 15 bp listed in the reference sequence. The fourth clone (&#x0201c;<italic>CAPON</italic> short-form&#x0201d;) contained an insert of 4 kb with a unique 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) corresponding to genomic sequence from intron 8, followed by exons 9 and 10, and a 3&#x02032; UTR longer than that contained by the other clones or in the reference sequence. This transcript is predicted to produce a 211 amino acid protein, including 18 novel amino acids at the amino terminus, and will contain the CAPON PDZ-binding domain.</p><p>The previously undescribed short-form transcript of <italic>CAPON</italic> was further characterized by 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; RACE. The 5&#x02032; UTR was 2,367 bp, while the longest 3&#x02032; RACE product ended 2,556 bp downstream of the stop codon. From these results, the total length of the short-form mRNA was calculated to be 5,559 bp. Due to the much longer 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTRs, the <italic>CAPON</italic> transcript encoding the short-form of the protein is actually significantly longer than the transcript that encodes the full-length protein. The gene, transcripts, and predicted protein structures of the two forms are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020263-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Protein and total RNA were extracted from Brodmann's area 46 (DLPFC) of postmortem samples from five normal controls, COS-7 cell that had been transfected with cDNA encoding the CAPON short-form, and untransfected COS-7 cells that normally express the CAPON long form. Western blots of these samples were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of CAPON. This antibody is predicted to interact with both the full-length and short-form of CAPON, since the antigen used to generate the antibody is in the carboxyl termini of both forms. Bands were observed at the expected sizes, near the 75-kDa marker for the full-length protein and near the 30-kDa marker for the short-form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020263-g002">Figure 2</xref>). There appears to be two smaller forms of the full-length CAPON (CAPON-L bracket, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020263-g002">Figure 2</xref>), which could be due to posttranslational modification (i.e., phosphorylation) of CAPON. For example, analysis by software designed to identify potential sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mpr.nci.nih.gov/mpr/ScanProteinForPKCSitesPage.aspx">http://mpr.nci.nih.gov/mpr/ScanProteinForPKCSitesPage.aspx</ext-link>) identified five such sites in the full-length CAPON sequence. The short form of CAPON appears as a doublet, although the presence of the lower band (CAPON-S&#x02032;) in untransfected COS-7 cells may indicate that this band is caused by recognition by the CAPON antibody of a cross-reacting protein. The appearance of the higher band (CAPON-S) in the transfected cells, which clearly comigrates with a band in human brain tissue, indicates that the short-form transcript is translated into a protein of the expected size in DLPFC.</p><p>As protein samples were not available for the Stanley Array Collection samples, we tested the correlation between protein and RNA expression using the normal control brain samples to determine if RNA levels could be used as a reasonable indicator of protein expression for CAPON. CAPON protein levels were quantified from Western blot image analysis and were normalized to levels of actin protein, while RNA levels were quantified by reverse-transcription real-time PCR normalized to levels of <italic>ACTB</italic> (beta-actin). For full-length CAPON, the correlation between protein and RNA levels was significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.019) with <italic>r</italic> = 0.94. For the short form, the correlation was also significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0049) with <italic>r</italic> = 0.97 between the RNA and protein levels of the S band, which corresponds to the size of the cloned CAPON product. While it seems likely that the S&#x02032; band represents a cross-reacting protein, given its presence in untransfected COS-7 cells, it is possible that it could represent a modified form of the short-form protein. Considering the CAPON short-form product as the sum of the S and S&#x02032; bands, the correlation with RNA levels remained significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.030), with <italic>r</italic> = 0.91.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Analysis of CAPON Isoform Expression by Diagnosis</title><p>Expression levels of both <italic>CAPON</italic> isoforms were determined by reverse-transcription real-time PCR for all 105 samples from the Stanley Array Collection.

No significant correlations were detected between mRNA levels of either <italic>CAPON</italic> isoform and the potentially confounding variables of age at death, PMI, brain pH, brain weight, gender, hemisphere, smoking status at time of death, lifetime alcohol use, or lifetime substance abuse (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0020263-t001">Table 1</xref>). <italic>CAPON</italic> expression levels were found to be significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) correlated with length of sample storage for both isoforms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0020263-t001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, for all subsequent analyses storage time was used as covariate.</p><p>The potential confounding effects of antipsychotic medication treatment on <italic>CAPON</italic> expression levels were also very important to examine, but since all of the patients with schizophrenia and none of the controls had been treated with such medications, the effects of treatment and diagnosis could not be separated by analyses that included these groups. Within the 35 individuals in the bipolar group, however, 18 individuals were on antipsychotic medication at the time of death, 11 individuals had never received antipsychotic medication, and six individuals were not on antipsychotic medication at time of death, but had been treated with these medications at some point in the past. <italic>CAPON</italic> levels were compared between antipsychotic-treated and untreated individuals with bipolar disorder. Neither a positive history of lifetime antipsychotic use nor antipsychotic use at time of death was significantly correlated with <italic>CAPON</italic> short-form expression within the bipolar group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0020263-t002">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, expression of full-length <italic>CAPON</italic> was significantly correlated with treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0020263-t002">Table 2</xref>), with a 40&#x00025; decrease in mean expression in the patients (<italic>n</italic> = 24) with bipolar disorder and a history of treatment with antipsychotics in the past or at time of death (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003), and a 45&#x00025; decrease in patients (<italic>n</italic> = 18) receiving antipsychotics at time of death (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0007), when compared to antipsychotic-untreated individuals (<italic>n</italic> = 11) with bipolar disorder. An estimate of total lifetime antipsychotic medication was available for all but one individual in the bipolar and schizophrenia groups with a positive history of antipsychotic treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 58). No significant correlations were found between levels of lifetime antipsychotic exposure and expression of either <italic>CAPON</italic> isoform (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0020263-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Overall, there was no significant difference in <italic>CAPON</italic> full-length mRNA expression across diagnostic categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020263-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Since treatment with antipsychotics may influence expression of the full-length isoform, we examined expression of this transcript in antipsychotic-na&#x000ef;ve patients with bipolar disorder. While mean <italic>CAPON</italic> full-length mRNA levels were increased by 24&#x00025; in patients with bipolar disorder but no history of exposure to antipsychotic medication (<italic>n</italic> = 11) as compared to normal controls, this increase did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = 0.11). Results were similar when comparing bipolar patients not receiving antipsychotic medication at time of death, regardless of past treatment history, (<italic>n</italic> = 17) to normal controls, with a 18&#x00025; increase in full-length <italic>CAPON</italic> levels (<italic>p</italic> = 0.14).</p><p>Mean <italic>CAPON</italic> short-form mRNA levels were significantly increased by 48&#x00025; in the schizophrenia group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0035) and 50&#x00025; in the bipolar group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0002) as compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020263-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The schizophrenia and bipolar groups did not differ significantly from each other in <italic>CAPON</italic> short-form expression (<italic>p</italic> = 0.94). <italic>CAPON</italic> short-form expression was significantly correlated with the age of onset in the schizophrenia group (Pearson's <italic>r</italic> = 0.53, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0008), but not in the bipolar group (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.02, <italic>p</italic> = 0.92). This significance (or lack thereof) is unchanged when age of death is included as a covariate. The majority of samples were from individuals of European decent (97&#x00025;), with one African American individual with bipolar disorder, one Native American individual with bipolar disorder, and one Hispanic individual with schizophrenia.

None of the SNPs showed significant expression differences between individuals heterozygous or homozygous for the associated allele.

Our screen used only primers from exon 10, so we would not have detected isoforms lacking this portion of the gene. One of the two identified transcripts encompasses ten exons and encodes a 501 amino acid protein containing two known functional domains, an amino-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain and a carboxyl-terminal PDZ-binding domain. This full-length form corresponds to transcripts previously identified in the rat and human &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;. The second transcript contains the last two exons of <italic>CAPON</italic> and is predicted to produce a short form of the protein, 211 amino acids long and containing the PDZ-binding domain. Prior work has demonstrated that the terminal 125 amino acids of the full-length protein are sufficient to bind the PDZ-domain of nNOS and interfere with the binding between nNOS and PSD93 or PSD95 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b12">12</xref>&#x0005d;.

A physiological role of the short form would likely be limited to the competitive inhibition of binding of other ligands to the PDZ domains of nNOS and PSD93 or PSD95.</p><p>There are significant obstacles to the study of gene expression in the human brain. Obtaining high-quality postmortem samples suitable for RNA extraction is difficult and labor-intensive. Obtaining appropriate matched control groups is also a challenge. While it may be possible to collect samples with relative consistency across some variables, such as PMI or brain pH, many factors that may potentially affect gene expression, such as treatment history and substance use, are beyond the control of investigators. The rate of collection of individuals with too many clinical restrictions (e.g., treatment-na&#x000ef;ve individuals with schizophrenia and no history of substance abuse, alcohol use, or smoking) would be too slow to produce a useful number of samples. Added to these clinical variables is likely etiological heterogeneity, with only a subset of affected individuals expected to harbor a primary causative mutation in any given gene. All of these factors may lessen the chance that significant differences in gene expression can be demonstrated using a particular sample.</p><p>We chose to conduct our expression studies using the Stanley Array Collection, as this collection contains samples from more individuals than other postmortem collections, and the samples were collected in a standardized fashion with an emphasis on obtaining high-quality RNA for expression studies. Limitations of this collection include the facts that protein samples were not available for parallel analysis, and that only one brain region, the DLPFC, was available for study. However, this brain region has long been hypothesized to be involved in schizophrenia, implicated by evidence from neuropsychological, neuroimaging, histopathological, and neurochemical studies (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020263-b24">24</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>Our results suggest that mRNA expression of the short-form of <italic>CAPON</italic> is significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005) increased in patients with either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. If the short-form protein behaves as predicted, it would disrupt the binding of nNOS to PSD95 through competitive inhibition and remove nNOS from the NMDAR complex, thereby decoupling NO generation from NMDAR activation. This could produce a picture consistent with the NMDAR hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia. Based on our data, expression of short-form mRNA does not appear sensitive to treatment with antipsychotic medication. Full-length <italic>CAPON</italic> mRNA expression, in contrast, appears to be highly influenced by treatment with antipsychotic medication, at least in bipolar disorder. It will be of interest to further investigate and confirm this effect in subsequent studies. Pre- and postexposure expression studies in animals may be helpful in determining if the relationship between antipsychotic treatment and decreased <italic>CAPON</italic> mRNA expression is causal. While we found no significant group differences in expression levels between patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and normal controls, it is possible that this is due to the normalization of full-length <italic>CAPON</italic> mRNA expression by antipsychotic treatment. Additional expression studies in individuals with schizophrenia not receiving antipsychotic medication would be of great interest to assess this possibility.</p><p>The Stanley Array Collection consists of samples collected from several locations within the United States, and therefore represents a sample that is independent from our Canadian familial schizophrenia collection.

Because of the limitations of working with human postmortem samples, it is likely that most of the next round of experiments will be done in cell culture and in animal models.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Where Can I Find More Information Online?</title><p>The following Web sites provide information on schizophrenia.</p><p>US National Institutes of Mental Health (search for &#x0201c;schizophrenia&#x0201d;): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/</ext-link></p><p>UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence pages on schizophrenia: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=42770">http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=42770</ext-link></p><p>The National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.narsad.org/">http://www.narsad.org/</ext-link></p><p>The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI):</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nami.org/">http://www.nami.org/</ext-link></p><p>The Schizophrenia Society of Canada:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.schizophrenia.ca/">http://www.schizophrenia.ca/</ext-link></p></sec></sec></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by grant R01 MH62440 to LMB and BLF from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and K25 AA015346 to SB from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. Blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to CAPON and actin, and proteins were detected using chemiluminescence. Band intensities for CAPON-L, CAPON-S, and CAPON-S + CAPON-S&#x02032; were calculated and normalized to the intensities of the corresponding actin bands. Untransfected COS-7 cells expressing CAPON-L and CAPON-S&#x02032; (COS-7/NT) and COS-7 cells expressing recombinant CAPON-S (COS-7/CAPON-S) and were used as controls for these proteins.
