Relatively little is known as to how WRN-1 functions in DNA repair and DNA damage signaling. Here, we take advantage of the genetic and cytological approaches in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to dissect the epistatic relationship of WRN-1 in various DNA damage checkpoint pathways. We found that WRN-1 is required for CHK1 phosphorylation induced by DNA replication inhibition, but not by UV radiation. Furthermore, WRN-1 influences the RPA-1 focus formation, suggesting that WRN-1 functions in the same step or upstream of RPA-1 in the DNA replication checkpoint pathway. In response to ionizing radiation, RPA-1 focus formation and nuclear localization of ATM depend on WRN-1 and MRE-11. We conclude that <italic>C. elegans</italic> WRN-1 participates in the initial stages of checkpoint activation induced by DNA replication inhibition and ionizing radiation. These functions of WRN-1 in upstream DNA damage signaling are likely to be conserved, but might be cryptic in human systems due to functional redundancy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Werner syndrome is a premature aging syndrome associated with genomic instability. The protein linked to Werner syndrome, WRN, has both helicase and exonuclease activities and is thought to be involved in DNA repair, including the resolution of replication fork arrest as well as in telomere maintenance.

We take advantage of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> germ cell system to explore DNA damage response defects associated with WRN, and we focus particularly on the role of <italic>wrn</italic> in the cell cycle checkpoint in response to DNA replication blockage and ionizing radiation (IR).

Germ cell cycle arrest results in enlarged cells and nuclei due to cessation of cell division while cellular growth continues unabated. CHK-1 phosphorylation was also observed in the majority of germ cell nuclei after UV radiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000801-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). One hour after &#x003b3;-irradiation (IR: ionizing radiation), phosphorylation of CHK-1 was observed in germ cell nuclei at the pachytene and transition stages but not in those of the mitotically proliferating region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000801-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To ask why phosphorylation of CHK1 Ser345 is detected in some cells of the proliferating region after UV treatment but not after IR treatment, we labeled S-phase cells with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Adult worms were exposed to BrdU for 30 min and irradiated with UV or IR, followed by incubation of 1 h in the absence of BrdU. Thereafter the gonads were simultaneously reacted with antibodies against BrdU and pCHK1-Ser345. Incorporation of BrdU into chromosomal DNA was observed in medium-sized germ cells of the mitotic region, but not in smaller and larger cells (marked by yellow arrows) that are probably in G1 or G2 phase, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000801-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Likewise, medium-sized UV-treated germ cells showed nuclear BrdU-staining, and only those cells (marked by white arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000801-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) were positive for pCHK1-Ser345, suggesting that CHK1-Ser345 phosphorylation is associated with S phase. One hour after IR treatment, none of the germ cells were positive for pCHK1-Ser345, although more than half of the IR-treated cells in the distal part of the germ line showed nuclear BrdU-staining.

The dependence of CHK-1 phosphorylation on WRN-1 and ATL-1 after DNA replication inhibition was also confirmed by Western blotting of worm extracts with the pSer345 CHK1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000801-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that CHK-1 phosphorylation is reduced in <italic>wrn-1</italic> and <italic>atl-1</italic> in the extracts.

Therefore, the helicase activity of WRN-1 seems not to be essential for checkpoint function. However, this activity is probably essential for the function of WRN-1 in DNA repair, since the <italic>wrn-1(tm764)</italic> as well as the <italic>wrn-1(gk99)</italic> mutation resulted in increased frequency of developmental defects in response to IR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000801.s001">Figure S1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000801.s001">S1F</xref>).

Although we place WRN-1 in the same step as RPA-1, upstream of ATR and CHK1, WRN-1 is not as essential for worm survival under normal conditions as these three checkpoint proteins. A possible reason for this difference is that WRN-1 may only respond to exogenously induced stalls of replication forks, but not to those formed spontaneously.

The absence of CHK-1-Ser345 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000801-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) is in line with a previous report showing that Ser345 of CHK1 is not phosphorylated by IR in mammalian cells whereas Ser317, which is not conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, is phosphorylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000801-Gatei1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. We thus hypothesize that some other residue in <italic>C. elegans</italic> CHK-1 is phosphorylated after IR to activate the protein.</p><p>In summary, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of human WRN helicase, WRN-1, regulates the DNA damage signaling pathway induced by DNA replication inhibition and double-stranded DNA breaks upstream of ATR, probably at or close to the step involving RPA localization, and upstream of ATM. Human WRN was recently found to be essential for the activation of ATM after treating cells with UV-activated psoralen and hydroxyurea, but ATM activation induced by &#x003b3;-rays was not dependent on WRN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000801-Cheng4">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. These results in humans differ from our findings in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where WRN-1 is required for the nuclear accumulation of ATM induced by DSBs, as well as for activation of ATR and CHK1 at stalled replications forks. Presumably, the relative levels of key proteins involved in DNA damage signaling vary between organisms, tissues, and cell types, so that the extent of the contribution of various proteins of each (sub)pathway is likely to differ between organisms. We therefore consider that the upstream DNA damage signaling functions of WRN-1 uncovered here are likely to be conserved, but might be cryptic in human systems due to functional redundancy. It will be interesting to follow up this possibility in future studies and to ask how <italic>C. elegans</italic> WRN-1 recruits and activates RPA and ATM in response to checkpoint activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains and EST Clones</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strain Bristol N2 was maintained as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000801-Brenner1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> at 20&#x000b0;C unless noted.
