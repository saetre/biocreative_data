Thus, centrosome amplification and mitotic checkpoint dysfunctions are believed possible causes of chromosomal instability. The Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (<italic>RB</italic>) participates in the regulation of synchrony between DNA synthesis and centrosome duplication and it is involved in transcription regulation of some mitotic genes.

Despite altered expression of genes involved in the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) the checkpoint seemed to function properly in pRb-depleted fibroblasts. In particular <italic>AURORA-A </italic>and <italic>PLK1 </italic>overexpression suggested that these two genes might have a role in the observed genomic instability. However, when they were post-transcriptionally silenced in pRb-depleted fibroblasts we did not observe reduction in the number of aneuploid cells. This finding suggests that overexpression of these two genes did not contribute to genomic instability triggered by <italic>RB </italic>acute loss although it affected cell proliferation.

Altogether, our results suggest that pRb-depleted primary human fibroblasts possess an intact spindle checkpoint and that micronuclei, likely caused by mis-attached kinetochores that in turn trigger chromosome segregation errors, are responsible for aneuploidy in primary human fibroblasts where pRb is acutely depleted.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Genomic instability is a hallmark of the vast majority of human cancers. The predominant form of genomic instability in human cancer is chromosome instability (CIN), which is characterized by gains or losses of whole chromosomes (aneuploidy) and chromosomal structural aberrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that CIN and aneuploidy, a long time considered late progression events to be associated with tumors, indeed represent early molecular changes seen in preneoplastic lesions of human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Aneuploidy occurrence could generate in a single step multiple changes required for tumor initiation and progression and is frequently observed in clinical tumor specimens. However, it is still debated whether aneuploidy is the consequence or the cause of tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Duplicated chromosomes must be equally segregated between the two daughter cells during cell division, and errors in this process can lead to aneuploidy. The presence of chromosomal gains and losses, particularly at early stages of carcinogenesis, has suggested that the impairment of chromosome segregation fidelity might play a central role in the genesis of cancers. However, the mechanism responsible for aneuploidy in the earliest stages of tumorigenesis is poorly understood. At least two possible causes, not mutually exclusive, could be responsible for aneuploidy: mutations in genes encoding mitotic regulators, like spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins, and defects in centrosome homeostasis.</p><p>Altered expression of genes involved in the SAC that monitors the correct alignment and attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, such as <italic>BUB1</italic>, <italic>PTTG1</italic>, <italic>MAD2 (Mad2L1) </italic>and <italic>BUB1B</italic>, induced aneuploidy in mammalian cells in culture, however, they were rarely found mutated in human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Further studies provided evidence that reduced expression of some of these genes contributes to defective spindle checkpoint controls. In fact deletion of one <italic>MAD2 </italic>allele resulted in a defective mitotic checkpoint in both human tumor cells and murine primary fibroblasts (MEFs), and <italic>BUB1B </italic>haploinsufficiency in mice resulted in defective mitotic arrest as well as tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Recently, it was reported a hereditary mutation of the <italic>BUB1B </italic>gene in patients with mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) a rare genetic disease with increased cancer risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>MAD2 </italic>overexpression was associated with stable inactivation of the Retinoblastoma (<italic>RB</italic>) gene by specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Already in the past century Theodor Boveri (1914) observed that cells with supernumerary centrosomes mis-segregated their chromosomes through the assembly of multipolar spindles. Centrosome amplification (indicating both numeric and morphological alterations) is a frequent event observed in the majority of solid tumors and it has also been detected in leukemia and lymphoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moreover, centrosome amplification has been associated with genetic instability observed in prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] as well as in preinvasive cancer lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Then, the correct centrosome number, necessary to assemble a bipolar mitotic spindle, is essential for chromosome segregation fidelity thus preventing CIN and aneuploidy.</p><p>Alterations in the two major tumor suppressors <italic>RB </italic>and <italic>TP53 </italic>have been reported to affect chromosome stability. Overexpression of <italic>CYCLIN-E </italic>and mutation of <italic>hCDC4 </italic>gene have been associated with CIN and centrosome amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and recently it has been reported that also p53 deficient cells needed <italic>CYCLIN-E </italic>overexpression to induce CIN and multiple centrosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Halting mitotic progression in human and murine pRb deficient primary fibroblasts resulted in supernumerary centrosomes and aneuploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Inactivation of pRb in human keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] by expression of the HPV16-E7 oncoprotein as well a transient G1/S cell cycle arrest in human fibroblasts and Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) with pRb dysfunction also generated multiple centrosomes and aneuploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, a tightly controlled coupling of centrosome and DNA replication and the mitotic cycle is necessary to generate correct segregation for both chromosomes and centrosomes.</p><p>To avoid any side effects caused by additional gene alterations present in tumor cell lines, we used IMR90 human diploid primary fibroblasts to investigate the mechanism(s) by which cells might become aneuploid. To this aim we analyzed the effects of acute loss of the Retinoblastoma (<italic>RB</italic>) gene function on centrosomes and genomic instability by using the RNA interference (siRNAs mediated) knockdown methodology. Here we show that in addition to supernumerary centrosomes acutely pRb-depleted human fibroblasts harbored micronuclei. Our results indicate that micronuclei formation caused by aneugenic events leading to chromosome loss, likely originating from erroneous kinetochore attachment, and not spindle assembly checkpoint dysfunctions are the trigger for aneuploidy in pRb-depleted primary human fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Acute loss of pRb in primary human fibroblasts generates supernumerary centrosomes, aneuploidy and changes in expression of genes necessary for centrosome duplication and mitotic progression</title><p>Previously, we showed that in pRb deficient human cells (expressing the HPV16-E7 oncoprotein) centrosome amplification triggered aneuploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and acute loss of pRb in MEFs caused centrosome amplification and aneuploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, because HPV16-E7 oncoprotein could have additional cellular effects besides pRb inactivation, and murine cells have less stringent checkpoints than human cells, we used primary human fibroblasts to investigate whether pRb acute loss by RNA interference affected chromosomal stability. Conventional RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that transfection of siRNA oligonucleotides specifically targeting <italic>RB </italic>reduced both <italic>RB </italic>transcript and protein levels when compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

The number of pRb-depleted cells with amplified centrosomes decreased after ten days in culture (data not shown). Supernumerary centrosomes generating multipolar spindle, as revealed after &#x003b2;-tubulin immunostaining, might be responsible for chromosomal missegregation and successive aneuploidy observed after acute loss of pRb in human fibroblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, c</xref>).</p><p>Then we addressed whether these cells had acquired genomic instability by carrying out conventional cytogenetics analyses. Alterations in the normal number of chromosomes were frequently observed in human fibroblasts acutely depleted of pRb but not in their wild-type parental counterpart. Karyotype analysis done after 4 days from siRNAs transfection revealed aneuploidy in 50% of analyzed metaphases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and the majority (80%) were hypodiploid (&#x0003c; 46 chromosomes). Recently, we found that in pRb deficient murine cells acute loss of pRb induced altered expression of genes involved in centrosome homeostasis and mitosis progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Then, we determined whether also in primary human fibroblasts acute loss of pRb altered the expression of some genes involved in chromosomal/centrosome dynamics that might be relevant for genomic stability. Quantitative real time RT-PCR confirmed that IMR90 cells at 72 hours from transfection had a very low level of <italic>RB </italic>expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). We found increased transcripts levels of genes necessary for centrosome duplication and mitotic progression as <italic>AURORA-A </italic>and <italic>PLK1 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). In addition pRb acute loss was associated with decreased <italic>MAD2 </italic>transcript levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) a gene belonging to the category of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) genes. Western blotting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>) and successive densitometry analysis of Western blots confirmed Real Time RT-PCR results. In particular quantification of Western blot band intensity indicated a two-fold increase for <italic>AURORA-A </italic>protein level, about 1.5 fold change for <italic>PLK1 </italic>protein level and a 50% reduction of MAD2 protein level.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of the spindle assembly checkpoint involvement in triggering chromosomal instability of RB silenced IMR90 cells</title><p>Several lines of evidence implicate that a weakened Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) could be responsible for the generation of aneuploid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The observed decrease in <italic>MAD2 </italic>expression in transient <italic>RB </italic>silenced IMR90 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), resulting in the reduction of a critical SAC component, might be consistent with this view. To determine if other mitotic checkpoint genes in addition to <italic>MAD2 </italic>were also altered in transient <italic>RB </italic>silenced IMR90 cells we extended the Real time RT-PCR to other genes involved in cell cycle, centrosome duplication and Spindle Assembly Checkpoint. Our analysis showed a marked decrease in the expression of <italic>BUB1B </italic>and <italic>CDC20 </italic>(about 50% of reduction), <italic>PTTG1 </italic>and <italic>CHFR </italic>(about 30% of reduction) in pRb acutely depleted cells in comparison to control cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In addition we detected differential expression of genes coding for centromeric proteins namely centromere protein-A (<italic>CENP-A</italic>) overexpression and centromere protein-F (<italic>CENP-F</italic>) down-regulation. Altogether, the reduced expression levels of these genes suggested a possible SAC dysfunction following pRb acute loss. To this aim we estimated the number of mitotic cells (mitotic index) in pRb-depleted cells after treatment with the mitotic inhibitor colcemid that depolymerizes microtubules and blocks metaphase-anaphase transition by activating the SAC. Our data indicated that both pRb-competent and pRb-depleted cells arrested in mitosis exhibiting an increased mitotic index (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, to determine that pRb-depleted cells arrested because of SAC activation we looked at kinetochore accumulation of Mad1, another crucial SAC component, after challenging the checkpoint with colcemid. To this end we looked at Mad1 localization of both pRb-competent and pRb-depleted IMR90 cells, treated with colcemid or left untreated, by immunofluorescence microscopy. As expected after colcemid treatment Mad1 accumulated at kinetochores of both pRb-competent and pRb-depleted cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C a'</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b'</xref>). On the contrary no Mad1 signals were detected in both pRb-competent and pRb-depleted untreated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). These results indicate that human fibroblasts acutely depleted of pRb possess a functional SAC, suggesting that pRb-depleted cells did not undergo a cell cycle arrest before reaching mitosis as revealed by the decrease in gene expression of mitotic genes we observed by Real time RT-PCR (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Therefore, previous findings that tumor cells with <italic>MAD2 </italic>haploinsufficiency did not arrest in mitosis and proceed into a subsequent S phase after mitotic poison treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], are likely to be attributed to some additional genetic mutations present in these tumor cell lines tested.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Evaluation of the spindle assembly checkpoint dysfunction in triggering chromosomal instability of pRb-depleted cells</bold>. <bold>A) </bold>Expression levels of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, centrosome duplication and mitosis progression by TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA).

Western blot analysis confirmed protein decrease in post-transcriptionally silenced cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, bottom panels). By immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, top panel) we observed that cells with multiple centrosomes were slightly reduced after simultaneous RNAi of <italic>RB </italic>and <italic>PLK1 </italic>(14%) in comparison to <italic>RB </italic>alone post-transcriptionally silenced cells (18%). In contrast post-transcriptional <italic>RB </italic>and <italic>AURORA-A </italic>silencing caused a marked reduction of supernumerary centrosomes in <italic>RB/AURORA-A </italic>post-transcriptionally silenced cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, middle panel). These findings suggest that centrosome amplification observed in <italic>RB </italic>depleted fibroblasts as well in <italic>RB/PLK1 </italic>depleted cells might depend on <italic>AURORA-A </italic>overexpression. However, real time RT-PCR done after <italic>RB/PLK1 </italic>double knockdown revealed a very low level of <italic>AURORA-A </italic>mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) suggesting that in these cells centrosome amplification did not depend, at least in part, on <italic>AURORA-A </italic>overexpression. Next, we did conventional cytogenetics to evaluate the presence of aneuploidy in <italic>RB/PLK1 </italic>and <italic>RB/AURORA-A </italic>post-transcriptionally silenced fibroblasts. We scored an increase in hypodiploid cells both in <italic>RB/PLK1 </italic>and <italic>RB/AURORA-A </italic>post-transcriptionally silenced fibroblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, bottom panel). These findings suggest that pRb acute loss could promote genomic instability that depends neither on <italic>PLK1 </italic>nor on <italic>AURORA-A </italic>overexpression. Alternatively, both up-regulation and down-regulation of these two genes could affect genomic stability in primary pRb-depleted cells. In addition the presence of supernumerary centrosomes did not seem the only cause leading to genomic instability in <italic>RB </italic>post-transcriptionally silenced cells. In the attempt to establish a possible role for the observed <italic>PLK1 </italic>or <italic>AURORA-A </italic>overexpression in <italic>RB </italic>post-transcriptionally silenced cells, we looked at proliferation of these cells in culture. Following simultaneous RNA interference of <italic>RB/PLK1 </italic>and <italic>RB/AURORA-A</italic>, IMR90 cells showed a delay in cell proliferation already at 72 hours, and at ten days from transfection these post-transcriptionally silenced cells underwent a permanent arrest. On the contrary pRb alone depleted cells recovered from the initial proliferation delay as soon as two days from transfection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Moreover, Western blot analyses showed increased levels of p21<sup>Cip1 </sup>in cells with knock-down of both <italic>RB </italic>and <italic>AURORA-A or PLK1 </italic>but not in <italic>RB </italic>alone depleted cells, suggesting a possible arrest of proliferation in a small fraction of cells co-depleted for <italic>RB </italic>and either <italic>PLK1 </italic>or <italic>AURORA-A</italic>.

Micronuclei are considered a marker of chromosome damage (chromosome loss or chromosome breakage events) formed during mitosis and identified in interphase as small bodies of extra chromatin in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. We found the presence of micronuclei in pRb-depleted cells (30%) as well as in both <italic>RB/PLK1 </italic>(20%) and <italic>RB/AURORA-A </italic>(18%) double knockdown cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). To determine whether micronuclei harbored acentric chromosomal fragments or whole chromosomes we investigated the presence of centromeres in these micronuclei. Immunofluorescence microscopy conducted using an anti-centromere antibody (CREST) showed that micronuclei contained centromeres suggesting the presence of whole chromosomes therein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B c, d, e</xref>). The control wild type cells did not show the presence of micronuclei by fluorescence microscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B, b</xref>). In addition immunofluorescence microscopy showed the presence of more than one centromeric signal in micronuclei of <italic>RB </italic>silenced cells suggesting the loss of more than one chromosome per cell, that is consistent with the hypodiploid phenotype displayed by pRb-depleted cells. Micronuclei might originate by the presence of lagging chromosomes observed during anaphase in human fibroblasts after <italic>RB </italic>acute loss (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B-a</xref>). This result suggests that micronuclei, which remain separate from the nucleus after nuclear division, might be the most likely way by which pRb-depleted cells become hypodiploid.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Micronuclei generation after pRb acute loss in primary human fibroblasts</bold>. <bold>A) </bold>Bar graphs showing micronuclei percentages scored in <italic>RB </italic>transcriptionally silenced IMR90 cells (siRB) and in IMR90 cells with knock-down of both <italic>RB </italic>and <italic>AURORA-A </italic>or <italic>PLK1 </italic>compared with untransfected cells (untr.) or cells transfected with siRNA-luciferase (siLuc). <bold>B) </bold>Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis detecting the presence of centromeres (green spots) in IMR90 wild-type cells (b), in micronuclei generated following <italic>RB </italic>transcriptional silencing (c), and after knock-down of both <italic>RB </italic>and <italic>PLK1 </italic>(d) or after knock-down of both <italic>RB </italic>and <italic>AURORA-A </italic>(e).

Unlike point mutations that affect only some genes, gains or losses of chromosomes (i.e., aneuploidy) altering dramatically gene expression could generate in a single step multiple changes required for tumor initiation and progression. An aneuploid cell will usually have a higher number of chromosomes (sometimes lower) and will not divide properly, resulting in two cells with different numbers of chromosomes. The mechanisms implicated in the formation of aneuploid cells are still not fully understood. Both alterations in genes controlling centrosome homeostasis and defects in genes encoding mitotic checkpoint proteins could trigger aneuploidy. The presence of supernumerary centrosomes is considered a possible cause of both chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. Supernumerary centrosomes have been associated with p53 and pRb dysfunction caused by the presence of <italic>HPV16-E6 </italic>and -<italic>E7 </italic>oncoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, we showed that pRb but not p53 deficient human cells resulted in aneuploid cells by allowing DNA re-replication associated with centrosomes amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>In mammalian cells DNA replication and centrosome duplication must be completed successfully before mitosis and are tightly regulated by a control network in which pRb plays a crucial role. Previously, we showed that centrosome amplification and aneuploidy occurred only after a prolonged G1/S arrest in MEFs stably devoid of pRb. In addition the presence of these alterations in pRb acutely depleted MEFs highlighted the importance of pRb in the control of genetic stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Here we demonstrate for the first time that <italic>RB </italic>acute loss triggers centrosome amplification and aneuploidy in human primary fibroblasts. We observed reduced expression of crucial Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) components suggesting that this checkpoint might be weakened in these cells and in turn it might be responsible for the observed aneuploidy. However, though fibroblasts acutely depleted of pRb showed <italic>MAD2 </italic>reduction, they did not show premature sister chromatid separation (PCS) that is a hallmark of tumor cells with reduced levels of <italic>MAD2 </italic>and mitotic checkpoint dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition when pRb acutely depleted IMR90 cells were treated with the mitotic poison colcemid they accumulated in mitosis indicating activation and functionality of the SAC checkpoint. Altogether these findings suggest that aneuploidy might not be triggered by SAC dysfunction in human primary fibroblasts acutely depleted of pRb.</p><p>Recently, it was reported that <italic>MAD2 </italic>up-regulation because of stable pRb depletion by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) led to chromosomal instability in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The explanation for this effect of overexpressed <italic>MAD2 </italic>was that part of the population adapted to the activated checkpoint and entered the cell cycle as polyploid cells that in turn could cause chromosome missegregation in the subsequent mitoses. On the contrary our results indicated that acute loss of <italic>RB </italic>in normal human fibroblasts did not cause <italic>MAD2 </italic>overexpression. Our findings suggest that the previously observed <italic>MAD2 </italic>overexpression could be a specific feature of cells stably depleted of pRb. Indeed, we found that <italic>MAD2 </italic>was overexpressed in IMR90 human fibroblasts stably depleted of pRb by transfection of a shRNA-mir (RB.670) targeting specifically human <italic>RB </italic>(data not shown). We found <italic>MAD2 </italic>up-regulation also in pRb-depleted HCT116 cells (A.A. manuscript in preparation), where this up-regulation likely depended on overexpression of <italic>BRCA1 </italic>that binds to the transcription factor OCT-1 and up-regulates <italic>MAD2 </italic>transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, additional genetic changes that occurred during the selection of <italic>RB </italic>stably depleted cells might be the explanation for up-regulation and to be involved in overriding the mitotic checkpoint if activated.</p><p>Critical regulators of mitotic progression and centrosome duplication such as <italic>PLK1 </italic>and <italic>AURORA-A </italic>that are expressed in a cell cycle dependent manner were also upregulated after RB acute loss. Recently, it has been shown that activation of the RB pathway resulted in the repression of Plk1 promoter activity that depended on the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Aurora-A overexpression following pRb depletion is consistent with recent finding that this kinase is under the transcriptional control of E2F3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], a partner of pRb in the regulation of cell cycle transitions. Also Plk1 has been reported to be regulated by E2F3 in bladder cancer cells in addition to known E2F3 targets such as Cyclin A and novel targets including pituitary tumor transforming gene 1 (PTTG1), and Caveolin-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Very recently, several findings have outlined the existence of the functional crosstalk between Plk1 and Aurora-A. Plk1 is activated before mitosis by Aurora-A and its cofactor Bora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, in mitosis Bora degradation is Plk1 dependent, and Plk1 is also required for the timely destruction of Aurora-A in late anaphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To understand the roles played by <italic>PLK1 </italic>and <italic>AURORA-A </italic>overexpression on centrosome amplification and aneuploidy, following pRb acute depletion, we did post-transcriptional silencing of <italic>RB</italic>, <italic>PLK1 </italic>and <italic>RB</italic>, <italic>AURORA-A </italic>simultaneously. Only <italic>RB/AURORA-A </italic>silenced human fibroblasts showed a decrease in the percentage of cells with supernumerary centrosomes suggesting that <italic>AURORA-A </italic>over-expression might be necessary for centrosome amplification to occur. However, <italic>RB/PLK1 </italic>silenced cells showed low transcript levels for <italic>AURORA-A </italic>suggesting that <italic>AURORA-A </italic>overexpression could be in part responsible for centrosome amplification.</p><p>On the other hand conventional cytogenetics analysis showed the presence of aneuploidy (mainly hypodiploid metaphases) in both <italic>RB/AURORA-A </italic>and <italic>RB/PLK1 </italic>silenced fibroblasts, suggesting that neither <italic>AURORA-A </italic>nor <italic>PLK1 </italic>over-expression could account for chromosome instability observed in these pRb-depleted cells. In this scenario it seems that <italic>AURORA-A </italic>and <italic>PLK1 </italic>over-expression affects primarily cell proliferation following pRb depletion in human primary fibroblasts. In fact simultaneous post-transcriptional silencing of <italic>RB/AURORA-A </italic>and <italic>RB/PLK1 </italic>resulted in delayed cell cycle progression consistent with the decreased Cyclin -E and -A levels, the reduced mitotic index as well as the increased p21<sup>Cip1 </sup>level. Surprisingly, we observed that aneuploid cells induced by pRb depletion were mostly hypodiploid. The unexpected finding that aneuploidy in pRb-depleted human normal cells is characterized by a unbalanced number of cells with chromosome loss relative to gain, is consistent with what has been recently reported for CENP-E<sup>+/- </sup>mice, where hypodiploid cells are better tolerated than hyperdiploid cells in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A molecular mechanism underlying this phenotype might involve lack of attachment or erroneous kinetochores attachment to the mitotic spindle. Merotelic kinetochore attachment that occurs when a kinetochore binds mitotic microtubules from both spindle poles could explain hypodiploidy generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Chromosomes with merotelic orientation that are not detected by the SAC because they do not expose unattached centromeres, could result in lagging chromosomes that persisting until anaphase onset would originate micronuclei upon nuclear envelope reconstitution at the end of mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Micronuclei are considered a possible cause of chromosome loss during mitosis resulting in the generation of hypodiploid cells that lack few chromosomes. Indeed immunofluorescence microscopy performed in pRb-depleted cells and in <italic>RB/AURORA-A </italic>and <italic>RB/PLK1 </italic>knockdown cells showed the presence of micronuclei containing whole chromosomes. An alternative hypothesis might be that micronuclei originate in <italic>RB </italic>silenced cells by defects in kinetochore assembling that generates dysfunctional centromere unable to contact correctly mitotic microtubules. Then, altered expression and dosage of some centromere components by promoting defects in kinetochore assembling could trigger micronuclei generation resulting in unfaithful chromosome segregation during mitosis. Expression studies have suggested a correlation between altered expression of several centromere proteins and cancer. Accordingly, in acutely pRb-depleted human primary fibroblasts we found altered expression of genes coding for two centromere proteins: namely <italic>CENP-A </italic>that was overexpressed and <italic>CENP-F </italic>that was underexpressed. <italic>CENP-A </italic>overexpression might cause a spreading of centromere heterochromatin which might interfere with the correct kinetochore complex assembling and then cause CIN as reported in colorectal cancer tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. <italic>CENP-F </italic>(mitosin) associates preferentially with kinetochores of unaligned chromosomes and is degraded upon completion of mitosis, both its overexpression and underexpression has been reported in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Altogether, our results suggest that pRb plays a critical role in regulating chromosome stability in human primary fibroblasts and its deficiency triggers defects in chromosome segregation via micronuclei formation. In fact pRb depleted primary human fibroblasts did not show SAC dysfunction despite decreased expression of some SAC genes. Thus, micronuclei could represent a mechanism underlying chromosome instability following <italic>RB </italic>acute loss and they could explain maintenance of hypodiploidy also after that <italic>RB </italic>expression will be restored.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we show for the first time that <italic>RB </italic>acute loss triggers centrosome amplification and aneuploidy in human primary fibroblasts. Even though pRb acutely depleted human fibroblasts showed <italic>MAD2 </italic>reduction they did not show spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) dysfunction when challenged with a mitotic poison.</p><p>Our observation that pRb-depleted cells were mostly hypodiploid suggests that micronuclei, likely caused by mis-attached kinetochores which in turn triggered chromosome segregation errors, are a possible cause of chromosome loss during mitosis resulting in the generation of aneuploid cells that lack few chromosomes. Altogether, our results suggest that pRb plays a critical role in regulating genomic stability in human primary fibroblasts and its deficiency induces defects in chromosome segregation via micronuclei formation and not by SAC dysfunction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and Cell Culture</title><p>Normal human IMR90 fibroblasts (diploid human embryonic lung fibroblasts, ATCC CCL-186) were cultured in MEM (Minimum Essential Medium) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, EU approved, Invitrogen Italy), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 0,1 mg/ml Streptomycin, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate and Non Essential Amino Acid (Invitrogen, Italy).
