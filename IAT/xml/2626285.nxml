While the covalent conjugation of polyubiquitin chains to a protein by ubiquitin ligases often leads to subsequent targeting and degradation by the 26S proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Hochstrasser1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, ubiquitin attachment has also been shown to be critical for the correct execution of non-proteasomal events, ranging from the regulated methylation of histones during transcriptional elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Sun1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> to the intracellular trafficking of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Hicke1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. For the latter, ubiquitination serves as a key signal mediating the internalization, intracellular transport and subsequent recycling or vacuolar degradation of plasma membrane-bound receptors and transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Dupre1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. While much progress has been made in elucidating the mechanistic basis for various steps in protein trafficking, many aspects about the core components and enzymatic steps remain unresolved.</p><p>In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, a single essential E3 ubiquitin ligase, Rsp5, has been implicated in the internalization of most if not all endocytosed proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Horak1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The uracil permease Fur4 is an experimentally well-characterized model substrate of Rsp5. Uracil binding, or various stress conditions such as nutrient starvation, heat shock, or the inhibition of protein synthesis trigger Fur4 phosphorylation which drives the subsequent recognition and Lys63-linked di-ubiquitination of Fur4 by Rsp5 on two specific lysine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Galan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Volland1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar to other membrane proteins, the ubiquitination of Fur4 results in its rapid and complete clearance from the plasma membrane into early endosomes. This is followed by the subsequent recognition of ubiquitinated Fur4 by the ESCRT-I, II, III complexes and other class E Vps proteins, followed by sorting into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Katzmann1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. When MVB sorting is inhibited in class E <italic>vps</italic> mutants, endocytosed Fur4 recycles back up to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Bugnicourt1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. After sorting into the MVB, Fur4 is targeted to the vacuolar lumen where it is degraded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Volland1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Fur4 can also follow a different pathway when synthesized in the presence of its substrate, uracil. In this situation, newly synthesized Fur4 is diverted to the endosomal system directly from the Golgi apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Blondel1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. It then undergoes Rsp5-dependent ubiquitination, a modification crucial for its sorting into MVBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Morvan1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, followed by vacuolar degradation after fusion of MVBs with the vacuole.</p><p>The process by which ubiquitin chains are attached to proteins is reversible. Cleavage of ubiquitin chains from ubiquitinated proteins is performed by a broad family of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) which share conserved motifs, notably the Cys and His boxes, which are required for catalytic function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Baker1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In yeast, these DUBs fall into two major categories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Wilkinson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>: the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (Uch), and the ubiquitin specific processing proteases (Ubp). Uchs are restricted to cleaving ubiquitin from small peptides and chemical adducts, while Ubps release ubiquitin from larger protein substrates and disassemble longer polyubiquitin chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Hochstrasser1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on sequence analysis, the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> encodes 16 Ubps, most of which have been confirmed to have general DUB activity <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Amerik1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Emerging evidence implicate members of the vesicle-based intra-organellar protein trafficking pathway as physiologically relevant targets of several of the Ubps. These include: Doa4 (Ubp4), involved in the deubiquitination of internalized endocytic cargoes such as Fur4 at the endosome immediately prior to their sorting into MVBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Dupre2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>; Ubp3, implicated in the deubiquitination of regulatory proteins in both the anterograde <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Cohen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and retrograde <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Cohen2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> protein transport pathways through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi systems, along with a possible involvement in the cytoplasm to vacuole (Cvt) trafficking pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Baxter1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>; and Ubp1, which has been linked to the internalization and turnover of the ABC membrane transporter Ste6 via an as yet unknown mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Schmitz1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Parallel studies by our group (described in this study) and another laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Kee1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> have now established specific and physiologically significant physical and functional interactions between the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp2, the E3 ligase Rsp5, along with a protein of previously unknown function, Rup1, which contains a ubiquitin associated (UBA) domain and a putative Rsp5-binding motif. Although the <italic>in vitro</italic> assays reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Kee1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> have hinted at a possible role of Ubp2 in the deubiquitination of substrates of Rsp5, including the ER membrane bound transcription factor Spt23 and the two relatively uncharacterized proteins Csr2 and Ecm2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Kee2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, physiologically significant targets of Ubp2 with respect to Rsp5-mediated trafficking remains uncertain. Here, we expand upon these initial observations and establish a critical role for Ubp2 in the ubiquitin-dependent sorting of plasma membrane proteins using Fur4 as a model substrate. Collectively, our data suggest that Ubp2 is not simply a negative regulator of Rsp5, but rather is engaged in a more complex and active regulatory relationship with Rsp5 at the MVB.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ubp2 Physically Interacts with Rsp5 and Rup1</title><p>Neither Ubp2 or Rup1 are essential for normal cell growth and deletion of either gene does not result in any obvious growth defects or overt morphological phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Baker1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Winzeler1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, to investigate the possible role(s) of Ubp2 in yeast, we performed large-scale tandem affinity purifications (TAP) to isolate endogenous Ubp2 from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains bearing a C-terminal TAP tag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Rigaut1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Stably interacting partner proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with silver, and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight) mass spectrometry.

As expected, Rup1-TAP co-purified with a seemingly identical amount of Ubp2 and with Rsp5, albeit in an apparently sub-stoichiometric level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004259-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Since immunoprecipitation of either Ubp2-TAP or Rup1-TAP resulted in a near-identical yield of Ubp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004259-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), the interaction between Ubp2 and Rup1 is seemingly complete and likely equimolar. In contrast, a substantial fraction of Rsp5 remained in solution and was not recovered with either Ubp2-TAP or Rup1-TAP after depletion of TAP-tagged proteins with IgG beads from soluble cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004259-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that a substantive fraction of Rsp5 exists in alternate protein complexes, or that Rsp5 binding is transient or labile. The relative proportion of cellular Rsp5 pool present in a complex with Ubp2 and Rup1 is estimated to be &#x0223c;10&#x00025; of total. Since we have shown that only a modest fraction of the total cellular pool of Rsp5 is stably bound to Ubp2/Rup1, Ubp2, and by extension Rup1, may be involved in only a subset of Rsp5-dependent pathways.</p><p>To further investigate the structure-function dependencies of the interaction of Ubp2/Rup1 with Rsp5, we constructed TAP-tagged strains bearing a targeted genomic deletion in either Ubp2 or Rup1. The composition of the resulting affinity-isolated protein complexes were then examined by Western blotting. Whereas Rsp5 remained bound to Rup1-TAP in the absence of Ubp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004259-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), Ubp2-TAP did not detectably precipitate Rsp5 in the absence of Rup1. These results support a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Kee1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> indicating that Rup1 likely mediates, at least in part, the interaction of Ubp2 to Rsp5. Consistent with this, we identified a putative WW domain consensus binding motif, PPPSY, encoded by amino acids 131&#x02013;135 of Rup1. We generated a site-specific point mutant in which the invariant core tyrosine residue 135 was substituted with a phenylalanine (Y135F), and expressed this from an episomal plasmid in a strain lacking endogenous <italic>RUP1</italic>. This type of mutation (Y&#x02192;F) has previously been shown to markedly reduce or even abolish binding of other WW domain proteins to their interacting partners bearing analogous PY motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Chen1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Strano1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, as expected, the interaction of this mutant variant with Rsp5 was impaired, although not abolished, relative to the wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004259-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), implying that the motif mediates in part the recruitment of Rsp5. Similar results were obtained after expression of the Rup1 Y135F mutant in a <italic>ubp2&#x00394;</italic> deletion mutant background (data not shown), indicating the residual binding was not mediated by Ubp2.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>UBP2 and RUP1 Interact Genetically with RSP5</title><p>To further explore the relationship of Ubp2 and Rup1 to Rsp5-related functions, we examined the effects of inducible ectopic overexpression of either Ubp2 or Rup1 in a strain harbouring a temperature-sensitive hypomorphic allele of <italic>RSP5</italic> (<italic>rsp5-1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Wang1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as in a wild-type strain, looking for enhancement or suppression of the conditional slow-growth phenotype. As seen in the limiting dilution series shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004259-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, Ubp2 overexpression was moderately toxic to the control strain as compared to an empty control vector, while the <italic>rsp5-1</italic> mutant was found to be extremely hypersensitive. This synthetic dosage lethality was specific to <italic>UBP2</italic>, as the <italic>rsp5-1</italic> strain did not shown any hypersensitivity to overexpression of two other unrelated deubiquitinating enzymes, <italic>UBP6</italic> and <italic>UBP10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004259-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Indeed, although overproduction of <italic>UBP10</italic> caused a noticeable growth defect in wildtype cells, this defect did not worsen when combined with the <italic>rsp5-1</italic> mutation, in striking contrast to <italic>UBP2</italic>. While wildtype yeast were not detectably sensitive to the overexpression of Rup1, <italic>rsp5-1</italic> and <italic>ubp2&#x00394;</italic> mutants displayed modest hypersensitivity.

In addition, Ubp2, Rup1, and Rsp5 have been shown in other studies to be present at the MVB. Rsp5 was found to be located at various sites within the endocytic pathway, including plasma membrane invaginations, late endosomes, and MVBs by colocalization with Pep12, an endosomal marker, and Vps32, a component of an ESCRT complex located at the MVB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Wang2">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Rsp5, Rup1 and Ubp2 have also been shown to interact with Hse1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Ren1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, a component of the ESCRT-0 complex located at the MVB. In addition to Fur4, we see a role for Ubp2 in the proper clearance of another membrane-bound protein, Ste2, from the plasma membrane, suggesting Ubp2 is generally required for efficient sorting.</p><p>Consistent with these results, Ubp2 has recently been shown to be important for the Rsp5-mediated trafficking of a vacuolar protease, carboxypeptidase S (Cps), which is sorted to the vacuolar lumen from the Golgi via the MVB pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Ren1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, a role for Ubp2 in properly sorting the membrane bound amino acid permease Gap1 directly from the Golgi to the MVB has also been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Ren1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we establish, at least in the case of Fur4 (and possibly for Ste2), the additional involvement of Ubp2 in sorting of endocytic cargo from the plasma membrane to the MVB. It seems, therefore, that Ubp2 has a role in modulating Rsp5-mediated trafficking of various types of membrane associated cargo.</p><p>What then, specifically, is the role of Ubp2? Although Ubp2 has been shown to deubiquitinate a non-essential ER-membrane bound transcription factor, Spt23, <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Kee1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, there is as yet no evidence for the physiological processing of Spt23 <italic>in vivo</italic> (M.L.; unpublished observations). Indeed, counterintuitive to expectation, our observation that a ub-Fur4 fusion can rescue the sorting defect in <italic>ubp2</italic>&#x00394; mutants suggests inefficient or improper ubiquitination of the internalized transporter.</p><p>One possibility is that Ubp2 may be involved in modulating the efficiency of Rsp5 ubiquitination, by deubiquitinating auto-ubiquitinated Rsp5, or by sequestering Rsp5 to a specific cellular compartment or substrate. Deubiquitination of Rsp5 would lead to the subsequent stabilization of the E3 ub-ligase as is the case for many previously identified E3-DUB physically interacting pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Li2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Mouchantaf1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this appears unlikely, as no detectable decrease in Rsp5 levels was detected in a <italic>ubp2</italic>&#x00394; mutants (M.L.; unpublished observations), and Rsp5 has not been reported to be (auto)ubiquitinated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>A second possibility is that Ubp2 may be involved in ubiquitin chain length editing of internalized receptors and transporters at the MVB. Most substrates of the endocytic pathway are covalently attached with single ubiquitin moieties or short K63-linked ubiquitin chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Galan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Terrell1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Gitan1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, although a Vps pathway substrate with a K63-linked polyubiquitin chain has been recently reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-StawieckaMirota1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. The recent finding that Ubp2 can efficiently and preferentially deubiquitinate K63 linked chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Kee2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> suggests a possible role for Ubp2 in editing Rsp5-catalyzed polyubiquitin chains down to a length suitable for recognition by various proteins in the endocytic/ESCRT machinery. Although a difference in the ubiquitin profile of Fur4 in a WT versus <italic>ubp2</italic>&#x00394; mutants was not detected, our Western blot assay represented the sum of all membrane compartments in the cell, and may not be sensitive enough to visualize a subtle kinetic defect at the MVB. It would be interesting and informative to look at the ubiquitination of Fur4 in conditions where more subtle differences in ubiquitination levels at the MVB could be detected.</p><p>A third, and more likely (although currently speculative) possibility is a role of Ubp2 in the deubiquitination of the cargo (e.g. Fur4) right at the MVB, which is then followed by a second, subsequent re-ubiquitination by Rsp5 for efficient sorting into the MVB. In support of this model, it was previously reported that Rsp5-dependent ubiquitination of cargo must occur at the MVB stage for proper sorting into MVBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Leon1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Further support for this model is our data showing a physical interaction between Rsp5 and Ubp2 through tethering by Rup1, allowing for a close physical proximity between the Ub ligase and the DUB at the MVB. Another DUB, Doa4, also appears to play a somewhat related, but different, role at the MVB, as deubiquitination by Doa4 itself is not sufficient for the proper re-ubiquitination of Fur4. Although it has not yet been shown conclusively that deubiquitination must occur prior to cargo re-ubiquitination, this will be an interesting area to address in the future. In addition to cargo deubiquitination, we cannot currently rule out an (additional) indirect role of Ubp2 on the sorting machinery itself, adding another possible level of complexity in the regulation of trafficking. We are also unable to conclusively exclude a role for Ubp2 at the plasma membrane, as there might have been subtle defects in <italic>ubp2</italic>&#x00394; cells at the internalization step of endocytosis that remained undetected in our experimental conditions.</p><p>The role of Rup1 also remains enigmatic. Residual Ubp2-Rsp5 binding was detected in the absence of Rup1, implying that Ubp2 and Rsp5 can interact, either directly, or possibly through another unknown adaptor protein. This could explain why Rup1 is not required for proper MVB sorting, although a minor sorting defect not apparent in the assay conditions tested cannot be ruled out. Aspects of our genetic data imply that Rup1 has a positive role in Ubp2 activity. For example, deletion of <italic>RUP1</italic> suppressed, albeit only partially, the temperature-sensitive phenotype of <italic>rsp5-1</italic> mutants. The presence of a UBA domain in Rup1 is also suggestive. Ubiquitin-binding motifs, such as UBA or UIM (ubiquitin interacting motif) domains, are present in a sizeable fraction of proteins involved in intracellular protein trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Hicke2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, and have been suggested to facilitate the &#x0201c;passing-off&#x0201d; of ubiquitinated endocytic cargo or components from one functional module in the processing machinery to another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Hicke2">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Swanson1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, Rup1 could play a complex role at the MVB, in both recruiting ubiquitinated proteins to the ternary complex and tethering Ubp2 to Rsp5.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains and Growth Media</title><p>All transformations of yeast strains were done using a standard protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Gietz1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004259-Soni1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>.
