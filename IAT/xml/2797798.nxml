It binds non-specifically to double-stranded RNA and specifically to protein targets. NS1 binds directly to p85&#x003b2; to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It binds a cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor to inhibit the maturation and export of host antiviral mRNAs, and it inhibits poly(A)-binding protein II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. NS1 protein interacts with the viral RNA polymerase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4GI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], NS1-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], NS1-BP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], Staufen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and nucleolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Association of NS1 protein with host factors may affect apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Growth arrest-specific genes are expressed preferentially in cultured cells that have entered a quiescent state following serum deprivation or growth to confluence. To date, eleven <italic>GAS </italic>genes have been identified that act in a variety of biological functions, including the control of microfilament organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], nerve cell growth or differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], tyrosine kinase receptor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and negative and positive control of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. No sequence similarity or common structural features have been found among the <italic>GAS </italic>genes or proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p><italic>GAS8</italic>, also known as <italic>GAS11</italic>, is located at 16q24.3 and was found to be a common deletion present in breast and prostate carcinomas. It was viewed as a potential tumor suppressor gene. The <italic>GAS8 </italic>gene consists of 11 exons spanning approximately 25 kb. Northern blot analysis identified two ubiquitously expressed mRNAs of 3.4 and 1.8 kb in length. Another gene, C16orf3, lies within intron 2 of <italic>GAS8</italic>, and is transcribed in the opposite orientation of <italic>GAS8 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Gas8 protein associates with microtubules <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Deletion analysis identified a microtubule-binding domain (GMAD) and a region that attenuates Gas8-microtubule interactions (IMAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Gas8 homologs in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei </italic>and <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii </italic>are integral components of the flagellar axoneme that regulates flagellar beating. The <italic>GAS8 </italic>gene is also expressed in a variety of mammalian cells that lack motile cilia. In COS7 cells, Gas8 is localized to the Golgi apparatus. This localization is dependent on intact microtubules and is regulated by the cell cycle, as Gas8 is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm as cells progress through mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In adult mice, <italic>GAS8 </italic>mRNA and protein are found predominantly in the testes, where expression is regulated during the post-meiotic development of male gametocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>We isolated Gas8 in a two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with the influenza A virus protein NS1.

The PCR products were cloned into pCMV-Myc via the SalI and NotI restriction sites to create pCMV-Myc-NS1. The expression plasmids pGEX-6P-1-NS1 and pEGFP-N3-NS1 were generated by inserting an NS1 cDNA corresponding to amino acids 1 to 237 between the EcoRI/NotI sites of pGEX-6P-1 and the EcoRI/KpnI sites of pEGFP-N3 (NEB), respectively. The GAS8 gene purchased from Proteintech was cloned by PCR using a primer pair specific for the human cDNA (GeneBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_001481">NM_001481</ext-link>). The products were cloned into pDsRed-Express-C1 and pCMV-Tag 2B respectively, creating pDsRed-GAS8 and FLAG-tagged GAS8. Different NS1 and Gas8 deletion mutants were generated by PCR, as above.

After twenty-four hours, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed with PBS. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma). The subcellular localization of the pDsRed-GAS8 and pEGFP-NS1 fusion proteins was detected using a Zeiss LSM 510 META microscope equipped with a 100&#x000d7; objective lens (Zeiss).</p></sec><sec><title>GST pulldown assays</title><p>GST and GST-NS1 proteins were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>BL21 induced with isopropyl-&#x003b2;-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Merck).

The strain grows normally at 23&#x000b0;C, but does not grow at 37&#x000b0;C. The CytoTrap system is based on the ability of the human Sos protein, which is the human homologue of the yeast CDC25 gene, to complement the cdc25 defect and to activate the yeast Ras signaling pathway. Expression of hSos and its subsequent localization to the plasma membrane allows the cdc25H yeast strain to grow at 37&#x000b0;C. The localization of Sos to the plasma membrane occurs through the interaction of two-hybrid proteins. We used a pSos-NS1 fusion protein to screen a human lung cDNA plasmid library, in which cDNA-encoded proteins were conditionally expressed as translational fusions with a pMyr. Expression of the pMyr fusion proteins is induced in the presence of galactose and repressed by glucose. Twenty-four library plasmids were isolated from 1.09 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7 </sup>transformants based on their ability to grow on minimal synthetic medium in the absence of leucine and uracil in plates containing galactose but not glucose at 37&#x000b0;C. Further identification of putative positive plasmids was performed by co-transformation with pSos-NS1, and 15 out of 24 were confirmed as positive plasmids. After DNA sequencing, 8 clones of different gene were obtained. Here, we report the analysis of one of the human cDNAs isolated from these library plasmids that encodes growth arrest-specific gene 8.</p></sec><sec><title>NS1 interacts with Gas8 in vitro and in vivo</title><p>To confirm the interaction between NS1 and Gas8 suggested by the two-hybrid results, two experiments were performed.

The interaction was confirmed <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>with GST-pulldown and co-IP assays. Identification of the NS1 domain that interacts with Gas8 revealed that neither the RNA binding domain nor the effector domain of NS1 alone could interact with Gas8, in contrast to a previously reported NS1-interacting protein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Deletion analysis revealed that the N-terminal 260 amino acids of Gas8 were able to interact with NS1. This domain corresponds to IMAD and GMAD domain.</p><p>Examination of the localization of Gas8 protein in cells revealed that two types of localization exist: Golgi and cytoplasmic. This phenomenon was even observed in the same types of cells. The Golgi apparatus localization is dependent on intact microtubules and is cell-cycle regulated, as Gas8 is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm as cells progress through mitosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Since the function of Gas8 has not yet been determined, the effect of the association between Gas8 and NS1 on virus infection is unknown. The mammalian Gas8 gene is a possible tumor suppressor that was previously identified as one of several genes that are up-regulated upon growth arrest[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Cell proliferation was not inhibited when CV-1 and DU145 cells were transfected with the recombinant plasmid pCMV-Tag 2B-GAS8. Gas8 was expressed in HeLa, CV-1, A549, and DU145 cells. NS1 inhibited the maturation of GAS8 mRNA. This is consistent with the fact that transient expression of NS1 in mammalian cells leads to retention of poly(A) RNA in the nucleus and inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In order to study the function of Gas8, we attempted to abrogate the expression of Gas8. Unfortunately, an effective target for RNAi was not found.</p><p>We identified proteins that interact with Gas8 by immunoprecipitation and found that Gas8 co-localizes with actin at the plasma membrane, but not in the cytoplasm. We speculate that this may be the result of its association with drebrin E2, which is the only protein of the myosin-9-drebrin E2-actin complex reported to be localized to the apical plasma membrane with actin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, successful expression of the drebrin E2 protein was not achieved, and therefore a direct interaction between Gas8 and drebrin still needs to be confirmed. Drebrin has been reported to modulate actin-myosin interactions in dendritic spines, and myosin 9 may function in intracellular vesicle transport[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Therefore we examined the effect of overexpression of Gas8 on the maturation of progeny virions and found that Gas8 could arrest the production of H3N2 progeny virions from cells.</p><p>Gas8 has been reported to interact with Rab3B. Rab3 subfamily proteins are enriched in neuronal and secretory cells, where they control regulated exocytosis through the interaction with the Rab3 effector proteins Rabphilin-3, Rim1/2, and Noc2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In fibroblasts and epithelial cells, Rab3B is involved in the transport of low-density lipoprotein receptors, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein, and polymeric immunoglobulin receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Overexpression of Noc2 inhibited the cell-surface transport of basolateral vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. Consistent with the functions of these Gas8-associated proteins and the binding detected between Gas8 and drebrin, actin, and myosin, we speculate that Gas8 may affect the release of H3N2 progeny virions.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LXZ and LX performed analysis of interaction between Gas8 and NS1 and wrote the manuscript.
