Recombination in yeast and mice is initiated by the formation and processing of double-strand breaks (DSBs). Meiotic DSBs are repaired by proteins that mediate homologous strand exchange, mismatch repair, and resolution of recombination intermediates. As these activities are occurring, homologous chromosomes undergo pairing and synapsis, which are completed by the pachytene stage of meiosis. The ability of germ cells to complete meiosis, and to undergo proper segregation of chromosomes in the subsequent meiotic divisions, hinges on the fidelity of these events. Defects in recombination and meiosis have been shown to underlie aneuploidy syndromes such as Downs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050105-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d; and azoospermia in men &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050105-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Our understanding of the genetic control of meiotic recombination in mammals has depended largely on studies of model organisms such as yeast. Mice with null mutations in orthologs of recombination genes often have meiotic defects that are very similar to yeast. However, it is clear that mammals have many genes required for meiosis that do not have orthologs in yeast, and that there are substantial differences between the sexes in the response to mutations in meiotic genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050105-b003">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050105-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, mouse null mutations generated by gene targeting of yeast orthologs do not model deleterious hypomorphic or dominant alleles that may occur in human populations.</p><p>Because of these issues, and because the genetics of meiosis is difficult to address in humans, we and others have undertaken a forward genetic approach to the identification of novel mutant genes causing infertility in mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050105-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050105-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

A key underlying difference may have to do with the timing of checkpoint activation in meiotic prophase I. For example, an earlier checkpoint activation may occur in spermatocytes before expression of one or more essential components of late RNs, preventing them from being made or modified in a way that is required for late RN formation. Notably, MLH3 foci are apparent prior to pachynema in human oocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050105-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, and components of early and late RNs appear earlier in female than male mice in terms of days lapsed from the beginning of meiotic prophase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050105-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.

Though it is completely unable to catalyze D-loop formation in vitro, the mutant protein might facilitate recombinant activities of other molecules so as to initiate interhomolog pairing.

The mutant protein did not impair the ability of wt DMC1 to catalyze strand invasion in the presence of HOP2-MND1, ruling them out as the target of dominant-negative interactions.

Since the <italic>Dmc1<sup>Mei11</sup></italic> mutation decreased DNA binding efficiency in vitro to approximately 30&#x00025; of wt activity, consistent with a decreased number of DMC1 foci in mutants, it is possible that the dominant-negative interaction may result from binding to a key protein(s) that depends upon DMC1 for localizing to sites of DSB repair.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Implications for Female Reproduction</title><p>In <italic>Dmc1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mutant females, oocytes are depleted around birth prior to primordial follicle formation, resulting in residual ovaries that are depleted of ovarian follicles and oocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050105-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050105-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.
