We have identified a novel regulatory function for Prp1. Expression of mutations in the N-terminus of Prp1 leads to the accumulation of pre-catalytic spliceosomal complexes containing the five snRNAs U1, U2, U5 and U4/U6 and pre-mRNAs. The mutations in the N-terminus, which prevent splicing to occur, include <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> identified phosphorylation sites of Prp4 kinase. These sites are highly conserved in the human ortholog U5-102 K. The results presented here demonstrate that structural integrity of the N-terminus is required to mediate a splicing event, but is not necessary for the assembly of spliceosomes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The chemical reactions leading to the removal of introns from pre-mRNAs and the basic components, including the five small nuclear ribonucleoproteinparticles (U1, U2, U5 and U4/U6 snRNPs) of a spliceosome, are conserved throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Two transesterification reactions are catalyzed by this very dynamic snRNP&#x02013;protein machinery. A series of conformational changes is induced to drive a pre-catalytic spliceosome into catalysis. These conformational changes are important for splicing regulation and quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>A spliceosome assembles <italic>in vitro</italic> on a pre-mRNA in a step-wise manner. The snRNPs U1 and U2 recognize the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-splice sites, respectively, and then a tri-snRNP consisting of U4/U6.U5 is recruited to build up the pre-catalytic spliceosomal complex containing the five U snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). It is not known how a splicing competent spliceosome bound to its substrate initiates the switch towards the multiple rearrangements to form a catalytic complex. However, it has been shown that the pre-catalytic spliceosome releases U1 and U4 to rearrange into the catalytic subcomplex containing the snRNAs U2.U6.U5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). How assembly and activation of the spliceosomal machinery occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> is still a matter of intense debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). It has been suggested that assembly of spliceosomes <italic>in vivo</italic> as well might be a stepwise process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8">6&#x02013;8</xref>). However, the isolation and characterization of a spliceosomal complex from the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> containing the five U snRNAs and most of the known snRNP proteins led to the suggestion that a penta-snRNP (holospliceosome) may assemble independently of pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The results of other experimental approaches to determine the sequential order of events in forming a splicing competent spliceosome <italic>in vivo</italic> suggest that the U1 snRNP recognizes pre-mRNA first. However, it cannot be decided whether in the next step U2 and then a pre-formed tri-snRNP U4/U6.U5 or a tetra-snRNP U2.U4/U6.U5 is recruited to the U1 snRNP-pre-mRNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10 B11">7&#x02013;11</xref>).</p><p>Almost nothing is known how and when an assembled spliceosome is switched on for catalysis <italic>in vivo</italic>. The proteins involved in this switch and, particularly, their specific function remains unknown. We have shown that Prp4 kinase and its physiological substrate Prp1 play a regulatory role in pre-mRNA splicing in fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. This interaction appears to be conserved throughout eukaryotic organisms, with the exception of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12 B13 B14">12&#x02013;14</xref>). Mammalian PRP4K kinase was found associated with spliceosomes and spliceosomal proteins, including U5-102 K the ortholog of Prp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The ortholog of Prp1 in budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is called Prp6. In <italic>S. pombe prp1<sup>+</sup></italic> cannot be replaced by the <italic>S. cerevisiae PRP6</italic> gene and the budding yeast genome does not encode an ortholog of Prp4 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>Prp1/Prp6/U5-102 K is a protein consisting of multiple direct repeats formerly called TPRs (Tetra-trico Peptide Repeats), which are now listed as HATs (half a TPR) in databases (Q12381, PRP1_SCHPO; P19735, PRP6_YEAST; O94906, PRP6_HUMAN). In Prp1 11 HAT repeats are preceded by a 27-kDa domain at the N-terminus of the protein which does not show similarities with known motifs. Interestingly, whereas the C-terminus displaying the HAT repeats is highly conserved among organisms, the N-terminus is less conserved.</p><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Prp6 is necessary for the formation of a stable tri-snRNP U4/U6.U5. It was suggested that both yeast and human Prp6 (U5-102 K) are required for tri-snRNP integrity, whereas Prp6 and Prp31 are connecting the U5 snRNP with the U4/U6 snRNP particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24">19&#x02013;24</xref>).</p><p>Prp1 is essential for growth and expressed by a single gene on chromosome II. Different temperature sensitive (ts) alleles of <italic>prp1</italic> accumulate pre-mRNA and the cell population arrests specifically either in G1 or in G2 phase of the cell cycle. This phenotype is caused by point mutations in the C-terminal part (HAT motifs) of Prp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Attempts to study the stepwise assembly of spliceosomal particles with <italic>S. pombe</italic> whole-cell extracts failed, due to the lack of an <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing system. These investigations revealed, however, that whole-cell extract of <italic>S. pombe</italic> contains minute amounts of tri-snRNP U4/U6.U5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Three <italic>in vivo</italic> derived large spliceosomal complexes from <italic>S. pombe</italic> have been isolated and analyzed. First, we have isolated and analyzed the U1 particle. Unexpectedly, the U1 snRNP exists as a multimeric 45S particle containing exclusively snRNA U1 associated with the seven Sm core proteins and nine U1 specific proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Second, based on the analysis of a 35S complex containing the snRNAs U2, U5 and U6, it was shown that it consists of a mixture of activated- and post-catalytic spliceosomal complexes. These spliceosomal subcomplexes did not contain the <italic>bona fide</italic> splicing factors Prp1/Prp6/U5-102 K and Prp31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27 B28 B29 B30">27&#x02013;30</xref>). Third, a complex associated with Prp1/Prp6/U5-102 K and Prp31 has been isolated and proteomic analysis of the complex revealed that it contains proteins expected in a spliceosomal sub-complex containing the four snRNAs U2, U5 and base paired U4/U6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Prp1 and Prp31 are found associated with large spliceosomal complexes co-sedimenting in a glycerol gradient in the range of 30&#x02013;60S. The spliceosomal complexes sedimenting in this range appear to be a mixture of pre-catalytic spliceosomal particles containing the four snRNAs U2, U5 and U4/U6 as well as complexes containing the five snRNAs, including U1. Collectively, these results indicate that Prp1 and Prp31 are proteins associated with pre-catalytic spliceosomal particles, but not with post-catalytic complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>Based on the observations described earlier, we hypothesized that Prp1 might play a regulatory role in splicing and is involved in the integrity and activation of pre-catalytic spliceosomal complexes.</p><p>Here, we report that expression of Prp1 carrying mutations in the N-terminus leads to the accumulation of pre-catalytic spliceosomal complexes containing pre-mRNAs. Spliceosomal complexes associated with mutant Prp1 appear to stall in a pre-catalytic stage containing all five snRNPs U1, U2, U5 and U4/U6. The results presented here indicate that mutations in the N-terminus of Prp1 prevent activation, but not assembly of pre-catalytic spliceosomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title><italic>Schizosaccharomyce pombe</italic> strains, growth media and <italic>in vivo</italic> tagging</title><p>Standard genetic and molecular techniques were used as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).

The N-terminus contains 17 threonines within 258 amino acids upstream of the HAT domains [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.digibib.tu-bs.de/?docid=00001688">http://www.digibib.tu-bs.de/?docid=00001688</ext-link>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>)]. Therefore, we started a mutation analysis deleting short regions of the N-terminus containing threonines and expressed these mutations <italic>in vivo</italic> to study their consequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A). To be able to express solely the mutated version of Prp1 we constructed strains containing two gene copies of <italic>prp1</italic>. One copy is driven by its natural promoter and fused with its coding region to a Myc-epitope tag; the second copy is under the control of the thiamine repressible promoter <italic>nmt1-8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The control strain expresses two wild-type (wt) <italic>prp1</italic> genes in medium without thiamine (&#x02013;Thi). In medium with thiamine (+Thi), however, the <italic>nmt1-8</italic> driven gene is repressed. This strain grows in both media with the same growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, open circles and open squares). The deletion mutations (&#x00394;N) were fused to the Myc-epitope tag and are driven by the natural promoter, which is constitutively transcribed. In these strains, the wt <italic>prp1</italic> is driven by the thiamine repressible promoter. All six mutant strains show in medium &#x02013;Thi the same growth rate as the control strain. However, in medium +Thi, when wt <italic>prp1</italic> is repressed and cells express solely Prp1&#x00394;N, all six strains arrested growth as shown here for the strain expressing Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227-249 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, &#x02013;Thi. filled circles; +Thi, filled squares).

Therefore, we compared the sedimentation profiles of Prp31 and Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 in a glycerol gradient when both <italic>prp1</italic> alleles were expressed (&#x02013;Thi) with the sedimentation profiles of Prp31 and Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 when cells expressed solely the mutant Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 (+Thi). This deletion is proximal to the first HAT (HAT1) motif starting from amino acid position 258 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, arrow). Cell extracts were isolated from growing (&#x02013;Thi) and arrested cells (+Thi; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, arrow). The gradient profile of Prp31 from growing cells expressing both Prp1<sup>wt</sup> and Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 shows, as expected, Prp31 sedimenting in the range of 30&#x02013;60S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, Panel: &#x02013;Thi, HA-Prp31). Unexpectedly, probing with anti-Myc-antibodies (&#x003b1;Myc) to detect Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 indicates that hardly any mutant protein is sedimenting in this range with Prp31 suggesting that not much of Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 associates with these pre-catalytic spliceosomal particles. Curiously, however, full-length mutant protein Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 is not found sedimenting lower than 30S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, Panel: &#x02212;Thi, Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249). By contrast, using extract of cells expressing solely Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 (+Thi), the gradient profiles show that Prp31 and mutant Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 are co-sedimenting in the range of 30&#x02013;60S and some full-length mutant protein Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 is sedimenting below 30S. This suggests that the mutant protein Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 mainly binds to Prp31 complexes, if there is no wt Prp1 available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, Panel: +Thi, HA-Prp31; and Panel: +Thi, Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249). Careful analysis revealed that full-length Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249, which does not associate with spliceosomal particles, is degraded mainly to cleavage products of 45 kDa sedimenting below 30S (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1155/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1A and B</ext-link>). To confirm this observation, we also expressed C-terminal deletions of HAT domains in this system and studied their consequences. The deletion of HAT11, for example, and sole expression of the mutant protein (Myc-Prp1&#x00394;825&#x02013;856) cause growth arrest as the expression of N-terminal deletions. The C-terminal mutant proteins, however, do not bind to spliceosomal complexes at all under both conditions and are found exclusively as 45-kDa cleavage products sedimenting in the gradient below 30S (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1155/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1C and D</ext-link>).</p><p>The strains expressing the other N-terminal deletions show the same remarkable allelic exclusion phenomenon as the strain expressing Prp1<sup>wt</sup> and Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249. In addition, in all cases expressing solely Prp1&#x00394;N, growth arrest correlates with the accumulation of pre-mRNAs of the genes <italic>rpl29</italic>, <italic>rps27</italic>, <italic>tbp1</italic> containing one, two and three introns, respectively (data not shown).</p><p>To characterize spliceosomal complexes of these strains we purified them by the tandem affinity purification (TAP) method using TAP-tagged Prp31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Extracts of cells expressing both, Prp1<sup>wt</sup> and Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249, and extracts of cells expressing solely Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;224 were used to purify Prp31&#x02013;TAP complexes. The material eluted from the first (T) and second (C) column, respectively, was separated on SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted and probed with antibodies against the calmodulin binding peptide (&#x003b1;TAP) to detect Prp31. Prp31 eluted from the columns after proteolytic cleavage of the protein A region revealed the expected size of 63 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, panel &#x02013;Thi: lanes 3 and 4; panel +Thi: lanes 7 and 8: Prp31-CM). Probing the western blots with anti-Myc antibodies (&#x003b1;Myc) shows that purified Prp31 from growing cells is not associated with Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, panel &#x02013;Thi: lanes 3 and 4), whereas in arrested cells, purified Prp31 is associated with Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, panel +Thi: lanes 7 and 8). However, probing the western blot with antibodies against Prp1 (&#x003b1;Prp1) shows that purified complexes of Prp31 from growing cells are exclusively associated with Prp1<sup>wt</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C, panel &#x02013;Thi: lanes 3 and 4; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1155/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1A</ext-link>). This is consistent with the interpretation of the results received from the gradient analysis presented earlier. The sedimentation profiles of Prp31 and Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 indicated that Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 associates only with Prp31 complexes sedimenting in the range of 30&#x02013;60S, if no Prp1<sup>wt</sup> is available in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panel +Thi). After affinity purification the sedimentation profile of Prp31 from arrested cells shows that the Prp31 complexes still sediment in the range of 30&#x02013;60S as observed with whole-cell extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>E, panel: &#x003b1;TAP, Prp31-CM).</p><p>The material eluted from the second affinity step was also used to isolate RNA. We used RT-PCR to verify the presence of the U snRNAs in both samples isolated from growing (&#x02212;Thi) and arrested cultures (+Thi). The results of semiquantitative RT-PCR demonstrate that the TAP purified Prp31 complexes associated with Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 in arrested cells (+Thi) contain significantly more U1 snRNA than the Prp31 complexes associated with Prp1<sup>wt</sup> from growing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B, lane 1, open square).</p><p>The RNA isolated from the spliceosomal Prp31 complexes after the second affinity step was also used to probe for the presence of pre-mRNAs and mature mRNAs of the ribosomal protein genes <italic>rpl29</italic> and <italic>rps27</italic>, respectively. The gene <italic>rpl29</italic> contains a single intron of 53 nt in size, whereas <italic>rps27</italic> contains two introns of 38 and 206 nt in size, respectively. The results of semiquantitative RT-PCR using total RNA of logarithmically growing cells show that both ribosomal protein genes are expressed and, particularly, effectively spliced showing no trace amount of unspliced pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D, lanes 5 and 11). In arrested cultures (+Thi) where the Prp31 complexes are associated with Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249, the results of semiquantitative RT-PCR show that the TAP purified Prp31 complexes contain significant amounts of unspliced <italic>rpl29</italic> pre-mRNA and only trace amounts of mature mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D, lane 3), whereas Prp31 complexes isolated from growing cells (&#x02212;Thi) contain only trace amounts of pre-mRNA and mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D, lane 1). In the case of <italic>rps27</italic>, the Prp31 complexes isolated from arrested cultures (+Thi) accumulate partially spliced and spliced pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D, lanes 7 and 9).</p><p>Taken together, the observations described above prompted us to suggest that the sole expression of Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 leads to stalled pre-catalytic spliceosomes containing pre-mRNAs and consisting of the five U snRNPs. Thus, we may expect accumulation of Prp31 in cells solely expressing Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249. Therefore, we quantitated the relative amount of Prp31 in extracts of growing cells (&#x02212;Thi) and compared it with the relative amount of Prp31 measured in extracts of arrested cells (+Thi). The results revealed that the amount of Prp31 is 2&#x02013;4-fold increased in arrested cells, indicating that pre-catalytic spliceosomal particles associated with Prp31 and Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 accumulate in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B).</p><p>To confirm that Prp31 is associated with native pre-catalytic spliceosomes containing the five snRNAs, including basepaired U4/U6, we immunoprecipitated extracts of cells expressing HA-Prp31 with HA-antibodies (&#x003b1;HA) and characterized the snRNA composition of the immunoprecipitates using a solution hybridization assay that preserved base pairing of U4 and U6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). When Prp31 was immunoprecipitated from extracts of growing (&#x02212;Thi) and arrested (+Thi) cultures, the spliceosomal complexes always contained the five snRNAs including base paired U4/U6 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1155/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). This result and the fact that Prp31 always sediments in a relatively broad range of 30&#x02013;60S confirm that spliceosomal particles containing five snRNAs U1, U2, U5, U4/U6 exist <italic>in vivo</italic> in a pool of pre-catalytic particles of different size. The data presented are consistent with the notion that expression of Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 leads to the accumulation of pre-catalytic spliceosomal particles containing the five snRNAs and pre-mRNA, indicating that manipulation in the N-terminal region of Prp1 prevents activation, but not assembly of spliceosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphorylation sites of Prp4 kinase in the N-terminus of Prp1</title><p>Prp1 is a physiological substrate of Prp4 kinase; therefore, we wanted to determine the phosphorylation sites in Prp1. Prp4 kinase phosphorylates Prp1 <italic>in vitro</italic> at threonine residues in the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). The N-terminus of Prp1 contains 17 threonine residues distributed throughout the 258 amino acids as indicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Since no phosphorylation site sequences of Prp4 kinase were known, we changed the 17 threonine residues in the N-terminus by site-specific mutagenesis to alanine and produced the mutated Prp1 in bacteria. Recombinant Prp1 and Prp4 kinase were incubated in a kinase assay with &#x003b3;[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP followed by phosphopeptide analysis of Prp1. The phosphopeptide map of Prp1<sup>wt</sup> revealed three strongly labeled spots and several weak signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, panel: wt Prp1, spots 1&#x02013;3). When we used a Prp1 protein in which the threonine at position 244 was changed to an alanine (T244A-Prp1), for example, spot 2 disappears in the peptide map, demonstrating that position 244 was phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, panel: T244A). The results of the mapping analyses show that positions T197/199, T205/207, T232/236 and T244 are unequivocally <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation sites of Prp4 kinase in the N-terminus of Prp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). These sites are located proximal to the first HAT domain, whereas T232, T236 and T244 reside in the region which has been deleted in Myc-Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 and T197/199, T205/207 reside in the region deleted in Myc-Prp1&#x00394;170-208 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B).</p><p>The alignment of the amino acid sequences comprising 50 amino acids of the N-terminus proximal to the first HAT motif (HAT1) of Prp1 with human Prp6, and with orthologs of genetic model organisms, including <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, shows that the phosphorylation sites in this region (amino acids 227&#x02013;249) are conserved in all organisms except in the N-terminus of Prp6 of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). It is noteworthy here that in phosphoproteome analysis of fission yeast a phosphopeptide was detected which carried a modified serine at position 235 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C, dagger, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>)]. Furthermore, even more intriguingly, phosphoproteome analysis of human cells revealed peptides phosphorylated at position T235, T244 and S248, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C; daggers, hsPrp6, O94906).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Consequences of the expression of N-terminal mutations in Prp1: accumulation of spliceosomes containing U1, U2, U5 and U4/U6</title><p>In this study, we investigated the function of the N-terminus of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> spliceosomal protein Prp1, which is the ortholog of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and human Prp6 (U5-102 K). This is the first report demonstrating that the N-terminal region of Prp1 is essential to mediate a splicing event; however, it is not necessary for assembly of spliceosomes <italic>in vivo</italic>. The 11 HAT domains comprising the C-terminus of Prp1 mediate interaction with other spliceosomal components. Several genetic interactions, including extragenic suppressors and synthetic lethal interactions with <italic>prp1</italic>, have been found. These studies yielded temperature-sensitive (ts) <italic>prp1</italic> alleles containing mutations in different HAT motifs and established an epistasis map showing, in addition to Prp4 kinase, genetic interactions with <italic>prp13</italic> (encoding snRNA U4 in <italic>S. pombe, snu4</italic>) and other spliceosomal components, such as Prp6 (Snu13 <italic>Sc</italic>, 15,5K <italic>Hs</italic>), Prp5 (Prp46 <italic>Sc,</italic> PRL1 <italic>Hs</italic>), Spp101 (Lin1/Snu40 <italic>Sc</italic>, U5-55K <italic>Hs</italic>) and Spp42 (Prp8 <italic>Sc</italic>, U5-220K <italic>Hs</italic>), which is involved in coordinating activities of several splicing factors at the heart of the spliceosome (12&#x02013;14,17,47&#x02013;51 and Razanau and K&#x000e4;ufer, unpublished data). However, none of these studies revealed a ts allele of <italic>prp1</italic> containing a mutation in the N-terminal region of the protein.</p><p>Therefore, we expressed N-terminal mutations in <italic>prp1</italic> in a genetic background which contained a repressible wt gene. Cells expressing both Prp1<sup>wt</sup> and Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 grow with the same growth rate as cells expressing two wt genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Under these conditions, almost no mutant Prp1 associates with the spliceosomal particles sedimenting between 30 and 60 S. Although our data presented in this report reveal that mutant Prp1 does not interfere with the function of Prp1<sup>wt</sup> and that mutant Prp1 not associated with spliceosomal particles eventually becomes degraded, we have no data explaining this phenomenon of extreme allelic exclusion. Therefore, we are prone to speculate. The observation that the wt Prp1<sup>wt</sup> completely outcompetes the mutant protein is consistent with the idea that Prp1 is involved in the activation of spliceosomes. Assuming that pre-mRNA splicing activity is high in growing cells, one would expect that the level of splicing competent spliceosomes containing Prp1<sup>wt</sup> and all five snRNPs is very low. We have made many observations which indicate that Prp1 plays a special role in regulating pre-mRNA splicing in fission yeast. For example, after depletion of Prp1 by switching off the <italic>prp1</italic> gene, pre-mRNA accumulates and pre-spliceosomal complexes containing Prp31 and all five snRNAs still exist, although Prp1<sup>wt</sup> protein was not detectable anymore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we showed that in cells solely expressing Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 the increasing amounts of Prp31 and U1 snRNA correlate with the accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNA associated with pre-catalytic spliceosomes. This is an indication that the expression of Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 does not prevent assembly of spliceosomes on pre-mRNA. We do not know, and cannot probe at this point, whether a proper or aberrant pre-mRNA splicing complex is assembled when Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 is expressed. However, our data are consistent with the notion that expression of Prp1&#x00394;227&#x02013;249 causes spliceosomes to stall before activation. Interestingly, all the N-terminal mutations investigated show similar phenotypes, emphasizing that the N-terminus of Prp1 is crucial for activation of spliceosomes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We determined the phosphorylation sites of Prp4 kinase in Prp1. The generation of the phosphopeptide maps revealed that seven threonine residues in the N-terminus of Prp1 are strongly phosphorylated by Prp4 kinase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, asterisks). Our experimental approach to determine by <italic>in vivo</italic> labeling and subsequent phosphopeptide mapping whether the <italic>in vitro</italic> sites are also used <italic>in vivo</italic> was cumbersome and revealed convincing data only for the threonine residue at position 244 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C and data not shown). However, phospho-proteomic analyses of fission yeast and of human cell extracts identified phosphates at the amino acid residues in positions 235, 244 and 248, indicating that these amino acids are phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Together, these findings led us suggest that this region is a target of kinases, including Prp4. Most intriguingly, this region, including the positions of the phosphorylation sites, is highly conserved throughout the kingdoms with the remarkable exception of Prp6 of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (including all Hemiascomycetes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C).</p><p>We still do not know what the molecular consequences are, when Prp1 is phosphorylated by Prp4 kinase <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, based on our results presented here and before, we hypothesize that in fission yeast phosphorylation of Prp1 by Prp4 kinase is part of the process in which spliceosomes are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>In an elegant study demonstrating that <italic>rem1</italic> encoding a meiotic cyclin is only expressed when a 87-nt intron is spliced out, it has been shown that pre-mRNA splicing is coupled with transcription in fission yeast. Splicing of <italic>rem1</italic>-pre-mRNA is dependent on the meiosis specific transcription factor Mei4 regulating transcription of the <italic>rem1</italic> gene and recruiting the splicing machinery to the transcribed locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52 B53 B54">52&#x02013;54</xref>). This is one of the very few examples of pre-mRNA splicing regulation in fission yeast so far. However, in fission yeast about 45% of the genes contain introns. Genes contain from one to more than 10 introns and the introns are small with a mean size of 78 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Thus, we reason that in general removal of introns in fission yeast is constitutive by default and, if splicing is coupled with transcription the spliceosomes need to be activated at transcribed loci after the splicing apparatus has recognized the introns to be spliced out. We suggest that phosphorylation of Prp1 by Prp4 kinase plays a role within the described scenario&#x02014;either the phosphorylation by Prp4 kinase is part of a mechanism that signals that an intron is occupied by a splicing competent spliceosome in a sense of quality control and/or the phosphorylation is directly involved in inducing the rearrangements for catalysis. In any case, our hypothesis can be experimentally approached and further analysis will help to provide insight into the complex control mechanisms exerted to express intron-containing genes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp1155/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Aleh Razanau is a scholar of the Georg-Christoph-Lichtenberg program &#x0201c;Molecular Complexes of Biomedical Relevance&#x0201d; at the Technische Universit&#x000e4;t Braunschweig working towards a PhD.
