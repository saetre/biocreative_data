We have shown that carriage of the T variant (CT or TT) of <italic>PTPN22 </italic>in combination with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies highly increases the odds ratio for developing RA. In the present study we analysed the association between the <italic>PTPN22 </italic>1858C/T polymorphism and early RA in patients from northern Sweden, related the polymorphism to autoantibodies and the HLA-DR shared epitope, and analysed their association with markers for disease activity and progression. The inception cohort includes individuals who also donated samples before disease onset. A case&#x02013;control study was performed in patients (<italic>n </italic>= 505; 342 females and 163 males) with early RA (mean duration of symptoms = 6.3 months) and in population-based matched controls (<italic>n </italic>= 970) from northern Sweden. Genotyping of the <italic>PTPN22 </italic>1858C/T polymorphism was performed using a TaqMan instrument. HLA-shared epitope alleles were identified using PCR sequence-specific primers. Anti-CCP2 antibodies were determined using enzyme-linked immunoassays. Disease activity (that is, the number of swollen and tender joints, the global visual analogue scale, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate) was followed on a regular basis (that is, at baseline and after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months). Both the 1858T allele and the carriage of T were associated with RA (&#x003c7;<sup>2 </sup>= 23.84, P = 0.000001, odds ratio = 1.69, 95% confidence interval = 1.36&#x02013;2.11; and &#x003c7;<sup>2 </sup>= 22.68, P = 0.000002, odds ratio = 1.79, 95% confidence interval = 1.40&#x02013;2.29, respectively). Association of the 1858T variant with RA was confined to seropositive disease. Carriage of 1858T and the presence of anti-CCP antibodies was independently associated with disease onset at an earlier age (P &#x0003c; 0.05 and P &#x0003c; 0.01, respectively), while the combination of both resulted in an even earlier age at onset. Smoking was identified as a risk factor independent of the 1858T variant and anti-CCP antibodies.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent studies have shown that a missense single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in a substitution of T for C at position 1858 in the protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (<italic>PTPN22</italic>) gene is associated with several autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Several of the autoimmune diseases associated with the <italic>PTPN22 </italic>1858T variant are characterized by the presence of autoantibodies. These autoantibodies can be present several years before onset of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We have previously shown that a combination of the T variant of <italic>PTPN22 </italic>and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies in combination strongly predicts the future onset of RA with a specificity of 100% for the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The association between the <italic>PTPN22 </italic>polymorphism and RA has been replicated by several groups studying different RA populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The first study on <italic>PTPN22 </italic>limited its association to rheumatoid factor-positive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This polymorphism has subsequently been associated with both seropositive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and seronegative disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In addition to genetic factors, environmental factors have been proposed to be of importance in the aetiology of RA. Several studies have suggested smoking to be the major environmental risk factor for RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. HLA-shared epitope (SE) alleles and smoking have also recently been shown to act synergistically as risk factors, but only in anti-CCP antibody-positive patients with RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Considering our findings of a stronger predictive value of the combination of <italic>PTPN22 </italic>1858T variant with anti-CCP antibodies compared with HLA-SE and anti-CCP antibodies for development of RA in individuals before disease onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], the aim of the present study was to investigate the 1858 C/T polymorphism in relation to the presence of autoantibodies and HLA-SE alleles in an inception cohort of RA patients from northern Sweden for disease susceptibility, onset and inflammatory activity during the first 2 years. The individuals with blood samples before disease onset were included in the cohort of patients with early RA after disease onset.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Patients from the four northern-most counties of Sweden with early RA (duration of symptoms &#x0003c; 12 months) were consecutively included in the study and followed for 2 years.

The patients were assessed clinically at baseline and after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months using the 28-joint count for tender and swollen joints and a global visual analogue scale, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was measured. The Disease Activity Score (DAS28) was calculated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Of the patients identified, 505 (342 females, 163 males) were willing to participate and donated DNA for this study.

Both smoking and HLA-SE predicted significantly the presence of anti-CCP antibodies, with the strongest impact from HLA-SE (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.11&#x02013;2.57 and OR = 3.25, 95% CI = 2.15&#x02013;4.92, respectively).</p><p>There was no difference in the levels of anti-CCP antibodies in patients with or without the 1858T variant or carrying HLA-SE. In the subcohort of individuals for whom samples were available before disease onset (<italic>n </italic>= 85), anti-CCP antibodies were present in 32.1%. Among those who lacked anti-CCP antibodies before disease onset but who turned anti-CCP antibody positive at disease onset, 62.5% were HLA-SE positive while 40% were HLA-SE negative (not significant). There was no relationship between carriage of the T variant and developing anti-CCP antibodies at disease onset compared with not carrying the T variant (51.4% versus 52.4%, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, an association of the 1858T allele of <italic>PTPN22 </italic>with RA was found in 505 individuals from the four northern-most counties of Sweden with early RA,. In agreement with a study from southern Sweden and also other studies, this association was confined to patients with seropositive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Both the 1858T variant and HLA-SE alleles predicted RA, with an increase of the relative risk of each when present in combination with anti-CCP antibodies. This was also found in individuals who subsequently developed RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the present study, in patients with early RA (that is, after disease onset), there was no significant association between the 1858T variant and anti-CCP antibodies, whereas HLA-SE was strongly associated with anti-CCP antibodies. The increase in the number of anti-CCP antibody-positive patients after disease onset was greater among those carrying HLA-SE alleles. This was evaluated in a subcohort of individuals who were anti-CCP-negative prior to onset of symptoms of disease but who became seropositive after disease onset; however, the number of individuals concerned was small and the difference did not reach statistical significance. These results could suggest that the 1858T variant is important before the disease has developed to a clinical stage, whereas HLA-SE is of significant importance when the disease has developed. Both these and our previous studies confirm that anti-CCP antibodies are the major predictor for RA. Taken together, these results could indicate that both genes contribute to the development of a disease, such as RA, by interfering in separate ways or at separate stages of pathogenesis (for example, by acting at various levels in the immunological process leading to the development of a disease). HLA-SE is believed to be involved in the antigen-presenting process whereas the role of the <italic>PTPN22 </italic>polymorphism for various parts of the immune system is not yet clear. The PTPN22 polymorphism is associated with several other autoimmune diseases, while HLA-SE is strongly related only to RA.</p><p>In contrast to most previous studies, we found that the PTPN22 1858T variant and HLA-SE are significantly associated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. One study has observed an association of the <italic>PTPN22 </italic>1858T variant and HLA-SE, but this was restricted to male patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Smoking has been shown to be the major environmental risk factor for RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In our study, smoking was a risk factor for RA independent of anti-CCP antibodies and the 1858T variant. In simple logistic regression analyses of anti-CCP antibody-negative patients, smoking was the only significant risk factor for RA, but this significance was lost in multiple logistic regression analysis. In the presence of anti-CCP antibodies, HLA-SE was a risk factor for RA; addition of smoking increased this risk approximately three-fold, which confirms the results presented in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The genotype and allele frequencies of the <italic>PTPN22 </italic>polymorphism in patients and controls were higher in our study than those reported by some other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Our results are consistent with the previously reported increasing south to north gradient in the frequency of the 1858T variant in white European populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>A gene-dosage effect of the 1858T allele has been suggested because a higher susceptibility for RA was found in individuals homozygous for the T allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We similarly found the OR for homozygous carriers of the T allele to be higher than that for heterozygous carriers (2.26 versus 1.69), suggesting a dose effect of the T allele of PTPN22. The number of homozygous carriers we were able to study, however, was small (<italic>n </italic>= 15).</p><p>Little is known about the effect of 1858T on disease severity and activity. Most studies investigating the effect of 1858T on clinical characteristics have found no association of 1858T with disease severity or activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. To analyse the effect of the 1858T variant on disease activity we calculated the area under the curve using DAS28 values for 24 months, but no significant association of 1858T with disease activity was found. There was a significant difference in disease activity at 6 months (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05),, when 1858T carriers had a higher DAS28 than patients without the T variant. This difference was not due to a difference in treatment prescribed; instead, it is possible that carriers of 1858T do not respond primarily as well to the treatment as non-T-carriers. The statistical significance did not remain, however, after correction for the number of performed tests.</p><p>It has been shown that the 1858T variant contributes to an earlier age at onset of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We were able to confirm this finding; patients with the T variant were significantly younger compared with patients not carrying the T variant. The presence of anti-CCP antibodies, particularly in combination with 1858T, contributed to an earlier age at onset of the disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The PTPN22 1858C/T polymorphism was shown to be associated with early RA in the northern Swedish population and was confined to seropositive disease. Patients carrying the 1858T variant had an earlier onset of the disease, particularly when in combination with anti-CCP antibodies. Furthermore, we could verify a south&#x02013;north gradient with high frequencies of the <italic>PTPN22 </italic>1858 T variant in patients and controls. Smoking was, in this patient cohort, a risk factor for RA independent of the 1858T variant and seropositivity for anti-CCP antibodies.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>anti-CCP = anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide; CI = confidence interval; DAS28 = disease activity score; HLA = human leukocyte antigen; OR = odds ratio; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; PTPN22 = protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22; RA = rheumatoid arthritis; SE = shared epitope.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HK was the main investigator, carried out the genotyping and the statistics, and contributed to preparation of the manuscript.
