The question that remains open concerns the function of LRP1 in adipogenesis. Here, we show that LRP1 is highly expressed in murine preadipocytes as well as in primary culture of human adipocytes. Moreover, LRP1 remains abundantly synthesised during mouse and human adipocyte differentiation. We demonstrate that LRP1 silencing in 3T3F442A murine preadipocytes significantly inhibits the expression of PPAR&#x003b3;, HSL and aP2 adipocyte differentiation markers after adipogenesis induction, and leads to lipid-depleted cells. We further show that the absence of lipids in LRP1-silenced preadipocytes is not caused by lipolysis induction. In addition, we provide the first evidences that LRP1 is significantly up-regulated in obese C57BI6/J mouse adipocytes and obese human adipose tissues. Interestingly, silencing of LRP1 in fully-differentiated adipocytes also reduces cellular lipid level and is associated with an increase of basal lipolysis. However, the ability of mature adipocytes to induce lipolysis is independent of LRP1 expression. Altogether, our findings highlight the dual role of LRP1 in the control of adipogenesis and lipid homeostasis, and suggest that LRP1 may be an important therapeutic target in obesity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Consumption of meals rich in fat and carbohydrates is a major causative factor of obesity, resulting in excessive white adipose tissue.

Here, we report that LRP1 expression is necessary for adipocyte differentiation. Silencing of LRP1 in preadipocytes by the use of siRNAs significantly inhibits the expression of PPAR&#x003b3;, HSL and aP2 adipocyte differentiation markers, and leads to lipid-depleted cells inept to induce lipolysis. Moreover, we corroborated the key function of LRP1 in maintaining the lipid levels in mature adipocytes. Until now, the implication of LRP1 in obesity has not been reported yet in human. Our study highlights, for the first time, that LRP1 expression is up-regulated in obese human tissue, and suggests that this receptor may be an interesting therapeutic target in obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>LRP1 is highly expressed in adipocytes during adipogenesis in mouse and human</title><p>In order to explore the function of adipocytic LRP1, we first investigated the level of LRP1 protein expression in preadipocytes relative to fibroblasts and epithelial cancer cells.

Indeed, the most obvious feature of adipocytes is the synthesis and storage of triglycerides in lipid droplets and therefore the gradual appearance and growth of lipid droplets are characteristic for adipocyte precursor cells undergoing adipogenic differentiation. The presence of these neutral lipids was detected by oil red O staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007422-g005">Fig. 5A&#x02013;B</xref>).

Microscopic analysis at day 3 and 7 of differentiation illustrated that, as attempted, Luc siRNA-transfected 3T3F442A cells accumulated numerous large lipid droplets and adopted a non adherent round morphology characteristic of mature adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007422-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, panels a and c).

Moreover, cells kept the morphological feature of adherent fibroblastic cells, suggesting that preadipocyte differentiation process did not occur in the absence of LRP1. Quantification of lipids afterwards demonstrated that silencing of LRP1 with LRP1 siRNA1 significantly decreased lipid content levels by 7 fold at day 7 of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007422-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, panel a).

Since LRP1 is expressed at high levels in preadipocytes, it therefore can be involved in the early steps of adipocyte differentiation. Indeed, our report demonstrate that LRP1 silencing by siRNAs in 3T3F442A preadipocytes significantly inhibits the expression of PPAR&#x003b3;, HSL and aP2 adipocyte markers of differentiation and leads to lipid-depleted cells, indicating that LRP1 is a key regulator of the adipogenic process. Our experiments using 3 LRP1 siRNAs show that LRP1 extinction abrogates adipocyte differentiation in a LRP1 dose-dependent manner. Our results also pinpoint that extinction of LRP1 expression in pre-adipocytes prevents their lipolytic response both at a basal level and after isoproterenol induction. Therefore the inhibition of lipid accumulation and triglyceride levels observed in LRP1-silenced preadipocytes is not the consequence of a stimulation of lipolysis, indicating a direct effect of LRP1 on the control of the adipogenic process. PPAR&#x003b3; is known to be crucial for the initiation of adipocyte differention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007422-He1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

This suggests the existence of a regulatory loop between these two factors. Our findings reveal that LRP1 silencing inhibits the expression of PPAR&#x003b3; by 80&#x00025; at day 3 of differentiation, indicating an early effect of LRP1 at the commencement of adipogenesis. It is therefore important to determine how LRP1 lost down-regulates PPAR&#x003b3; expression.

Studies in the future will investigate whether LRP1-ICD regulates PPAR&#x003b3; expression in preadipocytes.</p><p>Our results also indicate, for the first time, that LRP1 expression is up-regulated in human obese tissue. This up-regulation of LRP1 expression in the VAT of overweight/obese patients is in consensus with our results in obese mice. Obesity is characterized by the increase of intracellular lipid accumulation which shows a significant correlation with adipocyte differentiation. Terminally differentiated adipocytes cannot divide. Hence, alterations in the number of fat cells within the body must be accomplished by the differentiation of preadipocytes, which act as a renewable source of adipocytes. Interestingly, our <italic>in vitro</italic> study in 3T3F442A cells indicates that LRP1 expression is required for adipocyte differentiation and since LRP1 is abundantly expressed in adipocytes, we propose that LRP1 may participate in the onset of obesity. The crucial role of LRP1 in obesity is also supported by a recent study showing that adipocyte LRP1&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice have an overall decrease in fat mass and are protected from high-fat diet-induced obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007422-Hofmann1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.
