These vectors contain restriction sites for cloning a wide variety of DNA fragments within a small, non-autonomous P element and can be used to efficiently transduce microinjected DNA sequences into the germ line chromosomes of D. melanogaster. The P element in one vector also carries the rosy gene which serves as an easily scored marker to facilitate the transfer of DNA fragments that do not themselves confer a recognizable phenotype. The failure of certain P element constructs to function as vectors suggests that P element sequences, in addition to the 31 bp inverse terminal repeats, are required in cis for transposition. Moreover, removal of the first 38 bp of the autonomous 2.9 kb P element appears to destroy its ability to provide a trans-acting factor (s) required for the transposition of non-autonomous P elements. Finally, we describe a genomic sequence arrangement that apparently arose by the transposition of a 54 kb composite P element from a tetramer plasmid.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0200-a" xlink:role="6349"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6341"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6342"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6343"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6344"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0196.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6345"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0197.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6346"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0198.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6347"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0199.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6348"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0200.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6349"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0201.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6350"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00363-0202.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6351"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
