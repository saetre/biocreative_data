Here, using a macrophage-specific Dectin-1 deficient mice model, we demonstrate that Dectin-1 is essential to control fungal gastrointestinal infection by PPAR&#x003b3; ligands. We also show that the phagocytosis of yeast and the release of reactive oxygen intermediates in response to <italic>Candida albicans</italic> challenge are impaired in macrophages from Dectin-1 deficient mice treated with PPAR&#x003b3; ligands or IL-13. Although the Mannose Receptor is not sufficient to trigger antifungal functions during the alternative activation of macrophages, our data establish the involvement of the Mannose Receptor in the initial recognition of non-opsonized <italic>Candida albicans</italic> by macrophages. We also demonstrate for the first time that the modulation of Dectin-1 expression by IL-13 involves the PPAR&#x003b3; signaling pathway. These findings are consistent with a crucial role for PPAR&#x003b3; in the alternative activation of macrophages by Th2 cytokines.

The main host defense mechanisms against this yeast are engulfment and the production of reactive oxygen molecules by macrophages through Dectin-1 and the Mannose Receptor, two macrophage receptors for <italic>Candida albicans</italic> cell wall sugars. However, the contribution of these two receptors remains unclear. In our animal experiments, the lack of Dectin-1 in macrophages renders the animals more susceptible to gastrointestinal infection with <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, demonstrating the essential role of Dectin-1 in antifungal defense. In addition, our experiments established that the interaction between Dectin-1 and Mannose Receptor is important to orchestrate the host antifungal defense. Thus, <italic>Candida albicans</italic> clearance would be improved by Dectin-1 and Mannose Receptor up-regulation. Interestingly, we had established that the expression of these two receptors was increased by IL-13 through the activation of the nuclear receptor PPAR&#x003b3;, suggesting that PPAR&#x003b3; could be a therapeutic target to eliminate fungal infection.

These PRRs can recognize highly conserved microbial structures, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The PRR ligands comprise carbohydrate structures, peptidoglycans or lipopolysaccharides. The best characterized family of PRRs is the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) originally supposed to mediate cellular signaling, but the membrane-associated C-type lectin receptors have since emerged as major receptors in functions related to pathogen binding, uptake, and killing. They also contribute to the initiation and the modulation of the immune response. The C-type lectins form a group of proteins with at least one lectin-like carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) in their extracellular carboxy-terminal domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Willment1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The C-type lectin Dectin-1 is a major &#x003b2;-glucan receptor on the surface of macrophages, DCs, neutrophils and it is also expressed on certain lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Taylor1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. This type II transmembrane receptor consists of a single CRD involved in the calcium-independent recognition of &#x003b2;-1, 3-glucans exposed on particles such as zymosan, or many fungal species, including <italic>Saccharomyces, Pneumocystis, Aspergillus</italic> and <italic>Candida</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Brown1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Adams1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p><italic>C.albicans</italic> is the most common cause of opportunistic mycotic infections in severely immunocompromised hosts and during metabolic disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Pfaller1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The cell wall of this yeast is almost exclusively composed of glycans, such as mannans and &#x003b2;-glucans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Chaffin1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Mannans are the major component of outer cell wall while &#x003b2;-(1,3)- and &#x003b2;-(1,6)-glucans are more prominent in the inner layer. However, there is some surface exposure of &#x003b2;-glucans, particularly in areas where yeast cells bud during mother&#x02013;daughter cell separation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Gantner1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Netea1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The recognition of the multilayered carbohydrate structures of the fungal cell wall depends on various PRRs, such as the Mannose Receptor (MR), and the &#x003b2;-glucan receptor Dectin-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Netea1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Brown3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The respective roles of these PPRs in the non-opsonic recognition of <italic>C. albicans</italic> by macrophages remain unclear. Several studies support the view that the MR plays a crucial role in non-opsonized <italic>C.albicans</italic> recognition and phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Netea1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Porcaro1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Poulain1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, Dectin-1-induced-signaling leads to the production of cytokines and non-opsonic phagocytosis of yeast by murine macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-LeibundGutLandmann1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Herre1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Dectin-1 also mediates respiratory burst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Gantner2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and its involvement has been suggested in the activation and regulation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Suram1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Dectin-1 signaling pathway activation depends on its cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) the phosphorylation of which by Src kinase leads to the recruitment of spleen tyrosine kinase Syk in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Gross1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the contribution of the MR and Dectin-1 in non-opsonized <italic>C.albicans</italic> recognition, phagocytosis and killing is established, the point of intervention of these receptors in these processes remains unclear. In addition, depending on the context of the macrophage activation, the expression profile of PRRs is different. Thus, the change in the PRRs expression has to be taken into account in studying the involvement of these receptors in antifungal functions.</p><p>In mice, the expression of Dectin-1 can be influenced by various cytokines, steroids and microbial stimuli. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13, for example, which are associated with the alternative activation of macrophages (macrophages M2), markedly increase the expression of Dectin-1 at the cell surface, whereas LPS and dexamethasone repress Dectin-1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Willment2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, the Dectin-1 regulation pathway remains unclear. Empirical data suggest that the increase in Dectin-1 expression by IL-4 involved the STAT signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Murray1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, another study showed in genetic models of macrophage specific Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) or STAT-6 knockout mice, that the IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6/PPAR&#x003b3; axis is required for the maturation of alternatively activated macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Odegaard1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in this context, the signaling pathway involved in the modulation of Dectin-1 expression remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In this study we determined the respective roles of the MR and Dectin-1 in the control of fungal infection. Interestingly, we showed that <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, Dectin-1 is essential both to trigger the phagocytosis of non-opsonized <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and the respiratory burst after yeast challenge and to control fungal gastrointestinal infection. These data also established that the MR alone is not sufficient to trigger antifungal functions during macrophage alternative activation, indicating a cooperative role for Dectin-1 and the MR in the induction of the host antifungal response against <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. Moreover, we showed for the first time the involvement of the PPAR&#x003b3; signaling pathway in the regulation of Dectin-1 expression by IL-13.

We have demonstrated that depending on the context of macrophage activation, the receptors involved in yeast initial binding are different. Interestingly, we showed that the MR is the main PRR for the initial binding only in a M2 activation context in which the macrophages strongly expressed the MR at their surface. In contrast, the results of binding of non-opsonized <italic>C.albicans</italic> by resident macrophages showed that the MR is not involved in the recognition of non-opsonized <italic>C.albicans</italic>. This finding is consistent with the study which showed that resident macrophages do not express the MR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Taylor1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, we showed that Dectin-1 is not involved in the initial binding of non-opsonized <italic>C.albicans</italic> in resident macrophages. Moreover, in M2 activated macrophages, Dectin-1 is also not implicated in recognition of non-opsonized <italic>C.albicans</italic>. This finding is in line with a study on dendritic cells which showed that the addition of anti-MR and anti-DC-SIGN blocking agents inhibited the binding of non-opsonized <italic>C.albicans</italic> whereas the addition of an anti-Dectin-1 blocking agent did not change this recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Cambi1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. However, after 60 min of interaction between non-opsonized <italic>C.albicans</italic> and macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>, we showed that Dectin-1 is sufficient to trigger the phagocytosis of non-opsonized <italic>C.albicans</italic> and respiratory burst after challenge with the yeast. Indeed, our results obtained with laminarin are consistent with our data using Dectin-1 knockout macrophages that confirm that the impairment of this receptor strongly decreased the antifungal response. Heinsbroek and coworkers have reported that the phagocytosis of unopsonized <italic>C.albicans</italic> by thioglycollate-ellicited macrophages of Dectin-1 deficient mice was reduced by 80&#x00025;, showing that Dectin-1 is the main PRR for the initial phagocytosis by thioglycollate-ellicited macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Heinsbroek1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. These authors also have showed the lack of effects on MR in phagocytosis of <italic>Candida</italic> by thioglycollate-ellicited macrophages in which the MR is mainly intracellular in location. These data are also consistent with studies which showed that silencing Dectin-1 expression in macrophages with micro-RNA abolishes the zymosan-induced ROS production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Goodridge1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and that the Dectin-1 engagement was sufficient to trigger phagocytosis and ROS production stimulated by zymosan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Underhill1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> or by <italic>C.albicans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Gantner1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study we demonstrated that the initial binding of the yeast through the MR does not seem to be directly involved in Dectin-1-dependant <italic>C.albicans</italic> uptake and respiratory burst. Altogether these results strongly suggest that another receptor could be implicated in the initial step of the Dectin-1-dependant phagocytosis of non-opsonized <italic>C.albicans</italic> and ROS production. This hypothesis is in line with a recent study which showed that complement receptor 3 accumulates at the site of particle binding and hence suggests it has a role during fungal recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Heinsbroek1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The major contribution of Dectin-1 in <italic>C.albicans</italic> internalization and ROS production <italic>in vitro</italic> supports our <italic>in vivo</italic> study which showed that Dectin-1 knockout mice were more susceptible to gastrointestinal candidiasis. This increased <italic>Candida</italic> colonization of the stomach and cecum in macrophage-specific Dectin-1 deficient mice correlated with the decrease in the effective functions of their macrophages <italic>ex vivo</italic>, as observed <italic>in vitro</italic>. These data demonstrated that Dectin-1 is required for the host defense to GI infection with <italic>C.albicans</italic> and support the role of Dectin-1 in the <italic>in vivo</italic> control of <italic>C.albicans</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Taylor2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

Similarly, we demonstrated here that rosiglitazone, a specific PPAR&#x003b3; ligand, improved GI fungal clearance only in control mice and this amelioration was correlated with an increased in antifungal functions of their macrophages <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<italic>Candida</italic> phagocytosis and ROS production). Nevertheless, the treatment of macrophage-specific Dectin-1 deficient mice with rosiglitazone did not enhance the <italic>Candida</italic> elimination in GI tract while the rosiglitazone treatment increased the expression of MR. Altogether these data established that the MR alone is not sufficient to trigger the antifungal functions and the antifungal action of rosiglitazone is dependent on Dectin-1. We also show that the phagocytosis of yeast and the release of reactive oxygen intermediates in response to <italic>Candida albicans</italic> challenge are impaired in macrophages from Dectin-1 deficient mice treated with rosiglitazone. This <italic>in vivo</italic> study demonstrates that Dectin-1 is essential both to trigger the phagocytosis of non-opsonised <italic>C.albicans</italic> and the respiratory burst after yeast challenge, and to control fungal GI infection. In parallel, the involvement of the MR in the initial binding during M2 activation demonstrates that the MR and Dectin-1 are essential for an optimal antifungal host defence. Altogether these data suggest a cooperative role for these two receptors in the induction of the immune response against <italic>Candida</italic> by rosiglitazone. This cooperation between the MR, Dectin-1 and TLR2 was also demonstrated in the pathway involved in IL-1&#x003b2; production by <italic>C.albicans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-vandeVeerdonk1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The involvement of Dectin-1 in improving the resolution of candidiasis by PPAR&#x003b3; ligands is in line with our results which showed for the first time that the increase in Dectin-1 cell surface expression by IL-13 was mediated by the PPAR&#x003b3; signaling pathway. The implication of PPAR&#x003b3; in the transcriptional regulation of Dectin-1 is also confirmed by an <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of the Dectin-1 promoter using Genomatix software. One putative PPAR&#x003b3; responsive element was found in the reverse strand of this promoter. These results highlight that PPAR&#x003b3; is required for the maturation of alternatively activated macrophages. Indeed, we have previously shown that the PPAR&#x003b3; pathway was required <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> for the induction of the expression of the M2 marker MR (CD206) and CD36 expression during alternative activation of monocytes/macrophages by IL-13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Coste1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Coste2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Berry1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

These authors also reported that thiazolidinediones treatment significantly increased the expression of the M2 marker MR (CD206) in PBMC isolated from patients. In our study, we also show that both 15-&#x00394;PGJ<sub>2</sub> and rosiglitazone up-regulated Dectin-1 expression through PPAR&#x003b3;. Indeed, in the absence of PPAR&#x003b3; in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, IL-13 or PPAR&#x003b3; agonists do not induce the increase of Dectin-1 expression, and the effect of the PPAR&#x003b3; agonists or of IL-13 on this expression is restored by the pCMV-PPAR&#x003b3; transfection in these cells. These findings join a paradigm initiated by Huang and coworkers for the regulation of nuclear receptor function by Th2-type cytokines in an alternative pathway of macrophage activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Huang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this manuscript, we determined the signaling pathway triggered by IL-13 resulting in the increase of Dectin-1 expression.

Thus, we showed that IL-13 can positively regulate Dectin-1 expression partly by controlling the production of PPAR&#x003b3; endogenous ligands through cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation. These data are supported by the work of Huang and coworkers who showed that IL-4 leads to the production of PPAR&#x003b3; endogenous ligands and by our confocal microscopy studies illustrating that IL-13 generates 15-&#x00394;PGJ2 production and this nuclear localization in human monocytes and murine macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Coste2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Berry1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000714-Huang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In summary, we have established that Dectin-1 is essential both to trigger the phagocytosis of non-opsonized <italic>C.albicans</italic> and respiratory burst after yeast challenge during alternative macrophage activation and to control fungal GI infection.

These findings suggest that the cooperation between Dectin-1 and the MR is necessary to orchestrate the antifungal response.
