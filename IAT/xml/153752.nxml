Here we map DNA binding to N-terminal fragments of Mlh1 and Pms1. We demonstrate that Mlh1 and Pms1 N-terminal domains (NTDs) independently bind to double-stranded and single-stranded DNA, in the absence of dimerization and with different affinities. Full-length Mlh1p alone, which can homodimerize, also binds to DNA. Substituting conserved positively charged amino acids in Mlh1 produces mutator phenotypes in a haploid yeast strain characteristic of reduced MMR. These substitutions strongly reduce DNA binding by the Mlh1 NTD and, to a lesser extent, they also reduce DNA binding by full-length Mlh1 and the Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 heterodimer. Replacement of a homologous Pms1 residue has a much smaller effect on mutation rate and does not reduce DNA binding. The results demonstrate that NTDs of yeast Mlh1 and Pms1 contain independent DNA binding sites and they suggest that the C-terminal region of Mlh1p may also contribute to DNA binding. The differential mutator effects and binding properties observed here further suggest that Mlh1 and Pms1 differ in their interactions with DNA. Finally, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that DNA binding by Mlh1 is important for MMR.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>MutL homologs have been implicated in numerous DNA transactions including DNA mismatch repair (MMR), mitotic and meiotic recombination, transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, apoptosis and somatic hypermutation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c1">1</xref>). The best understood role of MutL homologs is in MMR, where they are responsible for coupling mismatch recognition by MutS homologs to downstream signals and events such as strand discrimination, mismatch excision and DNA resynthesis (for recent reviews on MMR see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c2">2</xref>).</p><p>MutL homologs exist predominantly as dimeric complexes. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, MutL is a homodimer of 68 kDa subunits in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c3">3</xref>). In eukaryotes, MutL homologs form multiple heterodimeric complexes that have specific cellular functions. In yeast and humans, Mlh1 is a common subunit of the three known heterodimeric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c9">9</xref>). The Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 heterodimer in yeast and the MLH1&#x02013;PMS2 heterodimer in humans and mice are the primary participants in MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c10">10</xref>). In yeast, there is evidence that the Mlh1&#x02013;Mlh3 and Mlh1&#x02013;Mlh2 complexes participate in correcting specific subsets of the frameshift intermediates processed by the MMR system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c5">5</xref>).</p><p>All MutL homologs contain a set of conserved amino acid motifs near the N-terminus that are common to the GHKL protein family and form a nucleotide binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c13">13</xref>). ATP binding and very weak ATPase activities were demonstrated for <italic>E.coli</italic> MutL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c14">14</xref>), human PMS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c15">15</xref>) and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Mlh1 and Pms1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c16">16</xref>). These ATPase activities are required for normal MMR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c17">17</xref>). In addition to binding and hydrolyzing ATP, MutL homologs bind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in a sequence- and mismatch-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>). High affinity binding to dsDNA by the yeast Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 heterodimer is strongly cooperative. Atomic force microscopy images of protein&#x02013; DNA complexes reveal that two duplexes are bound concomitantly, such that two separate helices are seen together in a long track of cooperatively bound protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>). This suggests that binding occurs at more than one site on the heterodimer. The functional significance of DNA binding by eukaryotic MutL homologs is currently unknown and most discussions of MMR do not yet incorporate their DNA binding properties into the repair mechanism. In this study, we report that both subunits of the yeast Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 complex contain distinct and independent DNA binding sites located within N-terminal domains (NTDs). We then provide evidence suggesting that DNA binding by the yeast Mlh1 is important for MMR and we present a model to incorporate this property into the MMR reaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>Denatured calf thymus DNA&#x02013;cellulose (ssDNA&#x02013;cellulose) and &#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs. Trypsin and chymotrypsin were from Sigma.

Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 was from Bio-Rad.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein purification</title><p>Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 and Mlh1 were overproduced and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c22">22</xref>). Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396) and their mutant derivatives were purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c16">16</xref>) with a single modification. Because some of the mutant proteins exhibited defective DNA binding, the final purification step consisting of enterokinase cleavage followed by a ssDNA affinity column was eliminated. Thus, all proteins used in this study retain the N-terminal 6-His affinity tag encoded by pET30a (Novagen). In comparison to our earlier studies of untagged wild-type Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396), the affinity tag did not significantly alter binding of Mlh1(343) or Pms1(396) to DNA in standard filter binding assays or to ATP in proteolysis protection assays. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c23">23</xref>) using reagents from Bio-Rad and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Mutations in Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396) were generated with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c16">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Partial proteolysis and ssDNA affinity chromatography</title><p>For Mlh1, reactions (20 &#x000b5;l) contained 17.5 &#x000b5;g protein in 25 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0 at 23&#x000b0;C, 10&#x00025; glycerol, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM dithiothreitol and 0.1 mM EDTA.

The chromatography was performed on a Vydac C<sub>4</sub> column (250 &#x000d7; 4.6 mm, 10 &#x000b5;m particle size; Vydac, Hesperia, CA) using a 50 ml linear gradient from 9 to 54&#x00025; acetonitrile containing 0.1&#x00025; trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml&#x0002f;min at room temperature. Samples were lyophilized and redissolved in 20 &#x000b5;l of 50&#x00025; acetonitrile in 0.1&#x00025; trifluoroacetic acid. An aliquot of 0.5 &#x000b5;l was used for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometric analysis as described below to determine the molecular weight. The remaining solution was incubated with 1 &#x000b5;g trypsin in 80 &#x000b5;l of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0, at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 h and used for peptide mapping analysis. Coomassie blue-stained protein bands were excised from SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gels and cut into small pieces, which were then placed in a 96-well tray for digestion. Proteolytic digestions of the excised protein bands were performed using a Progest&#x02122; automated digestion device (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) using a protocol described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c24">24</xref>). Briefly, gel pieces were destained, dehydrated and re-swelled in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.5 containing 10 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Digestion was performed at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 h. After digestion was complete, samples were lyophilized and reconstituted for mass spectrometric analysis in 5 &#x000b5;l of 50&#x00025; acetonitrile&#x0002f;0.1&#x00025; formic acid.</p><p>MALDI mass spectrometric analyses were performed using a DE-STR time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a nitrogen laser (&#x003bb; &#x0003d; 337 nm). Accelerating voltage was set at 25 kV in positive reflector mode. A saturated solution of recrystallized &#x003b1;-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in ethanol:water:formic acid (45:45:10), freshly prepared, was used as the MALDI matrix. Samples (0.5 &#x000b5;l) were spotted on the target plate using the dried droplet method. For the analysis of tryptic peptides, trypsin peaks at mass&#x0002f;charge 1045.5642 and 2211.1046 were used for internal mass calibration. For the molecular weight determination of the 38 and 49 kDa Mlh1 protein domains, bovine serum albumin was used for external calibration.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA binding assays</title><p>Nitrocellulose filter binding assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>). Unless specified otherwise, reactions (20 &#x000b5;l) contained 25 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0 at 23&#x000b0;C, 10&#x00025; glycerol, 25 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 100 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml bovine serum albumin and were incubated at room temperature (&#x0223c;23&#x000b0;C). Binding reactions for Mlh1(343) and its mutant derivatives were performed without MgCl<sub>2</sub>, due to the low affinity of these proteins for DNA in the presence of MgCl<sub>2</sub> (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f3">3</xref>C). Both &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;pGBT9 (mol. wt 3 575 000) and &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;poly(dT) (mol. wt 295 000) were utilized as DNA substrates, and binding assay conditions were identical for each substrate.

The DNA concentration in all assays was 5 &#x000b5;M nucleotide for both substrates, or 0.45 nM &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;pGBT9 and 5.5 nM &#x0005b;<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;poly(dT) when expressed as DNA molecules. Protein concentrations were varied as indicated in the figures. For NaCl and MgCl<sub>2</sub> titration experiments, the protein concentrations were 100 nM Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 or 500 nM for Mlh1, Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396).</p><p>Nitrocellulose filters (25 mm, 0.45 &#x000b5;m, HAWP; Millipore Corp.) for DNA binding reactions were soaked in 0.4 M KOH for 20 min, rinsed with deionized water and soaked in binding buffer for at least 1 h. Binding reactions were incubated at room temperature (&#x0223c;23&#x000b0;C) for 10 min. Samples were then diluted with 1 ml binding buffer and applied to filters on a Millipore 1225 sampling vacuum manifold (flow rate &#x0223c;2 ml&#x0002f;min). Filters were washed with an additional 0.75 ml of binding buffer, then removed from the manifold and dried under a heat lamp. Filters were placed in scintillation fluid and filter-bound DNA substrate was quantitated using a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter. The percentage of filter-bound substrate was calculated from the ratio of filter scintillation counts to total counts of substrate in the reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Glutaraldehyde cross-linking</title><p>Reactions (15 &#x000b5;l) contained 25 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.6 at 23&#x000b0;C, 10&#x00025; glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol and protein concentrations indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f4">4</xref>.

The products were applied to a ssDNA&#x02013;cellulose affinity column to identify fragments retaining the capacity to interact with DNA. Partial digestion with chymotrypsin revealed a predominant cleavage site resulting in fragments of 49 and 38 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f1">1</xref>A, arrows 1 and 2). The 38 kDa fragment was completely retained on the column (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f1">1</xref>A, right lane), and it was resistant to further proteolysis, indicating that it is a stable domain that binds to DNA. In contrast, the 49 kDa fragment was not retained on the column. The 38 and 49 kDa fragments were isolated by HPLC and their masses were accurately determined by MALDI mass spectrometry. They were digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides also analyzed by mass spectrometry. The combined results (not shown) demonstrated that the 38 kDa fragment was an NTD of Mlh1 cleaved by chymotrypsin after Phe343. Therefore, yeast Mlh1 contains a site in its 38 kDa NTD that binds to DNA independently of Pms1.</p><p>Because we have not yet been able to purify Pms1 in the absence of Mlh1, we used purified recombinant Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 heterodimer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f1">1</xref>B, left lane) to determine if Pms1 also binds to DNA. Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 was partially digested with chymotrypsin or trypsin and the resulting fragments were tested for binding to the ssDNA&#x02013;cellulose column. We then used mass spectrometry to determine the identities of several protein fragments that flowed through the DNA affinity column (numbered bands in lanes FT in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f1">1</xref>B), as well as several others that bound (numbered bands in lanes B). The open and closed horizontal bars in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f1">1</xref>C are intended to display the range of peptides (but not necessarily the absolute amino acid boundaries) that were identified in the proteolytic fragments within each numbered band excised from the gel in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f1">1</xref>B. This range of peptides refers to the primary amino acid sequence that encompasses all of the tryptic peptides identified by mass spectrometry for a given gel band. All identified fragments that flowed through the DNA affinity column without binding contained C-terminal sequences of Mlh1 or Pms1. In contrast, all identified fragments recovered in the bound fractions contained Mlh1 and&#x0002f;or Pms1 amino acid residues between 100 and 400. Interestingly, the bands numbered 2&#x02013;4, 12 and 13 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f1">1</xref>B each contained N-terminal fragments of both Mlh1 and Pms1. This suggests that proteolysis of these MutL homologs results in similar length fragments of each protein, one or both of which can bind to DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA binding by purified recombinant NTDs</title><p>To assay the DNA binding properties of these proteins under controlled conditions in solution, we expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> the NTD of Mlh1 identified by chymotrypsin proteolysis, designated Mlh1(343). We also expressed a corresponding N-terminal fragment of Pms1 &#x0005b;designated Pms1(396)&#x0005d; that was selected by structure-based sequence alignments with MutL and Mlh1. Both proteins were purified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f2">2</xref>) and their DNA binding properties examined using a filter binding assay. We also studied DNA binding by full-length Mlh1 and intact Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1, both expressed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>). As reported earlier, Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 heterodimer bound with high affinity to duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f3">3</xref>A, closed circles). To monitor binding to ssDNA, we used poly(dT). This synthetic DNA lacks the secondary structure characteristic of M13 ssDNA, which we think leads to high affinity binding by Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>). Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 binds to poly(dT), but with lower affinity than to duplex DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f3">3</xref>B). For example, at 64 nM Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1, 26&#x00025; of duplex DNA was bound (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f1">1</xref>A), while only 4&#x00025; of poly(dT) was bound (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f1">1</xref>B). However, it should be noted that the lower affinity for poly(dT) could be partly due to the decreased affinity of Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 for linear substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>). Full-length Mlh1 alone also bound to these same DNA substrates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f3">3</xref>, open circles). This demonstrates that intact Mlh1 can bind to DNA independently of Pms1. However, the DNA binding affinity of Mlh1 was somewhat lower than that of the heterodimer, which could reflect a difference in dimerization (see below) or a strong contribution of Pms1 to binding.</p><p>Consistent with DNA affinity chromatography results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f1">1</xref>A), Mlh1(343) bound to duplex DNA and to poly(dT) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f3">3</xref>A and B, closed boxes). In a similar manner (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f1">1</xref>B and C), Pms1(396) also bound to both duplex and ssDNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f3">3</xref>A and B, open boxes), with an affinity similar to that of full-length Mlh1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f3">3</xref>A, open circles). Thus, as with Mlh1, the NTD of Pms1 can bind to DNA independently of its normal protein partner. Interestingly, the affinity of Pms1(396) for ssDNA was higher than that of Mlh1(343).</p><p>Since variations in MgCl<sub>2</sub> and NaCl were previously shown to modulate DNA binding by the Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>), experiments were performed to investigate these variations on DNA binding by Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396). These experiments revealed that duplex DNA binding by Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>), full-length Mlh1 and Pms1(396) were each only slightly affected by variations in MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration from 0 to 4 mM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f3">3</xref>C). However, duplex DNA binding by Mlh1(343) was more strongly affected, such that little or no DNA binding was observed above 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f3">3</xref>C, closed boxes). Also, DNA binding by Mlh1(343) was more sensitive to increasing NaCl concentration than was binding by Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1, full-length Mlh1 or Pms1(396) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f3">3</xref>D). These results indicate that the Mlh1 and Pms1 NTDs separately bind to both duplex and ssDNA, but not necessarily in the same manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence that purified NTDs of Mlh1 and Pms1 do not self-associate</title><p>The N-terminus of <italic>E.coli</italic> MutL dimerizes when bound to ATP, creating a groove that was suggested to bind ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c19">19</xref>). Given this hypothesis, we examined whether dimerization of the homologous yeast Mlh1 and Pms1 NTDs are required for DNA binding. We used glutaraldehyde cross-linking and SDS&#x02013;PAGE to evaluate interactions, with Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 and full-length Mlh1 as positive controls. Treatment of intact Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 with 0.0025&#x00025; glutaraldehyde for 3 min generated a predominant band migrating at a position consistent with a heterodimer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f4">4</xref>, upper band in second lane). This cross-linked species was expected based on several studies showing that Mlh1 and Pms1 exist as a heterodimer (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c26">26</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c2">2</xref>), with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for heterodimer formation of 87 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c27">27</xref>). Cross-linking of intact Mlh1 alone by glutaraldehyde also generated a single novel band consistent with a Mlh1&#x02013;Mlh1 homodimer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f4">4</xref>, upper band in fourth lane). The extent of cross-linking of Mlh1 was lower than that of Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1, consistent with the interpretation that intact Mlh1 homodimerizes with a 36-fold higher <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 3.1 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c27">27</xref>). Under the same conditions, we did not detect cross-linking of either Mlh1(343) or Pms1(396) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f4">4</xref>, last four lanes), even using protein concentrations nearly 5-fold higher than that used for intact Mlh1. This indicates that the homodimerization interface of Mlh1 is in the C-terminus and that the homodimerization we see in full-length Mlh1 is not due to the NTD. No cross-linking of Mlh1(343) or Pms1(396) was observed in the presence of ATP or ADPNP (data not shown). These results are consistent with an earlier study in which no dimerization of an NTD of human PMS2 was detected by gel filtration, protein cross-linking or equilibrium ultracentrifugation in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c15">15</xref>). When cross-linking reactions with Mlh1(343) or Pms1(396) and various duplex and ssDNA oligonucleotides were performed in the presence and absence of ATP or ADPNP, again no bands indicative of specific cross-linked dimers were seen (data not shown). Instead, we observed a faint ladder of higher order species indicative of non-specific cross-linking, possibly of adjacently bound protein molecules on the DNA. Thus, dimerization is not required for DNA binding by the Mlh1 and Pms1 NTDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutator phenotypes conferred by amino acid changes in the putative DNA binding sites of Mlh1 and Pms1</title><p>To test whether DNA binding by Mlh1 and Pms1 is important for MMR, we attempted to identify amino acid replacements that confer a mutator phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic> indicative of reduced MMR activity and concomitantly result in diminished DNA binding. The fact that Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 binding to DNA is sensitive to the concentration of NaCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f3">3</xref>D) suggests that binding involves ionic contacts between positively charged amino acid side chains and the negatively charged DNA backbone. The data presented above indicate that at least some of the candidate DNA binding residues are in NTDs of Mlh1 and Pms1, but perhaps not among the first &#x0223c;100 amino acids. The structure of the NTD of <italic>E.coli</italic> MutL with bound ADPNP &#x0005b;Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f5">5</xref>A, adapted from Ban <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c19">19</xref>)&#x0005d; reveals a positive surface potential in a groove between the two subunits of the dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c19">19</xref>). This groove was proposed to participate in DNA binding and, in support of this proposal, replacement of Arg266 in &#x003b1;-helix H of MutL with glutamic acid (to reverse the charge) resulted in decreased binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c19">19</xref>). Although Arg266 in <italic>E.coli</italic> MutL is not conserved in eukaryotic homologs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f5">5</xref>C), positive potential was reportedly conserved in the homologous region of human PMS2 &#x0005b;Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f5">5</xref>B, adapted from Guarn&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c15">15</xref>)&#x0005d;, and a histidine in MutL aligns with arginines and lysines in yeast and human MutL homologs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f5">5</xref>B). On this basis, we replaced Lys328 of yeast Pms1 and Arg274 of yeast Mlh1 with glutamic acid. Because the adjacent Mlh1 Arg273 could also potentially interact with DNA, we created a mutation that resulted in replacement of Arg273 with glutamic acid and another that resulted in replacement of both Arg273 and Arg274 with glutamic acid. We introduced these missense mutations into the chromosomal <italic>MLH1</italic> and <italic>PMS1</italic> genes in a haploid yeast strain and monitored for a mutator phenotype indicative of loss of MMR <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mutator effects were examined at <italic>lys2</italic>::<italic>InsE</italic><sub><italic>A14</italic></sub> (primarily measures single base pair deletions in a run of 14 A-T base pairs), <italic>his7-2</italic> (primarily measures single base pair additions in a run of seven A-T base pairs) and <italic>CAN1</italic> (monitors a wide variety of mutations resulting in canavanine resistance).</p><p>The K328E replacement in Pms1 had no detectable effect on the mutation rate at <italic>CAN1</italic>, the locus that is least sensitive of the three for detecting changes in mutation rate due to loss of MMR (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg324tb1">1</xref>). However, the K328E replacement elevated the mutation rates at the <italic>lys2</italic>::<italic>InsE</italic><sub><italic>A14</italic></sub> and <italic>his7-2</italic> loci by 60- and 3.5-fold, respectively. Nonetheless, they are small in comparison to the 7500- and 63-fold increases at these loci, respectively, resulting from inability to repair replication errors due to deletion of the <italic>PMS1</italic> gene.</p><p>Substitution of glutamic acid for Arg274 in yeast Mlh1 yielded a significant mutator effect at all three loci (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg324tb1">1</xref>). In all cases, these mutator effects were greater than those resulting from the homologous K328E mutation in <italic>PMS1</italic>. In a simple patch test for mutagenesis, the R273E mutant has a phenotype similar to the R274E mutant (data not shown), so the R273E single mutant was not investigated in detail.

In contrast, compared to wild-type Mlh1(343), purified Mlh1(343) containing the R274E single change (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f2">2</xref>) or the R273E&#x0002f;R274E double change (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f2">2</xref>) had strongly reduced DNA binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f6">6</xref>). The extent of reduction in DNA binding conferred by the glutamic acid substitutions in Mlh1(343) correlated with the severity of the mutator phenotypes incurred by the respective mutant alleles <italic>in vivo</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg324tb1">1</xref>), i.e. the double mutant had a stronger mutator phenotype and lower affinity for DNA than did the R274E mutant.</p></sec><sec><title>Mlh1(343)-R273E&#x0002f;R274E proteolysis and interactions with ATP</title><p>Next, to examine the possibility that the substitutions in Mlh1(343)-R273E&#x0002f;R274E might indirectly reduce DNA binding by altering protein conformation, we compared the trypsin proteolysis patterns of the wild-type and double mutant Mlh1(343) proteins. These patterns were very similar (data not shown), indicating that the glutamic acid substitutions did not strongly perturb the conformation of Mlh1(343). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c16">16</xref>), wild-type Mlh1(343) is protected from trypsin proteolysis in the presence of ATP. The Mlh1(343)-R273E&#x0002f;R274E variant was protected by ATP in a similar manner &#x0005b;data not shown, but similar to results for wild-type Mlh1(343) in fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f4">4</xref>A of Hall <italic>et al</italic>.

Thus, the two amino acid changes did not diminish ATP binding by Mlh1(343). It was not possible to compare ATP hydrolysis activities, because measurement of the weak ATPase of Mlh1(343) requires using a ssDNA affinity column to obtain sufficiently pure protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c16">16</xref>). This purification step does not work with the double mutant because it does not bind to the DNA affinity column, again indicating reduced DNA binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of Mlh1-R273E&#x0002f;R274E mutation on DNA binding by full-length Mlh1 and the Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 heterodimer</title><p>Mlh1(343) containing the R273E&#x0002f;R274E mutation has dramatically reduced DNA binding capability compared to wild-type Mlh1(343) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f6">6</xref>A). To further explore the importance of these amino acids for DNA binding, we examined whether the DNA binding defect of the R273E&#x0002f;R274E variant could also be detected in the context of full-length Mlh1 and the Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 heterodimer. We expressed the full-length Mlh1 protein containing the R273E&#x0002f;R274E changes in yeast, either alone or with wild-type Pms1. The variant Mlh1 protein was soluble, allowing purification by affinity chromatography as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>). R273E&#x0002f;R274E Mlh1 co-purified with wild-type Pms1 in 1:1 stoichiometry, indicating that the double substitution in Mlh1 did not adversely affect its ability to dimerize with Pms1. The presence of the two glutamic acid substitutions in Mlh1 reduced DNA binding by both the heterodimer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f6">6</xref>B) and full-length Mlh1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f6">6</xref>C). A similar reduction was observed for both proteins, indicating that the presence of wild-type Pms1 in the heterodimer does not compensate for the lost Mlh1 DNA binding. The decreases in affinity were reproducible, but the effects were smaller than that seen with Mlh1(343) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f6">6</xref>A). The substantial retention of DNA binding by the full-length variant proteins suggests that additional amino acids in Pms1 and Mlh1 also contribute to DNA binding.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The results of this study demonstrate that NTDs of yeast Mlh1 and Pms1 each bind to duplex and ssDNA, independently of their normal partner and in the absence of detectable dimerization. Substitutions in <italic>MLH1</italic> that reduce DNA binding without apparent effect on ATP binding or protein conformation yield mutator phenotypes <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that DNA binding by Mlh1 is important for MMR.</p><p>It is not surprising that the strong mutator phenotype for <italic>mlh1-R273E,R274E</italic> is accompanied by more modest effects on DNA binding by the purified proteins. A similar situation has been observed for the ATPase activity of MutS and MutL homologs. Each subunit in the Msh2&#x02013;Msh6 and Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 heterodimers contains an ATPase domain. Mutation of a single ATPase domain essentially eliminates MMR function <italic>in vivo</italic>, yet the purified proteins retain substantial ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c28">28</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c2">2</xref>). The results presented here for DNA binding may be analogous, since Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 has two DNA binding sites, both of which are likely important for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>).</p><p>This study supports previous studies indicating that the Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 heterodimer is functionally asymmetric. For example, although Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396) are both ATPases, changing conserved residues in the ATP binding site of Mlh1 results in stronger mutator phenotypes than does changing the homologous residues in Pms1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c28">28</xref>). Biochemical data further suggest that binding of ATP to Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 may occur sequentially, with Mlh1 having higher intrinsic ATP binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c16">16</xref>). In a similar manner, the results presented here suggest that the Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 heterodimer may be asymmetric regarding DNA binding. For example, Arg274 in Mlh1 and Lys328 in Pms1 align as conserved basic amino acids in yeast Mlh1 and Pms1 (human PMS2) and they are in a (putative) &#x003b1;-helix whose homolog in <italic>E.coli</italic> MutL has been demonstrated to be important for DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c19">19</xref>). Nonetheless, the R274E substitution in Mlh1 results in a stronger mutator phenotype than does the corresponding K328E substitution in Pms1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg324tb1">1</xref>). This demonstrates that these conserved residues may contribute differently to DNA MMR <italic>in vivo</italic>. In parallel, the R274E substitution in Mlh1 reduces DNA binding while the K328E substitution in Pms1 does not, suggesting that the different phenotypes <italic>in vivo</italic> may result from a differential effect on Mlh1 versus Pms1 DNA binding. Further evidence for DNA binding asymmetry is provided by the observation that wild-type Pms1(396) binds ssDNA with greater affinity than does wild-type Mlh1(343) and by the differential effects of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and NaCl on DNA binding by Mlh1(343) and Pms1(396). The functional significance of the apparent DNA binding asymmetry observed here will be an important target of future studies that monitor the DNA binding affinity of new mutant forms of the intact Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 heterodimer. That additional residues are likely to be involved in DNA binding is indicated by the higher binding affinity of full-length Mlh1 as compared to Mlh1(343) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f3">3</xref>B) and by the greater effect of the R273E&#x0002f;R274E changes on binding by Mlh1(343) compared to the intact Mlh1 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg324f6">6</xref>). These data suggest that additional residues in the NTD and&#x0002f;or residues in the C-terminal region of Mlh1 also contribute to DNA binding, either directly as proposed for <italic>E.coli</italic> MutL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c19">19</xref>) or indirectly, e.g. by influencing protein conformation.</p><p>This study and an earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>) both imply that the intact yeast Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 heterodimer has two independent DNA binding sites that can bring two distant regions of duplex DNA together. We hypothesize that the DNA binding activity of MutL homologs is important for communication between the strand discrimination signal and proteins bound at the mismatch. A plausible model is that Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 binds simultaneously to duplex DNA near the mismatch and near the strand discrimination signal, either using the two independent binding sites on the heterodimer or by multiple heterodimers associated with each other (see below). This could permit use of the strand discrimination signal without the need for a MutS-containing protein complex to abandon the vicinity of the mismatch, as has been proposed for bacterial MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c29">29</xref>). The DNA deformation introduced upon MutS binding to a mismatch would be available for use in subsequent steps in the repair pathway, as has been proposed for sequential steps in base excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c31">31</xref>). Retention of MutS at the mismatch during subsequent steps in the repair pathway is an attractive model because the knowledge of the mismatch location is important for directing and terminating the excision reaction (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c33">33</xref>).</p><p>The idea that Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 may bind DNA at two distant locations can also be accommodated by models in which MutS homologs bind to the mismatch and then depart by ATP hydrolysis-dependent translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c34">34</xref>) or as a passively diffusing sliding clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c35">35</xref>). In either case, Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 binding to duplex DNA could be useful for marking the location of the mismatch, perhaps facilitating termination of strand excision once the mismatch is removed. The ability of bacterial MutL to bind to ssDNA has been suggested to facilitate initiation or progression of nascent strand excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c32">32</xref>). Thus, the ability of Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 to bind to either ssDNA or dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>) could be relevant to different steps in DNA MMR. Whether common, separate or overlapping binding sites exist for ssDNA and dsDNA remains to be established, as does the identity and location of additional amino acid residues that might be involved.</p><p>We believe that the protein&#x02013;protein interactions indicated by cooperative binding of Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 also play an important role during MMR and may facilitate communication between the two sites. This could occur through interactions between as few as two heterodimers or through formation of a protein tract between the two locations, similar to that observed by atomic force microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>). A contiguous long tract of Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 may seem unlikely for repair events involving a distant signal &#x0005b;e.g. a nick 1 kb away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c36">36</xref>)&#x0005d;. However, circumstantial evidence may support this possibility. In the <italic>E.coli</italic> reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> MMR system, relaxed and supercoiled circular heteroduplex DNA substrates are repaired more efficiently than linear substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c37">37</xref>). Similarly, yeast Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 binds with highest affinity to relaxed and supercoiled circular duplex DNA molecules and with reduced affinity to linear duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c21">21</xref>). Since the high affinity binding to circular DNA by Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 was seen as long cooperatively bound tracts of protein on the DNA, it is possible that this cooperative binding is directly involved in searching for and communicating with the strand discrimination signal after mismatch binding by MutS homologs. Cooperative binding may be relevant even if the strand discrimination signal is nearby, e.g. a nearby nick or primer terminus at a replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c38">38</xref>).</p><p>The above ideas involve engagement of the two DNA binding sites on Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 with distant locations on the same DNA molecule. Such &#x02018;intramolecular&#x02019; DNA binding may be relevant to other DNA transactions in which eukaryotic MutL homologs participate (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c1">1</xref>). Two independent DNA binding sites may also be used for &#x02018;intermolecular&#x02019; processes, hypothetically including coordinating MMR or stress responses to DNA damage on the leading and lagging strands during replication. The ability to bring two different duplex DNA molecules together may be particularly relevant for normal meiosis. Male mice deficient in PMS2 (homologous to yeast Pms1) are sterile and defective in chromosome synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c39">39</xref>) and male and female mice deficient in MLH1 are sterile, with meiosis arrested due to decreased crossing over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c41">41</xref>). Moreover, MLH1 immunolocalizes to sites of crossing over in wild-type spermatocytes. In yeast, Mlh1, but not Pms1, is also required for normal crossing over during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg324c42">42</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting to see if these processes are affected by mutations in <italic>MLH1</italic> or <italic>PMS1</italic> that reduce DNA binding affinity and&#x0002f;or the cooperativity of DNA binding. It will also be informative to determine if other eukaryotic MutL homologs (e.g. Mlh2 and Mlh3) have DNA binding sites in their N-termini.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg324f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> DNA binding by proteolytic fragments of Mlh1 and Pms1.

The lane designated FT (&#x02018;Flow Through&#x02019;) shows &#x0223c;0.5 &#x000b5;g of protein that flowed through the ssDNA column, while the lane designated B (&#x02018;Bound&#x02019;) shows &#x0223c;1.5 &#x000b5;g of Mlh1 fragments retained on the column and then eluted with 500 mM NaCl. Cleavage at a single major chymotrypsin cleavage site yields the two fragments labeled by arrows. Mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated that fragment 1 consists of amino acids 344&#x02013;769 and fragment 2 consists of amino acids 1&#x02013;343. (<bold>B</bold>) Purified Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1 was digested with chymotrypsin and trypsin and the reaction products were subjected to ssDNA affinity chromatography as described under Materials and Methods. The first lane, Mlh1-Pms1, shows 2 &#x000b5;g of purified Mlh1&#x02013;Pms1. All other lanes contain &#x0223c;1 &#x000b5;g of protein. FT, 5&#x00025; of the ssDNA column flow-through from the proteolysis reactions; B, 10&#x00025; of the peak fraction of proteolysis reaction products retained on the ssDNA affinity column and eluted with 500 mM NaCl. Numbered bands were excised from the gel, subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin and analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. The band labeled with &#x0002a; is fragment 2 from (A), representing amino acids 1&#x02013;343 of Mlh1. Fragment 1 from (A) is most likely band 14, although we did not confirm this. Other bands were also selected for analysis but did not yield interpretable mass spectrometry data. In general, we concentrated on the analysis of the smaller bands in lanes B because these were more informative for defining the DNA binding region. In (A) and (B) molecular weight standards were from Bio-Rad (broad range). (<bold>C</bold>) Peptide maps of the numbered bands in (B) were obtained by mass spectrometry. Labels on the Mlh1 and Pms1 bars represent amino acid number. Solid bars represent the range of peptides identified in the indicated fragments that were retained on the ssDNA affinity column. Likewise, open bars represent the range of peptides identified in the indicated fragments that flowed through the ssDNA affinity column. Several bands yielded peptides from both Mlh1 and Pms1 due to co-migration of proteolytic fragments. Note that open and closed horizontal bars do not represent absolute boundaries of the proteolytic fragments excised from the gel in (B). Rather, they indicate the range of peptides within the fragments, as identified by mass spectrometry. Also note that Mlh1 band 7 contains peptides within the NTD, yet this proteolytic fragment did not bind to the affinity column. We are not sure why this is the case; perhaps this fragment is folded in a manner that eliminates DNA binding.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkg324f1"/></fig><fig id="gkg324f2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p> Purified NTDs used in this study.
