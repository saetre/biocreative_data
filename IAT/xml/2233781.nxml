Introduction</title><p id="P3"><italic>Hesx1</italic> is a transcription factor that belongs to the paired class of homeobox genes. <italic>Hesx1</italic> is conserved in vertebrates, but it is absent from other animal groups, including amphioxus and ascidians. <italic>Hesx1</italic> is expressed in the rostral region of the developing vertebrate embryo, but expression has not been detected in any adult tissues or established cell lines, with the exception of mouse ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. In mouse, <italic>Hesx1</italic> expression is very dynamic and is regulated by specific enhancers located in the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; regions of the locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. <italic>Hesx1</italic> transcripts are first detected in the anterior endoderm of the early gastrula embryo, but the most prominent sites of expression are the anterior neural ectoderm, which later gives rise to the forebrain, and Rathke&#x02019;s pouch, the primordium of the anterior pituitary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>]. The expression pattern of <italic>Hesx1</italic> orthologues in other vertebrates is highly conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p><p id="P4">Previous research has shown that <italic>Hesx1</italic> is essential for normal forebrain and pituitary gland formation in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. <italic>Hesx1</italic>-deficient mouse embryos show variable degrees of forebrain defects, including abnormalities in dorsal midline structures, namely the septum pellucidum, corpus callosum, and anterior and hippocampal commissures. <italic>Hesx1</italic> homozygous mutants also show pituitary dysplasia, anophthalmia or microphthalmia and defects in the olfactory bulbs. A comparable phenotype is observed in the congenital human disorder septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), a syndrome characterised by variable combinations of pituitary abnormalities, midline forebrain defects and optic nerve hypoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>]. Indeed, it has been shown that mutations in human <italic>HESX1</italic> are associated with familial cases of SOD and other forms of hypopituitarism [combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) and isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>].</p><p id="P5">At the molecular level, there is evidence indicating that HESX1 can function as a transcriptional repressor in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. HESX1 contains two repressor domains, one located in the N-terminus (eh1 and HRPW motifs) and the other in the homeodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The N-terminal repressing domain binds TLE1, a mammalian orthologue of Groucho, whereas the homeodomain interacts with N-CoR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. TLE1 and N-CoR are proteins that mediate transcriptional repression through interactions with DNA binding transcription factors and histone deacetylases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, the repressing activity of HESX1 is required for the regulation of both neural differentiation and patterning of the anterior neuroectoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>]. Recently, we have shown that the mechanism underlying the forebrain defects in the <italic>Hesx1</italic>-deficient embryos involves the ectopic expression of genes with caudalising activities within the anterior forebrain of the very early mouse embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Normal pituitary organogenesis also requires the repressor functions of HESX1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Therefore, HESX1 is a critical transcriptional repressor that plays a broad role in the development of the forebrain and associated structures, such as the olfactory bulbs, eyes and pituitary gland.</p><p id="P6">It seems likely that HESX1 exerts its functions not only through the interaction with TLE1 and N-CoR, but further interacting proteins, which remain to be characterised. To search for novel HESX1-interacting proteins, we have performed a yeast two-hybrid screen on a 9.5-10.5 dpc (days post coitum) cDNA mouse library. We have identified DNMT1, a protein responsible for CpG methylation and repression of gene expression, as a HESX1 partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. We have mapped the regions of the proteins involved in the interaction and show that HESX1-DNMT1 complexes are present in cells and that both proteins co-localise in the nucleus. We demonstrate, by in situ hybridisation and RT-PCR, that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is actively transcribed in <italic>Hesx1</italic>-expressing cells in the forebrain and in Rathke&#x02019;s pouch of the developing mouse embryo. In transfected cells, the repressor activity of HESX1, which is mediated by the co-repressors TLE1 and N-CoR, cannot be enhanced by the addition of DNMT1 in a mammalian one-hybrid system. The link between HESX1 and DNMT1 suggests that HESX1 might repress transcription by an alternative mechanism, namely through CpG methylation of HESX1 target genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>2. Experimental procedures</title><sec id="S3"><title>2.1. Plasmid constructs</title><p id="P7">Two bait vectors were constructed by fusing either the full-length HESX1 (aa 1-185) protein or the N-terminal half (aa 1-107, excluding the homeodomain), in frame to the Gal4 DNA binding domain in the pGBDU-C vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. GST-HESX1 and GST-DNMT1 constructs were generated by cloning specific coding sequences into the pGEX-4T vector (Roche). Plasmids containing full-length cDNAs for the interactors were obtained from the IMAGE consortium (MRC Geneservice, Cambridge). These clones were 5706204 (<italic>Dnmt1</italic>), 4021046 (<italic>Rnf2</italic>); 6401542 (<italic>Lonp2</italic>); 5009612 (<italic>Srfbp1</italic>); 6413080 (<italic>Btb2</italic>); 6856060 (<italic>Zmiz1</italic>). An IMAGE clone (6826575) lacking 120 aa of the N-terminal part of <italic>Zfp592</italic> was also obtained. A full-length <italic>Safb1</italic> clone was kindly provided by Dr. Oesterreich (Baylor College of Medicine, USA). Coding regions were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCMV/SV40-Flag vector (Stratagene) and sequenced. For the mammalian one-hybrid system we used two reporter vectors: (i) p-Gal4BS-SV40 firefly luciferase reporter vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]; (ii) p-P3-SV40 firefly luciferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>]. When cells are transfected with these vectors, expression of luciferase is constitutively active, but it can be repressed by co-transfection of plasmids expressing either Gal4 DNA binding domain (DBD)-HESX1 fusion protein or just full-length HESX1, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. The p-Gal4DBD-Hesx1 construct was built by fusing the full-length coding region of the murine <italic>Hesx1</italic> cDNA to sequences expressing the Gal4DBD in the pM mammalian vector (Clontech). The efficiency of transfection was standardised using the pRL-SV40 renilla luciferase (Promega) as an internal control. Constructs expressing HA-HESX1, Flag-HESX1 and untagged HESX1 were built by cloning the murine <italic>Hesx1</italic> coding sequence into the HA-pCDNA3 (Invitrogen), pCMV/SV40-Flag vector (Invitrogen) and pCA&#x003b2;-Link [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>] vectors, respectively.

This expression analysis was also performed at 12.5 dpc by in situ hybridisation on paraffin sections to assess the degree of co-expression between <italic>Hesx1</italic> and the interactors in the developing Rathke&#x02019;s pouch. <italic>Hesx1</italic> shows a characteristic high-dorsal to low-ventral gradient of expression in Rathke&#x02019;s pouch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4M</xref>). <italic>Dnmt1</italic> and <italic>Safb1</italic> both showed the same dorso-ventral gradient in Rathke&#x02019;s pouch, indicating that they are co-expressed with <italic>Hesx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4N, O</xref>). <italic>Lonp2</italic> showed a weak and homogeneous pattern of expression in Rathke&#x02019;s pouch, and <italic>Srfbp1</italic> and <italic>Zfp592</italic> mRNA was not detected by slide in situ hybridisation (data not shown).</p><p id="P20">RT-PCR on RNA samples isolated from the heads (rostral to the mid-hindbrain boundary) of 8.5 dpc embryos and Rathke&#x02019;s pouch of 12.5 dpc wild-type embryos was carried out to complement the in situ hybridisation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4P</xref>). In heads, <italic>Dnmt1, Safb1</italic> and <italic>Zfp592</italic> appeared to be expressed at higher levels than <italic>Srfbp1</italic> and <italic>Lonp2</italic>, although we did not perform quantitative PCR. In Rathke&#x02019;s pouch, expression of <italic>Srfbp1</italic> and <italic>Zfp592</italic> was barely detectable, but <italic>Dnmt1, Safb1</italic> and <italic>Lonp2</italic> mRNA was amplified abundantly. Together, these expression analyses suggest that <italic>Hesx1</italic> is co-expressed with the identified interactors either within the anterior forebrain, Rathke&#x02019;s pouch or both.</p><p id="P21">Protein localisation was not investigated in mouse embryos because the available anti-HESX1 antibodies (either commercially or our own-produced anti-HESX1 sera) do not work in immunocytochemistry assays. However, immunofluorescence on transfected CHO cells using constructs expressing tag-HESX1 and tag interactors revealed nuclear localisation for HESX1 and all interactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>], except for LONP2, which localises to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Sajedi,E. and Martinez-Barbera, J.P., unpublished data).</p><p id="P22">We have previously demonstrated that HESX1 is a transcriptional repressor, able to recruit TLE1 and N-CoR to artificial promoters to repress transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. There is compelling evidence demonstrating the involvement of DNMT1 in CpG methylation and control of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>]. Therefore, the interaction of HESX1 with DNMT1 suggests that HESX1 might exert part of its repressing activity through the modification of the target gene expression patterns. We decided to characterise further the physical interaction between HESX1 and DNMT1.</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>3.3. Mapping of the HESX1- and DNMT1-interacting regions</title><p id="P23">The GST pull-down assay was used to define the interacting domains on each protein. The use of a series of GST-HESX1 deletion mutant proteins and <sup>35</sup>S-Met-labelled IVT (in vitro translated) full-length DNMT1 revealed the strongest binding with the full-length HESX1 protein (aa 1-185) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). Weak binding was observed with the N-terminal part of HESX1 (aa 1-107) and no binding was detected with any of the other HESX1 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). These data suggest that residues distributed throughout the whole tertiary structure of the HESX1 protein are likely to be required for a complete interaction. However, the N-terminal half of HESX1 confers enough binding properties to form a weak complex in vitro.</p><p id="P24">GST pull-down assays using <sup>35</sup>S-Met-labelled IVT full-length HESX1 with a series of GST-DNMT1 mutants encompassing distinct domains were used to map the regions of DNMT1 engaged in the interaction. Binding was consistently observed with peptides containing domains included in the first 748 aa of DNMT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>). Numerous functional domains have been mapped to this part of the protein, such as the PCNA binding domain (PBD), which directs association of DNMT1 to the replication foci, the targeting sequence (TS), required for association with peri-centromeric heterochromatin and the cystein-rich region (CxxC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. No binding was observed with a deletion protein containing just the bromo homology domain 1 (BAH1), but a weak interaction was supported when both BAH1 and BAH2 were present in the GST-DNMT1 mutant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, aa 686-812 and aa 746-1110, respectively). Residues located in the C-terminal catalytic domain were shown to contribute to the binding interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5E</xref>, aa 1124-1620). This is not unexpected, as it has been proposed that the DNMT1 activity depends on the presence of an intramolecular physical interaction between its N- and C-terminal domains, suggesting that residues from these two regions come in close association in the correctly folded DNMT1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>]. HESX1-DNMT1 interaction is mediated by the same regions responsible for the interaction between DNMT1 and the PcG protein EZH2, a histone methyltransferase associated with transcriptional repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. Overall, our data suggest that rather than a specific sequence motif, the tertiary structures of DNMT1 and HESX1 are essential for their interaction.</p><p id="P25">A GST pull-down assay was also performed on protein extracts obtained from untransfected ES cells, which express <italic>Hesx1</italic> at low levels. GST full-length HESX1 (aa 1-185) was able to bind endogenous DNMT1, as indicated by the detection of an immunoreactive band using a specific anti-DNMT1 antibody in Western blot analysis of GST-HESX1 (aa 1-185) bound proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5G</xref>). No binding was detected to GST, therefore demonstrating a direct interaction to HESX1 and confirming previous results using in vitro translated DNMT1.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>3.4. HESX1-DNMT1 interaction in mammalian cells</title><p id="P26">To confirm the interaction between HESX1 and DNMT1 further, co-immunoprecipitation of Flag-DNMT1 and HA-HESX1 tagged proteins was performed on transfected cell lines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with an anti-HA antibody revealed that HESX1 interacts with DNMT1 in 293T cells. Moreover, immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody followed by Western blot with an anti-HA antibody, also corroborated that HESX1 and DNMT1 form complexes in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>). Similar results were obtained in co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed on transfected CHO cells, although protein levels were much lower in this cell line (Sajedi, E. and Martinez-Barbera, J.P., unpublished data).</p><p id="P27">We also co-transfected 293T cells with plasmids expressing DNMT1 deletion mutants. These experiments confirmed, as previously described, that the N-terminal half and the C-terminal catalytic domain of DNMT1 are involved in the interaction with HESX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). No binding to HESX1 was detected with the DNMT1 fragment (aa 1-158) and weak interaction was observed with a longer peptide encompassing DNMT1 (aa 1-296), which includes the PCNA binding motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7B, C</xref>). The DNMT1 catalytic domain (aa 1124-1620) failed to interact with HESX1, but expression levels of this fragment were very low in transfected cells (Sajedi, E. and Martinez-Barbera, J.P., unpublished data).</p><p id="P28">However, DNMT1 deletion proteins containing the TS and the CxxC domains and the catalytic domain (aa 158-1620 and aa 296-1620) strongly interacted with HESX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7E, F</xref>). Overall, the co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that the three-dimensional structure of DNMT1 is required for the interaction.</p><p id="P29">Finally, we performed immunocytochemistry to determine the localisation of HESX1 and DNMT1 on co-transfected CHO cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>, both proteins are predominantly nuclear and were found to co-localise (yellow in merged panels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8C, F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>3.5. The repressor activity of HESX1 is not enhanced upon binding to DNMT1</title><p id="P30">We next examined whether the HESX1-DNMT1 interaction might have an effect on the repressor activity of HESX1. This possibility was investigated using a mammalian one-hybrid system we have previously established in transfected CHO and 293T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. In this system, transfection of a construct expressing the HESX1 protein as a fusion to the DNA binding domain (DBD) of Gal4 (Gal4DBD-HESX1) leads to the repression of a constitutively active luciferase reporter (p-Gal4BS-SV40 luciferase) in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A</xref>. When cells were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing DNMT1, the repressing activity of Gal4-HESX1 was not increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref>). Similar results to those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9B</xref> were obtained with a range of concentrations of reporter and effector vectors. We also performed luciferase assays using a reporter plasmid containing six copies of the consensus binding site for the paired-like family of homeodomain proteins, which includes HESX1 (p-P3-SV40 luciferase) and effector plasmids expressing the full-length HESX1 protein, rather than a fusion protein to Gal4DBD. In these conditions, addition of DNMT1 also failed to enhance the repressor activity of HESX1 on the P3 reporter vector in a wide range of concentrations (Sajedi, E. and Martinez-Barbera, J.P., unpublished data). Together, these results suggest that binding of DNMT1 to HESX1 cannot increase the repressor activity of HESX1 in transient luciferase assays in transfected cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S17"><title>4. Discussion</title><sec id="S18"><title>4.1. Identification of HESX1-interacting proteins</title><p id="P31"><italic>Hesx1</italic> is a developmental transcriptional repressor essential for normal forebrain and pituitary formation in mouse and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. A total of 13 <italic>HESX1</italic> mutations have been identified so far in association with SOD and/or hypopituitarism: eight of them are point mutations resulting in a single aa change (Q6H, I26T, E149K, R160C, S170L, T181A,Q117P, K176T) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]; one results from the deletion of a guanine in codon 175 (1684delG) causing a frameshift mutation and the generation of a novel C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]; a further mutation involves the insertion of an Alu element in the homeodomain leading to skipping of exon 3 (AluIII) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]; two more result from the insertion or deletion of two nucleotides (306/307insAG and 449/450delAC, respectively) causing a frameshift mutation and the premature termination of translation due to the introduction of a stop codon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]; and a final one is the consequence of a T to C transition at position +2 of exon 2, which mutates the invariant dinucleotide of the splice donor site of intron 2, yielding a HESX1 truncated protein lacking the homeodomain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The penetrance and severity of the phenotype are highly variable in patients carrying these <italic>HESX1</italic> mutations. At least in part, differences in severity of the phenotypes might be caused by specific perturbations in the protein-protein interactions between particular HESX1 mutated proteins and specific partners. Moreover, the possibility exists for a more direct contribution of HESX1-interacting proteins in human disease, i.e., mutations in HESX1 partners might also lead to congenital hypopituitarism and SOD. These experiments are currently being performed and will be published elsewhere.</p><p id="P32">To gain insights into the molecular function of HESX1 in normal development and disease, we have carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified five HESX1 interactors. At least three of these are associated with transcriptional repression, whilst the other two are of unknown function. DNMT1 has been shown to play essential roles in several processes including gene silencing. SAFB1 is a transcriptional repressor, which is also involved in chromatin remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. SRFBP1 interacts with SRF (serum response factor) to modulate SRF activating properties on a variety of promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>].</p><p id="P33">The expression analysis suggests that all five interactors are co-expressed with <italic>Hesx1</italic> within the anterior forebrain by in situ hybridisation and RT-PCR. Moreover, isolation of pure populations of <italic>Hesx1</italic>-expressing cells from the anterior forebrain and subsequent gene expression profiling has confirmed that all five interactors are co-expressed with <italic>Hesx1</italic> in <italic>Hesx1</italic>-expressing cells (Andoniadou, C.L. and Martinez-Barbera, J.P., unpublished data). <italic>Dnmt1, Safb1</italic> and <italic>Lonp2</italic> were highly expressed followed by <italic>Zfp592</italic> and <italic>Srfbp1</italic>, which were weakly expressed. This is consistent with the data obtained from the RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation analysis described here.</p><p id="P34">Remarkably, we have found that the expression pattern of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> and <italic>Safb1</italic> in the developing Rathke&#x02019;s pouch is very similar to that of <italic>Hesx1</italic>. <italic>Hesx1</italic> expression is high in the dorsal region of Rathke&#x02019;s pouch at 12.5 dpc, where progenitor cells are actively dividing, and low in the ventral part, where cell differentiation is taking place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. This suggests that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> and <italic>Safb1</italic> may be required for normal pituitary formation in mouse. In fact, <italic>Safb1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutant mice die perinatally and surviving individuals exhibit dwarfism due to low levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], a phenotype compatible with hypopituitarism, i.e., isolated growth hormone deficiency. <italic>Dnmt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice die early in gestation, but knock-down approaches have revealed that reduction of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> leads to microcephaly (small heads) and defects in terminal differentiation in some organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. The pituitary gland was not analysed in these studies.</p><p id="P35">Together, these findings suggest that HESX1 interacts with several proteins involved in gene repression to execute its function during the development of the forebrain and the pituitary gland.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>4.2. DNMT1-HESX1 interaction: is there a link between HESX1 and DNA methylation?</title><p id="P36">In this manuscript, we present evidence supporting the hypothesis that there is a direct interaction between HESX1 and DNMT1, which has been verified (1) in yeast, by a two-hybrid system; (2) in vitro, by GST pull-down assays; and (3) in mammalian cells, by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localisation experiments; (4) by expression analysis in the mouse embryo using RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation. Mapping of the interacting regions suggests that the tertiary structure of both proteins, rather than specific motifs or domains, is required for their interaction. Results obtained from a mammalian one-hybrid system suggest that recruitment of DNMT1 by HESX1 cannot enhance HESX1 activity as a transcriptional repressor. This is in contrast with previous results from our group and from others that have shown that co-transfection of TLE1 or N-CoR, another two known HESX1-interacting proteins, can increase the repressor activity of HESX1 in transfected cells using the same one-hybrid system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. A possibility to explain this discrepancy may be that the interaction of HESX1 with DNMT1 influences the activity of HESX1 in a way that cannot be detected in a one-hybrid system. Alternatively, the functional relevance of the interaction might not be to increase HESX1-repressor activity, but perhaps to silence HESX1 target genes within the <italic>Hesx1</italic>-expressing cells.</p><p id="P37">Analysis of the <italic>Hesx1</italic>-deficient embryos has shown that the loss of <italic>Hesx1</italic> leads to a posterior transformation of the anterior forebrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. Anterior forebrain structures, such as the eyes and the telencephalic vesicles (which will later form the cerebral hemispheres), are reduced in size, in favour of more posterior structures. At the molecular level, this change of cell fate can be visualised by the ectopic expression of posteriorising genes in the anterior neural ectoderm. The de-repression of posterior marker expression in the anterior forebrain brings about the posterior transformation. This phenotype is consistent with the idea that HESX1 functions as a repressor within the anterior forebrain. Indeed, there is biochemical evidence demonstrating a physical interaction between HESX1 and the co-repressors TLE1 and N-CoR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>]. Through these interactions, HESX1 associates in multimeric protein complexes with other co-repressors, such as mSIN3, HDAC1/2 and members of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex, to modify histones, alter chromatin structure and cause repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>].</p><p id="P38">Compelling evidence indicates that DNMT1 plays an essential role in the maintenance of transcriptionally repressed chromatin. Methylation of CpG sites is generally inversely correlated with transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>]. DNMT1 activity is controlled by its interaction with several proteins, including pRb, DMAP1, HDAC1/2, MeCP2, SUV39H1, HP1beta, p23, p53, EZH2 and the nucleolar chromatin remodelling complex Tip5/Snf2h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">50</xref>]. These interactions mediate transcriptional repression through independent mechanisms, such as histone deacetylation and methylation, disruption of transcriptional activation complexes and chromatin remodelling. Based on the physical interaction between HESX1 and DNMT1 shown in the present study, we postulate that HESX1 may induce permanent gene silencing by an additional mechanism of action, namely the specific methylation of CpG residues of HESX1 target genes.</p><p id="P39">One intriguing characteristic of <italic>Hesx1</italic>-deficient embryos is the variable expressivity of the severity of the forebrain and pituitary defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. This variability was initially thought to be the consequence of a mixed genetic background in the <italic>Hesx1</italic>-deficient embryos. However, <italic>Hesx1</italic> heterozygous mice have been backcrossed with C57BL6/J for more than 20 generations, ensuring a pure genetic background, but variable expressivity of the phenotype still persists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>]. This is not particular to mouse, as similar variability is observed in human patients carrying mutations in <italic>HESX1</italic>, and often between siblings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. The interaction with DNMT1 can explain the underlying cause of this variable expressivity in the phenotype, as epigenetic modifications have been proven to cause differences in gene expression in identical genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. DNMT1-deficient embryos and cells show a generalised genomic hypomethylation and a reduction in gene repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that lack of HESX1 in mutant embryos may cause demethylation of specific HESX1 target genes, as has been shown for other DNA binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. The uneven reduction of CpG methylation between mutant embryos of the same genetic background could lead to erratic de-repression and ectopic activation of caudalising genes within the forebrain, and therefore to a variable phenotype. The demonstration of this hypothesis is currently hampered by the lack of knowledge about direct HESX1 targets in vivo. The identification of genes directly regulated by HESX1 will allow us to characterise their methylation patterns in wild-type and <italic>Hesx1</italic>-deficient embryos in vivo, and to correlate these molecular data with the severity of the phenotype of <italic>Hesx1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants.</p><p id="P40">In summary, five HESX1-interacting proteins have been identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen, including DNMT1. The present investigation represents the first step towards the elucidation of the functional consequences of these interactions during development. Future studies will reveal whether the identified HESX1 partners may be involved in the aetiology and pathogenesis of human syndromes, such as SOD and hypopituitarism.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S20"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank A.

Strong interaction with HESX1 (aa 1-185) (arrowhead) is observed with DNMT1 fragments containing the first 748 aa (aa 1-343, aa 350-609, aa 613-7480 and aa 653-730) and the catalytic domain (aa 1124-1620). No binding was detected with a DNMT1 fragment containing the BAH1 domain (aa 686-812). A DNMT1 fragment including BAH1 and BAH2 domains (aa 746-1110) exhibited weak binding. (F) Representative Coomassie stain of the GST-DNMT1 fusion proteins used in panel B. As input, 1/10th of the total amount of <sup>35</sup>S-Met-labelled protein was used in panels B and E. (G) Approximately 1 mg of protein extracts obtained from untransfected ES cells was incubated with either an anti-DNMT1 antibody (IP: anti-DNMT1), GST or GST-HESX1 (aa 1-185), and bound proteins analysed by Western blot using an anti-DNMT1 antibody. Only GST-HESX1 (aa 1-185), but not GST, interacts with endogenous DNMT1.
