Centromere protein E (CENP-E) and cytoplasmic dynein are the two microtubule motors in metazoans known to localize at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pfarr et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yen et al., 1992</xref>). Each uses chemical energy released from ATP hydrolysis to direct movement toward plus ends or minus ends of microtubules, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schroer et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wood et al., 1997</xref>). Mitotic centromere-associated kinesin, a nonmotile kinesin, is also found at the inner centromere, and its microtubule-depolymerizing activity plays a role in error correction so as to generate proper kinetochore microtubule attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desai et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohi et al., 2003</xref>). Besides the energy-consuming motors, however, energy stored in the microtubule lattice from cleavage of GTP during microtubule assembly can generate sufficient force to power aspects of chromosome movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koshland et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coue et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inoue and Salmon, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grishchuk et al., 2005</xref>). By simply maintaining a linkage with spindle microtubules, kinetochores can exploit the energy liberated from the microtubule lattice during disassembly to drive chromosome movement independent of a power stroke generated by motors and additional chemical energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Howard and Hyman, 2003</xref>).</p><p>An important unsolved question is how the kinetochore holds onto both growing and shrinking microtubules. Using purified chromosomes attached to dynamic microtubules, either pan kinesin antibodies or those specific for CENP-E were shown to inhibit microtubule depolymerization-dependent motion of chromosomes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lombillo et al., 1995a</xref>). Moreover, beads coated with kinesin were able to follow the end of disassembling microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lombillo et al., 1995b</xref>), suggesting a role of kinesin family members in coupling kinetochores to dynamic microtubules. Discovery of the ring structure of the yeast Dam1/DASH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miranda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Westermann et al., 2005</xref>) has introduced such rings as plausible coupling devices for chromosome attachment and movement. In vitro, the ring complex can move processively on depolymerizing microtubule ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Westermann et al., 2006</xref>), and harness microtubule dynamics to produce force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asbury et al., 2006</xref>). However, the Dam1/DASH complex has not been found outside fungi. Conversely, motor enzymes such as dynein, CENP-E, and mitotic centromere-associated kinesin are missing from yeast kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McIntosh, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Initially found to be a kinesin family member that localizes to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yen et al., 1992</xref>), CENP-E is a mitosis-specific kinesin with a cyclin-like accumulation and degradation, reaching its peak during G2 and early M phase followed by rapid degradation during the completion of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 1994</xref>). As CENP-E is an essential kinetochore component whose loss leads to high rates of whole chromosome missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weaver et al., 2003</xref>), CENP-E is one of the components directly responsible for the stable capture of spindle microtubules by kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schaar et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wood et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Putkey et al., 2002</xref>). Inhibition or removal of CENP-E not only leads to a failure of metaphase chromosome alignment, resulting in unattached chromosomes that are abnormally close to a spindle pole, but it also reduces the number of microtubules bound by kinetochores even on chromosomes that are bioriented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McEwen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Putkey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weaver et al., 2003</xref>). Most recently, CENP-E has been proposed to facilitate chromosome congression by powering movement of a monooriented chromosome pair toward the spindle equator by attachment to and translocation along the kinetochore fiber of another chromosome pair that had already bioriented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kapoor et al., 2006</xref>). Although simple microtubule gliding assays with the CENP-E motor domain have shown it to be a plus end&#x02013;directed motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wood et al., 1997</xref>), the motor properties of CENP-E and the mechanism by which CENP-E contributes to kinetochore attachment to spindle microtubules are not known.</p><p>Using purified recombinant CENP-E, we now find that CENP-E is a very slow, highly processive motor that maintains microtubule attachment for long periods with a highly flexible 230-nm-long contour length. These properties combine not only to power chromosome congression but also to provide an essential motile kinetochore tether.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>CENP-E is a slow, processive motor that maintains microtubule attachment for long periods</title><p>To characterize the motor properties of CENP-E, we purified the motor plus neck domain of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> CENP-E (aa 1&#x02013;473) with GFP and a hexahistidine tag fused at the C terminus (CE473-GFP hereafter; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The presumed dimeric state of this CENP-E fragment was tested by measuring hydrodynamic parameters in solution. A sedimentation coefficient (6 S) and Stokes radius (5.2 nm) were obtained by sucrose gradient sedimentation and gel filtration chromatography, respectively (Fig. S1, A and B; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802189/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802189/DC1</ext-link>). This produced a calculated native molecular mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Siegel and Monty, 1966</xref>) for CE473-GFP of &#x0223c;130 kD, which is close to the predicted molecular mass of the dimer (160 kD), demonstrating that the preponderance of the CENP-E motor domain exists as a dimer in solution.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>CENP-E is a slow, processive motor that maintains microtubule attachment for long periods.</bold> (A) Purified CE473-GFP.

Freshly prepared protein was nonspecifically adhered on a coverslip surface, and the fluorescence intensity of CE473-GFP spots was measured and compared with that of K560-GFP, the well-characterized dimeric motor head of human kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Case et al., 1997</xref>). The fluorescence intensity distributions between CE473-GFP (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 432) and K560-GFP (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 347) were indistinguishable (Fig. S1 C), confirming that most imaged CENP-E spots were dimers. When the fluorescent CENP-E molecules were followed over time to examine their photobleaching behavior, most CE473-GFP and K560-GFP spots disappeared in either two steps or a single step (Fig. S1 D), as expected if each spot consisted of either two GFPs or a single GFP. Furthermore, the initial fluorescence intensity of moving spots was measured to confirm that the majority of moving CENP-E was indeed dimeric (Fig. S1 E). Therefore, both the hydrodynamic measurements in solution and the fluorescence analysis of single molecules viewed microscopically demonstrate that CE473-GFP is dimeric.</p><p>We then tested the processivity of CENP-E in vitro by directly observing single molecules of CE473-GFP moving along microtubules using TIRF microscopy. X-rhodamine&#x02013;labeled guanosine-5&#x02032;-([a,b]-methyleno) triphosphate (GMPCPP) microtubules were immobilized on a coverslip surface using an antitubulin antibody, and, subsequently, a low concentration (0.5&#x02013;1 nM) of CE473-GFP was introduced into the flow chamber (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). CENP-E single molecules moved processively and unidirectionally along microtubules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> and Videos 1 and 2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802189/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802189/DC1</ext-link>) with a median velocity of 8 nm/s (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 320; four independent preparations; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Substantial variation in speed (ranging from 1.7 to 48 nm/s) was observed for CENP-E. However, this was not the result of heterogeneity in motor activity among different protein preparations, as large variation in the velocity was consistently observed in the assays performed on the same day. Furthermore, the velocity of movement often differed by a factor of two even between the molecules running on the same microtubule (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, compare particle 1 with particle 2).</p><p>Processive movement of CENP-E motor single molecules was not smooth, and the CENP-E changed instantaneous velocity with multiple pauses within a single run (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Frequent changes in instantaneous velocity with large variations in the speed and even reversals in direction observed when frames were taken more rapidly in our single-molecule assays (Fig. S1, G and H; and Video 3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802189/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802189/DC1</ext-link>) suggested that CENP-E motility has a one-dimensional diffusion component. A mean square displacement (MSD) plot of CENP-E was well fitted with biased Brownian movement (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Polynomial regression to MSD (&#x003c1;) &#x0003d; <italic>&#x003c5;</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>t</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0002b; 2<italic>Dt</italic> (<italic>&#x003c5;</italic>, mean drift velocity; <italic>D</italic>, diffusion coefficient) produced a mean velocity of 9.7 &#x000b1; 0.6 nm/s (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 90) and a diffusion coefficient of 690 &#x000b1; 94 nm<sup>2</sup>/s (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 90), which was larger than expected from the fluctuation of a kinesin with an 8-nm step size and &#x0223c;10-nm/s speed (D &#x02248; 80 nm<sup>2</sup>/s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Svoboda et al., 1994</xref>). Similar mean velocities and diffusion coefficients for CENP-E were found in the experiments performed using more frequent frame rates and quantum dot-labeled CENP-E motor domain (Fig. S1 I).</p><p>The presence of a diffusional component in motility has been reported for other microtubule-dependent motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vale et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okada and Hirokawa, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwok et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furuta and Toyoshima, 2008</xref>) and suggests that CENP-E contains an additional electrostatic binding mode within the head-neck domain in addition to its force-generating strong microtubule-binding state. This weak binding of CENP-E to a microtubule might prevent the dissociation of CENP-E even when both motors are unbound, thus facilitating efficient reattachment. Consistent with this, CENP-E was able to maintain microtubule attachment for long periods, producing remarkably processive movement despite its slow velocity. The run time, which is defined as the time interval between the start and end of each processive run, was distributed exponentially, and the mean run time was determined by fitting the data into a cumulative distribution function. The mean duration of CENP-E processive runs was 195 &#x000b1; 13 s (3.3 min; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>), a value 50 times longer than the reported association time of K560-GFP single molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedman and Vale, 1999</xref>). The longest run we observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, kymograph 2) lasted &#x0003e;20 min. The slow velocity and longer association time of the CENP-E motor domain resulted in a mean run length of 1.5 &#x000b1; 0.1 &#x003bc;m (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>), which is comparable with the processivity of conventional kinesin. Therefore, unlike fast-moving organelle transport kinesins, CENP-E is a slow motor, but its high processivity maintains interaction with a microtubule for long periods.</p></sec><sec><title>CENP-E is a highly flexible dimeric kinesin with a 230-nm discontinuous coiled coil</title><p>To assess the structural features of full-length CENP-E, we purified untagged 340-kD recombinant CENP-E close to homogeneity from insect cells infected with baculovirus-expressing full-length <italic>Xenopus</italic> CENP-E cDNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Immediately after purification, CENP-E was adsorbed to mica, and individual molecules were visualized by electron microscopy using the quick-freeze deep-etch technique and platinum replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heuser, 1989</xref>). Consistent with its predicted long &#x003b1;-helical coiled-coil domain, CENP-E was seen to be highly elongated. The two kinesin motor heads, as indicated by arrows, were found separated by a long coiled coil followed by globular tails (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>), directly demonstrating that CENP-E is a homodimer.

Conventional kinesins mainly exist as either extended or folded conformations with a hinge located in the middle of the coiled coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirokawa et al., 1989</xref>). In contrast, CENP-E molecules were never uniformly straight but rather displayed a myriad of diverse conformations, none of which could be categorized by frequency as preferred conformations. Throughout the long coiled-coil domain, CENP-E seemed to contain multiple hinges and local distortions that accommodated sharp bends. Analysis of the CENP-E sequence showed that its predicted coiled-coil structure is disrupted &#x0003e;20 times, almost always by segments containing proline or glycine residues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Although it is unknown whether all of the predicted coiled-coil disruptors actually loop out from the coiled-coil axis, the discontinuities in the coiled coil are the mostly likely source of the high flexibility of CENP-E.</p><p>Measurement of hydrodynamic properties of full-length CENP-E in solution confirmed a highly elongated, flexible coiled-coil domain. A native molecular mass of 590 kD for recombinant <italic>Xenopus</italic> CENP-E was calculated from the measured values determined by sucrose gradient sedimentation and gel filtration of sedimentation coefficient (8.6 S) and Stokes radius (16 nm), respectively (Fig. S2, A and B; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802189/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802189/DC1</ext-link>). This value was close to the predicted molecular mass of a CENP-E homodimer (680 kD), which is consistent with our evidence from electron microscopy that CENP-E is dimeric. Calculating the frictional ratio (f/f<sub>o</sub>) using the mass of the dimer (680 kD) and the measured Stokes radius produced a value of 2.8 (Fig. S2 C). If CENP-E were a rigid prolate ellipsoid with an axial ratio of &#x0223c;100 (230-nm contour length/2-nm coiled-coil diameter), the f/f<sub>o</sub> would be &#x0003e;4. With the f/f<sub>o</sub> of 2.8, assuming no hydration and a prolate ellipsoid shape, the maximum possible axial ratio (a/b) of the CENP-E dimer was calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harding and C&#x000f6;lfen, 1995</xref>) to be 45 with an estimated length of 148 nm, which is obviously much shorter than CENP-E's actual contour length as determined by electron microscopy. Therefore, CENP-E in solution is substantially elongated on average but is not rigidly extended, which is consistent with the high flexibility observed by electron microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Full-length CENP-E is a slow plus end&#x02013;directed kinetochore motor</title><p>The characteristics of full-length CENP-E as a motor were determined using polarity-marked fluorescent microtubules and GFP-tagged full-length CENP-E (366 kD) tethered to a coverslip (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). The directionality of CENP-E has been controversial over the years. Partial purification of native CENP-E was initially reported to contain minus end&#x02013;directed motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thrower et al., 1995</xref>), whereas later the recombinant motor domain was shown to be a plus end&#x02013;directed motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wood et al., 1997</xref>). It was also reported that native CENP-E purified from mitotic HeLa cells did not support any motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeLuca et al., 2001</xref>). In this study, we unambiguously show that full-length recombinant CENP-E powered motility toward plus ends of microtubules, with microtubule gliding seen solely with the bright minus end leading. The mean velocity of gliding was 30 &#x000b1; 7.6 nm/s (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 112; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>; Video 4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802189/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802189/DC1</ext-link>). Although the speed difference between the motor domain and the full-length CENP-E could reflect autoinhibition of the C-terminal tail binding to the motor domain as recently proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Espeut et al.

To make a motor-dead CENP-E, we introduced a single point mutation in the ATP-binding P loop (T91N mutation) in the highly conserved kinesin motor domain of CENP-E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakata and Hirokawa, 1995</xref>). This mutation provided a rigor binding to microtubules that could not be dissociated even in the presence of ATP, and the motor domain of CENP-E<sup>T91N</sup> failed to support microtubule gliding even in the presence of saturating ATP concentrations (unpublished data). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wood et al., 1997</xref>), chromosomes failed to align properly in the majority of bipolar spindles in CENP-E&#x02013;depleted extracts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). When wild-type CENP-E was added back into CENP-E&#x02013;depleted extracts before spindle assembly, chromosome alignment defects were rescued in part with the CENP-E localized to kinetochores (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and D</xref>; and Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802189/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200802189/DC1</ext-link>).

This conclusion is tempered by the realization that in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extract spindles, chromosomes are prepositioned at the center (precongressed) during spindle assembly, and the process of chromosome alignment may differ from the typical prometaphase congression in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sawin and Mitchison, 1991</xref>). Nevertheless, it is clear that the plus end&#x02013;directed motility of CENP-E, at a minimum, is required for maintenance of chromosome alignment even in a system with fewer required chromosome movements for establishing an initial alignment. We believe that the strong misalignment phenotype from CENP-E depletion in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), in which fast microtubule poleward flux dominates the forces acting on kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maddox et al., 2003a</xref>), further supports CENP-E as an essential component for powering plus end&#x02013;directed chromosome movement to counteract flux.</p></sec><sec><title>CENP-E as a motile, flexible kinetochore tether</title><p>Use of electron tomography has shown that the vertebrate kinetochore is composed of a fibrous protein network with multiple microtubule interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2007</xref>). CENP-E is certainly part of the fibrous network for kinetochore attachment (as demonstrated with immunogold electron microscopy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yao et al., 1997</xref>), with its 230-nm length likely to be one of the longest fibers extending out from the kinetochore to capture microtubules. From our evidence, it is now clear that the long coiled coil of CENP-E could work advantageously for the initial capture of kinetochores to spindle microtubules by searching a large radial volume in cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>). After initial capture, the combination of slow processive movement along with one-dimensional diffusion would yield the translocation of CENP-E to the plus ends of microtubules, potentially damping dynamics there (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). An important novel aspect is that the high flexibility would allow versatile configurations of CENP-E binding to microtubules, permitting kinetochore attachment to microtubules approaching from a wide range of angles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, D and F</xref>). This would be in contrast to the highly conserved Ndc80 complex, which has been implicated as a key nonmotor microtubule-binding component of kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciferri et al., 2007</xref>) and whose &#x0223c;55-nm stiff rod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wei et al., 2005</xref>) apparently binds with a consistent polarity at a fixed angle relative to the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>A model for CENP-E as a motile, flexible tether for kinetochore microtubule capture and maintenance of linkage to dynamic spindle microtubules.</bold> (A) Using its slow processive motor activity and a weak diffusive binding mode to microtubules, CENP-E walks toward the plus ends of kinetochore microtubules or diffuses along the lattice without dissociating for extended periods. (B) The 230-nm-long coiled coil of CENP-E functions as a safety catch for disassembling microtubules detached from the core kinetochore attachment components, thereby stabilizing the microtubule and enabling rescue. (C) CENP-E is likely to be a part of the kinetochore slip clutch that is engaged on fluxing kinetochore microtubules with its slow plus end&#x02013;directed motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maddox et al., 2003a</xref>). CENP-E bound to the microtubule surface may affect kinetochore microtubule plus ends, thereby promoting growth and allowing recapture. (D) Unlike other shorter and more rigidly structured kinetochore capture components, multiple CENP-E molecules are likely to work together by allowing the simultaneous attachment at many different microtubule orientations relative to the kinetochore axis without forcing each other into unproductive conformations. (E) The highly flexible extended coiled coil of CENP-E mediates the initial capture of microtubules by searching a large volume in cells. (F) Its slow, processive motility powers monooriented chromosomes to congress using an adjacent kinetochore fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kapoor et al., 2006</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1810411f05"></graphic></fig><p>Finally, the 230-nm-long coiled coil of CENP-E is long enough to cover the entire kinetochore region and could even reach over to kinetochore fibers of other chromosomes passing close by (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). Our evidence supports that CENP-E, as a highly processive kinesin, is capable of driving the congression of a monooriented chromosome to the center along the neighboring kinetochore fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kapoor et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, the speed of microtubule gliding driven by multiple CENP-E molecules immobilized on a coverslip is similar to what has been observed for the velocities of kinetochore motility during chromosome congression in cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Skibbens et al., 1993</xref>). Furthermore, the high flexibility of CENP-E would allow multiple molecules to work together along the kinetochore fibers without forcing each other into unproductive conformations.</p><p>The CENP-E family kinesin (kinesin-7) has a longer family-specific neck domain than conventional kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Endow, 1999</xref>). We hypothesize that the longer neck and highly flexible, discontinuous coiled-coil domain of CENP-E are specialized for three roles during mitosis: efficient microtubule capture by kinetochores, towing monooriented chromosomes through viscous cytoplasm (especially those initially far from the spindle equator), and, perhaps most importantly, as a motile kinetochore tether maintaining linkage to dynamic kinetochore microtubule plus ends. The last of these properties couples the slow, processive motility with one-dimensional diffusion that together offer a molecular explanation for how relatively few CENP-E molecules (&#x0223c;50 dimers per human kinetochore; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 1994</xref>) can sustain kinetochore attachment to individual dynamic (growing and shrinking) microtubules without losing connection. Combined with the highly flexible 230-nm-long coiled coil, slow plus end&#x02013;directed motility, and ability of single molecules to remain microtubule bound for minutes, we propose that CENP-E is a part of the kinetochore slip clutch that is engaged on fluxing kinetochore microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maddox et al., 2003a</xref>). In effect, CENP-E combines a slow but processive motor, flexibility, reach, and stable microtubule binding to produce a motile molecular Velcro at kinetochores (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cloning, expression, and purification of CENP-E</title><p>cDNA encoding <italic>Xenopus</italic> CENP-E residues 1&#x02013;473 fused at the C terminus to a GFP-6His tag was cloned into pET23d (Novagen), and protein expression was induced at 13&#x000b0;C for &#x0223c;12 h with 10 nM IPTG in Rosetta (DE3).
