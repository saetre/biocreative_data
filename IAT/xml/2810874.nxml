PEDF accumulates in the aqueous humor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. It acts as a survival factor, protecting neuronal cells from natural and induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Lens function deteriorates with age. Oxidative stress, ultraviolet radiation, and other toxic factors can induce the formation of cataract in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. The formation of senile cataract is a universal aging process accompanied by numerous morphological and functional changes in the lens cells. Apoptosis of lens epithelial cells appears to be a common cellular basis for noncongenital cataract (including senile) development in humans and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. PEDF is expressed intracellularly in almost all human ocular tissues and extracellularly during both fetal and early adult periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>Our previous study found that the <italic>PEDF</italic> gene can be expressed in aqueous humor and lens epithelial cells, and that the expression level decreased significantly with increasing age. Those results suggested <italic>PEDF</italic> may regulate or protect the lens epithelial cells by paracrine or autocine processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, one study of the molecular characteristics of lens epithelial cells from patients with senile cataract by cDNA microarray technique found that <italic>PEDF</italic> was strongly downregulated (by 5.9-fold) in senile cataract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. The <italic>PEDF</italic> gene is known to have an important role in the physiology and morphology of the transparent lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. As we know, the opacification of eye lens is often caused by protein misfolding and aggregation. There may, therefore, be some relationship between <italic>PEDF</italic> and some lens proteins, such as &#x003b1;B-crystallin and vimentin. However, there is little available information on this, so we designed our experiment to determine whether downregulation of <italic>PEDF</italic> expression is associated with alterations in the expression of the critical lens proteins vimentin and &#x003b1;B-crystallin.</p><p>The reason we chose &#x003b1;B-crystallin and vimentin to study is that these are important proteins for lens. &#x003b1;B-crystallin, a member of the small heat shock protein family is among the predominant proteins of the vertebrate eye lens and is constitutively expressed at low levels in the lens epithelium and in numerous tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Many factors are known to play a role in the formation of aggregated and cross-linked crystallin species during cataract development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>].</p><p>&#x003b1;B-crystallin is a major lens protein expressed in numerous nonlens tissues of vertebrates, consistent with its putative no-refractive cellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Patients who carry a missense mutation in aB-crystallin (R120G) develop desmin-related myopathy and cataracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. It is likely that maintaining genomic integrity is important in the lens since the anterior lens epithelial cells are held in the G<sub>0</sub> phase of the cell cycle throughout life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. One study suggested that aB-crystallin may be an important component of the cellular machinery involved in maintaining genomic stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. The reduced thermal stability and the dominant negative effects of the mutant &#x003b1;B-crystallin may be the direct cause of cataract because &#x003b1;B-crystallin null mice have clear lenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>].</p><p>Vimentin, a critical cytoskeletal element in the human lens cell, is a main structural determinant in these cells, forming a membrane-connected cytoskeleton. Vimentin shows a unique pattern of expression relative to all known intermediate filament (IF) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>]. Vimentin is mainly expressed in the epithelium of the lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. A previous study revealed that high expression of vimentin interfered strongly with the normal differentiation of the lens fibers. Normal fiber cell denucleation and elongation processes were impaired and the animals developed pronounced cataracts followed by extensive lens degeneration. The age of appearance and extent of these abnormalities in the different transgenic lines were directly related to the vimentin level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Overexpression of this protein has strongly disturbed the normal morphogenesis of the lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Decrease of vimentin may be initiated by damage to the epithelial cells, leading to degradation of the cytoskeleton, and appears to be related to the formation of age-related cataract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>].</p><p>Through this experiment, we found a significant overexpression of &#x003b1;B-crystallin and downexpression of vimentin in human primary lens epithelial cells through RNAinterference (RNAi) RNAi to PEDF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Source of eye tissue</title><p>Human eyes were obtained from cadavers (12 female, 15 male, aged from 20-35 years) through the ZhongShan Ophthalmic center eye Bank, Guangzhou, China.

There are no significant differences between the levels of Vimentin detected in the control group and the shRNA-scramble group (p&#x0003e;0.05, shRNA-scr with random RNA sequence). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were applied to each treatment (n=3), and the standard error of the mean (SEM) was used in the graph (B).

Most studies on this gene in eye tissue have focused on the retinal and ciliary body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Information is known on its neuroprotective and anti-angiogenic actions in the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>], and there is some association between <italic>PEDF</italic> and age-related eye diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. There have also been studies of this gene on the lens, but most research has focused on location and expression level. The novelty of our experiment is that we associate <italic>PEDF</italic> with lens proteins. Since all these proteins are affected by the age-related factors, there may be some associations between them and <italic>PEDF</italic>. Through the downregulation of <italic>PEDF</italic> with the RNAi technique, we obtained two major findings: (1) the protein level of &#x003b1;B-crystallin is significantly higher than the control group; and (2) the protein level of vimentin is significantly lower than the control group. We do find the associations among <italic>PEDF</italic> down regulation and the expression of &#x003b1;B-crystallin and vimentin even through it&#x02019;s hard to tell if the down-regulation of <italic>PEDF</italic> is the direct or the unique factor for the changes of lens protein &#x003b1;B-crystallin and vimentin.</p><p>First, in this experiment, primary human lens epithelial cells were used. Their physiological characteristics are much more similar as in vivo than human lens epithelial cell line. Since the primary cells are very hard to be transfected, we performed the PEDF RNAi with the help of lentivirus infection. To improve the success rate, we designed three different primers. According to the Real time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) results, all of the experiment groups have high RNAi efficiency.</p><p>Second, in this experiment we realized the downregulation of <italic>PEDF</italic> artificially. We removed the other contributing factors, such as age-related factors and homeostasis factors, so that we could focus on the association between <italic>PEDF</italic> and the lens proteins. We also set up the shRNA-scramble control group, which helped us prove that the changes to the lens protein were not caused by infection reagents or some other experimental factors other than the downregulation of <italic>PEDF</italic>.</p><p><italic>PEDF</italic> was strongly downregulated (by 5.9-fold) in senile cataract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>], and we found that downregulation of <italic>PEDF</italic> can cause the higher expression of &#x003b1;B-crystallin. Therefore, we suggest that the expression of &#x003b1;B-crystallin is higher in senile cataract, which is consistent with two previously reported findings: 1) the reduced thermal stability and the dominant negative effects of mutant &#x003b1;B-crystallin may be the direct cause of cataract because &#x003b1;B-crystallin null mice have clear lenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]; and 2) the decrease of vimentin may be initiated by damage to the epithelial cells, leading to degradation of the cytoskeleton, and appears to be related to the formation of age-related cataract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>].</p><p>Oxidative damage to lens proteins is a major factor leading to cataract formation. Idiopathic senile, diabetic, and myopic cataractogenesis appear to be dependent on oxidative damage to lens proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. Another study indicated that the amount of inhibitory <italic>PEDF</italic> produced by retinal cells was positively correlated with oxygen concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. We therefore suggest that the change in vimentin and &#x003b1;B-crystallin may be caused by downregulation of <italic>PEDF</italic>, which is connected to oxidative cellular stress.</p><p>&#x003b1;-Crystallins, especially &#x003b1;B-crystallin, are expressed in several other tissues under stress conditions. &#x003b1;-Crystallin appears to function as a molecular chaperone in prevention of stress-induced precipitation of &#x003b2;- and &#x003bb;-crystallins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. &#x003b1;B-crystallin is a small heat shock protein so it can be constitutively expressed and increased in response to cellular stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>], while cellular stresses can also reduce expression of nonessential genes. We therefore hypothesize that the upregulation of &#x003b1;B-crystallin and the downregulation of vimentin caused by downregulation of <italic>PEDF</italic> were due to a cellular stress response. If this is the case, we can also investigate whether the other stress response proteins can be increased upon <italic>PEDF</italic> downregulation.</p><p>Because crystallins, proteins related to the small heat shock protein family, have been shown to bind to vimentin and inhibit filament assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>], it is still unknown whether the expression change of the &#x003b1;B-crystallin was induced by <italic>PEDF</italic> downregulation or induced by the change in vimentin expression. Therefore, our future work will focus on the fundamental mechanism causing the change of the lens proteins caused by the downregulation of <italic>PEDF</italic>.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrated a significant overexpression of &#x003b1;B-crystallin and downexpression of vimentin in human primary lens epithelial cells through RNAi to <italic>PEDF</italic>. Since vimentin and aB-crystallin are two important proteins of human lens and are changed in the process of cataract formation, there may be some relationship between the downregulation of <italic>PEDF</italic> and cataract.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Supported by CNSF grant (30772391).
