This represents a crucial mechanism in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Respiratory pathogens are a major cause of exacerbations leading to recurrent cycles of injury and repair. The interaction between pathogen-associated molecular patterns and the host is mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRR's). In the present study we characterized the expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)- 2, TLR4 and CD14 on human AM compared to autologous monocytes obtained from patients with COPD, healthy smokers and non-smokers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study population consisted of 14 COPD patients without evidence for acute exacerbation, 10 healthy smokers and 17 healthy non-smokers stratified according to age. The expression of TLR2, TLR4 and CD14 surface molecules on human AM compared to autologous monocytes was assessed <italic>ex vivo </italic>using FACS analysis. <italic>In situ </italic>hybridization was performed on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells by application of the new developed HOPE-fixative.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The expression of TLR2, TLR4 and CD14 on AM from COPD patients, smokers and non-smokers was reduced as compared to autologous monocytes. Comparing AM we detected a reduced expression of TLR2 in COPD patients and smokers. In addition TLR2 mRNA and protein expression was increased after LPS stimulation on non-smokers AM in contrast to smokers and COPD patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggest a smoke related change in the phenotype of AM's and the cellular response to microbial stimulation which may be associated with impairment of host defenses in the lower respiratory tract.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Backround</title><p>COPD patients appear to have underlying pathologic abnormalities which facilitate bacterial colonisation and result in an increased rate of respiratory infections. Bacteria are detected in 40&#x02013;60 % of exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and the significance of exacerbations for clinical course and decline of lung function is increasingly acknowledged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The mechanisms of the increased susceptibility to bacterial infections are poorly understood. In addition to the impaired mucociliary clearance, deficient functions of the innate immune system seem to be of importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Incomplete elimination of bacterial pathogens contributes to continuing activation of immune effector mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], possibly resulting in damage of the mucosa and parenchyma.</p><p>Tobacco smoking is known to induce inflammatory processes. Recent data demonstrated high concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in cigarette tobacco as well as biologically active LPS in the particulate phase of cigarette smoke, suggesting a clinical relevance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>. AM play an orchestrating role in the pulmonary immune response. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRR) which are expressed on the macrophage's surface mediate the interaction between conserved patterns on microorganisms, pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP's), and host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. TLR- 4 together with CD14 and the MD2 adapter molecule serves as receptor for components from Gram-negative bacteria such as LPS. TLR2 predominantly recognizes components from Gram-positive bacteria such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PGN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>A disturbed regulation of PRR on monocytes and AM may affect the recognition of bacterial pathogens and the intracellular signaling as well as resulting effector mechanisms. A change in the PRR expression on AM from COPD patients may therefore be involved in the process of continuing inflammation and bacterial colonization. In our study we asked whether chronic cigarette smoke exposure alters the expression of PRR's in human monocytes/AM <italic>ex vivo</italic>. The surface expression of TLR 2, TLR 4 and CD14 was phenotypically characterized on circulating monocytes and AM obtained by BAL in COPD patients, healthy smokers and non-smokers. In addition, the response to LPS stimulation was evaluated at mRNA and protein level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study population consisted of three groups: 14 COPD patients (11 male, 3 female, FEV1 % predicted: mean 58, range 35&#x02013;78), 10 healthy smokers (5 male, 5 female, FEV1 % predicted: mean 103, range 92&#x02013;120), 10 young (6 male, 4 female, FEV1 % predicted: mean 108, range 98&#x02013;118) and 7 elderly healthy non-smokers (6 male 1 female, FEV1 % predicted: mean 120, range 113&#x02013;142).

We observed a significantly decreased expression of PRR's on AM compared to monocytes. The main finding was that AM from COPD patients and smokers show an equally decreased surface expression of TLR2 compared to non-smokers of two age groups. In addition, an upregulation of TLR2 after LPS stimulation was only observed on non-smokers AM.</p><p>An increased TLR2 surface expression on human monocytes in response to LPS-stimulation has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], whereas on the transcriptional level divergent data have been reported showing either upregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], or downregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] of TLR2-mRNA depending on timing and dose of stimulation. In addition, differential regulation of TLR2 by IL-1, IL-10 and GM-CSF (upregulation) and IFN-gamma, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-4 (downregulation) has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, the net result of stimulation <italic>in vivo </italic>will depend on the local balance of inflammatory mediators. What are the possible consequences of LPS-stimulated TLR2 expression? Whole gram-negative bacteria are recognized not only through TLR4 (by LPS) but also TLR 2 (by bacterial lipopeptides). In this setting upregulation of TLR2 which occurs mainly with high LPS doses, may provide an additional mechanism to sensitize cells against large microbial challenges. Moreover, TLR2 is the main PRR recognizing gram-positive bacteria, and recent studies have shown that TLR2 -deficient animals are at high risk for succumbing to invasive pneumococcal infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Thus, the blunted TLR2 expression of AM from smokers and COPD patients after LPS stimulation may impair antimicrobial defenses in the lower respiratory tract. Recently a reduced TLR expression in aging mice was demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However this factor seems to be without influence on our results since comparable levels of PRR expression on monocytes and AM from healthy young and elderly non-smokers were observed.</p><p>The mechanisms of the smoking induced alteration of pulmonary immune functions are poorly understood. On the one hand smoking is known to induce inflammatory processes by activating AM and epithelial cells leading to production of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-8 and LTB4 and subsequent neutrophil recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Accordingly, in BALF and sputum of patients with COPD neutrophil activation and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. On the other hand a depressed capacity for LPS-induced cytokine release of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 from AM of smokers was described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Skold and colleagues found a higher expression of CD11a, CD54 and CD71 in non-smoker's AM compared with smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. CD11a (LFA-1) and its ligand play an important role in the interaction between antigen presenting cells and T-lymphocytes. In addition the metabolic response after <italic>in vitro </italic>stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was higher in non-smokers than in smokers AM. Dandrea <italic>et al</italic>. observed a reduced inflammatory cytokine release in cultured AM from smokers in response to LPS by simultaneous exposure to NO2 compared to non-smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Cultured human bronchial epithelial cells from COPD patients release lower levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-8 than similar preparations from non-smokers or smokers without COPD, suggesting that downregulation of inflammatory mediator release may also occur in bronchial epithelial cells of individuals with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Our data demonstrating an altered AM phenotype with reduced expression of TLR2 in smokers and COPD patients suggest that a continuous exposure to microbial products in this disease provided by bacterial colonization and LPS present in tobacco smoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] may downmodulate the pulmonary immune response. Whether this is due to the selection of a heterogenous macrophage subpopulation in the pulmonary compartment or to a general AM phenotype change under the environmental conditions described cannot be firmly differentiated from our data. However, with regard to the continous distribution of TLR expression intensities found by flow cytometry the latter possibility seems more likely. <italic>In vitro </italic>it was shown that the TLR response is downregulated after repetitive stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Interestingly a hyporesponsiveness of cells to the TLR-4 ligand LPS was shown as well after preincubation with ligands for TLR2 and vice versa, which indicates the existence of common signaling pathways of the TLR system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that this phenomenon also plays a role under conditions of chronic stimulation with bacterial components <italic>in vivo </italic>as suggested by the missing effect of LPS-stimulation on TLR2 expression on cells from smokers and COPD patients. This finding was confirmed using <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization targeting TLR2, which was recently demonstrated by our group on AM and alveolar epithelial cells type II in the human lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Although there was only a small overlap between non-smokers on the one hand and smokers and COPD patients on the other we observed a large variability in the extent of response to LPS stimulation in the non-smoking group which is a well-known phenomenon with regard to the release of biologic mediators as proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In contrast, no difference in TLR4 expression between smokers, non-smokers, COPD patients was observed in our study which may be due to the generally weaker expression of this molecule on monocytes and AM.</p><p>Functionally relevant polymorphisms of TLR's have been found in persons with endotoxin hyporesponsiveness (TLR-4) and staphylococcal sepsis (TLR-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Data regarding their relevance in COPD are not available. The generally lower expression of PRR's on AM's compared to monocytes is comparable to data reported for dendritic cells and may accompany the differentiation process of monocytes to macrophage populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Regarding the effect of chronic smoke exposure on blood cells we did not find any difference in the PRR expression on monocytes between smokers and non-smokers (data not shown) suggesting a compartmentalized effect of tobacco smoking. In contrast Lauener et al. demonstrated a significantly increased expression of CD14 and TLR2 on blood cells of farmers' children compared to non-farmers' children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the altered phenotype of smokers AM could play a role in decreased cellular responses to microbial stimulation facilitating persistent infection. Further studies regarding to the functional relevance of these findings and their contribution to the pathogenesis of COPD could lead to more effective treatment regimens of this disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AM = alveolar macrophage; BAL = bronchoalveolar lavage; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; FACS = Fluorescence activated cell sorter; GM-CSF = granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; HOPE = Hepes-Glutamic acid buffer mediated Organic solvent Protection Effect; IL = interleukin; IFN-&#x003b3; = interferon-&#x003b3;; LTA = lipoteichoic acid; LPS = lipopolysaccharide; PBMC = peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PE = phycoerythrin; PGN = peptidoglycan; PMA = phorbol myristate acetate; PMN = polymorphonuclear neutrophils; PRR = pattern recognition receptor; rMFI = relative mean fluorescence intensity; TLR = Toll-like receptor; TNF-&#x003b1; = tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DD carried out the flow cytometry and was involved in the design of the study and drafting the manuscript.
