Furrow formation relies on positional cues provided by anaphase spindle microtubules (MTs), but how such cues are generated remains unclear. Using chemical genetics to achieve both temporal and spatial control, we show that the self-organized delivery of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) to the midzone and its local phosphorylation of a MT-bound substrate are critical for generating this furrow-inducing signal. When Plk1 was active but unable to target itself to this equatorial landmark, both cortical RhoA recruitment and furrow induction failed to occur, thus recapitulating the effects of anaphase-specific Plk1 inhibition. Using tandem mass spectrometry and phosphospecific antibodies, we found that Plk1 binds and directly phosphorylates the HsCYK-4 subunit of centralspindlin (also known as MgcRacGAP) at the midzone. At serine 157, this modification creates a major docking site for the tandem BRCT repeats of the Rho GTP exchange factor Ect2. Cells expressing only a nonphosphorylatable form of HsCYK-4 failed to localize Ect2 at the midzone and were severely impaired in cleavage furrow formation, implying that HsCYK-4 is Plk1's rate-limiting target upstream of RhoA. Conversely, tethering an inhibitor-resistant allele of Plk1 to HsCYK-4 allowed furrows to form despite global inhibition of all other Plk1 molecules in the cell. Our findings illuminate two key mechanisms governing the initiation of cytokinesis in human cells and illustrate the power of chemical genetics to probe such regulation both in time and space.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>During mitosis, the separation of duplicated chromosomes and subsequent cytokinesis (cell division) are tightly coupled processes. Cytokinesis must occur not only after chromosomes have separated but also in the physical space between the chromosomes, so that each daughter cell inherits the appropriate genetic material. The mechanisms responsible for this cellular choreography are poorly understood, however. We used chemical genetics to dissect the role of a key regulator of cell division, Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) in human cells. We show that, contrary to previous models, the ability of Plk1 to seek out microtubules that lie between the separated chromosomes (so-called midzone microtubules) provides the cell with an affirmative command to divide. Once assembled at this landmark, Plk1 phosphorylates HsCYK-4, a component of the centralspindlin complex (so named because it assembles at the spindle midzone) and enables binding between HsCYK-4 and Ect2, another regulator of cell division. Bound Ect2 then communicates with the machinery that assembles the actin- and myosin-based contractile ring, leading to division of the cell into two daughters. Our work therefore reveals new insights into how Plk1 temporally and spatially orchestrates division of human cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>At the end of mitosis, a physical barrier must be established between the segregated sister genomes to produce two distinct cells.

In addition to its fundamental role in cell multiplication, cytokinesis contributes to genome integrity, because cells that fail to complete cytokinesis often reduplicate their chromosomes and centrosomes in the following cell cycle.

For example, declining Cdk1 activity at anaphase onset allows the reversal of inhibitory phosphorylations on PRC1 and the MKLP1 subunit of centralspindlin, enabling these factors to bind and bundle antiparallel MTs that constitute the spindle midzone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000111-Mollinari1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000111-Mishima1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Exposure of Plk1<sup>as</sup> cells to one such analog, 3-MB-PP1, abrogates all known mitotic and cytokinetic functions of the kinase, albeit on a 100-fold shorter time scale than gene deletion or RNAi. Importantly, 3-MB-PP1 is inert when applied to cells expressing wild-type Plk1, validating this compound as an allele-specific inhibitor in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000111-Randall1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In this Research Article, we leverage this system to modulate not only the timing of kinase signaling but also its geometry. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous models, Plk1's self-organization at the midzone in fact plays a crucial role in communicating the position of this equatorial landmark to the RhoA network. We also show that one key step in this communication involves the site-specific phosphorylation of the RhoGAP subunit of the centralspindlin complex, HsCYK-4, which creates a recognition site for a tandem BRCT repeat motif located at the N terminus of Ect2. Together these findings provide new insight into how Plk1 generates and amplifies the midzone-derived signal for cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A Chemical Genetic System for Manipulating the Geometry of Plk1 Activity in Anaphase Cells</title><p>As a first step, Plk1<sup>as</sup> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000111-Burkard1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> were transduced with retroviruses expressing either wild-type Plk1 (Plk1<sup>wt</sup>) or a so-called &#x0201c;pincer&#x0201d; mutant (Plk1<sup>AA</sup>) that can no longer bind phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000111-Elia2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000111-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

To test this explicitly, we cotransfected HeLa cells with epitope-tagged versions of HsCYK-4 (either wild-type or nonphosphorylatable) and an N-terminal Ect2 fragment that is immune to both intramolecular and Cdk1-dependent inhibition (myc-BRCT&#x0002a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000111-Yuce1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>).

However, it is unique in that it works by concentrating Plk1 near its midzone-specific substrates, rather than by up-regulating Plk1's activity throughout the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, like other positive-feedback loops, Plk1 self-organization makes cytokinesis more switchlike&#x02014;that is, more rapid and synchronous relative to other late mitotic events&#x02014;than would otherwise be the case. Indeed, in cells expressing the active but unanchored kinase fragment (Plk1<sup>cat</sup>), furrows were not only rarer but also shallower and more temporally heterogeneous than those induced by midzone-localized versions of Plk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000111-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000111.s006">Figure S6</xref>).

Conversely, pharmacologic agents have much faster kinetics of onset, but their high diffusibility limits their usefulness in selectively activating or inhibiting an enzyme at a defined subcellular location. Furthermore, distinguishing between the on-target and off-target effects of such compounds can be quite difficult. As illustrated here, chemical genetics can overcome these limitations and provide novel insights that are inaccessible via other routes. Given existing methods for gene replacement, similar systems can now be envisioned for most or all of the 600 kinases in the mouse and human genomes, providing powerful tools for both fundamental physiologic studies and preclinical evaluation of these enzymes as therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture Procedures</title><p>All lines were propagated in the following media supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin: HeLa and Phoenix retroviral packaging lines, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM); HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells, McCoy's 5A medium; and hTERT-RPE1 retinal pigment epithelial cells, 1&#x02236;1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 2.5 mM L-glutamine.

After 24 h, cells were washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) and released into fresh medium. After an additional 12 h, thymidine was added. Fifteen hours later, cells were washed twice with HBSS and released into fresh medium containing nocodazole. After 12 h, cells were washed twice and transferred into nocodazole-free medium. At each timepoint, DSP was added for 10 min to stabilize HsCYK-4 associated proteins, followed by quenching in 0.1 M Tris pH 8.0 for 10 min. Cells were collected and lysed in buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5&#x00025; NP-40, 10&#x00025; glycerol) containing phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mM &#x003b2;-glycerolphosphate, 50 mM NaF, 0.3 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>), protease inhibitors (1mM PMSF, 1&#x000d7; protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)), and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Two micrograms anti-HsCYK-4 antibody or control goat IgG was added to 1 mg extract on ice, followed by retrieval of immune complexes with a 1&#x02236;1 mixture of protein A- and protein G-coupled Sepharose beads. After extensive washes, bead-bound proteins were boiled in 1&#x000d7; Laemmli buffer containing &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol to reverse DSP-generated crosslinks prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. A similar protocol was used for all other immunoprecipitation experiments, except that DSP treatment was omitted. To specifically inhibit the 9E10 anti-myc antibody, a 100-fold excess of competitor peptide (EQKLISEEDL; Anaspec) was added on ice for 1 h before immunoprecipitation. Far-Western blotting with the GST-PBD fusion protein was performed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000111-Lowery1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Phosphoepitope-specific antibodies to HsCYK-4 were generated in rabbits through immunization of pS157- or p170-specific phosphopeptides (Active Motif).
