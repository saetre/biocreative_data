By using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the sequence published by Rouault et al. (1990) a probe was derived which permitted the isolation of three human IRF cDNA clones. Hybridization to genomic DNA and mRNA, as well as sequencing data indicated a single copy gene of about 40 kb specifying a 4.0 kb mRNA that translates into a protein of 98,400 dalton. By in vitro transcription of a assembled IRF cDNA coupled to in vitro translation in a wheat germ extract, we obtained full sized IRF that bound specifically to a human ferritin IRE. In vitro translated IRF retained sensitivity to sulfhydryl oxidation by diamide and could be reactivated by beta-mercaptoethanol in the same way as native placental IRF. An IRF deletion mutant shortened by 132 amino acids at the COOH-terminus was no longer able to bind to an IRE, indicating that this region of the protein plays a role in RNA recognition. Placental IRF has previously been shown to migrate as a doublet on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After V8 protease digestion the heterogeneity was located in a 65/70 kDa NH2-terminal doublet. The liberated 31 kDa COOH-terminal polypeptide was found to be homogeneous by amino acid sequencing supporting the conclusion of a single IRF gene.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0057-a" xlink:role="37"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0057-b" xlink:role="37"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0057-c" xlink:role="37"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0058-a" xlink:role="38"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0058-b" xlink:role="38"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0053.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="33"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0054.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="34"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0055.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="35"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0056.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="36"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0057.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="37"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0058.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="38"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00075-0059.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="39"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
