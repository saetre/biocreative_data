Myelin basic protein, one of the most abundant myelin-specific proteins, is an intrinsically disordered protein that has been shown to bind calmodulin. In this study, we focus on a 19-mer synthetic peptide from the predicted calmodulin-binding segment near the C-terminus of human myelin basic protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The interaction of native human myelin basic protein with calmodulin was confirmed by affinity chromatography. The binding of the myelin basic protein peptide to calmodulin was tested with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) in different temperatures, and K<sub>d </sub>was observed to be in the low &#x003bc;M range, as previously observed for full-length myelin basic protein. Surface plasmon resonance showed that the peptide bound to calmodulin, and binding was accompanied by a conformational change; furthermore, gel filtration chromatography indicated a decrease in the hydrodynamic radius of calmodulin in the presence of the peptide. NMR spectroscopy was used to map the binding area to reside mainly within the hydrophobic pocket of the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin. The solution structure obtained by small-angle X-ray scattering indicates binding of the myelin basic protein peptide into the interlobal groove of calmodulin, while calmodulin remains in an extended conformation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our results give a detailed structural insight into the interaction of calmodulin with a C-terminal segment of a major myelin protein, the myelin basic protein. The used 19-mer peptide interacts mainly with the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin, and a conformational change accompanies binding, suggesting a novel mode of calmodulin-target protein interaction. Calmodulin does not collapse and wrap around the peptide tightly; instead, it remains in an extended conformation in the solution structure. The observed affinity can be physiologically relevant, given the high abundance of both binding partners in the nervous system.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The myelin sheath is a tightly packed multilamellar membrane structure crucial for the correct functioning of the vertebrate nervous system. Myelin carries a specific set of proteins, whose expression is tightly regulated during development. Biochemically, the composition of myelin in the central and peripheral nervous system (CNS and PNS, respectively) is different from each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Mutations in myelin proteins or an autoimmune attack towards them can lead to devastating neurological diseases.</p><p>One of the most abundant proteins of myelin is the myelin basic protein (MBP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. MBP is a protein family, of which the 18.5-kDa isoform predominates in adult myelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In CNS myelin, it comprises 30% of the total protein; it is also present in PNS myelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. MBP is thought to be involved in the tight association of the cytoplasmic leaflets of apposing myelin membranes within compact myelin, where there is little, if any, cytoplasm present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Several segments of MBP are target autoantigens that have been characterised in multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>A bewildering amount of post-translational modifications, in addition to extensive alternative splicing, have been observed for MBP, leading to a number of size and charge isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. MBP has also been characterised as being intrinsically unstructured, with a possibility of local folding, especially upon binding to ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A low-resolution 3-dimensional model for MBP adsorbed to a lipid monolayer has been built based on electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Solution scattering experiments have also indicated an unfolded structure for lipid-free MBP; in the lipid-bound state, however, the protein seems compact but not globular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Several interaction partners for MBP have been characterised, including actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], tubulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and calmodulin (CaM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Although the interaction between MBP and CaM was initially reported already in 1980 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], relatively little structural information is available about the interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, MBP seems to have multiple regions capable of binding CaM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and it is not fully clear which of the CaM-binding sites are of physiological relevance. Some assays have also indicated a heterogeneous mode for the interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and the interaction is affected by MBP post-translational modifications, such as citrullination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The main CaM-binding site has been suggested to reside in the C-terminal region of CaM, between residues 132&#x02013;167 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. At least one more site lies in the central/N-terminal region of MBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we have used a synthetic peptide from the predicted CaM-binding segment near the C-terminus of human MBP to study the MBP-CaM interaction. We have used a number of biochemical and biophysical methods to confirm the interaction, thus accurately mapping the binding site of the peptide in CaM, and to obtain thermodynamic and structural data regarding complex formation in solution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Native human brain MBP binds to CaM</title><p>Affinity chromatography on CaM-sepharose was used to investigate the binding of human brain native MBP by CaM. The results clearly indicated that in the presence of calcium ions, MBP is retained in the affinity matrix, and that upon complexation of calcium by using EGTA, MBP is released (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Thus, the interaction is calcium-dependent, as earlier shown for bovine, murine, and human brain MBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Mass spectroscopic analysis indicated that the main human adult MBP isoforms, 17.2 and 18.5 kDa, were both present in the EGTA eluate, indicating that neither one of them is deficient in binding CaM (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Both in gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy, the 18.5-kDa isoform was more abundant.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Interaction between human brain MBP and CaM and selection of the peptide for the CaM interaction study</bold>. A. Electrophoretic analysis by SDS-PAGE of the fractions from affinity chromatography of human brain MBP on CaM-sepharose. The samples are as follows: 1, adult human brain MBP isoforms loaded into the column; 2&#x02013;6, washes with a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>; 7&#x02013;11, elution with a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EGTA. The observed strong protein band corresponds to the 18.5-kDa main human MBP isoform. The presence of also the 17.2-kDa isoform in both the second wash (lane 3) and the second EGTA eluate (lane 8) was confirmed by mass spectrometry (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).

We used a number of sequence analysis methods to select a peptide from this region that would be expected to bind CaM with high affinity. A combination of the following parameters was used: predicted propensity to fold into a helix, a low score in disorder predictions, the presence of a putative CaM-binding site according to the CaM target database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and detectable sequence homology to other well-characterised CaM targets. In addition, a search for putative functionally flexible regions was carried out using Wiggle. The results of these analyses are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><p>The peptide HKGFKGVDAQGTLSKIFKL, corresponding to residues 138&#x02013;156 of human 18.5-kDa MBP, was selected for the experiments. In brief, this is one of the two regions recognised as putative CaM targets by the CaM target database, and clearly one of the few regions in MBP that are consistently not predicted to be disordered by various disorder prediction algorithms. It is also predicted to be able to fold into an &#x003b1;-helix.</p></sec><sec><title>Conformational analysis by circular dichroism spectroscopy</title><p>Circular dichroism (CD) experiments were performed to compare the secondary structure, folding, and thermal stability of CaM in the presence and absence of the MBP peptide. The CD spectrum of CaM alone showed a shape typical of &#x003b1;-helical proteins, with negative minima at 206 and 221 nm and a positive maximum at 196 nm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The CD spectrum of the complex was only slightly different from the spectrum of CaM, indicating that no major conformational changes take place upon complex formation. The k2d program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] was used to predict the secondary structure contents (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The proportional content of &#x003b1;-helix was somewhat smaller in the complex than in CaM, reflecting the observation that the peptide in the absence of CaM contained no &#x003b1;-helix under the employed conditions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). While the fitting method suggests a large fraction of &#x003b2;-strand in the peptide in the absence of CaM, this reflects, rather, the inadequacy of the method for calculating the structure of a short peptide (or an unfolded protein), which is mostly unfolded, and probably contains a mixture of transient structures. For the structure modeling (see below), the peptide was modeled as a helix due to its homology to other (kinase) peptides that always bind CaM in a helical conformation (but are indeed disordered when not bound).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Circular dichroism spectroscopy</bold>.

A major transition, increasing the denaturation speed, occurs at a temperature of around +90&#x000b0;C for both samples. This transition is more pronounced in the absence of the peptide (CaM alone), which may indicate a stabilising effect by the peptide. Furthermore, cooling the samples back to +20&#x000b0;C in a similar fashion induced refolding of CaM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), and the presence of the peptide did not cause significant differences in the refolding.</p></sec><sec><title>Calorimetric binding assay</title><p>Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to study the interaction between the MBP peptide and CaM (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

The latter is probably due to electrostatic interactions between the peptide and CaM, after the single specific binding site is saturated. The measured dilution heat was basically zero (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), and it was assumed that the titrations will each time approach zero.</p><p>To characterize the binding of the peptide to the specific binding site of CaM, only the peaks 2&#x02013;7 were chosen for curve fitting to model 1:1 binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). When using all data (data points 2&#x02013;20), the best curve fitting could be obtained by using an artificial model implementing four sequential binding sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). In both cases, the thermodynamic parameters for the first, high-affinity, binding event are highly similar (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

The kinetics of the binding reaction were studied by injecting different concentrations of the MBP peptide over an immobilised CaM surface (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The data confirm the binding of the MBP peptide by immobilised CaM, and a K<sub>d </sub>value of 58 &#x003bc;M can be estimated from the data. The difference in the K<sub>d </sub>values obtained by SPR and ITC may be explained by the fact that CaM was immobilised on a solid support for the SPR analysis. The data could only be properly fit by a conformational change model (A+B &#x0003c;-&#x0003e; AB &#x0003c;-&#x0003e; AB*), in which, upon initial complex (AB) formation, the conformation of the complex alters (AB*). Even so, it became clear that the signal for the second conformation (AB*) is lower than for the first (AB), which significantly complicates the analysis and makes the calculated k<sub>on </sub>and k<sub>off </sub>values (k<sub>a1 </sub>= 6700 M<sup>-1 </sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, k<sub>d1 </sub>= 0.14 s<sup>-1</sup>, k<sub>a2 </sub>= 0.004 s<sup>-1</sup>, k<sub>d2 </sub>= 0.011 s<sup>-1</sup>), especially for the second step of the reaction, unreliable. It is not possible to take such a situation into account in the BIAevaluation software, and in order to obtain a good fit, it was necessary to use additional parameters to describe the background level. A decrease in the SPR signal between two conformations has been observed previously for the binding of small molecules by a maltose-binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Ligand binding to a receptor that correspondingly decreases in hydrodynamic radius yielded a negative change in resonance units (RU). It was also proposed that the sign of the RU change is a function of the net change in hydrodynamic radius that occurs upon ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Since by using the equilibrium RU values, the obtained Scatchard plot is curved (not shown), it is possible that similarly to the ITC experiment, the SPR signal is a combination of low- and high-affinity binding events. A further analysis of the data by non-linear regression by using a 2-site binding model (in GraphPad Prism) and the RU values at equilibrium gives evidence that a low-affinity binding event is seen at high concentrations of the peptide, and the corresponding K<sub>d </sub>values are approximately 10 and 1000 &#x003bc;M for the two binding events.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Surface plasmon resonance</bold>.

An increased stability of the complex with longer injection times can be observed from the fact that the dissociation rates get slower with increased injection time. The experiment clearly showed that longer injections of the MBP peptide give a more stable CaM-peptide complex, which also suggests the occurrence of a conformational change. Furthermore, during longer injections, the signal decreases already during the injection, indicating that the signal for the AB* state is indeed lower than that for the AB state.</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping the MBP-binding site of CaM by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy</title><p>NMR spectroscopy was used to identify CaM residues whose chemical shifts change upon forming the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-MBP peptide complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

As small conformational changes upon peptide binding could still not be excluded, we split CaM into three fragments (central helix, N- and C-termini of CaM) for the molecular modelling of the complex. The peptide was modelled as a helix for simplicity and due to homology, but the low resolution of the SAXS data does not allow for the determination of the exact conformation of the peptide. The program SASREF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] was employed to construct a low-resolution 3D model of CaM loaded with the peptide by using distance restraints from NMR data and requirement of chain compatibility for the three CaM segments (see details in Methods). This approach assumes that the CaM residues with the largest chemical shift perturbations in the NMR experiment interact closely with the peptide, which may not be strictly true for all of them. A typical rigid body model of the complex generated in multiple SASREF runs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) yields a good fit to the experimental data of the complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The overall shape of CaM in the rigid body modelling remains similar to that of free CaM. Similarly to the <italic>ab initio </italic>modelling results, the results suggest that the peptide is located between the two lobes, and more specifically, the tighter contact between the peptide and the C-terminal lobe observed by NMR is compatible with the SAXS results. It should be mentioned that at the given resolution, the models with antiparallel orientations of the peptide-helix are not distinguishable from each other, and solutions with both peptide directions were obtained, yielding the same fit to the SAXS data.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Size exclusion chromatography</title><p>To further validate the determined solution structure of the complex, we carried out gel filtration chromatography and analysed the fractions by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, allowing the visualisation of both CaM and the peptide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).

A superposition of the chromatograms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>) in the presence and absence of the peptide indicates that the hydrodynamic radius of CaM is indeed decreased in the presence of the peptide.

By the use of various bioinformatics methods and sequence comparisons to known CaM ligands, we were able to design a 19-residue peptide based on the sequence of human MBP that binds to CaM with micromolar affinity. The measured affinity for the peptide towards CaM was similar or slightly weaker than observed previously for full-length MBP and a C-terminal proteolytic fragment thereof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although the observed affinity, in the low micromolar range, is lower than for some other CaM targets, it suggests a physiological relevance for the interaction, taking into account the following points: Firstly, the concentration of MBP in myelin is very high, and the concentration of CaM in cells is also in the order of 1&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], even higher in the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Thus, the measured affinity is in the range that can regulate the interactions between these two highly abundant proteins. Secondly, it is likely that the surrounding regions of MBP, being highly positively charged, can interact with and possibly even wrap around CaM, once the specific recognition of the binding site has occurred; this would be expected to increase the affinity for complex formation. Furthermore, the presence of more than one binding site for CaM in MBP raises the possibility of so-called allovalency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], effectively increasing the affinity.</p><p>It should be noted that in other vertebrate species, insertions of 1&#x02013;2 residues are seen near the middle of the peptide that was used (see Methods). This implies either that there may be subtle species-specific differences in the interaction between CaM and this MBP segment, or that the entire length of the peptide is not necessary for the interaction. For example, it is possible that only one half of the used MBP peptide is in close contact with the C-terminal lobe of CaM; high-resolution structural data would be required to fully address this issue.</p><p>The region, from which the peptide was selected, is also a target for MBP posttranslational modifications. Ser151 can be phosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and Gln147 deamidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Both of these modifications will add a negative charge to the corresponding position, thus likely decreasing the affinity for CaM. No citrullination sites are present in the peptide, however, due to the lack of arginine residues. On both sides of the used peptide, the MBP sequence does harbour characterised citrullination sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], which could, in principle, also regulate binding to CaM.</p></sec><sec><title>Energetics of the CaM-MBP peptide interaction</title><p>The heat capacities of several CaM-associated reactions have been reported and discussed earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].

This is important in order to prevent temperature-induced conformational changes in CaM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]; this effect is also seen in our data, making measurements at high temperatures unreliable. CaM-binding peptides have been roughly divided into two groups depending on the heat capacity upon their complex formation with CaM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].

In our current study, the estimated <italic>&#x00394;C</italic><sub><italic>p </italic></sub>of the formed complex is -0.13 kcal mol<sup>-1 </sup>K<sup>-1</sup>, which is different from the above cases and can indicate different type of binding compared to the two previously discussed groups of peptides. In fact, it directly suggests a smaller buried surface area than in the other CaM-peptide complexes &#x02013; an idea which is indeed confirmed by our NMR and SAXS studies.</p></sec><sec><title>The structure of the CaM-MBP peptide complex in solution</title><p>SPR indicated that the complex formed between immobilised CaM and the MBP peptide underwent a conformational change upon binding. A conformational change was also detected by SPR when the complex between CaM and the ERR3 receptor was studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. A negative change in RU, as observed here for the CaM-MBP complex, during the injection may reflect a decrease in the hydrodynamic radius of the forming complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This is also in line with our results from gel filtration chromatography, in which the apparent size of CaM is decreased in the presence of the peptide, indicating a smaller hydrodynamic radius for the complex than for unliganded CaM. On the other hand, as expected, CD spectroscopy clearly indicated that no large-scale changes in secondary structure content occur upon binding.</p><p>The solution structure of the CaM-MBP peptide complex obtained with SAXS is compatible with all of the other experiments we carried out on the complex. In essence, the SAXS results indicate that the maximum diameter of CaM does not change when bound to the MBP peptide, and the radius of gyration for the complex is slightly smaller than that of free CaM. This result is fully compatible with the result from gel filtration chromatography. The peptide can be seen bound to a groove in the central region of CaM (slightly closer to the C-terminal lobe), which remains in the extended conformation. In other words, CaM does not collapse around the MBP peptide, as seen in several other instances of CaM-peptide recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>It is possible that the CaM-MBP peptide complex has several conformations in solution; however, the fact that both the <italic>ab initio </italic>and rigid body models from SAXS fit the measured data well (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) indicates that it is likely that only one major conformation is present, at the resolution that has been used in the current study. This is also supported by gel filtration chromatography (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>), where significantly different conformations of the complex could yield different peaks or peaks with non-symmetric shapes, since the starting point is CaM, an elongated dumbbell-shaped molecule.</p><p>Our NMR data indicate that although the main binding site for the MBP peptide resides in the C-terminal lobe of CaM, also the central helix and the N-terminal lobe interact with the peptide.

With relatively weak binding, such as that observed between MBP and CaM, a massive conformational change may indeed not be required, and the binding affinity may be low in order to maintain the possibility of regulation, because the concentrations of both interaction partners in the cell are high. Thus, MBP is another CaM target that cannot be thought of as being analogous to CaM kinases with respect to the mode of CaM binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].

To account for possible conformational changes upon peptide binding, CaM was represented by three rigid bodies, namely by the N-terminal lobe, the central helix, and the C-terminal lobe (residues 4&#x02013;64, 65&#x02013;93, and 94&#x02013;148, respectively). SASREF positions the four rigid bodies (three CaM portions and the peptide) with respect to each other using SA to form an interconnected assembly without steric clashes, while minimising the discrepancy between the experimental data and the scattering profile from the model of the complex. The latter is calculated based on the pre-computed scattering amplitudes of the subunits in the reference positions and orientations. Scattering from the atomic models was calculated using the program CRYSOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. SASREF allows one to account for contacts between specific residues in the subunits using distance restraints. In the present work, the polypeptide chain compatibility of the entire CaM was ensured by restraining the distances between appropriate terminal residues of three CaM portions to 0.4 nm. Moreover, the information on chemical shift perturbations from the NMR experiment (see NMR section) was also included into SAXS-based molecular modelling by adding the proximity requirement between the peptide and the CaM residues that were observed to be involved in binding the MBP peptide. In brief, a distance restraint of 10 &#x000c5; was used between the peptide and residues 78, 80, 85, or 88 of CaM. A restraint of 7 &#x000c5; was imposed on the distance between the peptide and CaM residues 130, 137, or 141 and between the peptide and CaM residues 143 or 147. The restraint terms were not adjusted during minimisation. A discussion on the shape of the restraint functions has been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>For the <italic>ab initio </italic>and rigid body analyses, multiple runs were performed to verify the stability of the solution, and typical 3D reconstructions are presented in the results section.

Such an NSD value means that the models are indistinguishable at the resolution provided by SAXS. The analysis of common structural features of the models was done using the programs DAMAVER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and SUPCOMB. The latter program aligns two arbitrary low or high resolution models represented by ensembles of points by minimizing a dissimilarity measure, NSD. For every point (bead or atom) in the first model, the minimum value among the distances between this point and all points in the second model is found, and the same is done for the points in the second model. These distances are added and normalized against the average distances between the neighboring points for the two models. Generally, NSD values close to unity indicate that the two models are similar. The program DAMAVER specifies the most typical model (i.e. that having the lowest average NSD with all the other models of the set of superimposed structures).</p><p>The rigid body model and the original data are included in this paper as Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Size exclusion chromatography</title><p>Gel filtration chromatography with the &#x000c4;KTA<italic>purifier </italic>system (Pharmacia Biotech) was used to investigate the difference in the behaviour of CaM in the presence and absence of the MBP peptide.
