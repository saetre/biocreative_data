Vesicle-based membrane delivery from the recycling endosome (RE) has an essential but ill-defined involvement in cytokinesis. In the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> early embryo, Nuf (Nuclear fallout), a Rab11 effector which is essential for RE function, is required for F-actin and membrane integrity during furrow ingression. We find that in <italic>nuf</italic> mutant embryos, an initial loss of F-actin at the furrow is followed by loss of the associated furrow membrane. Wild-type embryos treated with Latrunculin A or Rho inhibitor display similar defects. Drug- or Rho-GTP&#x02013;induced increase of actin polymerization or genetically mediated decrease of actin depolymerization suppresses the <italic>nuf</italic> mutant F-actin and membrane defects. We also find that RhoGEF2 does not properly localize at the furrow in <italic>nuf</italic> mutant embryos and that RhoGEF2&#x02013;Rho1 pathway components show strong specific genetic interactions with Nuf.

The contractile ring forms perpendicular and midway to the anaphase spindle. Once the contractile ring forms, ingression of the cleavage furrow begins. Ingression of the animal cleavage furrow involves vesicle-mediated membrane addition as well as actomyosin-based contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albertson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Avino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glotzer, 2005</xref>). Thus, successful cytokinesis requires precise coordination between contraction and membrane addition.</p><p>Vesicle-based membrane delivery from both the Golgi and the recycling endosome (RE) is necessary for furrow ingression during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lecuit and Wieschaus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sisson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Skop et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farkas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pelissier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fielding et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giansanti et al., 2007</xref>). The RE, which is often found closely associated with microtubules, mediates vesicle transport directly to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ullrich et al., 1996</xref>). These properties make it especially well suited for regulating vesicle-mediated delivery to the cytokinesis furrows. Functional studies demonstrating a role for the RE in cytokinesis have relied extensively on <italic>rab11</italic> mutants. Rab11 is a small GTPase that preferentially localizes to the RE and is required for proper RE formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maxfield and McGraw, 2004</xref>). Consequently, <italic>rab11</italic> mutants render the RE nonfunctional and disrupt vesicle recycling to the plasma membrane. Mutations of <italic>rab11</italic> in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and mammalian cells all result in a failure to complete cleavage furrow ingression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Skop et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pelissier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giansanti et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Additional support for a specific role of the RE in vesicle-mediated membrane delivery during cytokinesis comes from analysis of the Rab11 effector protein Nuf/FIP3/Arfophilin2. Genetic studies in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> identified the centrosome-associated protein Nuf (Nuclear-fallout) as being essential for proper furrow formation in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sullivan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rothwell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>). Nuf is a homologue of mammalian FIP3/Arfophilin2 and both share a conserved 20-aa C-terminal Rab11 binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hickson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>). GST pulldowns demonstrate that Nuf and Rab11 physically associate and functional studies demonstrate that Nuf and Rab11 are mutually required for their localization to the RE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Mutational analysis reveals that Nuf and Rab11 are involved in proper membrane and actin organization at the invaginating furrows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rothwell et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>nuf</italic> embryos, regions of the furrow are devoid of F-actin but not of other core furrow components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rothwell et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, extensive gaps in the membrane are observed in the furrows of <italic>nuf</italic> and <italic>rab11</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rothwell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>). Associated with these gaps is an extensive accumulation of vesicles in the cortex, suggesting that these mutations disrupt RE-based vesicle-mediated delivery to the invaginating furrows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rothwell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The fact that disrupting RE function through the <italic>nuf</italic> and <italic>rab11</italic> mutants produces defects in both membrane and F-actin organization suggests that these processes are closely linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>). To explore this linkage, we examined the relationship between F-actin turnover and stability of the metaphase and cellularization furrows in the early <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryo. Although actin turnover at the cytokinetic furrow has been well documented in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pelham and Chang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2005</xref>), the functional significance remains unclear and the relationship between turnover and membrane stability has not been specifically explored. An advantage of studying this issue in the early <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryo is that furrow formation does not rely on actomyosin-based contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Royou et al., 2004</xref>). Surprisingly, disrupting myosin II function through mutations, antibody injection, or small molecule inhibitors has little effect on furrow progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Royou et al., 2004</xref>). The same experiments performed in tissue culture cells undergoing conventional cytokinesis produced profound disruptions in furrow progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Somma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Echard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eggert et al., 2004</xref>). Furrow invagination in the early <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos is driven primarily by vesicle-mediated membrane addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lecuit and Wieschaus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sisson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pelissier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>). This enables us to explore functions of F-actin turnover that are independent of its role in actomyosin-based contraction.</p><p>In this paper, we describe a set of experiments that demonstrate that F-actin is required for the stability of the furrow membrane and actin turnover is required for normal furrow elongation. We also propose a model in which Nuf, a Rab11 effector, regulates furrow maintenance by regulating the rate of F-actin polymerization through the RhoGEF2&#x02013;Rho1 pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>F-actin is rapidly turned over at the furrow through depolymerization and repolymerization</title><p>To investigate actin dynamics at the metaphase furrows, we injected Rhodamine-labeled monomeric actin into embryos expressing the F-actin&#x02013;specific label GFP-Moesin. The specificity for F-actin labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edwards et al., 1997</xref>) was confirmed by colocalization of GFP-Moesin with phalloidin staining (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712036/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712036/DC1</ext-link>). Monomeric Rhodamine actin was incorporated into newly forming furrow tips (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, arrowheads). Interestingly, within 15 s after injection, Rhodamine-actin was rapidly incorporated into preexisting furrows and its fluorescence continued to increase for at least 2 min after injection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, arrows). The observation that actin polymerization occurred within existing cytokinetic furrows reveals that furrows are dynamic rather than static structures.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>F-actin is rapidly turned over in the furrow through depolymerization and repolymerization.</bold> The schematic illustrates the focal plane relative to the furrow.

LatA was injected into GFP-Moesin&#x02013;expressing embryos during furrow invagination at cycle 13. These embryos had also been previously injected with Rhodamine-labeled monomeric actin, and time was provided for the monomeric actin to fully incorporate into furrows. At 1 min 20 s after Latrunculin injection, the levels of exogenous actin and GFP-Moesin were clearly diminished (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), indicating loss of F-actin from the furrow. Quantification of the signal intensities at furrows areas indicated that 4 min after injection, the Rhodamine-actin and GFP-Moesin signals were reduced by 74.4 &#x000b1; 6.6% (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3 embryos) and 78.8 &#x000b1; 2.3% (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3 embryos), respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, furrow intensity calculation). In contrast, the fluorescence signals 4 min after injection in DMSO-injected controls were reduced only by 0.9 &#x000b1; 0.4% (Rhodamine-actin; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3 embryos) and 0.8 &#x000b1; 0.3% (GFP-Moesin; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3 embryos).</p><p>To better understand actin dynamics at the furrow, we quantified turnover rates of F-actin at metaphase furrows using FRAP. Previous FRAP analyses on cleavage furrows could not differentiate the actin turnover rates at the preexisting furrow and at the ingressing furrow tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pelham and Chang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2005</xref>). Our system enables viewing of preexisting furrows and furrow tips separately at defined z depths below the embryo surface, allowing examination of actin turnover exclusively in preexisting furrows and furrow tips, respectively. Monomeric Rhodamine-actin was injected into GFP-Moesin&#x02013;expressing embryos and allowed to fully incorporate into existing furrows, and then these labels were photobleached. This experiment revealed that F-actin turnover is rapid in preexisting furrows, with a fluorescence recovery t<sub>1/2</sub> of 25.9 &#x000b1; 1.8 s (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10 embryos) for GFP-Moesin and 17.9 &#x000b1; 1.3 s (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10 embryos) for Rhodamine-actin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>; and Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712036/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712036/DC1</ext-link>). Furthermore, the respective fluorescence labels returned to 83.8 &#x000b1; 2.9% (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10 embryos) and 86.3 &#x000b1; 3.5% (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10 embryos) of their prebleached intensities 80 s after photobleaching, indicating that most of the F-actin in the furrow turned over within that time period. Similar fluorescence recovery results were obtained when furrow tips were photobleached, with a t<sub>1/2</sub> of 24.2 &#x000b1; 2.3 s (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 11 embryos) for GFP-Moesin and 21.6 &#x000b1; 1.6 s (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 11 embryos) for Rhodamine-actin. Accordingly, 88.7 &#x000b1; 5.7% (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 11 embryos) of the GFP-Moesin and 92.3 &#x000b1; 5.3% (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 11 embryos) of the Rhodamine-actin intensities were recovered at the furrow tips 80 s after photobleaching. Collectively, with our experiments demonstrating actin polymerization and depolymerization activities at the metaphase furrows, these results indicate that metaphase and conventional cytokinesis furrows share the property of rapid F-actin turnover.</p></sec><sec><title>F-actin turnover is required for furrow invagination</title><p>To investigate the functional impact of actin turnover on furrow dynamics, we inhibited actin turnover by injecting Jasp (Jasplakinolide) or LatA into living embryos. The efficacy of Jasp was demonstrated by excess F-actin accumulation at the invaginating furrows when it was injected during cycle 13 in wild-type (WT) embryos expressing a GFP-Dlg (Discs-Large) transgene (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712036/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712036/DC1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quinones-Coello et al., 2007</xref>).

Both furrow invagination, determined by the length of the furrow, and furrow integrity, indicated by the furrow ring structure behind the invaginating leading edge, were analyzed using this marker. Although furrow integrity was not perturbed, furrow invagination was blocked after Jasp injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A&#x02013;C</xref>). In contrast, LatA injection permitted furrow invagination but caused gaps in the furrow ring structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), which is reminiscent of a previous study demonstrating that the free ends of incomplete metaphase furrows in <italic>nuf</italic> mutant embryos extend normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rothwell et al., 1999</xref>). These reults indicate that depolymerization or destabilization of F-actin at the furrow is required for furrow invagination, whereas actin polymerization is required for maintaining furrow integrity.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>F-actin turnover is required for furrow invagination.</bold> (A) 1 mM Jasp, 2 mM LatA, or DMSO control were injected into GFP-Dlg embryos at cycle-13 early prophase (when furrow is &#x0223c;3 &#x003bc;m in length), and furrow invagination was followed over time at depths from &#x02212;2 &#x003bc;m to &#x02212;8 &#x003bc;m below the embryo surface.

As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, GFP-Dlg&#x02013;marked plasma membrane was closely surrounded by F-actin at the furrow in untreated WT embryos. LatA injection caused an immediate loss of F-actin signal intensity at the furrow (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Initially, the injection had no apparent effect on GFP-Dlg distribution, but by 3 min after injection, large gaps of GFP-Dlg&#x02013;labeled membrane were visible (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>, arrowheads). These gaps became more extensive as furrow progression proceeded. The same effect on furrow membrane integrity was seen in older cellularizing embryos after disrupting F-actin at the furrow by LatA injection (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712036/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712036/DC1</ext-link>). These studies indicate that in both cycle 13 and cellularization-stage embryos, F-actin loss at the furrow was followed by the loss of membrane integrity. To further verify these results, we analyzed the effect of LatA with a different plasma membrane marker, Spider-GFP, a casein kinase I which is associated with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frescas et al., 2006</xref>). As with the GFP-Dlg, LatA injection led to breaks in the previously contiguous Spider-GFP signal (Fig. S3 B).

However, mitotic spindles adjacent to partial or intact furrow membranes remained independent of one another (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref> and Video 2). As most of F-actin was no longer associated with the remaining furrow membrane 4 min after LatA injection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3 B and 1 B</xref>), these data indicate that plasma membrane, not F-actin, serves as the primary barrier separating neighboring spindles from one another.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuf is required to maintain furrow integrity</title><p>Previous studies have shown that the RE component Nuf is required for actin and membrane recruitment to the invaginating furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rothwell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>).

In regions where furrow membrane was already lost before injection, Jasp did not induce new membrane growth to fill the furrow gaps (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>), which is consistent with our finding that Jasp functions to stabilize actin cytoskeleton and its associated plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Jasp also disrupted spindle formation (Fig. S4 B), and thus spindle fusion was not pursued in these Jasp-treated <italic>nuf</italic> embryos.

We examined if RhoA and Nuf share a common function in promoting furrow maintenance by testing if reduced RhoA activity produces the <italic>nuf</italic> phenotype. The Rho inhibitor C3 exotransferase was injected into cycle-13 prophase embryos expressing GFP-Dlg. C3 transferase has been widely used to block Rho signaling in different systems including cellularization and conventional cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crawford et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bement et al., 2005</xref>). Similar to embryos deficient for Nuf or injected with LatA, C3-treated embryos induced membrane loss over time, which eventually led to neighboring spindle fusions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref> and Video 8, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712036/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712036/DC1</ext-link>). Importantly, loss of F-actin also precedes loss of membrane at the furrows after C3 injection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). This indicates that, similar to <italic>nuf</italic> embryos, blocking Rho activity induces loss of F-actin stability at the furrow, which results in loss of membrane integrity. The phenotypes of reducing Rho or Nuf function are strikingly similar, suggesting that Nuf functions within a Rho pathway to promote furrow integrity.</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Nuf functions within the RhoA pathway to promote furrow integrity.</bold> (A and B) 1 mg/ml C3 transferase was injected at cycle-13 early prophase.

We therefore examined the localization of other furrow components in <italic>nuf</italic> mutant embryos. Unlike RhoGEF2, the core furrow components within the RhoA pathway, Rho1 and Diaphanous, generally concentrated in furrow regions where F-actin was properly localized (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, D and E</xref> and Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712036/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712036/DC1</ext-link>). Furthermore, we tested the localization of RhoGEF2 together with another core furrow component, Anillin, in <italic>nuf</italic> embryos. Anillin is a multidomain protein that is essential for cytokinesis and plays an important role in scaffolding furrow components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Field et al., 2005</xref>). It localizes to the metaphase furrow preceding F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Field and Alberts, 1995</xref>) and in <italic>nuf</italic> embryos, it localizes to regions of the furrows lacking F-actin during early furrow formation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 F</xref>, arrows; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rothwell et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, Anillin is a good marker to indicate furrow integrity. Our staining showed that during early furrow formation, RhoGEF2 was diffusely localized at the furrow in regions where Anillin was properly localized (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 F</xref>, arrows). Because RhoGEF2 was mislocalized in regions that show aspects of normal furrow structure, the data indicate that RhoGEF2 mislocalization in <italic>nuf</italic> embryos is caused by a lack of Nuf activity. Among the other furrow components tested in this and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rothwell et al., 1998</xref>), there is a correlation between the mislocalization of furrow components and F-actin defects. Therefore, RhoGEF2 is unique in this respect because RhoGEF2 mislocalization is not limited to furrow regions with F-actin defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuf interacts genetically with RhoGEF2 and its downstream actin remodelers</title><p>Functional test for interaction between Nuf and the RhoA pathway were performed through dosage-sensitive genetic interactions between null alleles of <italic>nuf</italic> and several genes involved in actin remodeling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 G</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).

To address this issue, we determined the turnover rates of F-actin by performing FRAP analysis on the furrow-associated F-actin located at the tip and 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;m behind the leading edge of the furrow. These studies demonstrate that GFP-Moesin, an F-actin binding protein, and injected Rhodamine-labeled actin are rapidly turned over. The turnover rates are comparable with turnover rates observed in LLCPK1 epithelial cell contractile ring (26 s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2005</xref>), normal rat kidney cell equatorial cortex (12&#x02013;15 s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guha et al., 2005</xref>) and fission yeast contractile ring (&#x0223c;25 s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pelham and Chang, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, rapid incorporation of G-actin into preexisting furrow-actin filaments and rapid disappearance of F-actin from preexisting furrows after LatA treatment indicate that both actin polymerization and depolymerization contribute to F-actin turnover at the furrow. These studies are in accord with previous work demonstrating rapid turnover of actin at the cleavage furrows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pelham and Chang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2005</xref>). Although previous work focused on F-actin turnover specifically at the contractile ring, our studies demonstrate that F-actin also turns over in a myosin-free zone well behind the leading edge of the ingressing furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Royou et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Actin turnover coordinates furrow invagination with furrow integrity</title><p>Although it is likely that rapid actin turnover will prove to be a conserved feature of cytokinetic furrows, its functional significance remains unclear. F-actin turnover may be required for proper actomyosin-based constriction of the contractile ring, as this structure decreases in volume as constriction proceeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schroeder, 1972</xref>). However, the F-actin turnover observed behind the leading edge of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> metaphase and cellularization furrows is likely to have additional function, as furrow ingression is not dependent on actomyosin-based contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Royou et al., 2004</xref>). Rather, ingression of these furrows relies largely on vesicle-mediated membrane addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lecuit and Wieschaus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sisson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pelissier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>). Consequently, we analyzed the relationship between F-actin turnover, furrow membrane stability, and ingression by simultaneously monitoring plasma membrane and F-actin dynamics. We find that LatA injection results in an immediate loss of F-actin. In addition, the loss of F-actin after LatA treatment always precedes loss of furrow membrane integrity. These results indicate that cortical F-actin is critical for maintaining furrow membrane integrity. Previous studies demonstrated that LatA-induced disruption of F-actin results in relaxation of the cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2005</xref>). Our studies suggest that this relaxation may be in part caused by loss of furrow membrane integrity. Our finding also provides a possible explanation for the observation that mutants in Anillin, an F-actin bundling protein, produce large gaps in the plasma membrane of the cellularization furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Field et al., 2005</xref>). These gaps may also be a direct consequence of F-actin loss.</p><p>To understand the functional significance of F-actin turnover at the furrow, we injected Jasp, a drug that stabilizes F-actin by inhibiting F-actin turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bubb et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2005</xref>). Jasp resulted in a robust accumulation of F-actin at the furrows but did not disrupt furrow integrity. However, it prevented both furrow progression and regression, indicating an increase in furrow stability. This result is consistent with studies in other systems demonstrating that excess accumulation or stabilization of F-actin significantly slowed or blocked progression of the cleavage furrows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Connell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murthy and Wadsworth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mukhina et al., 2007</xref>). Those studies were performed in cells in which furrow advancement requires actomyosin-based contraction at the contractile ring and, thus, it remained unclear if the block of furrow progression was solely caused by inhibition of contractile ring constriction. Because furrow invagination in the early <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryo is primarily the result of vesicle-mediated membrane addition and it does not require actomyosin-based constriction, the Jasp-induced block of metaphase furrow progression is likely caused by inhibition of processes other than actomyosin-based constriction.</p><p>One explanation for these results comes from studies demonstrating that cortical F-actin acts as a barrier preventing vesicles from gaining access to docking and fusion sites at the plasma membrane. Studies suggest that transient depolymerization of F-actin at the membrane&#x02013;actin cytoskeleton interface facilitates membrane addition to the furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eitzen, 2003</xref>). The recent realization that vesicle-mediated membrane addition plays an important role in ingression of the cytokinetic furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albertson et al., 2005</xref>) raises the possibility that F-actin turnover is required to facilitate vesicle-mediated membrane fusion. Our studies suggest that F-actin turnover at the cytokinetic furrow is required to facilitate vesicle-mediated membrane growth while simultaneously providing structural integrity to the newly invaginated membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuf maintains furrow stability through promoting actin polymerization</title><p>Our studies of F-actin dynamics also provide insights into the role of Nuf, a Rab11 effector, during invagination of the metaphase and cellularization furrows. Nuf and its mammalian homologue FIP3 are required for the structural integrity of the RE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emery et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horgan et al., 2007</xref>). Disruption of Nuf/FIP3 function results in a failure to complete cytokinesis, and <italic>rab11</italic> mutants produce a similar phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>). These results, along with cytological observations of vesicle distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rothwell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>), indicate that vesicles derived from the RE are an important source of membrane during furrow formation. Although Rab11 remains associated with the RE throughout the cell cycle, Nuf exhibits a cell cycle&#x02013;regulated Dynein-dependent recruitment to the RE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Riggs et al., 2007</xref>). Nuf is associated with the RE only at those phases of the cell cycle in which the furrows are invaginating. It is possible that the cell cycle&#x02013;regulated association of Nuf with Rab11 may stimulate vesicle delivery to the invaginating furrows.</p><p>A puzzling feature of the <italic>nuf</italic> and <italic>Rab11</italic> mutant phenotypes is that they cause severe defects in furrow F-actin organization as well as defects in membrane integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>). The LatA injection studies described in the previous section raise the possibility that the defects in F-actin organization precede and cause the membrane defects observed in <italic>nuf</italic> and <italic>Rab11</italic> mutant embryos. Support for this idea comes from our finding that the initial defect in <italic>nuf</italic> embryos is the formation of large gaps in the invaginating furrow-associated F-actin. Shortly after loss of F-actin, we observed loss of membrane integrity in the same region. This phenotype is strikingly similar to that observed in LatA-treated embryos: an immediate loss of F-actin followed by a loss of membrane integrity. These results suggest that a primary function of Nuf during furrow invagination is to maintain high levels of F-actin along the length of the furrows. In addition, we conclude that at least some of the observed membrane defects in <italic>nuf</italic> embryos are a direct consequence of the defects in F-actin organization (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Model.</bold> In WT embryos, Nuf promotes actin polymerization at the invaginating furrow by properly localizing RhoGEF2 to the furrow, where it activates Rho1. Up-regulating actin polymerization stabilizes furrow membrane. In <italic>nuf</italic> mutant embryos, failed RhoGEF2 recruitment results in insufficient actin polymerization. This in turn results in loss of furrow membrane integrity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820301f08"></graphic></fig><p>Because F-actin is rapidly turning over, the abundance of F-actin in any given region of the furrow depends on the relative polymerization and depolymerization rates. Thus, one explanation for the failure to maintain F-actin at the furrows in <italic>nuf</italic> embryos is a disruption in the relative rates of polymerization and depolymerization. To test this idea, we artificially increased the rate of actin polymerization in <italic>nuf</italic> embryos by injecting Jasp. The Jasp injections prevented loss of furrow-associated F-actin in <italic>nuf</italic> embryos. Significantly, in addition to maintaining F-actin integrity, the Jasp injections also maintained furrow membrane integrity in <italic>nuf</italic> embryos. We confirmed this result by genetically reducing the dosage of Twinstar/Cofilin in <italic>nuf</italic> embryos. Cofilin is known to sever and depolymerize F-actin during cell migration and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ono, 2007</xref>). Thus, reducing Cofilin dosage is likely to reduce the rate of actin depolymerization and increase cortical F-actin levels. In accord with this reasoning, we find that reducing the dosage of Twinstar, the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> homologue of cofilin, dramatically suppresses both the F-actin and membrane defects observed in <italic>nuf</italic> embryos. In contrast to embryos carrying the normal dosage of <italic>twinstar</italic>, <italic>nuf</italic> embryos with reduced dosage of <italic>twinstar</italic> exhibited relatively normal metaphase and cellularization furrows. Normally, none of the eggs hatch from <italic>nuf</italic> embryos. However, in <italic>nuf</italic> embryos with reduced levels of Twinstar, significant egg hatch was observed and a large proportion of these gave rise to adults. These findings strongly support the idea that the primary defect in <italic>nuf</italic> embryos is a failure to maintain sufficient levels of F-actin at the plasma membrane during furrow invagination. The loss of F-actin ultimately results in loss of integrity in the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>RE-derived vesicles deliver actin polymerization activity to the invaginating furrows</title><p>Our studies raise the issue of the mechanism by which Nuf promotes F-actin stability during furrow invagination. Previous studies demonstrated that vesicles near the invaginating furrow are often associated with F-actin, raising the possibility that F-actin and vesicles are delivered as a unit to the invaginating furrows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rothwell et al., 1999</xref>). It may be that as F-actin is depolymerized at the furrow, new F-actin is directly supplied by vesicle-mediated delivery. Support for this idea comes from studies in cultured animal cells demonstrating that F-actin is transported along the cortex to the ingressing furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao and Wang, 1990</xref>). It may be that, like in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryo, this cortically transported F-actin is vesicle associated.</p><p>An alternative explanation is based on the idea that RE-derived vesicles destined for invaginating furrows may carry potent actin remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>). Support for this model is provided by several studies demonstrating that RhoGEF2 and its downstream effectors Rho1 and Diaphanous are required for proper actin remodeling at the metaphase and cellularization furrows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crawford et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grosshans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Padash Barmchi et al., 2005</xref>). Analysis of <italic>RhoGEF2</italic> mutants was particularly intriguing because the resulting gaps in the furrow-associated F-actin were strikingly similar to those observed in <italic>nuf</italic> and <italic>Rab11</italic> embryos. In addition, RhoGEF2 was observed not only at the invaginating membrane but also in puncta throughout the cortex, raising the possibility that it is delivered through vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Padash Barmchi et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we find that RhoGEF2 delivery and localization at the metaphase furrows require Nuf and Rab11. In <italic>nuf</italic> embryos, although Rho1 and Diaphanous were mislocalized only in the region where furrow was disrupted, RhoGEF2 was globally diffuse around the furrow, implying a specific role for the RE in delivering RhoGEF2. We also find that treating embryos with the Rho inhibitor C3 exotransferase produces phenotypes similar to <italic>nuf</italic>, in which loss of F-actin at the furrow precedes membrane loss. Conversely, injecting constitutively active RhoA into <italic>nuf</italic> embryos rescues the <italic>nuf</italic>-induced furrow defects specifically at the injection site.</p><p>Synthetic genetic interactions between Nuf and the RhoGEF2&#x02013;Rho1 pathway further support the model that vesicles derived from RE ferry both membrane and actin-remodeling activity to the invaginating furrow. This model emphasizes an important role for the RE in linking membrane addition to actin remodeling at the invaginating metaphase furrow, which may also be true for conventional cytokinesis. Further, because membrane addition requires transient actin depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eitzen, 2003</xref>), by promoting actin polymerization at the site of membrane addition, this pathway compensates for the transient loss of F-actin during vesicle delivery.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Fly strains and genetics</title><p>Experiments involving all <italic>nuf</italic> or <italic>Rab11</italic> mutants were performed using the <italic>nuf<sup>1</sup></italic>-null allele or <italic>Rab11<sup>j2D1</sup>/Rab11<sup>93Bi</sup></italic> transheterozygous combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rothwell et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riggs et al., 2003</xref>).

Except for the experiment after actin incorporation into the furrow, 10 mg/ml Rhodamine-conjugated actin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) and 10 mg/ml Rhodamine-conjugated tubulin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) were injected into the embryos one cycle before drug injections and imaging. The following drugs were injected either at early cycle-13 prophase or early cellularization: DMSO alone (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM Latrunculin A (in DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Jasp (in DMSO; EMD and provided by P. Crews, University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), and 1 mg/ml C3 exotransferase (Cytoskeleton, Inc.). C3 transferase is an ADP ribosyl transferase that selectively ribosylates and inactivates Rho-GTP with high specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aktories et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sekine et al., 1989</xref>). 1 mg/ml of the constitutively active form of human recombinant RhoA protein (Q63L; Cytoskeleton Inc.) was injected at either early cycle-13 interphase or early cellularization. RhoA(Q63L) has a glutamine-to-leucine substitution at residue 63, preventing GTP hydrolysis, and maintains the protein in the active GTP-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gallo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sisson et al., 2000</xref>), DMSO injection alone caused nuclei to move slightly away from the embryo cortex, but it had little effect on membrane and actin dynamics at the furrow.</p></sec><sec><title>Confocal microscopy, image quantifications, and statistics</title><p>Confocal microscope images were captured on an inverted photoscope (DMIRB; Leitz) equipped with a laser confocal imaging system (TCS SP2; Leica) using an HCX PL APO 1.4 NA 63&#x000d7; oil objective (Leica) at room temperature. Except in FRAP experiments, ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) was used to quantify the confocal images. For LatA injection experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), fluorescence intensities of GFP-Moesin and Rhodamine-actin at the furrows were subtracted from the background intensities measured from the nucleus regions. At least eight furrows and eight nuclear regions were analyzed in each embryo. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 G</xref>, based on the furrow morphology, embryos were classified into different groups: weak furrow (&#x0003e;10% of the furrows within an embryo showing uneven F-actin distribution), very weak furrow (&#x0003e;10% of the furrows within an embryo showing very uneven F-actin distribution), with breaks in furrow (&#x0003e;5% of the furrows within an embryo are broken), and normal furrow morphology. Student's <italic>t</italic> test (two-tailed, equal variance) was performed to analyze the data for furrow invagination, furrow-break index, and spindle-fusion index. Error bars represent the SEM from at least three independent experiments. For videos, image series collected over time were cropped in ImageReady (v9.0; Adobe) and converted to QuickTime (Apple) videos using PNG lossless compression.</p></sec><sec><title>FRAP analysis</title><p>Imaging was controlled by the Leica Confocal Software Microlab. After five prebleach scans of an entire image, 10 bleaching scans (0.7 s each) with 100% intensity of 488 nm (for GFP-Moesin) or 100% intensity of 488 and 543 nm (for Rhodamine-labeled actin) over the region of interest (10 &#x000d7; 10 &#x003bc;m) were performed. After photobleaching, the fluorescence recovery was monitored 10 times every 0.7 s and 60 times every 2 s. The recovery of fluorescence intensities, specifically at the furrow regions, was measured with Microlab. This software only measures a fixed x-y region. Thus, in a few cases where furrow structures showed slight drifts during fluorescence recovery, the FRAP image series were quantified using ImageJ software. The intensity of the bleached furrow area was normalized to the background nonbleached area. Recovery percentage was calculated as the final plateau intensity (I<sub>F</sub>) minus the first intensity after photobleaching (I<sub>0</sub>) all divided by the difference between prebleach (I<sub>I</sub>) and postbleach (I<sub>0</sub>) intensities ([I<sub>F</sub> &#x02212; I<sub>0</sub>]/[I<sub>I</sub> &#x02212; I<sub>0</sub>]). The fluorescence intensity of each time-point (I<sub>t</sub>) was transformed into a 0&#x02013;1 scale calculated by [I<sub>t</sub> &#x02212; I<sub>0</sub>]/[I<sub>I</sub> &#x02212; I<sub>0</sub>]). The values of relative intensities versus time were plotted using Excel (2004; Microsoft), and the recovery t<sub>1/2</sub> was measured from the plots.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows that GFP-Moesin marks F-actin cap and furrow.
