The most common histological subtypes of sporadic kidney tumors are clear cell RCC (CC-RCC) and papillary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Tumorigenesis of CC-RCC is frequently associated with loss and/or alteration of the short arm of chromosome 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. At least two tumor suppressors are localized on 3p21-3p25, the <italic>von Hippel-Lindau </italic>(<italic>VHL</italic>) and the RAS association domain family 1A (<italic>RASSF1A</italic>) genes, both found to be altered in sporadic RCC. Chromosomal alterations, point mutations and epigenetic silencing have been described to affect VHL function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], while <italic>RASSF1A </italic>has frequently been detected to undergo promoter hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing in CC-RCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>RASSF1A is functionally involved in cell cycle control, microtubule stabilization, cellular adhesion and motility as well as apoptosis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). Therefore, depletion of RASSF1A is associated with accelerated mitotic progression and an increased risk for chromosomal defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], enhanced cellular motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and with increased tumor susceptibility in knock-out mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The multifaceted function of RASSF1A as well as its frequently detected epigenetic silencing suggests an essential role in carcinogenesis. Therefore, findings regarding <italic>RASSF1A </italic>methylation in histopathologically normal kidney tissue isolated adjacent to tumor tissue or from autopsy samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] might be indicative for an involvement of <italic>RASSF1A </italic>in the early tumorigenesis of CC-RCC. On the other hand, significant methylation in normal tissue has not been described in other reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and a quantitative study questions that significant differences in <italic>RASSF1A </italic>methylation can be found comparing methylation levels in CC-RCC and corresponding normal tissue samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The detection of a methylation frequency in tumor tissue matching that in normal tissue would indicate that <italic>RASSF1A </italic>methylation in kidney is more likely to be independent from CC-RCC tumorigenesis. Conversely, if methylation could be found in normal tissue, which expands following tumor development, a role of <italic>RASSF1A </italic>in early tumorigenesis is implied. Thus, both quality and quantitative extent of methylation in histopathologically normal and tumoral tissue of tumor-bearing kidney requires systematic analysis to demonstrate whether significant methylation can be found in normal cells and a substantially increased methylation can be detected within neoplastic cells. Moreover, considering that so far the presence of RASSF1A protein has been analyzed solely in fully transformed or embryonic cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], it is an important issue to examine whether methylation levels can be correlated to a corresponding expression of RASSF1A in normal and tumor tissues.</p><p>In the present study, we have quantitatively measured promoter methylation of the <italic>RASSF1A </italic>gene in paired samples of CC-RCC and corresponding normal renal tissue. Furthermore, the presence of RASSF1A protein in tumors and histopathologically normal parenchyma was analyzed using tissue arrays and immunohistochemistry. Methylation was found to be significantly increased within tumor cells of tissue pairs analyzed. Correspondingly, almost complete loss of RASSF1A expression was observed in tumor cells, while normal tubular epithelial cells largely demonstrated strong immunopositivity. However, a subgroup of tissues exhibited a heterogeneous expression pattern including partial loss of RASSF1A protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Quantitation of RASSF1A methylation in paired tumoral and normal tissue samples</title><p>Methylation was first quantitatively analyzed in tumor vs. paired normal tissue from each individual patient using COBRA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Analyzed promoter region of the <italic>RASSF1A </italic>gene</bold>.

This corresponds with a lack of <italic>RASSF1A </italic>promoter methylation as detected by COBRA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). Moreover, immunopositivity can be specifically blocked by the peptide used for immunization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a[ii]</xref>).

Faint nuclear positivity, appears as heterogeneous pattern in antibody incubations of HEK293 independently of the presence of a blocking peptide, suggesting a residual unspecific nuclear binding of the polyclonal antibody.

However, discordant results were reported for <italic>RASSF1A </italic>promoter methylation occurring in tumor-surrounding, i.e. histopathologically tumor-free renal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Moreover, a quantitative study found no difference between normal and tumoral tissue regarding the frequency of methylation or a normalized methylation index of both tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, as long as a significant increase of tumor-dependent <italic>RASSF1A </italic>methylation cannot be shown in CC-RCC, it seems debatable whether <italic>RASSF1A </italic>substantially contributes to RCC tumorigenesis.</p><p>Our study is the first to specifically address the comparison of <italic>RASSF1A </italic>methylation levels detectable in paired samples of normal and tumor tissue. Our quantitative methylation analysis focused CpG sites localized directly adjacent to the start of <italic>RASSF1A </italic>transcription, a promoter region that has been described to cause gene silencing of <italic>RASSF1A </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The results of our quantitative data clearly show that the degree of relative methylation is significantly increased within tumor tissue of individual tissue pairs. However, a single tissue pair out of 45 demonstrated a 7% decrease of relative methylation in the tumor sample which we hypothetically explain by tissue heterogeneity due to the presence of undetected fibroblasts or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.</p><p>Increased methylation as detected in most tumors can be explained by a higher proportion of low grade methylation, an increased number of highly methylated promoters or a combination of both effects. According to our bisulfite sequencing analysis of both an individual tissue pair and the tumor and normal groups as a whole, the higher degree of relative methylation observed in tumors can be attributed clearly to a higher proportion of densely methylated sequences present in tumors. Although the absolute numbers for the relative degree of methylation determined by COBRA and calculated on the basis of bisulfite sequencing slightly differ, a nearly identical ratio of methylation in tumor vs. normal tissue samples was obtained for both methods. Thus, the results of our comparative methylation analysis demonstrate a statistically significant expansion of <italic>RASSF1A </italic>promoter methylation in the course of RCC development.</p><p>However, our sequencing analyses also demonstrated that dense methylation, though detected more frequently in tumor cells, is also sporadically observed in normal tissue thereby confirming results described in some of the earlier analyses of <italic>RASSF1A </italic>methylation in kidney tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Moreover, methylation data obtained for tumors and normal tissue overall matches the results of our expression analysis. Accordingly, expression analysis demonstrated strong signals for RASSF1A protein in the control cell line as well as in the cytoplasm of most of the normal tubular cells. In contrast, a significant loss of protein was detected within most cells of tumor tissue. Thus, protein levels detected immunohistochemically in a large part of tumors are in concordance with a gene silencing of <italic>RASSF1A </italic>in RCC as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Most interestingly, we also observed in normal tissue samples a partial loss of signals for RASSF1A protein, appearing as a heterogeneous staining pattern, which is in line with the detection of a subgroup of densely methylated promoter sequences in normal tissue. Similar findings have been described for methylation and expression of the <italic>MLH1 </italic>and <italic>p14 </italic>genes and were designated as "epigenetic mosaicism" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>It has been described that RASSF1A translocates during mitosis and reorganization of microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], thus leading to a loss of cytoplasmic signals. However, apparent mitotic activity was not detected in these cells, neither in extent nor in frequency explaining the observed expression patterns.</p><p>We therefore conclude that the sporadic hypermethylation observed in normal tissue corresponds to a partial loss of RASSF1A expression in normal tubular epithelium of the kidney leading to epigenetic mosaicism of <italic>RASSF1A </italic>as a possible premalignant event in CC-RCC tumorigenesis. To characterize the role of <italic>RASSF1A </italic>in early tumorigenesis of the kidney further functional studies are required.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our methylation and expression analyses of RASSF1A support the hypothesis that infrequent hypermethylation of the <italic>RASSF1A </italic>promoter in normal cells precedes the formation of tumor cells, thus explaining the more frequently detected hypermethylation found in most CC-RCCs. The partial loss of RASS1A expression driven by hypermethylation of the gene promoter could be a premalignant event in early tumorigenesis in the kidney.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue samples and DNA extraction</title><p>Paired tumoral and normal specimens were prepared from 45 primary clear cell RCCs after nephrectomy (table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> for patient characteristics).

The relative degree of methylation in each sample was calculated by dividing the sum of methylated signals by the sum of all signals. To demonstrate that COBRA can be applied for determination of the relative degree of <italic>RASSF1A </italic>promoter methylation, defined mixtures of corresponding plasmid DNA and of DNA isolated from HEK293 and CaSki cell lines were measured. The relative degree of methylation measured by COBRA was then compared to the known input ratio of methylated and unmethylated sequences. Linearity was observed for almost two orders of magnitude, both for the plasmid and cell line controls. Using the threefold standard deviation of signals obtained from multiple negative controls, the analytical sensitivity of COBRA could be calculated to be 2.75% relative methylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Bisulfite sequencing</title><p>For sequence analysis amplicons were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vectors (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and sequenced using SP6 primer, BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit on an ABI 3100 Avant automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocols or by custom sequence analysis (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany).

For detection of RASSF1A protein an affinity purified goat polyclonal antibody (RASF1-N15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) and a mouse monoclonal antibody (Anti-human RASSF1A mAb, clone 3F3, Acris, Germany) were applied. RASF1-N15 specifically detects the N-terminus of RASSF1 isoforms A, D, F, G. However, the major transcripts are represented by isoforms A and C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], whereas other isoforms seem to be expressed rarely in a tissue-specific manner such as RASSF1D and E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].
