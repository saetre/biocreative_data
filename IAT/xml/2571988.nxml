In some experiments, DCs were infected with R5-HIV-1<sub>BaL</sub> or X4-HIV-1<sub>NDK</sub>, and viral replication, proviral HIV-DNA and the frequency of infected DCs were measured. Autologous NK cells were sorted and either kept unstimulated in the presence of suboptimal concentration of IL-2, or activated by a combination of PHA and IL-2. The impact of 24 h NK-DC cross-talk on the fate of HIV-1-infected DCs was analyzed. We report that activated NK cells were required for the induction of maturation of DCs, whether uninfected or HIV-1-infected, and this process involved HMGB1. However, the cross-talk between HIV-1-infected DCs and activated NK cells was functionally defective, as demonstrated by the strong impairment of DCs to induce Th1 polarization of na&#x000ef;ve CD4 T cells. This was associated with the defective production of IL-12 and IL-18 by infected DCs. Moreover, the crosstalk between activated NK cells and HIV-infected DCs resulted in a dramatic increase in viral replication and proviral DNA expression in DCs. HMGB1, produced both by NK cells and DCs, was found to play a pivotal role in this process, and inhibition of HMGB1 activity by glycyrrhizin, known to bind specifically to HMGB1, or blocking anti-HMGB1 antibodies, abrogated NK-dependent HIV-1 replication in DCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These observations provide evidence for the crucial role of NK-DC cross-talk in promoting viral dissemination, and challenge the question of the <italic>in vivo</italic> involvement of HMGB1 in the triggering of HIV-1 replication and replenishment of viral reservoirs in AIDS.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Early stages of HIV-1 infection are associated with local recruitment and activation of important effectors of innate immunity, NK cells and DCs.

We investigated the role of NK-DC cross-talk on maturation, function, and susceptibility to viral replication of HIV-1-infected iDCs. We discovered that maturation of HIV-1-infected DCs could be triggered by activated NK cells, but it was associated with a strong impairment of mature infected DCs to induce Th1 polarization following their cross-talk with NK cells. In addition, the cross-talk between NK cells and HIV-1-infected iDCs resulted in a dramatic increase in viral replication and proviral DNA expression in DCs. This process was mainly triggered by HMGB1, released both by NK cells and DCs, as a consequence of NK-DC cross-talk. This study provides new insights into how HIV &#x02018;hijacks&#x02019; DCs to promote efficiently viral dissemination.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Activated NK cells induce the maturation of autologous primary immature dendritic cells infected with HIV-1</title><p>To investigate the role of NK cells on DC maturation, we generated monocyte-derived DCs from isolated monocytes and cocultured them with NK cells purified from the same donor.

Indeed, while spontaneous maturation of iDCs was observed after 48 h of culture in medium, as shown by the high percentage of CD86<sup>bright</sup> HLA-DR<sup>bright</sup> DCs, 10 &#x000b5;g/ml rh-HMGB1 only weakly increased from 65&#x00025; to 71&#x00025; the percentage of these cells. Interestingly, rh-HMGB1-treated DCs were not fully mature, as assessed by the lack of expression of CD80, CD83 and the weak expression of DC-lamp, all fully expressed in mDC (DC0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003601-g003"><bold>Fig. 3b</bold></xref>). However, these partially mature DCs were functionally susceptible to rh-HMGB1 as shown by the increased release of the chemokines, MCP1, MIP-1&#x003b1;, MIP-1&#x003b2; and IL-8 by hr-HMGB1-treated DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003601-g003"><bold>Fig. 3c</bold></xref>).

Following incubation of iDCs with 1 &#x000b5;g/ml of HMGB1, down-regulation of RAGE was observed, strongly suggesting that this receptor was used by these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003601-g003"><bold>Fig. 3d</bold></xref>). Following DC infection with HIV-1<sub>BaL</sub>, no change in RAGE levels was detected on iDC and DC0. Incubation of infected DCs with HMGB1 induced similar down-regulation of RAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003601-g003"><bold>Fig. 3d</bold></xref>). The possible involvement of RAGE during NK-DC cross-talk was evaluated with the same approach, comparing RAGE expression on DCs cocultured with aNK cells and DC cultured alone. After 2 h of coculture with aNK cells, DCs showed an up-regulation of RAGE expression, followed by a down-regulation at 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003601-g003"><bold>Fig. 3e</bold></xref>). Very similar observations were made with HIV-1-infected DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003601-g003"><bold>Fig. 3e</bold></xref>). Thus, HMGB1 is an important factor for the maturation of both uninfected and HIV-1-infected iDCs during NK-DC cross talk, and it involves RAGE, whose expression on iDC is not altered following their productive infection.</p><fig id="pone-0003601-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003601.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>aNK-dependent maturation of HIV-1-infected iDCs is mediated by HMGB1 and involoves RAGE.</title><p>(a) Left panel: iDCs were cultured for 24 h either alone or with aNK cells, in the presence of blocking anti-HMGB1 antibodies (10 &#x000b5;g/ml) or glycyrrhizin (10 &#x000b5;g/ml).

Coculture of na&#x000ef;ve T cells with iDCs did not increase the proportion of IFN-&#x003b3; positive T cells, and similar data were obtained in coculture of na&#x000ef;ve T cells with iDCs and rNK cells. In contrast, cocultures of na&#x000ef;ve T cells with iDC in the presence of aNK cells induced a significant increase of IFN-&#x003b3; T cell response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003601-g004"><bold>Fig. 4b</bold></xref>), suggesting that aNK&#x02236;iDC cross-talk is essential for Th1 polarization. When the same experiment was performed with HIV-1<sub>BaL</sub>-infected DC, no Th1 polarization was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003601-g004"><bold>Fig. 4c</bold></xref>). The contribution of HIV-1 replication to the inhibition of Th1 polarization was shown by the addition of AZT, which restored the increased IFN-&#x003b3; T cell response induced by infected DCs cocultured with aNK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003601-g004"><bold>Fig. 4d</bold></xref>). We used AZT at a concentration inhibiting viral replication in these conditions, as assessed by the dosage of p24 antigen in the supernatants (data not shown). IL-12 and IL-18 are critical cytokines produced by DCs and involved in Th1 polarization. We therefore addressed the question of the impact of aNK-DC cross-talk on the release of these cytokines by DCs. We found that aNK-DC cross talk triggers both IL-12 and IL-18 secretion by non infected DCs. Importantly, the production of both cytokines was not detected anymore in cocultures of aNK cells and infected DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003601-g004"><bold>Fig. 4e, f</bold></xref>). In addition, the triggering of IFN-&#x003b3; production by NK cells during aNK-DC cross talk was not detected anymore when the coculture was performed with HIV-1 infected DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003601-g004"><bold>Fig. 4g</bold></xref>). Thus, the priming of DCs for Th1 polarization occurs during aNK-iDC cross-talk, though the induction of cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-18 released by DCs, and IFN-&#x003b3; released by NK cells. Following their infection with HIV-1, iDCs cannot be polarized anymore by aNK cells, due to a defective NK-DC cross-talk. Consequently HIV-1 infected DCs are impaired in their capacity to induce Th1 polarization.</p><fig id="pone-0003601-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003601.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Impairment of NK-triggered Th1 polarization by DCs following HIV-1 infection is associated to altered IL-12 and IL-18 production.</title><p>(a) Th1 polarization by DCs triggered by NK cells was tested by incubating iDC (10<sup>6</sup>/ml) for 30 mn in the presence of rNK or aNK cells (2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup>/ml).

An extremely high level of HMGB1 was detected when iDCs where put in contact with aNK cells, similar to the one released by mature DCs. Interestingly, confocal microscopy analysis of NK-DC conjugates showed that both cells expressed the cytokine. HMGB1 receptor, RAGE, was found rapidly induced following DC interaction with aNK cells, and was further down-regulated, compatible with the implication of HMGB1 in NK-dependent DC maturation. In addition to contributing to DC maturation, HMGB1 has been shown to act as a chemoattractant on iDCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003601-Yang1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, and to be also required for migration of mature DCs in response to CCR7 and CCR4 ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003601-Dumitriu1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, both activities being mediated by RAGE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003601-Yang1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003601-Dumitriu1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

These properties of HMGB1 have to be taken into consideration in the context of an uncontrolled viral infection, such as that induced by HIV.</p><p>Productive infection of iDCs with R5 or X4 strains of HIV-1 preserved NK-dependent phenotypic DC maturation, as shown by the frequency of CD86<sup>bright</sup>HLA-DR<sup>bright</sup> DCs, while HIV itself didn't induce DC maturation in the range of p24 concentrations used (0.001 to 10 ng/ml). However, the consequence of aNK-DC interaction was a significant enhancement of HIV-1 infection in iDCs. This was shown by several means, indicating an increased frequency of p24<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC, associated with a significant enhancement of p24 release in NK-DC culture supernatant, and this was confirmed by immunofluorescence at the single cell level. Moreover, NK-DC cross-talk resulted in a dramatic increase in HIV-1 DNA expression in DCs. Considering the crucial role of HMGB1 during the reciprocal activation of DCs and NK cells, we evaluated its contribution to the triggering of HIV-1 replication in iDCs with blocking anti-HMGB1 antibodies or glycyrrhizin. The strong blocking effect of these inhibitors on p24 release indicates the involvement of HMGB1 in the process. It is noteworthy that both inhibitors also decreased significantly HIV-1 replication in 24 h cultures of infected iDCs, in the absence of NK cells. This is likely due to the spontaneous release of HMGB1 by iDC, shown here and previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003601-Dumitriu1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, which was preserved following their infection with HIV-1.

As a corollary, we demonstrated that rh-HMGB1 significantly increased p24 release in culture supernatants of infected DCs and of aNK-infected DC cocultures. These data may have important implications in the understanding of HIV pathogenesis, since plasma HMGB1 levels were found elevated in chronically HIV-1-infected patients, with the highest concentrations in patients with clinical complications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003601-Nowak2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recent studies highlighted the essential role of NK cells in the modulation of Th1 polarization, suggesting that they trigger IL-12 and IL-18 release by DCs, promoting the production of IFN-&#x003b3; by NK cells that in turn trigger the differentiation of T cells towards Th1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003601-Fehniger1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003601-Agaugue1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. The essential role of IL-12 and IL-18 on Th1 differentiation is confirmed here, since the defect of HIV-1 infected DCs to produce increased amount of IL-12 and IL-18 in response to NK cell activation was associated with a defective Th1 polarization. This defect was directly linked to HIV-1 replication in DCs, as shown by the positive effect of the HIV inhibitor AZT. These observations suggest that some of the functional alterations reported in DCs from HIV-infected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003601-Donaghy1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003601-SmedSorensen1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, such as a decreased secretion of several cytokines, including IL-12, and an impaired ability to prime autologous CD4 T cells, may be linked to a defective NK-DC cross-talk, as suggested recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003601-Mavilio1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Alteration of NK&#x02236;DC cross may also lead to a defect in NK-cell elimination of iDCs, as reported in chronically HIV-infected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003601-Mavilio1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> and associated with the resistance of HIV-infected DCs to apoptosis induced by NK cells (Melki MT, Sa&#x000ef;di H, Gougeon ML, submitted to publication).</p><p>In summary, we have shown that activation of HIV-1 replication and the possible establishment of viral reservoirs in HIV-1-infected DCs is dependent on a cross-talk between aNK cells and autologous DCs. We have identified the pivotal role of HMGB1 in this process, produced both by NK cells and DCs during their cross-talk, and showed that NK-dependent triggering of HIV replication in DCs is completely abrogated by Glycyrrhizin, which binds specifically to HMGB1, or blocking anti-HMGB1 antibodies. In addition, our data indicate a strong impairment of HIV-1-infected DCs to induce Th1 polarization following their cross-talk with NK cells. These observations provide evidence of the crucial role of NK-DC cross-talk in promoting viral dissemination, and challenges the question of the <italic>in vivo</italic> involvement of HMGB1 in the triggering of viral replication and replenishment of viral reservoirs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Isolation and separation of primary cells</title><p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated from the blood of healthy donors on a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient.
