Both single-stranded and duplex DNA are hydrolyzed by this enzyme in a quasi-processive manner. This is indicated by the results of polymer-challenge experiments utilizing product analysis techniques. Due to the quasi-processive mode of hydrolysis, the kinetics of label release from the 3'-terminally labeled oligonucleotide substrates, annealed to complementary homopolymers, show an initial high rate of hydrolysis. In the case of both single-stranded and duplex DNA substrates, hydrolysis seems to continue, at best, up to the point where the enzyme is five or six nucleotides away from the 5-end. The enzyme carries out mismatch repair, as evidenced by experiments with primer molecules containing improper base residues at the 3'-OH terminus. Control experiments with complementary base residues at the 3'-end indicate that extensive removal of terminal residue takes place in the presence of dNTP's only when such residues are "improper" in the Watson-Crick sense.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00420-0238.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="657"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00420-0239.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="658"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00420-0240.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="659"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00420-0241.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="660"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00420-0242.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="661"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00420-0243.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="662"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00420-0244.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="663"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00420-0245.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="664"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00420-0246.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="665"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00420-0247.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="666"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00420-0248.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="667"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00420-0249.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="668"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00420-0250.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="669"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00420-0251.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="670"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00420-0252.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="671"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
