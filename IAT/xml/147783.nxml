In addition, studies suggest that YY1 may play an important role in development and differentiation. Here, we report the isolation and analysis of a YY1 genomic clone from a lambda human liver library. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with the YY1 clone has localized the YY1 gene to chromosome 14 band q32. A major YY1 gene transcription initiation site has been mapped to 478 bp upstream of the ATG translation start site. The proximal promoter contains multiple Sp1 transcription factor binding sites but lacks a consensus TATA or CCAAT box. Transient transfections and detailed deletion analyses localized the promoter to no more than 277 bp upstream from the major transcription start site. Finally, we have found that overexpression of the adenovirus E1A protein represses expression of a reporter gene directed by the YY1 promoter.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
