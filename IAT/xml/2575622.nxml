Nephritis is a common and serious manifestation of SLE. More than one-half of all SLE patients develop nephritis during their course of illness, and 10% to 25% of these patients progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) despite immunosuppressive treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A central pathogenic aspect of lupus nephritis is the deposition of immune complexes within glomeruli and tubules. Subsequent inflammatory processes involving complement activation, macrophage recruitment, and generation of reactive oxygen species cause glomerular damage, increased glomerular permeability, and proteinuria. Sustained glomerular and interstitial inflammation stimulates fibrogenesis, eventually leading to renal scarring and compromised renal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Metallothioneins (MTs) are nonenzymatic polypeptides of 6 to 7 kDa that bind heavy metals with high affinity and possess a range of anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Due to a high content of cysteines, MTs are potent antioxidants and provide protection against reactive oxygen species-induced cellular damage during experimental inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, MTs have been shown to reduce inflammation through interference with activation of cytotoxic T cells and B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Four major MT subfamilies exist in mammals (MT-I, MT-II, MT-III, and MT-IV). Human kidneys express MT-I and MT-II, which have been described as intracellular proteins of proximal tubular cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis involves an altered pattern of renal MT-I+II expression. To our knowledge, this question has not been addressed before. We demonstrate that lupus nephritis is associated with significant alterations in the tubular MT-I+II expression profile. Furthermore, our data indicate that important prognostic information can be deduced from the renal MT-I+II expression pattern in patients with lupus nephritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patients and biopsy specimens</title><p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded renal biopsies were obtained from patients of a previously described historic lupus nephritis cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. All patients were diagnosed with lupus nephritis during the period 1975 to 1995 and met the classification criteria of SLE defined by the American College of Rheumatology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Tissue suitable for experimental immunohistochemistry could be retrieved for 37 patients. These biopsies were kindly made available from the Departments of Pathology at Odense University Hospital, Denmark, at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, at Herlev University Hospital, Denmark, and at The National University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. All biopsies had been taken for diagnostic purposes, and no patients had previously been diagnosed with lupus nephritis. Samples of normal kidney tissue obtained from four patients with renal cell carcinoma served as control specimens. In addition, renal biopsies from five patients suffering from antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated systemic vasculitis (AASV) with glomerulonephritis were retrieved (two patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, three patients with microscopic polyangiitis).</p><p>The following data were registered at the time of biopsy for all SLE patients: sex, age at time of biopsy, age at time of SLE diagnosis, date of first renal biopsy, date of onset of nephritis symptoms (defined as the date of the first observation of persistent proteinuria (&#x0003e; 0.5 g/day), hematuria, and/or cellular casts), serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, serum albumin, blood pressure, level of 24-hour urinary protein excretion, a clinical disease activity score (representing a modified version of the European Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], using only the clinical components with unchanged scoring weights), and a urinary sediment analysis. The urinary sediment was considered indicative of active renal disease if analysis showed cellular or granular casts or &#x0003e; 5 erythrocytes per high-power field. Treatment with cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and high-dose cortico steroids was recorded. The time from kidney biopsy to development of ESRD (defined as the need for chronic dialysis or renal transplantation) was known in all cases. The study baseline was defined as the date of first renal biopsy. Patients were followed until death or until the end of 1995. No patients were lost to follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Standard histopathological analyses</title><p>All SLE biopsies were examined (by HS) and classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification criteria for lupus nephritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Activity index scores and chronicity index scores were calculated using the scoring system developed by the US National Institutes of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. According to this system, active glomerular lesions include cellular proliferation, fibrinoid necrosis/karyorrhexis, cellular crescents, hyaline thrombi/wire loops, and leukocyte infiltration &#x02013; while mononuclear cell infiltration is considered an active tubulointerstitial abnormality. Chronic glomerular lesions encompass glomerular sclerosis and fibrous crescents, while chronic tubulointerstitial changes include interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Each variable is scored from zero to three, weighting fibrinoid necrosis/karyorrhexis and cellular crescents by a factor of two. The biopsies were evaluated without knowledge of clinical data.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Paraffin-embedded renal biopsies were cut into 5 &#x003bc;m-thick sections and were processed for immunohistochemistry as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In brief, sections were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with rabbit anti-MT-I+II, diluted 1:500 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The primary antibody was detected using biotinylated mouse antirabbit IgG (1:400, code B3275; Sigma-Aldrich, Copenhagen, Denmark), followed by streptavidin&#x02013;biotin&#x02013;peroxidase complex (StreptABComplex/HRP, code K377; Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) prepared according to the manufacturer's recommended dilution. These secondary and tertiary steps were performed at room temperature for 30 minutes. The immunoreaction was visualized using 0.015% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in 3.3-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride (DAB)/Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 0.05 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4) for 10 minutes at room temperature. To evaluate the extent of nonspecific binding in the immunohistochemical experiments, control sections were incubated in the absence of primary antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of immunohistochemically stained slides</title><p>To obtain an overall impression of the MT-I+II expression patterns, anti-MT-I+II-stained sections were first screened by two investigators (MF and MP). In the healthy kidney specimens, a strong MT-I+II staining reaction was observed in the cytoplasm of proximal tubular cells. Furthermore, cytoplasmic MT-I+II staining was seen in the epithelial cells of some collecting tubules as described below. In the lupus nephritis specimens, MT-I+II staining was also found in the proximal renal tubules. In a large proportion of these specimens, however, some proximal tubules displayed intense luminal MT-I+II reactivity in combination with absent or significantly reduced epithelial cell staining. The number of cross-sectioned proximal tubules displaying the latter pattern of anti-MT-I+II reactivity was determined in a sequence of 3 to 60 consecutive high power fields (40&#x000d7; magnification), depending on the size of the individual biopsy. The only field adjustments were made to avoid large vessels and glomeruli.</p><p>For semiquantitative analyses, each cross-sectioned proximal tubule displaying significant luminal MT-I+II reactivity in combination with reduced/absent staining of the lining epithelial cells was scored one, while cross-sectioned proximal tubules in which the MT-I+II staining was observed exclusively/predominantly in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells were scored zero. As a conservative approach, tubules that did not clearly display one of these morphologies were also scored zero. The tubular MT score of the individual biopsy specimens was defined as the median score obtained according to this scoring system per visual field at 40&#x000d7; magnification.</p><p>Most of the lupus nephritis biopsies consisted mainly of cortical renal tissue. Consequently, the MT-I+II expression in collecting tubules could not be systematically examined in these specimens. In all biopsies, glomerular cross-sections were also evaluated for MT-I+II reactivity, and the median number of MT-I+II-positive cells was determined.</p><p>All biopsies were scored by the same investigator (MF) and were analyzed without knowledge of clinical or standard histopathological data. The scorings were subsequently validated by another investigator (CBA).</p></sec><sec><title>Visualization</title><p>Sections were examined on an Axioplan plus light microscope (Zeiss, G&#x000f6;ttingen, Germany).

The equality of cumulative incidence curves was tested by the log-rank test. Event rates were related to the total number of person-years of observation, and rate ratios of event rates were calculated in stratified analyses. Comparison of continuous data was performed using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney rank-sum test. Spearman's rank correlation test was used in correlation studies.</p><p>In all analyses, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant.

Twenty-two patients (59%) received treatment with cyclophosphamide during their course of illness, a similar number (59%) of patients were treated with azathioprine, and five (13%) patients were subjected to treatment with high-dose corticosteroids only. In all cases, immunosuppressive treatment was started or intensified within 1 month following renal biopsy, and no patients received intensive immunosuppressive treatment before renal biopsy was performed.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical data of 37 patients with lupus nephritis at the time of first renal biopsy</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left">Number of patients</td><td align="left">Median</td><td align="left">Lower quartile</td><td align="left">Upper quartile</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Age (years)</td><td align="left">37</td><td align="left">29.6</td><td align="left">19.6</td><td align="left">46.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Duration of systemic lupus erythematosus before biopsy (years)</td><td align="left">37</td><td align="left">0.4</td><td align="left">0.0</td><td align="left">7.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Duration of follow-up (years)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="left">37</td><td align="left">5.0</td><td align="left">1.1</td><td align="left">8.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Creatinine clearance (% of expected)</td><td align="left">37</td><td align="left">77</td><td align="left">60</td><td align="left">100</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Serum albumin (&#x003bc;mol/l)</td><td align="left">37</td><td align="left">411</td><td align="left">304</td><td align="left">498</td></tr><tr><td align="left">24-hour urinary protein excretion (g)</td><td align="left">37</td><td align="left">4.9</td><td align="left">2.1</td><td align="left">15.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)</td><td align="left">36</td><td align="left">130</td><td align="left">116</td><td align="left">160</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)</td><td align="left">36</td><td align="left">90</td><td align="left">71</td><td align="left">90</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Duration of follow-up after first renal biopsy.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Four patients (11%) presented with WHO class II glomerulonephritis, three patients (8%) with WHO class III glomerulonephritis, 27 patients (73%) displayed WHO class IV histopathology, and three patients were diagnosed with WHO class V glomerulonephritis (8%).

As a novel finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], we detected significant epithelial cell MT-I+II staining in the collecting tubules of these specimens (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). The MT-I+II staining observed in collecting tubules was frequently weaker than the staining reaction observed in proximal tubules, and some cross-sectioned collecting tubules were MT-I+II-negative. Moreover, while the epithelial cells of some collecting tubules displayed a homogeneous cytoplasmic MT-I+II staining reaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>), the MT-I+II staining observed in other collecting tubules was confined to the cytoplasm adjacent to the luminal membrane (data not shown). Glomeruli and other segments of the nephron were consistently MT-I+II-negative.

In the remaining lupus nephritis biopsies, we noted the presence of proximal tubules displaying low to absent epithelial MT-I+II staining in combination with strong staining of the tubular lumen.

This analysis showed that patients presenting with a tubular MT score of zero had a significantly lower median creatinine clearance than the rest of the patients. To further analyze the association between the tubular MT score and the creatinine clearance, we examined whether these variables were correlated to each other in the lupus cohort other using Spearman's rank correlation test.

Exposure to high protein concentrations stimulates proximal tubular cells to secrete proinflammatory mediators, including monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], regulation upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], IL-8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], complement factor C3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and transforming growth factor beta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. During lupus nephritis, proximal tubules have been shown to alter their expression of several molecules involved in inflammatory processes, including intracellular adhesion molecule 1, CD40, and Toll-like receptor 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrate that proximal tubules exposed to the inflammatory and proteinuric conditions associated with lupus nephritis also display a significantly altered expression pattern of MT-I+II. By immunohistochemical analyses, we noted a relatively high frequency of cross-sectioned proximal tubules showing luminal MT-I+II expression with concomitant epithelial cell MT-I+II depletion in kidney biopsies from lupus nephritis patients. Similar changes in renal MT-I+II expression were not observed in biopsies of healthy renal tissue. Importantly, the tubular MT score, reflecting the incidence of proximal tubules displaying these changes in MT-I+II expression, was positively correlated to the creatinine clearance in the SLE cohort, and lupus patients with a tubular MT score of zero presented with a significantly lower median creatinine clearance than the rest of the patients. Moreover, a tubular MT score &#x0003c; 1.0 was identified as a strong predictor of ESRD in renal survival analyses. A low tubular MT score was therefore associated with impaired renal function at the time of first kidney biopsy and with an increased risk of a poor renal outcome in the present SLE cohort, indicating that renal MTs exert important renoprotective functions in the lumen of proximal tubules during lupus nephritis.</p><p>The present study was based on a historic cohort of patients and has several limitations. Due to the retrospective nature of the investigations, we were unable to obtain patient material such as serum, urine, or additional renal tissue for further experimental analyses. We were therefore prevented from investigating whether the tubular MT score was correlated to the level of urinary MT-I+II excretion or to the serum concentration of these MTs. Consequently, the present study does not elucidate whether the urinary MT concentration can be used as a biomarker for active nephritis in SLE patients in the same way as previously demonstrated for molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, P-selectin, soluble TNF receptor 1 and chemokine (C&#x02013;X&#x02013;C motif) ligand 16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, we were unable to investigate the origin of the MTs observed in the lumen of proximal tubules during lupus nephritis. In the examined nephritis specimens, luminal MT-I+II expression was consistently associated with MT-I+II depletion of the adjacent tubular epithelium, but not with enhanced MT-I+II expression in other nephron segments or in the renal interstitium. Moreover, light microscopic analyses suggested that MT-I+II are present in the lumen of proximal tubules as extracellular proteins. Together, these findings strongly indicate that the MTs observed in the lumen of proximal tubules were, at least in part, secreted from adjacent tubular cells and not simply derived from plasma via glomerular ultrafiltration. Further studies are needed, however, to determine whether proximal tubular cells secrete MT-I+II to the tubular lumen in the setting of lupus nephritis &#x02013; and, if so, to identify the stimuli that trigger the secretion.</p><p>Intriguingly, our analyses demonstrate that proximal tubules do not always display intraluminal MT-I+II immunostaining during lupus nephritis, suggesting that this alteration in renal MT distribution requires or can be blocked by as yet undefined stimuli. To this end, it could be hypothesized that proximal tubular cells secrete MTs in response to the presence of harmful substances delivered to the tubular lumen from the inflamed glomerulus, but that this secretion can be inhibited by other intracellular or extracellular signals associated with renal inflammation. Although the present study was not designed to investigate the extent to which similar changes in renal MT expression occur during other inflammatory nephropathies, our analyses indicate that the same morphological tubular alterations are seen in AASV glomerulonephritis. This observation suggests that the mechanisms responsible for inducing the observed alterations in the tubular MT expression profile are not specific for lupus nephritis, but are probably evoked by renal inflammation <italic>per se</italic>.</p><p>A range of histological features has been shown to influence the prognosis in lupus nephritis. Frequently reported histological predictors of a poor renal outcome include WHO class IV histopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], high activity index scores and chronicity index scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], high index scores for cellular crescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], glomerular sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], interstitial fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and tubular atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Thus, histological variables identified as risk factors of ESRD typically reflect either active inflammation or the late-stage, degenerative consequences of inflammation. Here, we provide evidence that the renal expression pattern of MT-I+II, i.e., proteins with potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, also carries prognostic information in lupus nephritis. The findings of our study add to the growing amount of experimental data suggesting that MT-I+II exert important functions not only as intracellular proteins, as previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], but also after secretion from MT-producing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, our study raises a number of new questions. Based on the known functional repertoire of MT-I+II, it is tempting to speculate that MT-I+II protect the proximal tubular epithelium from reactive oxygen species and other cytotoxic substances after secretion to the tubular lumen as outlined above. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these MTs provide renoprotection during lupus nephritis remain to be defined. It also remains to be clarified to what extent the observed changes in tubular MT-I+II expression are evoked in the setting of other inflammatory nephropathies. Finally, from a therapeutic perspective it would be of great interest to investigate whether treatment with exogenous MT-I+II could modify the course of lupus nephritis in animal models.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study provides the first description of renal MT-I+II expression during lupus nephritis.
