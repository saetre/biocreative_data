Proper development and maintenance of thymus architecture depend on signals generated by a sustained crosstalk between developing thymocytes and stromal elements. Any maturation impairment occurring in either cellular component leads to an aberrant thymic development. Gene expression occurring during T lymphocyte differentiation must be coordinated in a spatio-temporal fashion; one way in which this is achieved is through the regulation by cell-cell adhesion and interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>We examined the role played by Epithelial V-like Antigen 1 (EVA1), an Ig adhesion molecule expressed on thymus epithelial cells (TEC) and immature thymocytes, in T cell development by employing RNA interference <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models.

These results confirm that EVA1 is important for normal developmental processes.</p><p>Patterning of thymic epithelial compartment is defined by differential keratin (K) expression: in particular thymic cortex is characterized by the expression of K8 and K18, while thymic medulla expresses K5 and K14 isoforms. While initial patterning does not depend on inductive signals from haematopoietic cells, thymocyte derived signals are required during late phases of fetal thymus development to generate and sustain a normal thymic epithelial compartment in newborn and adult mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007586-Klug2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, haematoxylin and eosin analysis revealed that a significant amount of haematopoietic cells repopulated the thymus after transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007586-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).
