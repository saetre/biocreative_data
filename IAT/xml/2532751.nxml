Deamidated-isomerized molecules are both structurally and functionally altered. The enzyme isoaspartyl protein carboxyl-<italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase (PCMT; EC 2.1.1.77) has peculiar substrate specificity towards these deamidated proteins. It catalyzes methyl esterification of the free &#x003b1;-carboxyl group at the isoaspartyl site, thus initiating the repair of these abnormal proteins through the conversion of the isopeptide bond into a normal &#x003b1;-peptide bond. Deamidation occurs slowly during cellular and molecular aging, being accelerated by physical-chemical stresses brought to the living cells. Previous evidence supports a role of protein deamidation in the acquisition of susceptibility to apoptosis. Aim of this work was to shed a light on the role of PCMT in apoptosis clarifying the relevant mechanism(s).</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Endothelial cells transiently transfected with various constructs of <italic>PCMT</italic>, <italic>i.e.</italic> overexpressing wild type PCMT or negative dominants, were used to investigate the role of protein methylation during apoptosis induced by oxidative stress (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>; 0.1&#x02013;0.5 mM range). Results show that A) Cells overexpressing &#x0201c;wild type&#x0201d; human PCMT were resistant to apoptosis, whereas overexpression of antisense <italic>PCMT</italic> induces high sensitivity to apoptosis even at low H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. B) PCMT protective effect is specifically due to its methyltransferase activity rather than to any other non-enzymatic interactions. In fact negative dominants, overexpressing PCMT mutants devoid of catalytic activity do not prevent apoptosis. C) Cells transfected with antisense <italic>PCMT</italic>, or overexpressing a <italic>PCMT</italic> mutant, accumulate isoaspartyl-containing damaged proteins upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. Proteomics allowed the identification of proteins, which are both PCMT substrates and apoptosis effectors, whose deamidation occurs under oxidative stress conditions leading to programmed cell death. These proteins, including Hsp70, Hsp90, actin, and Bcl-xL, are recognized and methylated by PCMT, according to the general repair mechanism of this methyltransferase.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>Apoptosis can be modulated by &#x0201c;on/off&#x0201d; switch partitioning the amount of specific protein effectors, which are either in their active (native) or inactive (deamidated) molecular forms.

The deamidation mechanism entails the nucleophilic attack of the peptidyl nitrogen of the Asn&#x0002b;1 residue onto the &#x003b2;-carbonyl carbon of the Asn, leading to the formation of an aspartyl succinimidyl (ASU) intermediate, with the elimination of the ammonia moiety.

This enzyme, hence, promotes the conversion of the abnormal L-isoAsp residue into L-aspartyl, eliminating the isopeptide bond which alters protein conformation, thus preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional proteins. This methylation-dependent repair activity has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic>, with synthetic isoAsp-containing peptides as well as with deamidated purified proteins. Various <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies confirmed that a PCMT activity is related to the processing of deamidated-isomerized proteins. For example in the erythrocytes from patients with spherocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Ingrosso1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> or with a G6PD deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Ingrosso2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> the increase in membrane protein isomerization, associated with the disease, could be monitored <italic>ex vivo</italic> by an increase in methyl ester formation in the intact erythrocytes. On the other hand, in chronic renal failure, where PCMT is inhibited by the intracellular accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine, membrane proteins tend to accumulate isomerized aspartyls within the red cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Perna1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Further <italic>in vivo</italic> studies provided evidence on the role of this enzyme in preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful damaged proteins. In <italic>PCMT</italic> knockout mice isomerized proteins increased 4&#x02013;8 fold compared with the levels detected in the wild-type mice, and the knockout animals exhibited brain damage and fatal epileptic seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Kim1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A number of cell stress conditions have been linked to an increased propensity of proteins to undergo deamidation. Oxidative conditions have been considered as a way through which proteins become more susceptible to deamidation. The underlying mechanism is still unclear, although the evidence suggests that oxidative conditions may induce an increased flexibility of the polypeptide backbone or a transient unfolding of proteins, allowing Asn deamidation and enhancing the formation of L-isoAsp residues. In this respect it has been shown that erythrocytes from glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient patients display a higher propensity to deamidation at membrane protein level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Ingrosso2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, UV irradiation, which causes an increased formation of reactive oxygen species, leads to an increased protein deamidation in cultured melanoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-DAngelo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, analysis of the <italic>PCMT</italic> gene provided interesting clues about the regulation of this enzyme. This gene contains several motifs, as potential regulation sites in response to different stress conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-DeVry1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It has been proposed that protein methyl esterification, catalyzed by PCMT, may be able to mediate protection from apoptosis induced by Bax in a neuronal cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Huebscher1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This interpretation relies upon the evidence that cotransfection with a <italic>PCMT</italic> carrying vector prevents apoptosis induced by Bax, in this system. More recently it has been shown that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl2 protein family, contains two labile asparaginyl sites which are deamidation-prone (i.e. positions 52 and 66) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Deverman1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The deamidated Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> is not more able to block the action of pro-apoptotic proteins thus leading to cell death. A transient intracellular alkalinization has been related to Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> isomerization during cell stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Zhao1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. It is worth noting in this respect that general alkaline pH conditions increase the tendency of labile asparaginyl residues to form ASU. Consistent with these observations the rate of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation was found to be significantly reduced in hepatocellular carcinomas compared to normal liver tissue and this has been linked to a resistance of the transformed cells to undergo apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Takehara1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We report here that PCMT, when overexpressed in endothelial cells, is able to prevent apoptosis induced by an oxidative treatment. Experiments using PCMT negative dominants show that the enzymatic activity must be preserved in order to exert its antiaptotic effect. In order to identify molecular mediators of apoptotic cascade involved in this mechanism, and specifically recognized and modified by PCMT, we have employed the human recombinant enzyme as a specific ligand. We thus identify in our experimental system, a number of methyltransferase targets, also including Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>. We could therefore infer the role of protein methylation in apoptotic cell death and its underlying implications.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Characterization of PCMT plasmid constructs</title><p>Porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) were transfected with plasmid constructs carrying the <italic>PCMT</italic> sense or the antisense genes or either negative dominant mutants (Asp83&#x02192;Phe and Asp83&#x02192;Val), as described under &#x0201c;<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>&#x0201d;.

As for the first feature, the most deamidation-susceptible residues are asparagines followed by non bulky residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Galletti1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Clarke1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Aswad2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. As for substrate-PCMT interaction, negative structural requirements are the presence of Cys or charged residues immediately following isoAsp <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Lowenson1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> as well as N-terminal isoAsp residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Galletti2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on these criteria we therefore carefully reviewed published sequences of all proteins substrates we had identified. Results confirmed that all proteins indeed contained at least one deamidation site, thus allowing us to predict the position at which the actual methylatable isoaspartyls may occur. Protein disulfide isomerase (accession no P30101) displays one theoretically deamidation-susceptible site at Asn199Gly, another at Asn272Ala, plus two adjacent AsnThr sites at position 88. Molecular chaperone HSP70 &#x0005b;accession number (AN) NP_005338.1&#x0005d; contains several theoretical deamidation sites including: five Asn-Ala (at position 59, 280, 367, 515, 619), two Asn-Ser (407, 646), Asn62Thr. Asn41Ser occurs in HSP90 (AN NP_031381.2). Ferrochelatase (AN NP_000131.1) displays three of such features (Asn153Thr; Asn204Ala; Asn372Gly). As for mitochondrial import receptor (AN NP_064628.1) the only theoretical deamidation site is Asn124Thr. Actin (AN P63261) contains the following theoretically deamidation-susceptible asparagines: Asn12Gly, Asn-Thr at positions 128 and 296, Asn280Ser. In addition, we identified, as a PCMT substrate, the cleaved form of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Fujita1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation sites have been experimentally and unambiguously identified by previous work, as discussed below. It is now clear that this protein undergoes deamidation at two (Asn52 and Asn66) of the three Asn-Gly sequences, which are theoretically sensitive hot spots for this post-biosynthetic modification. Present results demonstrate that this protein actually is recognized by the repair methyltransferase PCMT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data demonstrate that PCMT overexpression confers resistance to apoptosis, induced by oxidative stress, in endothelial cells. Conversely, under conditions in which PCMT was suppressed, cells accumulated isoaspartyl-containing, deamidated proteins, upon oxidative stress. The identification of isoaspartyl-containing derivatives as the actual target-substrate for this protection was made possible by the utilization of PCMT as a specific enzymatic probe, which selectively recognizes the isoaspartyl moiety in deamidated proteins. In fact we were able to show that isomerized proteins increase significantly in the cells committed to apoptosis as the result of oxidative treatment. To clarify the mechanism involved in this resistance we employed a proteomics approach using, again, PCMT as a specific ligand to isolate deamidated-isomerized protein substrates. We can conclude that all the proteins we were able to isolate act as endogenous substrates for PCMT, under conditions in which cells undergo apoptosis. These substrates include various stress proteins (HSP70, HSP90, mitochondrial import receptor, protein disulfide isomerase), the cytoskeletal component actin (a long-established substrate for PCMT), ferrochelatase and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>. The role in apoptosis of some of these proteins has been well established, in particular regarding chaperone HSP70 and HSP90 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Beere1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. As for HSP70, this protein prevalently exerts antiapoptotic activity, both in the intrinsic and in the extrinsic pathways, according to a complex pattern throughout the apoptosis cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Arya1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Ruchalski1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. As for HSP90, this component, as well, is endowed with antiapoptotic activity through a multifaceted mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Arya1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Beere2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> is perhaps the most interesting protein we were able to isolate, for at least two reasons: first it exerts powerful and direct antiapoptotic activity. Second, and more relevant to our aim, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> undergoes deamidation in relation with cell damage, giving rise to its isoaspartyl derivative, and this process has profound implications on its functional antiapoptotic role. In fact it has been previously reported in the literature that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation is critical in the signaling pathway leading from DNA damage to apoptosis. Data accumulating over the last few years led to the notion that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation induces a profound structural modification, which, in turn, hampers the antiapoptotic function of this protein. In particular Deverman and coworkers used constructs where Asn52 and Asn66 in the wild type form of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, the two critical deamidation-susceptible asparagines, are replaced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Deverman1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Results, as rediscussed subsequently, were consistent with the view that Asn deamidation to isoaspartate, as the real product, results in the loss of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> function (Erratum for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Deverman1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Deverman2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanism for generation of the isoaspartyl derivative of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> has been finally elucidated, as it involves an increase of the intracellular pH, consequent to cell injury, and transcriptional activation of a Na/H antiport, which constitutes a favorable microenvironment for asparaginyl deamidation through ASU formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Zhao1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It is worth noting that an oxidative stress, as the means we used to induce apoptosis, also represents a protein deamidation-favoring microenvironment. In this respect, it has been previously shown that a) human erythrocytes treated with either <italic>t</italic>-BHP or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulate deamidated isomerized proteins in the cell membrane, which are methyl esterified <italic>ex vivo</italic> by PCMT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Ingrosso4">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>; b) human erythrocytes from G6PD-deficient subjects are particularly prone to undergo deamidation at membrane protein level, upon oxidative stress, compared to normal red cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Ingrosso2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>; c) melanoma cells also accumulate PCMT substrates upon UV irradiation, according to a mechanism which is mediated by an oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-DAngelo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, we detected increased isoaspartyl formation in the erythrocytes from patients with Down Syndrome, a condition which is characterized by increased oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Galletti3">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Now a more general question arises: is the occurrence of isoaspartyls upon deamidation a built-in destruction device or, rather, a fine tuning system acting in concert with methylation? The presence of deamidation-susceptible Asn in proteins appears to be selected against during evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Wright1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Some early experimental evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Robinson2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Rogers1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> supports a &#x0201c;Molecular Clock&#x0201d; hypothesis. According to this model, the presence of such deamidation-susceptible Asn may account for the occurrence of time-dependent structural modifications of functional meaning. For example, in the case of triosephosphate isomerase and serine hydroxymethyltransferase, deamidation of labile asparagines residues may represent specific signals for commitment of protein to degradation.</p><p>On the other hand, it has been suggested that the non-random distribution of such labile residues in proteins may not only be related to their degradation. It has been argued that although deamidation could be actually considered as a &#x0201c;structural alteration&#x0201d;, at least in some instances, the persistence of such deamidation hot spots during evolution may otherwise serve to certain functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Reissner1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. According to this view, deamidation may be interpreted as a molecular switch that regulates partitioning over time between two molecule subpopulations of a certain protein, which are also functionally modified. The existence of PCMT, as an enzyme involved in the &#x0201c;repair&#x0201d; of the isopeptide bond resulting from Asn deamidation, is also in agreement with the latter mechanism. In this respect protein deamidation to isoaspartyl-containing products, which are susceptible to recognition and repair by PCMT, has been found to occur in the extracellular matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Weber1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Weber2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently it has been reported that deamidation of susceptible proteins in the extracellular matrix may also serve as a molecular signal to unravel new integrin binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Curnis1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Deamidation of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, with consequent abolishment of its antiapoptotic function, thus represents a further example of such a molecular device to change functional properties of those proteins in which it occurs. Based on present results we then propose that PCMT is involved in the modulation of the apoptotic process, by regulating the balance, within the cell, between the isoaspartyl-containing and the repaired aspartyl form of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003258-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The repair mechanism, as it has been shown on various models, does not consist in the restoration of the asparaginyl residues, but, rather, in the conversion of the isopeptide bond at the level of the isoAsp into a normal &#x003b1;&#x02013;peptide bond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Galletti1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003258-Clarke1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0003258-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003258.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Proposed role of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> deamidation and methylation in apoptosis.</title><p>Deamidation-isomerization of two critical Asn residues of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> abolishes its antiapoptotic function.

Some of the proteins we thus identified as PCMT substrates, which are known to be involved in apoptosis, have been implicated in pathogenesis of tumors, with particular regard to the acquisition of resistance by the transformed cell phenotypes.
