We show here that laminins play an autocrine role in promoting this transformation. Laminins containing the &#x003b1;4, &#x003b1;5, and &#x003b2;2 subunits are synthesized by muscle fibers and concentrated in the small portion of the basal lamina that passes through the synaptic cleft at the NMJ. Topological maturation of AChR clusters was delayed in targeted mutant mice lacking laminin &#x003b1;5 and arrested in mutants lacking both &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5. Analysis of chimeric laminins in vivo and of mutant myotubes cultured aneurally demonstrated that the laminins act directly on muscle cells to promote postsynaptic maturation. Immunohistochemical studies in vivo and in vitro along with analysis of targeted mutants provide evidence that laminin-dependent aggregation of dystroglycan in the postsynaptic membrane is a key step in synaptic maturation. Another synaptically concentrated laminin receptor, Bcam, is dispensable. Together with previous studies implicating laminins as organizers of presynaptic differentiation, these results show that laminins coordinate post- with presynaptic maturation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; Bcam, basal cell adhesion molecule/Lutheran blood group antigen; BTX, &#x003b1;-bungarotoxin; LG, laminin globular; MuSK, muscle-specific kinase; NMJ, neuromuscular junction.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>A hallmark of the chemical synapse is the precise apposition of its pre- and postsynaptic specializations: neurotransmitter release sites in nerve terminals lie directly opposite concentrations of neurotransmitter receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. One mechanism for ensuring this coordination is the presentation by synaptic partners of factors that locally organize each other's differentiation. At the skeletal neuromuscular junction (NMJ), for example, agrin and acetylcholine secreted from axons pattern the postsynaptic membrane, and laminins and fibroblast growth factors secreted from the muscle pattern the nerve terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noakes et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gautam et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgess et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nishimune et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Misgeld et al., 2005</xref>). However, recent studies have emphasized the ability of postsynaptic components, such as acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), to aggregate in the absence of innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2001</xref>). Time-lapse imaging in vivo shows that some AChR aggregates are organized by the nerves, whereas others may be recognized by the nerve and incorporated into the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flanagan-Steet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Panzer et al., 2006</xref>). Partially redundant control by intrinsic and extrinsic patterning may help ensure that all muscle fibers end up with proper innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kummer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A combination of transsynaptic and cell-autonomous factors may also be responsible for postnatal maturation of the NMJ. During the first 2 wk after birth, the initially ovoid postsynaptic plaque of AChRs is transformed into a complex pretzel-shaped array of branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Slater, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Desaki and Uehara, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marques et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sanes and Lichtman, 2001</xref>). This process, which mirrors the postnatal branching of nerve terminals, was long assumed to reflect transsynaptic signaling because it fails to occur in neonatally denervated muscles, and because AChR aggregates in cultured myotubes generally remain plaque-shaped. Recently, however, we found that the plaque-to-pretzel transition can occur to a remarkable extent in myotubes cultured aneurally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kummer et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, mechanisms must exist that coordinate the branching of pre- and postsynaptic structures as synapses mature.</p><p>How can such coordination be achieved? One attractive hypothesis is that some components of the synaptic cleft influence both pre- and postsynaptic differentiation. In support of this idea, we provide evidence here that laminins, muscle-derived synaptic organizers that promote presynaptic differentiation by an intercellular mechanism, also promote postsynaptic maturation by an autocrine mechanism. Laminins, which are heterotrimers of &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3; subunits, are components of the basal lamina that ensheathes muscle fibers. Most of the basal lamina is rich in laminin 211 (&#x0003d;&#x003b1;2, &#x003b2;1 &#x003b3;1; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aumailley et al., 2005</xref> for laminin nomenclature), and contains the &#x003b2;1 subunit. In contrast, the small fraction of the basal lamina that occupies the synaptic cleft at the NMJ bears little if any &#x003b2;1 but is rich in laminins 221, 421, and 521, all of which contain the &#x003b2;2 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patton et al., 1997</xref>). Laminin &#x003b2;2 promotes presynaptic differentiation, in part by binding to voltage-gated calcium channels in the presynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noakes et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Son et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nishimune, et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In attempting to determine roles of the individual laminin &#x003b1; chains associated with synaptic &#x003b2;2 (&#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;4, and &#x003b1;5 in laminins 221, 421, and 521, respectively), we found ultrastructural defects in alignment of pre- and postsynaptic specializations in mice lacking laminin &#x003b1;4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patton et al., 2001</xref>). Lack of laminin &#x003b1;2 also leads to modest neuromuscular defects, but these may be secondary to the muscular dystrophy that results from loss of laminin 211 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Law et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Desaki et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patton et al., 2001</xref>). Roles of laminin &#x003b1;5 have been difficult to analyze because mice lacking laminin &#x003b1;5 (<italic>Lama5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) die at late embryonic stages because of multiple developmental defects, including exencephaly, syndactyly, and dysmorphogenesis of the placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miner et al., 1998</xref>). Accordingly, we reexamined this issue using a conditional mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nguyen et al., 2005</xref>) in which we could selectively remove laminin &#x003b1;5 from muscle. Postsynaptic maturation was delayed in mice lacking laminin &#x003b1;5 in muscle and arrested in double mutants lacking laminins &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5. Further analysis, both in vivo and in vitro, provided evidence that laminin acts directly on myotubes to promote postsynaptic maturation and that this autocrine effect is mediated in large part by the transmembrane laminin receptor dystroglycan. Together, these results suggest that synaptic laminins act through distinct receptors as both retrograde organizers of presynaptic maturation and autocrine organizers of postsynaptic maturation. This dual role provides an elegant way to coordinate pre- and postsynaptic growth and differentiation as the synapse matures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Muscle-specific deletion of <italic>laminin &#x003b1;5</italic></title><p>In initial studies, we examined muscles from targeted laminin &#x003b1;5 null mutant mice (<italic>Lama5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miner et al., 1998</xref>). NMJs formed in these mutants, with vesicle-rich nerve terminals apposed to postsynaptic AChR aggregates (Biernan, J., L. Knittel, D. Yang, Y.S. Tarumi, J.H. Miner, J.R. Sanes, and B.L. Patton. 2003. Society for Neuroscience 33<sup>rd</sup> Annual Meeting. Abstr. 898.7). This analysis was limited to embryonic stages, however, because <italic>Lama5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mutants usually die before embryonic day 17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miner et al., 1998</xref>). To assess roles of this subunit in later stages of neuromuscular synaptogenesis, we used a conditional allele in which exons 15&#x02013;21 of the <italic>Lama5</italic> gene were flanked by loxP sites (<italic>Lama5<sup>loxP</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nguyen et al., 2005</xref>). Cre-mediated recombination of the loxP sites excises these exons, resulting in a frame-shifted laminin &#x003b1;5 mRNA and a null allele. We mated the conditional mutants to transgenic mice in which regulatory sequences from the human skeletal actin gene drive muscle-specific expression of Cre recombinase (<italic>HSA-Cre;</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwander et al., 2003</xref>).

Over the first three postnatal weeks, laminin &#x003b1;5 is lost from extrasynaptic basal lamina and becomes concentrated in synaptic basal lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patton et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). In <italic>Lama5<sup>M/M</sup></italic> muscle, laminin &#x003b1;5 was barely detectable in extrasynaptic basal lamina at postnatal day 0; it was undetectable at 75% of NMJs at P0 and at 95% of NMJs by P10 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and not depicted). The low levels of laminin &#x003b1;5 present at birth may result from slow degradation of laminins inserted before gene deletion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohn et al., 2002</xref>). In any case, the absence of laminin &#x003b1;5 from NMJs at later stages indicates that synaptic deposits of this subunit in postnatal muscle are contributed solely by the muscle and not by motor neurons or Schwann cells. Quantitative analysis of immunofluorescence indicated that levels of laminins &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b2;2 at the NMJ were unaffected by the absence of laminin &#x003b1;5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref> and not depicted).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Muscle-specific deletion of laminin &#x003b1;5 leads to delayed neuromuscular synapse maturation.</bold> (A) Laminin &#x003b1;5 protein was undetectable at NMJs by P21 in <italic>Lama5<sup>M/M</sup></italic> mice, but laminin &#x003b1;4 levels were unaltered.

However, this model would be open to question if dystroglycan were also required for synaptic localization of the laminins, a possibility suggested by studies on myotubes derived from dystroglycan-null embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grady et al., 2000</xref>). We therefore asked whether dystroglycan is required for the synaptic localization of laminins &#x003b1;4 or &#x003b1;5 in vivo. In fact, levels and patterns of laminin &#x003b1;4, and laminin &#x003b1;5 immunoreactivity were similar at NMJs <italic>Dag1<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic>;<italic>Pax3-Cre</italic> mice and littermate controls (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, A and B</xref>). Likewise, loss of dystroglycan had no detectable effect on the synaptic levels or distribution of integrin &#x003b1;7, integrin &#x003b2;1, or Bcam, and patterns of laminin &#x003b1;4, laminin &#x003b1;5, integrin &#x003b1;7, integrin &#x003b2;1, and dystroglycan did not differ detectably between <italic>Bcam<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice and controls (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9, C and D</xref>; and unpublished data). The synaptic concentration of laminins at NMJs in <italic>Dag1<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic>:<italic>Pax3-Cre</italic> muscle suggests that whereas synaptic laminin &#x003b1; chains are required to localize dystroglycan, the opposite is not true.</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Roles of dystroglycan in localizing synaptic laminins and Bcam.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) Laminin &#x003b1;4, laminin &#x003b1;5, and Bcam are similarly concentrated at synaptic sites of control and <italic>Dag1<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>:Pax3-Cre</italic> muscles.

Early steps in postsynaptic differentiation have been studied in detail and are known to involve interplay of nerve-derived signals and muscle cell&#x02013;autonomous programs (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kummer et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, little is known about factors that control the subsequent molecular and topological changes that occur as the NMJ matures. Here, we have focused on roles of laminins in the postnatal transformation of the NMJ from a simple plaque to a complex branched array. We analyzed NMJs in a set of five targeted null and conditional mutants, as well as in myotubes cultured aneurally from several of the lines. Collectively with previous studies (see Introduction), our results lead to three major conclusions: (1) laminins containing the &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 subunits are muscle-derived autocrine promoters of postsynaptic differentiation; (2) these autocrine effects depend in large part on the ability of laminins &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 in the synaptic cleft to aggregate dystroglycan in the postsynaptic membrane; and (3) the three synaptically concentrated laminin subunits (&#x003b1;4, &#x003b1;5, and &#x003b2;2) play distinct but interrelated roles in both pre- and postsynaptic differentiation.</p><sec><title>Laminins as autocrine synaptic organizing molecules</title><p>Pre- and postsynaptic differentiation are interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2001</xref>). Therefore, in considering roles of laminins &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 in postsynaptic maturation, a main issue is the relationship between their cellular source and target. Three possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive, are: (a) laminins &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 might be synthesized by nerve or Schwann cells and act transsynaptically on muscle cells; (b) they might be synthesized by muscle and act transsynaptically to affect presynaptic differentiation, with postsynaptic defects being indirect consequences of the presynaptic impairment; and (c) they might both be synthesized by and act directly on the postsynaptic cell.</p><p>Several results favor the third of these alternatives, that laminin acts by an autocrine mechanism. First, laminins &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 are made by myotubes and inserted into basal lamina associated with postsynaptic specializations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Patton, 2000</xref>). Second, laminins &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 are not detectably expressed by motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miner et al., 1997</xref>). Third, the use of a conditional <italic>Lama5</italic> mutant allowed us to excise laminin selectively from muscle cells, leaving other potential sources unperturbed. Postsynaptic maturation was delayed in these mice and arrested in mice that also lacked laminin &#x003b1;4. Fourth, myotubes from <italic>Lama5<sup>M/M</sup></italic>;<italic>Lama4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice cultured in the absence of neurons displayed defects in AChR aggregation. Thus, although laminins also act on nerve terminals, their effects on postsynaptic maturation are in large part direct.</p><p>Several groups have shown previously that application of laminin to cultured myotubes promotes formation of AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vogel et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sugiyama et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Montanaro et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Smirnov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marangi et al., 2002</xref>). The relationship of this effect to synapse formation in vivo has been unclear, however, because the laminin isoforms used in vitro (laminins 111 and 211) are not found in synaptic basal lamina. Moreover, the effects of soluble laminin in vitro occur in the absence of the receptor tyrosine kinase muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), whereas no AChR clusters form on laminin-laden MuSK<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> myotubes in vivo (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2001</xref>). We have shown that substrate-bound laminin 111 promotes AChR aggregation by a MuSK-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kummer et al., 2004</xref>) and now show that &#x003b1;4- and &#x003b1;5-containing laminins (421 and 521) are more potent or different from laminin 111.</p></sec><sec><title>Dystroglycan as a synaptic laminin receptor</title><p>If laminins are autocrine promoters of postsynaptic differentiation, they presumably act through receptors on myotubes. Laminins are large multisubunit proteins, and at least a dozen laminin-binding moieties (proteins and carbohydrates) have been described, many of which are present in muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Suzuki, et al., 2005</xref>). As one way of narrowing the set of candidates, we took note of the finding that a chimeric laminin, <italic>Mr5G2</italic>, failed to rescue postsynaptic defects on <italic>Lama5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Because this chimera differs from laminin &#x003b1;5 only in its last three LG domains, we hypothesized that mediators of the effects of laminin on postsynaptic membrane would not only be present in the postsynaptic membrane but also interact with the C-terminal three LG domains of laminin &#x003b1;5. Three receptors that meet these criteria are dystroglycan, Bcam, and &#x003b2;1 integrins. Of these, our analysis supports a critical role for dystroglycan.</p><p>Dystroglycan was discovered as a laminin-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gee et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barresi and Campbell, 2006</xref>), but it was initially implicated in NMJ formation when it was discovered that it also binds agrin, a nerve-derived organizer of postsynaptic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowe et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campanelli et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gee et al., 1994</xref>). Later studies showed that agrin does not signal through dystroglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sanes and Lichtman 2001</xref>). In parallel, however, evidence accumulated favoring the idea that dystroglycan and other proteins of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grady et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2000</xref>) are involved in later aspects of postsynaptic maturation. For example, NMJs in chimeric mice generated from dystroglycan null embryonic stem (ES) cells have a simplified postsynaptic topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">C&#x000f4;t&#x000e9; et al., 1999</xref>), and cultured myotubes generated directly from such ES cells form abnormal AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grady, et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacobson et al., 2001</xref>). Here, we used conditional dystroglycan mutants to generate mice in which dystroglycan is uniformly deleted from a subset of muscles (<italic>Dag1<sup>loxP/loxP</sup></italic>;<italic>Pax3-Cre</italic>; unpublished data). We were therefore able to directly compare synaptic morphology in the absence of laminins &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 and in the absence of dystroglycan. The similar postsynaptic phenotypes in these two mutants supports the idea that dystroglycan mediates the effects of synaptic laminins on postsynaptic differentiation.</p><p>Further studies suggest that laminins may act by promoting aggregation of dystroglycan in the postsynaptic membrane, where it can transduce signals or recruit other components. For example, levels of dystroglycan immunoreactivity associated with AChR clusters were markedly reduced in the postsynaptic membrane of <italic>Lama4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>;Lama5<sup>M/M</sup></italic> mice and in myotubes cultured aneurally from these mice. Moreover, loss of dystroglycan was not evident at NMJs from <italic>Lama4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> or <italic>Lama5<sup>M/M</sup></italic> single mutants, in which postsynaptic differentiation was normal or only delayed, respectively. Conversely, laminins &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 remained concentrated at synaptic sites in dystroglycan-deficient muscle, which indicates that, in vivo, it is laminins that localize dystroglycan rather than vice versa. Together with previous studies showing that soluble laminins can cluster dystroglycan when added to cultured myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Montanaro et al., 1998</xref>), our results suggest that laminins are responsible, at least in part, for the synaptic concentration of dystroglycans.</p><p>How do laminins &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 aggregate dystroglycan? The answer is not straightforward, in that dystroglycan also binds laminin &#x003b1;2, which is present throughout the muscle fiber membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>), and laminin &#x003b1;1, which is used as uniform substrate in myotube cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kummer et al., 2004</xref>). The simplest possibility is that laminins &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 bind differently or more tightly to dystroglycan than do laminins &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;2. Unfortunately, there is currently no evidence to support this idea, and pure, intact laminin chains are not available to test it. Alternatively, laminins &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5 might recruit linker proteins that aggregate dystroglycan. We have not rigorously tested this possibility but provide evidence that if such linkers do exist, they do not include the laminin- or dystroglycan-binding proteins agrin, integrin &#x003b1;7&#x003b2;1, or Bcam.</p><p>How, in turn, might clustered dystroglycan promote postsynaptic maturation? First, one possibility is that it interacts with AChRs to maintain their high density. Indeed, dystroglycan binds to rapsyn, which in turn clusters AChRs, and to MuSK, a component of the primary postsynaptic scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apel et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartoli et al., 2001</xref>). Second, dystroglycan is a key component of a dystrophin glycoprotein complex, several intracellular components of which have been implicated in postsynaptic maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deconinck et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grady et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bogdanik et al., 2008</xref>). Third, dystroglycan might interact with other laminin receptors such as integrins or Bcam. Our results indicate that Bcam is unlikely to be involved, but we were unable to directly test the role of &#x003b2;1 integrins for the postnatal NMJ maturation because deletion of the &#x003b2;1 integrin gene from muscle cells leads to embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwander et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">2004</xref>). However, mice lacking integrin &#x003b1;7, the main synaptic laminin-binding integrin, were found to show no morphological abnormalities at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mayer et al., 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Laminins as transsynaptic coordinators</title><p>The laminin &#x003b1;4, &#x003b1;5, and &#x003b2;2 chains are selectively associated with the basal lamina of the synaptic cleft (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanes et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patton et al., 1997</xref>). Previous studies showed that &#x003b2;2 laminins serve as critical organizers of presynaptic maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noakes et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knight et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nishimune et al., 2004</xref>) and also affect placement of terminal Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Patton et al., 1998</xref>). Laminin &#x003b1;4 helps to specify the precise apposition of pre-to-postsynaptic specializations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patton et al., 2001</xref>). Here, we focused on the third synaptically concentrated laminin chain, &#x003b1;5, and discovered new roles of laminins in synaptic maturation. First, analysis of laminin &#x003b1;5 conditional mutants (<italic>Lama5<sup>M/M</sup></italic>) showed that &#x003b1;5 is an autocrine promoter of postsynaptic differentiation. Second, analysis of <italic>Lama5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>;Mr5G2</italic> mice showed that laminin &#x003b1;5 acts through a distinct mechanism to ensure complete innervation of the postsynaptic membrane. Third, analysis of <italic>Lama4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>;Lama5<sup>M/M</sup></italic> double mutants showed that &#x003b1;4 can substitute for &#x003b1;5, at least in regard to its postsynaptic activity. Together, these results show that synaptic laminins act collaboratively on all three cells of the NMJ to organize and coordinate synaptic maturation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>The generation of the following genetically engineered mouse strains has been described previously: <italic>Lama5</italic> null (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miner et al., 1998</xref>), <italic>Lama5<sup>loxP</sup></italic> conditional mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nguyen et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>Lama4</italic> null (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patton et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>Lamb2</italic> null (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noakes et al., 1995</xref>), <italic>Dag1<sup>loxP</sup></italic> conditional mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohn et al., 2002</xref>), <italic>Mr5G2</italic> transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kikkawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kikkawa and Miner, 2006</xref>), HSA-Cre transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwander et al., 2003</xref>), and Pax3Cre transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2000</xref>).
