The cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are among the specialized plasma membrane proteins that carry out these functions. The mechanisms of recognition and adhesion are of particular relevance in the nervous system whose operation heavily relies on cell-cell communication, and whose many cell types acting in concert are capable of extensive re-organization in development, learning and memory. Recently two related CAMs, Necl-2-SynCAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and Necl-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], were shown to fulfill important functions in the central nervous system (CNS). In addition to acting as a CAM in other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], SynCAM can induce presynaptic differentiation in co-cultured neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], whereas Necl-1 is expressed specifically in brain and localizes at contact sites between neurons and glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These two CAMs are Ig superfamily members and genomic analysis predicts that they are part of a set of four closely related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] for which different nomenclatures have been proposed, in particular nectin-like 1 to 4 (Necl-1 to -4), and synaptic CAM 1 to 4 (SynCAM-1 to -4), each with its merits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Here we describe Necl-3/SynCAM-2, a previously uncharacterized member of the family, which we term Necl-3 throughout for simplicity and because the term is neutral with respect to function. Necl-3 shares with the other Necls/SynCAMs a conserved modular organization comprising three Ig domains, a single trans-membrane pass and a short cytoplasmic region containing 4.1 and PDZ binding motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Necl-3 accumulates in several tissues, including those of the nervous system, where it localizes to myelinated axons and in ependymal cells. We also demonstrate that Necl-3 engages in homo- and heterophilic interactions leading to cell aggregation and discuss its possible implication in processes dependent on neural cell adhesion.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Necl-3 expression</title><p>Genes that are differentially expressed in the postnatal development of the rat CNS may inform on important aspects of neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. One such gene codes for Necl-3, whose expression we assessed in various rat tissues by northern blot and real-time PCR. A Necl-3 mRNA greater than 5 Kb was detected in various structures of the CNS (midbrain, cerebellum and hippocampus), whereas it was either undetectable or poorly expressed in all other organs tested except for testis (data not shown). Real-time PCR analysis of eighteen tissues using a primer pair spanning two exons confirmed the northern blot result (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We next examined Necl-3 protein accumulation. Since there is a high degree of homology among the Necl family members (in the rat, Necl-3 has 48%, 44%, and 35% amino-acid identity to Necl-1, Necl-2, and Necl-4 respectively), it was critical to ensure specificity when raising and testing anti Necl-3 antibodies. We immunized rabbits against a recombinant segment of the extracellular domain of Necl-3 that is the least conserved region among the Necl proteins. Antibody specificity was tested using <italic>Drosophila </italic>S2 cells transfected with either green fluorescent protein (GFP) alone or Necl-1, Necl-2, Necl-3, and Necl-4 fused to GFP at their carboxy-termini. Crude S2 lysates were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and probed with either the anti Necl-3 or an anti GFP antibody serving as a loading control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The anti Necl-3 antibody reveals a single species of the expected size exclusively in cells transfected with Necl-3-GFP. We conclude that we have a highly specific anti Necl-3 antibody preparation that does not cross-react with Necl-3's closest relatives, i.e. Necl-1, Necl-2, or Necl-4.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>All signal were normalized with GAPDH and are displayed as arbitrary units of the fluorescence intensity (Mb: midbrain, Cer: cerebellum, Hp: hippocampus, Ctx: cortex, ON: optic nerve, SC: spinal cord, OB: olfactory bulb, Sn: snout, Th: thymus, SG: surrenal gland, SM: skeletal muscle, Ht: heart, Lg: lung, Ky: kidney, Li: liver, DT: digestive tract, WF: white fat, Ts: testis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2202-8-90-1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Antibody specificity and Necl-3 expression. (Panel A) Crude lysates of S2 cells transfected with either GFP or one each of the Necl-GFP fusion proteins were visualized by SDS-PAGE and coomassie blue staining (left panel). The gels were blotted on nitrocellulose membranes and revealed with either an anti GFP mAb (middle panel), or the affinity-purified anti Necl-3 antibody (right panel). The cells had been transfected with GFP (Ctrl), Necl-1-GFP (1), Necl-2-GFP (2), Necl-3-GFP (3) or Necl-4-GFP (4). The anti GFP mAb reveals fusion proteins of the expected apparent molecular weights as well as faster migrating products, likely the result of degradation or internal translation initiation. The anti Necl-3 antibody does not cross-react with the other members of the Necl family. (Panel B) 15 &#x003bc;g of homogenates from hippocampus (Hi), cortex (C), lung (Lu), kidney (K), testis (T), spleen (S), heart (He), liver (Li) and thymus (T) of a 2-month-old rat were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by western blotting with the anti-Necl-3 antibody.

The Necl-3 protein was detected in brain structures, but also in kidney, heart and liver (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Necl-3 migrates with an apparent mass of approximately 52 kDa, which is slightly more than its calculated molecular weight of 48 kDa. This is due at least in part to N-linked glycosylation since treatment with the N-glycosidase PNGaseF converts Necl-3 to a faster migrating form, consistent with the presence of N-glycosylation consensus sites in the extracellular domain (data not shown). We also monitored the accumulation of Necl-3 in the postnatal brain and found that the protein is barely detectable at P1 or P12 and has reached a plateau by P60 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Necl-3 is targeted to the plasma membrane and engages in homo- and heterophilic interactions</title><p>Necl-1 and Necl-2 form homo- and heterophilic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In order to investigate Necl-3's potential to insert in the plasma membrane, we transfected Hela cells with vectors expressing either GFP or a chimeric protein consisting of Necl-3 carboxy-terminally fused to GFP. Unlike GFP alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), Necl-3-GFP accumulates at contact sites between transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Confocal analysis and tri-dimensional reconstitution confirm the cytoplasmic location of GFP and the plasma membrane location of Necl-3-GFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>). To rule out a localization artifact due to the GFP moiety of the fusion protein, we transfected a myc-tagged version of Necl-3, and identical results were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These data imply that Necl-3 is targeted to the plasma membrane and possibly engages in homophilic trans-interactions. Similar results were obtained for Necl-1 and Necl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. To verify that Necl-3 is targeted to the plasma membrane, we took advantage of the fact that our anti Necl-3 antibody recognizes a domain predicted to be extracellular. Transfected Hela cells were used in immunofluorescence experiments done on cells that were not permeabilized, i.e. in the absence of detergent. In such conditions the antibody is indeed able to specifically bind to the putative extracellular domain of Necl-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C&#x02013;E</xref>), confirming its predicted topology and location at the plasma membrane.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>GFP (A, top panel: average projection of 30 z-stacks of 0.24 micron each; bottom panel: a single X/Y plane in the center, a X/Z slice at bottom and a Y/Z slice on the right) or Necl-3-GFP (B, top panel: average projection of 39 z-stacks of 0.12 micron each; bottom panel: a single X/Y plane in the center, a X/Z slice at bottom and a Y/Z slice on the right) was transfected in Hela cells and visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Unlike GFP alone, Necl-3 accumulates in the plasma membrane and at cell-cell contacts between transfected cells (arrow). (C-E), Hela cells transfected with Necl-3-GFP were processed for immunofluorescence with the anti Necl-3 antibody in non-permeabilized conditions and visualized (average projection of 83 z-stacks of 0.12 micron each) in the GFP channel (C) and in the rhodamine channel (D). To reveal untransfected cells, the specimen was stained with DAPI. The (E) panel shows the merged DAPI, GFP and rhodamine channels.

These do not aggregate spontaneously and Necl-2/SynCAM is able to induce their aggregation through homophilic interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. S2 cells were transfected separately with plasmids expressing GFP or Necl-3-GFP under the control of an inducible metallothionein promoter. After transfection, the cells were washed free from plasmid, induced with CuSO<sub>4</sub>, gently shaken to favor aggregation and visualized without further fixation. Unlike cells transfected with GFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B</xref>), those transfected with Necl-3-GFP form large aggregates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C&#x02013;D</xref>). Since the transfection efficiency is not 100%, the non-transfected cells in the Necl-3-GFP plate serve as internal control, showing no aggregation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C, D</xref>). We next tested Necl-3's ability to form aggregates with its relatives Necl-1, Necl-2 and Necl-4. S2 cells were separately transfected with plasmids coding for Necl-3-GFP, Necl-1-DsRed, and Necl-4-DsRed. After transfection, they were mixed in different combinations pairwise and induced to express their transfected Necl. After gentle shaking, aggregates formed between Necl-3-GFP and Necl-1-DsRed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E, F</xref>) or Necl-4-DsRed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G, H</xref>). Again, non-transfected cells serving as internal control did not aggregate. To rule out an artifact due to the use of DsRed, we performed a similar S2 cells aggregation assay using a myc-tagged version of Necl-3 along with Necl-2-GFP. Using a rhodamine-conjugated anti myc secondary antibody, we again observed aggregates of red and green cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I, J</xref>). Thus, Necl-3 unambiguously interacts with itself, Necl-1, Necl-2, and Necl-4 in these aggregation assays. To test the promiscuity of Necl-3's heterophilic interactions, we assayed its ability to aggregate with ALCAM/CD166, an adhesion molecule bearing five Ig-loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Necl-3-DsRed and ALCAM-GFP were used for aggregation assays as described above. Large S2 cells aggregates were observed but these were always composed of green only or red only cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The fact that Necl-3 does not interact productively with ALCAM shows that, even though Necl-3 is capable of multiple heterophilic interactions with other Necl proteins, it retains specificity for certain Ig loop folds.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>S2 cells transfected with GFP (A, B) or Necl-3-GFP (C, D) were gently shaken and visualized by phase contrast (A, C) and fluorescence microscopy (B, D).

S2 cells transfected with Necl-3-GFP were mixed with Necl-1-DsRed cells (E, F); cells transfected with Necl-3-GFP were mixed with Necl-4-DsRed (G, H) cells, and cells transfected with Necl-3-myc were mixed with Necl-2-GFP (I, J). The cell aggregates were visualized by fluorescence microscopy with green and red pass filters (E, G, I), by phase contrast (F, H), or by fluorescent staining of the nuclei with DAPI (J).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2202-8-90-5"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>S2 cells transfected with ALCAM-GFP or Necl-3-DsRed were mixed, then gently shaken and visualized by fluorescence microscopy.

This chimeric protein or a control full-length human IgG were adsorbed on protein A resin and used in pull-down assays. Lysates of mock-transfected and Necl-2-GFP transfected S2 cells were the inputs for the pull-down experiments. After incubation and washings, the proteins retained on the beads were analyzed by western blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Control IgG beads are unable to bring down Necl-2-GFP, whereas the Fc-Necl-3 beads efficiently do so (approximately 15% of the input Necl-2-GFP is recovered). Incidentally, the fact that human IgG beads do not interact with Necl-2 confirms that even though the Necl proteins are capable of multiple heterophilic interactions, they retain specificity. We note that the heterophilic interaction described here is calcium independent since the pull-down experiments were done in presence of EDTA. Similar data have been reported for the homophilic interactions of Necl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>The Fc-Necl-3 fusion protein (N3) or IgGs (IgG) were immobilized on protein A beads.

Closely-related Necl-2 is also expressed there [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], where it can induce presynaptic differentiation in co-cultured neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], while Necl-1 localizes at cell-cell contact sites between neurons and glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We therefore investigated the brain distribution of Necl-3 by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Intense labeling was observed in structures resembling axon bundles in several brain areas including cerebellar white matter and ventral reticular nucleus(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A, D</xref>). The axonal localization of Necl-3 was confirmed by a near-perfect overlap with the axonal neurofilament marker (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A&#x02013;F</xref>). Careful examination however shows that although the Necl-3 and the neurofilament staining are largely overlapping, they are not identical (inset Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8F</xref>). This co-localization is unlikely to be an artifact since it was apparent for each Z optical section examined (not shown). We investigated whether Necl-3 is expressed in other cell types in co-labeling experiments with non-neuronal markers. Antibodies against GFAP (glial fibrillary acid protein) revealed very little or no accumulation in astrocytes and anti CD11b showed no detectable signal in microglial cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A&#x02013;F</xref>). Necl-3 immunoreactivity was also detected in ependymal cells of the ventricle wall and choroid plexus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10A&#x02013;B</xref>). Close examination shows that in addition to its apparent membrane localization, Necl-3 also accumulates to the cytoplasm of ependymal cells, the significance of which is currently under investigation. Finally, labeling was observed inside capillaries, indicating that Necl-3 is also expressed on cells circulating in the blood (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>12 &#x003bc;m sagittal brain sections of a two-month-old rat were processed for immunohistochemistry.

In sharp contrast to the co-localization seen with neurofilament, Necl-3 positive fibers are always surrounded by Rip/CNP immunoreactivity in a mutually exclusive pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11A&#x02013;C</xref>). Identical results were obtained using a mAb directed against the myelin basic protein (MBP) in combination with anti Necl-3 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11D&#x02013;F</xref>). This confirms that Necl-3 is found in the axoplasm of myelinated axons. We also investigated the relationship between Necl-3 and myelination by examining the caudate putamen stained with anti Necl-3 and anti Rip/CNP antibodies. There we found that Necl-3 immunoreactivity is stronger in the myelinated areas and, as seen previously, that it is wrapped in oligodendrocytic immunoreactivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12A&#x02013;C</xref>). We finally examined whether Necl-3 is also expressed in myelinated axon fibers of the PNS. Co-labeling experiments with anti Necl-3 antibody plus anti neurofilament antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13A&#x02013;C</xref>) or Rip/CNP antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13D&#x02013;F</xref>) show that in the trigeminal nerve, as in the CNS, Necl-3 immunoreactivity overlaps perfectly with that of the neurofilaments and is surrounded by but excluded from the myelinated processes. Electron microscopy was used to confirm at a finer scale that Necl-3 is present at the axon-oligodendrocyte interface. The pons of three-month-old rats was used for pre-embedding immuno-electron microscopy with affinity-purified anti Necl-3 antibody. These experiments show that Necl-3 is absent from the axonal matrix and largely, but not exclusively, located at the innermost interface between oligodendrocytic layers and the axon shaft (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14B</xref>).

To explore whether Necl-3 would preferentially form contacts with specific cells we relied on an adhesion assay with mixed primary cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Cerebellar cells were dissociated and plated on petri dishes that were either untreated, coated with control IgGs, or coated with Fc-Necl-3. After a short incubation time, the non-adhering cells were washed away, and the remaining cells were cultured for another day. Microglial cells attached non-specifically to all dishes, reflecting the ability of these cells for binding untreated surfaces. Only the Fc-Necl-3 treated dishes attached cells other than microglia, and these were exclusively oligodendrocytes, as evident from their characteristic morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14D</xref>) and immunoreactivity for Rip/CNP (data not shown). Quantification indicates that this result is statistically highly significant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14G</xref>). Thus in this system Necl-3 can functionally and selectively interact with oligodendrocytes and does not bind to other CNS cell-types. To confirm the observation that Necl-3 preferentially binds to oligodendrocytes, the fusion protein Fc-Necl-3 or control IgGs were directly added to a mixed primary culture prepared from neonatal cortex. The Fc moiety on control IgGs and Fc-Necl-3 was revealed with labeled anti human Fc antibodies. No signal was observed with the control IgGs by fluorescent microscopy (data not shown), in contrast oligodendrocytes were strongly and selectively labeled with Fc-Necl-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14F</xref>). The binding of Fc-Necl-3 on mixed primary cultures was repeated and the oligodendrocytes were revealed with the mAb Rip that specifically stains these cells. Again oligodendrocytes are preferably bound by Necl-3, despite the presence of other cell types in the cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">15</xref>), and incubating the cultures with the same amount of IgGs does not to produce any detectable signal (data not shown). These experiments are in complete agreement with the plate adhesion assay and indicate that Necl-3 has a ligand on oligodendrocytes, to which it preferentially binds. This is also in agreement with observation by others that in the CNS, Fc-Necl-3 binds to oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F15"><label>Figure 15</label><caption><p>(A) The image in the red-pass channel shows Fc-Necl-3 revealed by a rhodamine-coupled secondary antibody.

Biederer has done a particularly interesting analysis with respect to splice variants, gene size, and protein structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Here we describe several of Necl-3's biological features. We demonstrate that it is a <italic>bona fide </italic>adhesion molecule able to engage in homo- and heterophilic interactions. The contacts Necl-3 makes with itself and with Necl-1, -2 and -4 are strong enough to withstand co-precipitation and cause cell aggregation. Likewise, Kakunaga et al. have shown that Necl-1 interacts with itself, Necl-2, nectin-1 and nectin-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], whereas Necl-2/SynCAM binds to itself and to Necl-1, nectin-3 and CRTAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It was also recently reported that Necl-1 and Necl-4 binds homo- and heterophilically and that Necl-2 and Necl-3 bind to Necl-1 and Necl-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In this latter report, the authors use a different technology than ourselves and reach similar conclusions, i.e. that Necl proteins engage in homo- and heterophilc interaction. The degree of promiscuity of the Necl proteins is an important biological question. It is unlikely that they only interact with the partners so far documented, but do they interact with many other Ig domain proteins and with proteins of other superfamilies? Here we show that Necl-3 does not react in trans with the Ig folds in IgG's and in ALCAM, but much more work will be needed to sort out the range of these interactions and clarify their biological relevance.</p><p>Using highly specific antibodies, we show that Necl-3 is enriched in myelinated axons in rat CNS and PNS. Our immuno-electron microscopy data indicate that Necl-3 accumulates at contact sites between neurons and oligodendrocytes. In addition, initial investigations suggest that Necl-3, similarly to Necl-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], is located at internodes on myelinated axons (data not shown). A function of Necl-3 compatible with these data, as well as with the fact that its maximal expression coincides with mature myelination, would be that Necl-3 participates in the myelin ensheathment of the axon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It could do so by "gluing" the oligodendrocytic processes to the axon shaft, a proposition that should be investigated in the future. Our adhesion assays show that Necl-3 preferentially adheres to oligodendrocytes. Since it is mostly expressed in neurons, this suggests that although capable of forming homophilic trans-interactions, Necl-3 preferentially forms heterophilic interactions. It raises the question of the identity of the Necl-3 interaction partner(s) in the oligodendrocyte. A good candidate for such a partner is Necl-1, as it is present in oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and binds to Necl-3 (this work). A recent report showed very convincingly that in the PNS Necl-1 is axonal and segregates preferentially to the internodal membrane whereas Necl-4 is expressed in Schwann cells and heterodimerizes with Necl-1, thereby forming a pair mediating axon-glia contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Necl-4 is therefore a likely partner for Necl-3 in the CNS, as these two Necl proteins are able to make heterophilic interactions (our work and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]). Indeed Spiegel et al. also report, as data not shown, that in the CNS Fc-Necl-3 bind to oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Consequently, Necl-3 (this report and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]) and Necl-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] are likely involved in the establishment axon-glia contacts. However, numerous other oligodendrocytic proteins could also serve as plausible Necl-3 partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The complex set of interactions engaged in by the Necl proteins suggests that they fulfill important cell adhesion and recognition functions. Our results reinforce the notion that the Necl family of proteins is involved in cell adhesion and recognition in the nervous system, as recently proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. There, Necl-1 and Necl-3 would favor neuron-glia contact (this work and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]) through heterophilic binding to Necl-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]; and Necl-2 would enable neuron-neuron contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Intriguingly, Necl-2 also promotes interactions between the nervous and immune systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It will be of interest to test whether other Necl family members fulfill similar neuro-immune functions. It also points to a possible mechanism for the interaction between lymphocytes and myelinated axons as it occurs in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, leukodystrophy, central pontine myelinolysis and others. Here, Necl-2 on lymphocytes would interact with Necl-4 on oligodendrocytes or Necl-1, Necl-2, or Necl-3 on the axon shaft. The Necl proteins may also be involved in certain aspects of nervous system regeneration and repair. In a PNS remyelination model, Necl-4 appears to be important for this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and Necl-2 (SgIGSF) mRNA and protein are upregulated in a model of olfactory epithelium nerve transection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Since Necl-3 is not present exclusively in the nervous system, it will be important to assess its cellular localization in the other tissues that express it.</p><p>In conclusion, our data describe some of the properties of the novel adhesion molecule Necl-3 and highlight its implication in the nervous system. This work also supports the notion that the Necl family of proteins fulfills important adhesion and recognition functions in the nervous system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>PCR reactions were done with Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) according to the supplier's instructions.

The cells were then blocked with PBS 10% FCS for 20 min, and incubated in PBS, 0.5% BSA, containing the affinity-purified anti Necl-3 antibody (diluted 1:200). After washes in PBS, highly cross-adsorbed Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies were as above. Coverslips were then rinsed again in PBS, and stained with Hoechst. Widefield microscopy was performed on a Zeiss AXIOZ1 microscope with a 63&#x000d7; oil immersion objective. Mouse mAbs were obtained from the following suppliers: DSHB (University of Iowa), neurofilament and Rip; Roche, GFAP and GFP; Serotec, CD11b; Chemicon, MBP and Upstate, Myc tag.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoelectron microscopy</title><p>Anesthetized rats were perfused with PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 0,1% glutaraldheyde. Brain were dissected and put overnight in PBS with 2% paraformaldehyde, 25% sucrose for cryoprotection, then embedded in O.C.T. medium (Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN) and cryo-sectioned at 12 &#x003bc;m thickness. Sections were put on superfrost slides (Menzel GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) and incubated for 30 min with PBS plus 0,1 % BSA (New England Biolabs, USA). Sections were incubated overnight in a humid chamber at 4&#x000b0;C with 40 &#x003bc;l of anti-Necl-3 antibody diluted (1:50) in PBS plus 0,1% BSA. They were then washed 5 times for 20 min with PBS plus 0,1 % BSA and incubated in a humid chamber with 40 &#x003bc;l of anti-rabbit IgG FAB fluoronanogold Alexa 488 (Nanoprobes Inc., Yaphank, NY, USA) diluted (1:10) in PBS (0,1% BSA, 0,1% FSK gelatine) for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were first washed with PBS plus 0.1% BSA (3 times 20 min) and then 3 times with 0,1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.2). After fixation with 2% glutaraldheyde in 0,1 M sodium cacodylate (30 min at room temperature) specimen were further washed with 0,1 M sodium cacodylate and distilled water. Gold enhancement of the nanogold particles was performed for 4 min according to the manufacturers' recommendations (Nanoprobes, Inc.). After enhancement, sections were washed 4 times with water and 3 times 10 min with 0,1 M sodium cacodylate. Sections were post-fixed in 0,1 M OsO<sub>4 </sub>for 1 h, washed 3 times 5 min with 0,1 M sodium cacodylate and 5 times 5 min with water and stained with uranyl acetate. Finally sections were dehydrated and embedded in resin (Agar 100 Resin, Agar Scientific, UK). Sections of 70 nm were collected on 200 slot grids, counterstained with half saturated uranyl acetate then 2.5 % lead citrate and analyzed using either a TEM Philips 410 or a Tecnai G2 electron microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>Real time PCR analysis</title><p>Real time PCR analysis were prepared with SYBR green (Molecular Probes) as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] on an iCycler iQ Bio-Rad station, with quantitation, melt curve, and PCR efficiency analysis derived by the station's software.
