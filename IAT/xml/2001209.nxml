Like all cancers, it occurs when cells begin to divide uncontrollably because of changes (mutations) in their genes. Chemotherapy drugs kill these rapidly dividing cells but, because some normal tissues are sensitive to these agents, it is hard to destroy the cancer without causing serious side effects. Recently, &#x0201c;targeted&#x0201d; therapies have brought new hope to some patients with cancer. These therapies attack the changes in cancer cells that allow them to divide uncontrollably but leave normal cells unscathed. One of the first molecules for which a targeted therapy was developed was the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In normal cells, messenger proteins bind to EGFR and activate its &#x0201c;tyrosine kinase,&#x0201d; an enzyme that sticks phosphate groups on tyrosine (an amino acid) in other proteins. These proteins then tell the cell to divide. Alterations to this signaling system drive uncontrolled cell division in some cancers so blocking the EGFR signaling pathway should stop these cancers growing. Indeed, some lung cancers with mutations in the tyrosine kinase of EGFR shrink dramatically when treated with gefitinib or erlotinib, two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>TKI-sensitive lung cancers shrink when treated with TKIs because of drug-induced cell death, but what are the molecular mechanisms underlying this death? A better understanding of how TKIs kill cancer cells might provide new insights into why not all cancer cells with mutations in <italic>EGFR</italic> (the gene from which EGFR is made) are sensitive to TKIs. It might also uncover new targets for therapy. TKIs do not completely kill lung cancers, but if the mechanism of TKI-induced cell death were understood, it might be possible to enhance their effects. In this study, the researchers have investigated how cell death occurs after kinase inhibition in a panel of human lung cancer cell lines (cells isolated from human tumors that grow indefinitely in dishes) that carry <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers show, first, that erlotinib induces a type of cell death called apoptosis in erlotinib-sensitive cell lines but not in resistant cell lines. Apoptosis can be activated by two major pathways. In this instance, the researchers report, the so-called &#x0201c;intrinsic&#x0201d; pathway activates apoptosis. This pathway is stimulated by proapoptotic members of the BCL2 family of proteins and is blocked by antiapoptotic members, so the researchers examined the effect of erlotinib treatment on the expression of BCL2 family members in the <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant cell lines. Erlotinib treatment increased the expression of the proapoptotic protein BIM in sensitive but not in resistant cell lines. It also removed phosphate groups from BIM&#x02014;dephosphorylated BIM is a more potent proapoptotic protein. Conversely, blocking BIM expression using a technique called RNA interference virtually eliminated the ability of erlotinib to kill <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant cell lines. The researchers also report that erlotinib treatment increased BIM expression in erlotinib-sensitive lung tumors growing in mice and that an inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 enhanced erlotinib-induced death in drug-sensitive cells growing in dishes.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings indicate that BIM activity is essential for the apoptosis triggered by TKIs in drug-sensitive lung cancer cells that carry <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations, and that treatment of these cells with TKIs induces both the expression and dephosphorylation of BIM. The finding that the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis activation is involved in TKI-induced cell death suggests that changes in this pathway (possibly mutations in some of its components) might influence the sensitivity of <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant lung cancers to TKIs. Finally, these findings suggest that giving drugs that affect the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis activation at the same time as TKIs might further improve the clinical outcome for patients with <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant tumors. Such combinations will have to be tested in clinical trials before being used routinely.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040294">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040294</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>US National Cancer Institute information for patients and professionals on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/lung">lung cancer</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information for patients from Cancer Research UK on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=140">lung cancer</ext-link> including information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=5047#new">treatment with TKIs</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis">apoptosis</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermal_growth_factor_receptor">epidermal growth factor receptor</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcl-2">BCL-2 proteins</ext-link> (note that Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit; available in several languages)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information for patients from Cancerbackup on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/Treatments/Biologicaltherapies/Cancergrowthinhibitors/Erlotinib">erlotinib</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/Treatments/Biologicaltherapies/Cancergrowthinhibitors/Gefitinib">gefitinib</ext-link></p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Gong Y, Somwar R, Politi K, Balak M, Chmielecki J, et al.

However, none of these studies addressed the molecular mechanisms by which caspases are activated.</p><p>Two major pathways of caspase activation exist: the extrinsic pathway, triggered by &#x0201c;death receptor&#x0201d;-ligand binding (such as FASL to FAS), and the intrinsic pathway, triggered by cellular stress, such as occurs after cytokine deprivation, DNA damage, and anoikis (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040294-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;). BCL2 family proteins are a critical feature of the intrinsic pathway. Overexpression of some antiapoptotic family members, such as BCL2 and BCL-xL (also called BCL2-like ligand 1 &#x0005b;BCL2L1&#x0005d;), can prevent apoptosis induced by withdrawal of growth factor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040294-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040294-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.

Treatment with the PI3K inhibitors alone had minimal effects on either BIM expression levels or phosphorylation status. Lysates from cells treated with the combination of MEK (U0126, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040294-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) and PI3K inhibitors (wortmannin or LY294002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040294-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) did not show any additive effects on the induction of BIM EL, when compared with cells treated with the MEK inhibitor treatment alone. These data suggest that mutant EGFRs influence BIM expression and phosphorylation status mainly through the ERK signaling pathway. More precise mechanisms of BIM regulation remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Finally, to begin to determine how EGFR signaling affects BIM in an isolated cell system, we examined the effect of EGF stimulation on Bim in NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type <italic>EGFR</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040294-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. These mouse fibroblasts express very low levels of endogenous Egfr and its heterodimeric Erbb family members (i.e., Erbb2, Erbb3, and Erbb4). As expected, addition of exogenous EGF to serum-starved cells induced a rapid and massive phosphorylation of the receptor within 15 min, followed by a time-dependent decay in receptor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040294-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Levels of total EGFR decreased after EGF stimulation, presumably due to internalization and lysosomal degradation of the receptor. These changes were accompanied by transient increases in both Erk and Akt signaling. In parallel with these changes, EGF stimulation induced a rapid phosphorylation of Bim as well as a decrease in Bim protein levels; others have shown that these changes correlate with decreased Bim activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040294-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040294-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. BIM levels were restored quickly as levels of phospho-EGFR diminished. Thus, Bim protein levels and phosphorylation are tightly regulated by the EGFR signaling pathway. Moreover, EGFR stimulation by ligand can lead to changes suggestive of decreased BIM activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Bim Expression and Phospho-EGF Receptor Status Are Inversely Correlated in Mouse Models</title><p>We had hoped to extend our studies on the role of BIM in kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis to human mutant <italic>EGFR</italic> tumor specimens.

Studies with cell lines and mouse lung tumor models suggest that such responses involve cell death, but the underlying mechanisms have not been well elucidated. Here, we sought to characterize pathways of apoptosis induced by this class of agents in mutant EGFR-dependent lung adenocarcinoma cells. An enhanced understanding of such processes could lead to the identification of even more effective therapeutic strategies. The studies were motivated by the fact that despite inducing dramatic clinical and radiographic tumor responses, gefitinib and erlotinib rarely induce complete responses and do not cure patients.</p><p>Using a panel of human lung cancer cell lines that harbor <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations, we show that mutant EGFR-dependent cells with nanomolar sensitivity to erlotinib undergo G1 cell cycle arrest and cell death in response to kinase inhibition. Cell death is mediated through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway: cells release cytochrome <italic>c</italic> from mitochondria, they display altered localization of the proapoptotic protein BAX, and apoptosis can be blocked by overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-xL.</p><p>We also found that in cells dependent upon mutant EGFR signaling for survival, EGFR kinase inhibition leads to induced levels and dephosphorylation of BIM, a member of the proapoptotic BH3-only family of BCL2-related proteins. Importantly, these changes, which have been shown to enhance the proapoptotic activity of BIM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040294-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040294-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, are required for erlotinib-induced cell death; knockdown of BIM expression by RNA interference completely eliminates drug-induced cell killing in vitro, and erlotinib dramatically induces BIM levels in cell lines that die but not in cell lines resistant to the drug. Consistent with these in vitro findings, lungs from transgenic mice bearing mutant EGFR-driven lung adenocarcinomas and xenografts of PC-9 cells display increased concentrations of Bim shortly after erlotinib treatment.</p><p>BIM has been previously implicated in signaling cell death following cytokine withdrawal &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040294-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. This BH3-only protein has also been shown to be necessary for imatinib-induced killing of BCR-ABL-dependent leukemic cells in vitro (human cells) and in vivo (mice) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040294-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. The latter study found that only knockdown of Bim and Bad together by RNA interference could completely eliminate imatinib-induced killing. Here we found that knockdown of BIM alone by siRNAs was sufficient to prevent erlotinib-induced cell death in human lung cancer cells. Discrepancies between killing mechanisms in leukemic cells sensitive to imatinib and lung adenocarcinoma cells sensitive to EGFR inhibitors could be explained by different cell types of origin and/or different experimental procedures. Nevertheless, taken together, these findings suggest that the induction of BIM is a common apoptotic mechanism shared by both hematopoietic and epithelial tumor cells that depend upon kinase signaling for survival.</p><p>The status of BIM appears to be regulated at multiple points. Transcriptional profiling of erlotinib-treated cells and immunoblotting analysis of cells co-treated with erlotinib and an RNA polymerase II inhibitor indicate that the induction of BIM occurs at least in part at the transcriptional level. Moreover, studies of Bim in NIH 3T3 (mouse) cells transfected with <italic>EGFR</italic> cDNAs and in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines that harbor <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations indicate that Bim phosphorylation status is influenced by perturbation of EGFR signaling. Use of specific PI3K/AKT and ERK pathway inhibitors on drug-sensitive <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant cells suggests that the ERK pathway predominantly influences BIM status downstream of EGFR. However, others have shown that H3255 and PC-9 cells treated with a more potent and selective MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD0325901 (Pfizer), do not undergo apoptosis (Dr. David Solit, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, personal communication). This finding suggests that (1) while BIM induction is required for erlotinib-induced apoptosis, it may not be sufficient to provoke cell death, and (2) other signaling components downstream of EGFR are also likely to be involved in inducing apoptosis of these cells.</p><p>At the clinical level, our results have several implications. Since drug-sensitive <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant cells die via the intrinsic pathway of caspase activation, molecules within this cascade could influence both sensitivity and/or resistance of <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant lung tumor cells to EGFR kinase inhibitors. Conversely, manipulation of this pathway could be a therapeutic strategy to enhance the death of cells that depend upon mutant EGFR signaling for survival. Indeed, the fact that the BCL2 antagonist ABT-737 significantly enhances erlotinib-induced cell killing provides proof-of-principle that such an approach may achieve greater and more durable responses to EGFR inhibitors in patients whose lung tumors harbor <italic>EGFR</italic> kinase domain mutations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040294-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Erlotinib Induces Caspase 3/7 Activation in Drug-Sensitive Lung Adenocarcinoma Cell Lines That Harbor <italic>EGFR</italic> Mutations</title><p>Cell lines were treated with either DMSO or different concentrations of erlotinib in 96-well plates for the indicated times.
