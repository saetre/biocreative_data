The cloned fragment was approximately 14 kilobase-pair (kb) long, and extended about 9.0 kb upstream as well as 3.5 kb downstream from the apoA-II gene, which was contained within a 3.1 kb HindIII fragment of human DNA. The complete nucleic acid sequence of the apoA-II gene has been determined, establishing that the apoA-II gene is interrupted by three intervening sequences of 182, 293, and 395 bp. The second intron is of particular interest, because it contains a 33 bp sequence of alternating G and T residues very close to the 3' splice site which has the potential to form a left handed Z-helix structure in vivo. A restriction fragment length polymorphism 3' from the apoA-II gene has been detected which may serve as a marker for the long arm of chromosome 1 in linkage analyses.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0379-a" xlink:role="4601"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0375.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4597"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0376.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4598"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0377.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4599"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0378.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4600"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0379.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4601"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0380.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4602"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0381.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4603"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0382.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4604"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0383.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4605"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0384.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4606"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0385.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4607"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00306-0386.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4608"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
