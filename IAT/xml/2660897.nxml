Previous studies have shown that the constitutively active serine/threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2; (GSK3&#x003b2;) associates with the C-terminal basic domain of p53 and regulates its actions. In this study we identified the GSK3&#x003b2; N-terminal amino acids 78&#x02013;92 as necessary for its association with p53. Inhibitors of GSK3 impaired the acetylation of p53 at Lys373 and Lys382 near the GSK3&#x003b2; binding region in p53, indicating that GSK3&#x003b2; facilitates p53 acetylation. We also found that acetylation of p53 reduced its association with GSK3&#x003b2;, as well as with GSK3&#x003b1;. These results indicate that the N-terminal region of GSK3&#x003b2; binds p53, this association promotes the acetylation of p53, and subsequently acetylated p53 dissociates from GSK3.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) phosphorylates more than 40 substrates, so its actions must be controlled in a substrate-specific manner to avoid spurious phosphorylation of unintended substrates upon fluxes in the activity of GSK3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This must be accomplished by synchronous regulation of GSK3 binding to substrates or substrate-containing protein complexes and regulation of GSK3 activity, such as the activity-regulating serine-phosphorylation of GSK3. Thus, the association of GSK3 in protein complexes is likely as critical as post-translational modifications in controlling the actions of GSK3. This has been well-described for the Wnt signaling pathway where GSK3 must be bound to axin to phosphorylate axin-bound &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This substrate specificity implies the existence of different GSK3 recognition motifs for various binding partners, but GSK3 binding domain studies have been confined to Wnt signaling proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus, little is known about binding domains in GSK3, and it is usually depicted as three domains, a small N-terminal domain, a slightly larger C-terminal domain, and a predominant middle kinase domain. Additionally, a nuclear localization sequence was recently identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>To understand better the protein-protein interactions of GSK3&#x003b2;, we investigated the residues required for GSK3&#x003b2; to bind the tumor suppressor p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. GSK3&#x003b2; forms a complex with nuclear p53 to promote p53-induced apoptosis, and the C-terminal p53 basic domain is necessary for this interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. GSK3&#x003b2; also interacts with p53 in the nucleus during cellular senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and GSK3&#x003b2; binds p53 in mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although the interaction between GSK3&#x003b2; and p53 has been confirmed in several studies, the functional consequences are controversial, possibly because of the many other regulatory influences on p53 and the context- and cell-specific regulation and actions of p53. GSK3 has been reported to phosphorylate Ser33-p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] or Ser315-p53 and Ser376-p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and to regulate the intracellular localization of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In this study we identified the domain of GSK3&#x003b2; necessary for its association with p53. Furthermore, we found that GSK3 promotes the acetylation of p53, and that p53 acetylation reduces its association with GSK3&#x003b2;.</p><p>The region of GSK3&#x003b2; that binds to p53 was examined by expressing mutants of myc-tagged GSK3&#x003b2; fused to a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in p53-null H1299 cells that inducibly express wild-type HA-tagged p53. Immunostaining of transfected cells demonstrated that all GSK3&#x003b2; constructs were expressed in the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and data not shown). Following expression of NLS-GSK3&#x003b2; constructs, the expression of HA-p53 was induced, and co-immunoprecipitation of p53 with GSK3&#x003b2; constructs was measured. GSK3&#x003b2; was sequentially truncated from the C-terminal to the smallest construct consisting of residues 1&#x02013;134, and each of these GSK3&#x003b2; constructs associated with p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), indicating that the N-terminal amino acids 1&#x02013;134 of GSK3&#x003b2; are required for binding to p53. Subsequently, smaller 25-residue N-terminal sequential truncations of GSK3&#x003b2; were expressed and these showed that deletion of the N-terminal 77 residues did not abrogate binding to p53, but deletion of the N-terminal 92 or 114 residues eliminated association with p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). This demonstrates that a region encompassing residues 78&#x02013;92 of GSK3&#x003b2; was necessary for p53 binding. This localization was confirmed by constructing three different deletion mutants of GSK3&#x003b2; with this region eliminated, which failed to bind p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Nuclear localization of expressed GSK3&#x003b2; constructs</bold>. p53-null human lung carcinoma H1299 cells that express inducible wild-type HA-tagged p53 were transiently transfected with wild-type GSK3&#x003b2;-NLS-myc (1&#x02013;420) or the indicated mutants of GSK3&#x003b2;-NLS-myc. Constructs generated by ligating rat GSK3&#x003b2; cDNA into the pShooter vector pCMV/myc/nuc (Invitrogen) were expressed using FuGENE 6 (Roche). NLS-myc vector (myc) was used as a negative control. After 24 hr, expression was examined by immunoblotting and immunostaining with anti-myc-tag (Cell Signaling) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Nuclei were labeled with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml bisbenzimide (Bis; blue). The expression level of each mutant construct was similar to wild-type GSK3&#x003b2;-NLS-myc and all GSK3&#x003b2;-NLS-myc constructs (green) were expressed in the nucleus. 100&#x000d7; magnification.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-4598-8-14-1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of the GSK3&#x003b2; domain required for association with p53</bold>.

This region of GSK3&#x003b2; required for association with p53 is composed of two externally exposed loops that might be easily assessable to binding partners and contains K85/K86 that are critical for GSK3&#x003b2; kinase activity. Thus, we tested if GSK3&#x003b2; activity is required for its association with p53. Kinase dead GSK3&#x003b2; was generated by mutating K85 and K86 to alanine, with an NLS and myc-tag (K85A/K86A-NLS-GSK3&#x003b2;). Co-immunoprecipitation showed that both wild-type and kinase-dead GSK3&#x003b2; associate with p53, demonstrating that GSK3&#x003b2; activity is not required for association with p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Diagram of the GSK3&#x003b2; region required for association with p53</bold>.

Previously, the coactivators p300 and PCAF were shown to acetylate the C-terminus region of p53, which activates the DNA binding activity of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].

Trichostatin A (TSA) is a well-established inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in classes I, II, and IV, comprising HDAC 1&#x02013;11, and nicotinamide inhibits HDAC class III, comprising Sirt1-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Therefore, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 1 &#x003bc;M camptothecin for 3 hr to increase p53 levels, with or without 1 &#x003bc;M TSA plus 5 mM nicotinamide to inhibit p53 deacetylation. p53 levels were increased by camptothecin treatment and co-treatment with TSA/nicotinamide increased p53 acetylation at K373 and K382, but not at K320 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Treatment with three structurally diverse GSK3 inhibitors, lithium, SB216763, and CHIR99021, significantly inhibited the acetylation of p53 at K373 and K382 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In contrast, lithium and SB216763 did not inhibit p53 K320 acetylation (99 &#x000b1; 5% and 140 &#x000b1; 15%, respectively). These results implicate GSK3 as a modulator of p53 acetylation, indicating that GSK3 promotes p53 acetylation.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>GSK3 regulates p53 acetylation which regulates association with GSK3&#x003b2;</bold>.

Each isoform of GSK3 was immunoprecipitated and p53 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with both GSK3 isoforms. Inclusion of TSA/nicotinamide with camptothecin treatment increased p53 acetylation on K373 and K382 but not on K320, and there was a large inhibition of the association of p53 with both GSK3 isoforms compared with their association with p53 in the absence of TSA/nicotinamide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). These results indicate that acetylation of p53 at K373 and K382, proximal to the GSK3&#x003b2; binding region, inhibits the association of GSK3 with p53.</p><p>p53 and GSK3 each has critical roles in determining cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Therefore, it is particularly interesting to determine mechanisms regulating interactions between the two proteins. In this study we identified a novel protein-interacting region near the N-terminus of GSK3 that is critical for its interaction with p53. Furthermore, we found that GSK3 promotes the acetylation of p53 at sites (K373 and K382) near the GSK3&#x003b2;-binding region of p53, which spans residues 364&#x02013;373. Highly acetylated p53, in turn only poorly associates with GSK3. These findings indicate that a region near the N-terminus of GSK3 associates with the C-terminal basic domain of p53 that contains several sites that can be acetylated, GSK3 promotes the acetylation of p53, and acetylated p53 dissociates from GSK3.</p><p>Little is known about domains in GSK3 that are critical for its interactions with other proteins despite the importance of these interactions for controlling and directing the actions of GSK3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Since the interaction between GSK3&#x003b2; and p53 is important for controlling the actions of both proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], we examined regions in GSK3 that are required for this interaction. Previously overlapping but non-identical binding sites in the carboxy lobe of GSK3&#x003b2; were identified as critical for associating with proteins in the Wnt signaling pathway, axin and GBP/FRAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Both axin and GBP bind a channel in GSK3&#x003b2; formed by an &#x003b1;-helix (residues 262&#x02013;273) and an extended loop (residues 285&#x02013;299), so their binding is mutually exclusive, but the interacting residues of GSK3&#x003b2; differ for axin and GBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Unlike the Wnt signaling proteins, this entire C-terminal region of GSK3 was completely dispensable for its interaction with p53, which required GSK3&#x003b2; residues 78&#x02013;92. Although the binding domain contains residues K85/K86 that are necessary for its kinase activity, kinase-dead GSK3&#x003b2; with these residues mutated to alanine associated with p53 equivalently to wild-type GSK3&#x003b2; indicating that GSK3&#x003b2; activity does not affect the interaction with p53, which has also been shown for kinase-dead GSK3&#x003b2; binding to components of the Wnt signaling system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, these results demonstrate that different domains of GSK3&#x003b2; are utilized to enable GSK3&#x003b2; to regulate the Wnt and p53 systems. Differential protein-associating domains of GSK3&#x003b2; likely contribute to enabling GSK3 to selectively regulate phosphorylation of its substrates, which number over forty.</p><p>Several effects of GSK3 on p53 have been reported, including facilitation of its transcriptional activity and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], p53 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and p53 intracellular localization and trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Since the region encompassing residues 364&#x02013;373 in the C-terminal basic domain of p53 that is required for its association with GSK3&#x003b2; contains several sites that can be acetylated, we examined if GSK3 regulates p53 acetylation and if p53 acetylation regulates its association with GSK3. Both of these were found to occur, as GSK3 inhibitors substantially reduced the acetylation of p53 at two sites near the region of p53 required for its association with GSK3&#x003b2;, residues K373 and K382, but not at a more distant acetylation site, K320, and increased acetylation of p53 decreased its association with GSK3. Although the functional roles of p53 acetylation remain controversial, several reports suggest that acetylation increases p53 stability and promotes co-activator recruitment, leading to transcriptional activation of target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our findings indicate that the N-terminal region of GSK3 associates with the basic domain of p53 and this facilitates p53 acetylation which leads to dissociation of p53 from GSK3.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TYE performed the research and
