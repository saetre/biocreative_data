The gene encodes the BRCT-domain containing protein microcephalin/BRIT1. Apart from its role in the regulation of chromosome condensation, the protein is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage. We report here on the first mouse model of impaired <italic>Mcph1</italic>-function. The model was established based on an embryonic stem cell line from BayGenomics (RR0608) containing a gene trap in intron 12 of the <italic>Mcph1</italic> gene deleting the C-terminal BRCT-domain of the protein. Although residual wild type allele can be detected by quantitative real-time PCR cell cultures generated from mouse tissues bearing the homozygous gene trap mutation display the cellular phenotype of misregulated chromosome condensation that is characteristic for the human disorder, confirming defective <italic>Mcph1</italic> function due to the gene trap mutation. While surprisingly the DNA damage response (formation of repair foci, chromosomal breakage, and G2/M checkpoint function after irradiation) appears to be largely normal in cell cultures derived from Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice, the overall survival rates of the Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> animals are significantly reduced compared to wild type and heterozygous mice. However, we could not detect clear signs of premature malignant disease development due to the perturbed <italic>Mcph1</italic> function. Moreover, the animals show no obvious physical phenotype and no reduced fertility. Body and brain size are within the range of wild type controls. Gene expression on RNA and protein level did not reveal any specific pattern of differentially regulated genes. To the best of our knowledge this represents the first mammalian transgenic model displaying a defect in mitotic chromosome condensation and is also the first mouse model for impaired <italic>Mcph1-</italic>function.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitosis is the fundamental process ensuring the proper segregation of replicated chromatids to the daughter cells. At the beginning of mitosis the apparently amorphous interphase chromatin is organized into individual chromosomes with a pair of separated sister chromatids. This process is referred to as chromosome assembly, implying chromosome condensation and sister chromatid resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Nasmyth1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Swedlow1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The assembled chromosomes become attached to the spindle tubules in prometaphase and sister chromatids are segregated into daughter cells in anaphase. Among the earliest events in mitosis are the onset of chromosome condensation and the separation of mature centrosomes. Cell entry into mitosis is under the control of a tightly regulated network of protein kinases, cyclins and protein phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Pines1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Understanding the structural and molecular basis of mitotic chromosome condensation and segregation remains a basic challenge in cell biology.</p><p>The first description of a disorder in man affecting chromosome condensation was reported in 2002 (OMIM 606858) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Neitzel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Cultures of patients cells display high numbers of prophase-like cells (up to 20&#x00025;) due to premature chromosome condensation (&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a; PCC syndrome) in early G2-phase commencing already 1 hour after completion of S-phase and delayed decondensation post-mitosis. In 2004, we demonstrated that PCC syndrome and MCPH1 primary microcephaly (OMIM 251200) are allelic disorders, both caused by mutations in the <italic>MCPH1</italic> gene (GeneID 79648) encoding microcephalin/BRIT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Trimborn1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Jackson1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The two conditions share the common cellular phenotype of misregulated chromosome condensation. We demonstrated that siRNA-mediated depletion of <italic>MCPH1</italic>-mRNA is sufficient to reproduce this phenotype and that the condensation defect is mediated by condensin II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Trimborn1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Trimborn2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings implicated microcephalin/BRIT1 as a novel regulator of chromosome condensation and linked the apparently disparate fields of neurogenesis and chromosome biology.</p><p>The full length human <italic>MCPH1</italic>-encoded protein microcephalin/BRIT1 encompasses 835 amino acids and has one N-terminal and two C-terminal BRCT-domains (BRCT &#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a; BRCA1 C-terminal). The mouse ortholog shares the same domain structure and encodes a protein of 822 amino acids. The structure is evolutionary conserved in metazoans. Genes with an equivalent structure are even found in the two main invertebrate model organisms, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (GeneID 36372) and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (GeneID 173252) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Ponting1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>BRCT-domains are found predominantly in proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoint control and DNA repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Bork1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Huyton1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it was speculated that microcephalin/BRIT1 might play a role in DNA damage response and checkpoint control, in addition to its role in chromosome condensation. Evidence that microcephalin/BRIT1 might be involved in checkpoint control comes mainly from experiments using RNA interference. A severe impairment of the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint in human U2OS cells was reported after depletion of microcephalin/BRIT1 by RNAi. Microcephalin/BRIT1-depleted U2OS cells displayed a loss of G2/M checkpoint control allowing cells to proceed into mitosis despite exposure to considerable doses of ionizing irradiation (3&#x02013;10 Gy) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Xu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Lin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, protein levels of the checkpoint mediator BRCA1 and the checkpoint kinase CHK1 were decreased following treatment with <italic>MCPH1</italic>-siRNAs. However, in patient cells with <italic>MCPH1</italic> truncating mutations no downregulation of BRCA1 and CHK1 was observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Alderton1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Alderton et al. found microcephalin/BRIT1 to function downstream of CHK1 in the ATR-dependent damage response pathway that affects CDC25A stability and G2/M-checkpoint arrest after replication fork stalling.</p><p>Rai et al. postulated that <italic>MCPH1</italic> is a tumor suppressor gene. Copy number and expression of <italic>MCPH1</italic> were reduced in 35 of 87 (40&#x00025;) advanced epithelial ovarian tumors and in 72&#x00025; of 54 breast cancer specimens. <italic>MCPH1</italic> expression was inversely correlated with genomic instability and metastasis. They also detected a mutation resulting in a premature stop codon in exon 11 and subsequent deletion of the C-terminal BRCT-domains in one of ten breast cancer samples. There was loss of heterozygosity in the other allele of <italic>MCPH1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Rai1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, these authors showed that microcephalin/BRIT1 co-localizes to DNA damage response proteins, such as MDC1, 53BP1, NBS1, and phosphorylated ATM and is required for the activation of these proteins. The mutated <italic>MCPH1</italic>-transcript detected in the breast cancer specimen described above was unable to complement the defective activation of DNA damage response proteins, in contrast to full length <italic>MCPH1</italic>.</p><p>Recently, it was reported that the ability of <italic>hMCPH1</italic> to localize to the sites of DNA double-strand breaks depends on its C-terminal tandem BRCT domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Wood1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and is mediated by phosphorylated H2AX&#x02013;termed &#x003b3;H2AX. These findings correlate with data obtained by the cloning and expression of chicken <italic>Mcph1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Jeffers1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Also very recently it was shown that microcephalin/BRIT1 not only interacts with condensin II in the regulation of chromosome condensation but also in the homologous repair of DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Wood2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition, microcephalin/BRIT1 appears to have also centrosomal functions. Prolonged treatment of <italic>MCPH1</italic> patient lymphoblastoid cell lines with nocodazole results in supernumerary centrosomes, a feature also observed in Seckel syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Alderton1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. It was demonstrated in model organisms that isoforms of microcephalin/BRIT1 localize to the centrosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Jeffers1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Brunk1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> it appears to be essential for the coordination of mitosis in the syncytical embryo as in <italic>mcph1</italic> mutant flies mitotic entry is slowed with prolonged prophase and metaphase stages, while centrosomes are frequently detached and prematurely separated. As a consequence centrosome and nuclear cycles become uncoordinated, resulting in arrested embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Brunk1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Rickmyre1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Microcephaly occurring in MCPH1 primary microcephaly may be due to a defective centrosomal function of microcephalin/BRIT1 influencing the number of proliferative, symmetric cell divisions of neuronal stem cells during neurogenesis.</p><p>Many of the accumulating data reported for microcephalin are based on RNAi-experiments. It will be relevant to back up this information by data provided from model organisms. A model system with misregulated chromosome condensation will also be useful to obtain further insights into the molecular mechanisms shaping the mitotic chromosomes.</p><p>We present here the first mouse model with defective <italic>Mcph1</italic>-function. The model was generated using a mouse embryonic stem cell line containing a gene trap in intron 12 of the <italic>Mcph1</italic> gene (GeneID 244329) deleting the C-terminal BRCT-domain of the protein. In our study we show that the gene trap mutation impairs the function of the protein resulting in misregulated chromosome condensation in proliferating cells of animals homozygous for the trapped allele.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of the Gene Trap Insertion Site</title><p>Long range PCR kit (Roche) was applied for candidate forward primers designed for 5 Kb intervals of intron 12 of the <italic>Mcph1</italic>-gene.

Primer pairs spanning introns 12 or 13 were used for the amplification of the <italic>Mcph1</italic> wild type transcript. The relative quantification was achieved applying the &#x00394;&#x00394;CT method. Normalization was reached using Hprt as endogenous reference gene, and RNA from wild type animals was used for standardization. We compared the expression in liver, brain, and spleen of three Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> animals to three controls by relative quantification. In Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> the mRNA level of wt <italic>Mcph1</italic> was reduced to approximately 9&#x00025;&#x000b1;2.5 in spleen, 19&#x00025;&#x000b1;3.2 in liver, and 28&#x00025;&#x000b1;4.3 in brain, indicating that the <italic>Mcph1</italic> genetrap mutation results - as expected - in a preferential splicing of exon 11 of the <italic>Mcph1</italic>-gene to the gene trap vector. Obviously, however, alternative splicing allows a strongly reduced but still detectable expression of the wild type allele and this expression varies between different tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009242-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Residual wild type protein might be able to exert some function, however with significantly diminished activity due to its reduced abundance. In addition, even the trap-allele may adopt some Mcph1-functions because the genetrap truncates only the C-terminus of the protein. Therefore, we intended to further characterize the expression from both the wild type- and trap-allele. Unfortunately, we were not able to detect the wild type Mcph1 protein by western blotting neither in protein samples from wild type nor Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> animals. Also the &#x003b2;&#x02013;geo reporter was not traceable in Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> neither by X-gal staining nor by anti-&#x003b2;&#x02013;galactosidase antibodies. This may be explained by low expression rates of Mcph1. Therefore, we decided to perform an absolute quantification of the mRNAs of both alleles and an endogenous control gene (<italic>Hprt</italic>) in the different tissues by real time PCR. The results revealed that in comparison to the low-abundant endogenous control gene <italic>Hprt, Mcph1</italic> is expressed at very low levels in all analyzed tissues. In wild type tissues the copy numbers of Mcph1 per microgram RNA compared to Hprt were 3.7&#x000b1;1.6 times less in spleen, 10.7&#x000b1;1.2 times less in liver, and 21.6&#x000b1;3.7 times lower in brain and accordingly even lower in the tissues of the Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> animals (76.9&#x000b1;21.1 times, 45.1&#x000b1;12.1 times, 46.3&#x000b1;3.6, respectively). Thus, our problems detecting the Mcph1 protein can be explained by these very low expression levels. Surprisingly, the analyses also revealed that the gene trap allele is expressed at approximately the same low level as the remaining wild type allele in the tissues of the Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> animals (the ratios of expressed gene trap to wild type allele were 0,85 in brain, 1,07 liver, and 0,68 in spleen, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009242-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). Therefore, the addition of the &#x003b2;-geo cassette may either interfere with the regulation of gene expression or destabilize the mRNA expressed by the trap-allele. Thus, the low expression level not only may explain our problems detecting the reporter protein but also infers that it may not be possible for the fusion protein to substantially adopt Mcph1-functions.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Phenotypic Description of the Mice</title><p>Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> animals did not differ significantly in body weight compared to wild type animals (mean 32.3 g&#x000b1;1.8, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;14 vs. 33.5 g&#x000b1;2.6, n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;12, respectively, unpaired t-testing results in a two-tailed P-value P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.193) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009242-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

For this purpose, we compared one logarithmically growing diploid fibroblast cell line and one transformed cell line from Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice to wild type cell lines in 1 h intervals (1 h&#x02013;4 h) by autoradiography after pulse-labeling with <sup>3</sup>&#x0005b;H&#x0005d;-thymidine for 10 min. N&#x02265;100 prophases or prophase-like cells were scored per time point and per cell line and the proportion of labeled cells was determined. We observed a significant difference between the gt/gt and wt cell lines in the proportion of prophase/prophase-like cells that were labeled within this period. Already 1 h after the pulse, 12&#x00025; of the prophase-like cells of the diploid gt/gt mouse but none of the prophase cells in the control showed 3H-thymidine labeling. After 2 h, 42&#x00025; of PLCs in the diploid Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> cells and 12&#x00025; of the prophases in wt cells were labeled (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009242-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Similar results were obtained for the transformed cell lines. 1 h after the pulse 35&#x00025; of PLCs were labeled in the Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> cell line compared to only 12&#x00025; in the wild type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009242.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Consequently, chromosome condensation in the Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> cells starts in the early G2 phase of the cell cycle as soon as 1 h after the end of the S-phase or even earlier. Thus, the observed premature chromosome condensation phenotype described in the cells of human patients with <italic>MCPH1</italic>-deficiency is also found in mouse cells homozygous for the trap-allele.</p><p>To investigate the chromosome decondensation behavior of the Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> cell lines in the early G1 phase of the cell cycle we treated three logarithmically growing Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> fibroblast cell lines and three wild type fibroblast cell lines with the inhibitor of cytokinesis Cytochalasin B. Treatment with Cytochalasin B results in binucleated cells. Cytological preparations were performed following 2 hs of Cytochalasin treatment. Consequently, all binucleated cells must have exited mitosis within these two hours and, therefore, be in early G1 phase. 19.8&#x00025; (&#x000b1; 2.7) of binucleated Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> cells displayed condensed chromatin, while only 2.8&#x00025; (&#x000b1; 1.2) of wild type binucleated cells showed signs of chromatin condensation, (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;84.32, p&#x0003c;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009242-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, there is a delayed decondensation in Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> cells.</p><p>These data were supported by immunofluorescence analyses. In normal prophases phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (p-H3) usually has spread to the chromosome arms while human MCPH1 cells show prophase like cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle without full phospho-histone H3 labeling (Alderton et al, 2006). Similarly, we observed high numbers of equivalent cells in Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> fibroblast cultures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009242-g004">Figure 4D</xref> shows a cell displaying clearly condensed chromatin with only centromeric p-H3-labeling. These cells are accordingly in G2 and show prophase-like condensation but are different from normal prophases on a molecular level, because in normal prophases histone H3-phosphorylation has spread out over the whole chromosome arms (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009242.s002">Figure S2</xref> for an exemplary normal prophase cell). Pairs of post-mitotic cells can be defined by the formation of a midbody between daughter cells. Following midbody staining with antibodies against Aurora B kinase, we observed a high proportion of post-mitotic cells with clearly condensed chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009242-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).

Likewise, we could not identify any sex specific differences in the breeding success.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>DNA Damage</title><p>Several reports attribute a crucial function in DNA damage response to microcephalin/BRIT1. Xu et al. (2004) and Lin et al. (2005) observed that downregulation of MCPH1 by RNAi impaired the ionizing radiation-induced G2/M checkpoint response in U2OS osteosarcoma cells. In contrast, accurate G2/M checkpoint function had previously been reported in <italic>MCPH1</italic>-mutated patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Neitzel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to examine the DNA-damage induced G2/M checkpoint response in Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mouse fibroblasts, phospho-histone H3 (Ser<sup>10</sup>) (p-H3) expression was studied as a mitotic marker. Using G2 phase irradiation under exactly identical conditions as described by Xu et al. (2004), flow cytometric analysis revealed a decrease of p-H3-positive Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> fibroblasts by 87.2&#x00025; 2 h after provision of 4 Gy. For comparison, wildtype mouse fibroblasts treated in the same way showed a reduction of p-H3-positive cells by 81.2&#x00025;. In triplicate experiments, these figures were not statistically significantly different (single-tailed t-test, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.189). The corresponding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009242-g004">figures 4</xref> h after exposure towards 4 Gy were 86.8&#x00025; p-H3 reduction in Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> fibroblasts and 79.6&#x00025; reduction in wildtype fibroblasts (single-tailed t-test, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.200). Therefore, decreased <italic>Mcph1</italic> expression in Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mouse fibroblasts is not associated with defective G2/M checkpoint functions. These data show that Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mouse fibroblasts can efficiently prevent mitotic entry despite the gene trap mutation.</p><p>Moreover, it was reported that microcephalin function is essential for targeting DNA damage response proteins such as 53BP1 to DNA repair foci at the sites of DNA double strand breaks (Rai et al. 2006). The targeting of microcephalin/BRIT1 itself to the repair foci was assigned to the C-terminal BRCT-domains (Wood et al. 2007; Jeffers et al. 2008). Therefore, we explored whether the gene trap deleting the last C-terminal BRCT domain interfered with foci formation following DNA double strand break induction. In contrast to the reported results, the formation of 53BP1 foci that co-localized to &#x003b3;H2AX-foci seemed not disturbed in diploid fibroblast cell cultures of Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice following 2 hours treatment with 0.5 &#x000b5;g/ml of the radiomimetic agent adriamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009242-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We did not observe any obvious difference in the formation of repair foci compared to wild type cell cultures. Possibly, this may be explained by residual wild type Mcph1 protein. Also the truncated protein produced by the gene trap allele may be sufficient to enable 53BP1 foci formation. Therefore, we repeated the experiment with cultures of transformed fibroblasts of wild type and Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice and depleted the cells of both Mcph1 wild type and Mcph1<sup>gt</sup> alleles by RNAi. Quantitative real time PCR showed that Mcph1 and Mcph1<sup>gt</sup> were efficiently depleted by &#x0003e;70&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009242.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Determination of the number of prophase-like cells confirmed that the depletion was efficient enough to induce the cellular phenotype of misregulated chromosome condensation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009242.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In wild type cells the number of prophase-like cells increased from 2.0&#x00025;&#x000b1;0.3 to 11.8&#x00025;&#x000b1;1.6 after siRNA treatment while the percentage of PLCs was not increased in Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> cells (11.1&#x00025;&#x000b1;2.6 in the mock treated cells, 12,1&#x00025;&#x000b1;2,2 in the siRNA treated cells). Again, there was no obvious difference in the formation of 53BP1-foci between wild type and Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> cells following the induction of DNA double strand breaks for 2 hs with 10 &#x000b5;g/ml bleomycin. Surprisingly, there was also no obvious difference between RNAi treated and mock treated cells neither in wt nor in Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009242-g006">Figure 6B</xref> for overview pictures of the different preparations). To exclude a more subtle effect the different preparations were analyzed quantitatively. Several overview pictures were taken randomly from different areas of each preparation. The pictures were coded and foci numbers in &#x0003e;100 cells were scored for each sample from these coded pictures of single focal planes by four different evaluators in two experiments. Also the quantitative analysis revealed no difference between Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> and wild type cells.

In this study, the C-terminal BRCT-domains were identified to be crucial for E2F1 binding and activation. Therefore, we investigated the effects of the gene trap mutation on gene expression in different tissues on RNA and protein level. We performed expression analyses using Sentrix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Mouse-6 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) comparing gene expression in brain, liver, and spleen of 3 Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> and 3 wildtype animals. (All information including the raw data can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ws.molgen.mpg.de/ws/311013/MIAME.rar">http://ws.molgen.mpg.de/ws/311013/MIAME.rar</ext-link>.) These analyses revealed no specific patterns of differentially regulated genes in the animal bearing the gene trap. In particular, in none of the three analyzed tissues did we find an enrichment of regulated genes in any of the pathways microcephalin/BRIT1 is known to be involved.

Combining the data of all three tissues resulted in 39 genes commonly upregulated and 23 genes commonly downregulated with a P-value &#x02264;0.05 in all three tissues of the Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> animals investigated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009242.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009242.s005">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009242.s006">S2</xref> (D-G)).

A total of 63 protein isoform alterations were found when comparing Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> to control brains. In contrast to the expression profiling, in this assay more protein isoforms (52) appeared to be downregulated than upregulated (11) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0009242.s010">Table S6</xref>). Comparing the Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> data to proteomics studies of three neurodegenerative disorders (ND) it became obvious that the number of changes occurring in the brain of gt/gt mice, however, are a lot less numerous than in ND.

The lower number of changes correlates with a very mild phenotype found in MCPH1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We describe here the first mammalian model with misregulated mitotic chromosome condensation due to defective <italic>Mcph1</italic> function. The gene product of the mouse <italic>Mcph1</italic> gene is truncated by a gene trap within intron 12 of the gene which results in the deletion of the last BRCT-domain of the protein. The observed defect in the regulation of chromosome compaction resembles that observed in human PCC syndrome. The chromatin condenses prematurely in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, shortly after completing replication. Post-mitosis the decondensation of the chromatin is delayed. This results in an elevated fraction of cells with condensed chromatin displaying a prophase-like appearance. This unique cellular phenotype proves that the protein function is impaired although the gene trap results in a deletion of only 97 C-terminal amino acids. In addition, our data suggest that the addition of the &#x003b2;-geo reporter interferes with normal function and/or folding of the protein. In this context it seems noteworthy that in contrast all germ line mutations in human <italic>MCPH1</italic> reported so far affect the N-terminal part of the protein. Also, it was recently reported that it is indeed the N-terminal BRCT-domain that is required for the regulation of chromosome condensation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Wood2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results, however, suggest that the whole Mcph1 protein may be necessary for an unperturbed function in the regulation of chromosome condensation. The observation that the defective chromosome condensation occurs only in the homozygous but not the heterozygous cell lines makes a dominant-negative effect exerted by the &#x003b2;-geo-reporter unlikely.</p><p>Despite the defect in chromosome condensation due to the obviously impaired function of the protein, the Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup>-mice do not show any striking physical phenotype. This may not be really surprising, as the major clinical symptom of the human disorder is the severe microcephaly due to a marked reduction in the size of the cerebral cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Trimborn1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Jackson1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The reduction of the cerebral cortex, however, does not result in significant neurological dysfunction apart from a moderate reduction in cognitive ability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Ponting1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Evolutionary, the enormous encephalization that has occurred in the lineage leading to modern humans is mainly reflected in an increase of the cortical size of the human brain. Therefore, a defect in neurogenic mitosis, which is probably the reason for the microcephaly in humans bearing <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutations, may have only a marginal impact on the formation of mouse brain, that could remain undetected by the methods applied. In this context it should also be noted that the residual expression of the wild type allele was highest in brain (approximately 28&#x00025;) and it is entirely conceivable that the residual protein allows a normal brain development. Also <italic>Mcph1</italic> isoforms that may be unperturbed by the gene trap mutation could substitute for the function of the truncated protein.</p><p>What seems to be more surprising is that meiosis appears to be undisturbed by the defect. At least, we did not observe any limitation in the reproductive capacity of gt/gt mice of both sexes and the morphology of meiosis I spreads of male Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice was normal. Therefore, microcephalin/BRIT1 may either not function in meiotic chromosome condensation or proper meiotic function may not be harmed by an abnormal condensation behavior (undetectable in our preparations). Previously, we have shown that the condensation defect in human cells has no impact on the proper execution of the main mitotic function, that is the segregation of sister chromatids to the daughter cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Neitzel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. However, meiotic division may be more susceptible.

Importantly, several studies assign the decisive role in the execution of the DNA damage response functions of the protein to the C-terminal BRCT-domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Rai1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Wood1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Jeffers1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Deletion of the C-terminal BRCT-domain alone is sufficient to abolish the ability of microcephalin/BRIT1 to form radiation induced foci itself. Moreover, while the exogenous expression of an RNAi-resistant full length MCPH1-transcript was sufficient to rescue this effect of the MCPH1 knockdown, a transcript that was isolated in a human breast cancer specimen lacking the C-terminal BRCT-domains was not able to complement the defect. It was also reported that microcephalin/BRIT1 is involved in transcriptional activation of many important genes of the DNA damage response. Interestingly, it was shown that the C-terminal BRCT domains are also essential in exerting this function.</p><p>Hence, it remains to be explained why our investigations show that repair foci formation, G2/M checkpoint control, and chromosomal breakage rates in the Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> cell cultures are not affected by the genetrap mutation deleting the C-terminal BRCT-domain. Also the expression profiling of the Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice did not show a shifted expression of key components of the DNA damage response network, such as BRCA1 and CHK1 that were published to be affected by MCPH1 knockdowns.</p><p>Certainly, again, it may be possible that residual wild type protein or even the truncated protein encoded by the gene trap allele exert these functions. However, also the depletion of wild type Mcph1 and Mcph1<sup>gt</sup> by RNAi did not impair the formation of 53BP1 foci neither in wt nor in Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> cells. Although it may be possible that the knockdown in our experiments was not efficient enough to induce the damage response phenotype, this seems unlikely as it was efficient enough to induce defective chromosome condensation in wt cells.</p><p>Therefore, although it was shown that Mcph1 co-localizes with &#x003b3;-H2AX in repair foci also in mice cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Wood2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, we can not ultimately rule out that in some aspects the role of Mcph1 in DNA damage response may differ between mice and human. However, also the function of Mcph1 in the regulation of chromosome condensation may be more dosage sensitive than some of its other functions. We can also not exclude that the use of radiomimetics may result in different results compared to double strand break induction by ionizing irradiation.</p><p>In this context it seems noteworthy, that we did not observe radiosensitivity in human MCPH1 patient cell lines bearing homozygous truncating mutations (T143NfsX5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Neitzel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and that 53BP1 also forms regular DNA repair foci that co-localize with &#x003b3;-H2AX in MCPH1 patient fibroblasts (our own unpublished observations).</p><p>Further experiments will be necessary to explain these conflicting results. The more so as, while our manuscript was in revision, another report on the functions of MCPH1 in DNA damage response was published and the authors of this study equally did not observe an effect of the depletion of hMCPH1 on 53BP1 foci formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009242-Wu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, we describe here the first <italic>Mcph1</italic> mouse model. We could show that a mutation caused by a gene trap vector results in impaired Mcph1 function. Evidence comes from the confirmation of the defect in the regulation of chromosome condensation in proliferating cells of the Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup>-mice. This defect resembles that described for PCC syndrome a human genetic disorder caused by <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutations. Most importantly, the overall life span of the Mcph1<sup>gt/gt</sup> is significantly shortened. Thus, the mouse model should prove useful for the further delineating of the consequences of <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutations on patient's health and to unravel the molecular mechanisms which determine microcephalin/BRIT functions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0009242.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Thymidine pulse labeling.
