This type of cancer begins when cells in the breast that line the milk-producing glands or the tubes that take the milk to the nipples (glandular and ductal epithelial cells, respectively) acquire genetic changes that allow them to grow uncontrollably and to move around the body (metastasize). The uncontrolled division leads to the formation of a lump that can be detected by mammography (a breast X-ray) or by manual breast examination. Breast cancer is treated by surgical removal of the lump or, if the cancer has started to spread, by removal of the whole breast (mastectomy). Surgery is usually followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy. These &#x0201c;adjuvant&#x0201d; therapies are designed to kill any remaining cancer cells but can make patients very ill. Generally speaking, the outlook for women with breast cancer is good. In the US, for example, nearly 90&#x00025; of affected women are still alive five years after their diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4a1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Although breast cancer is usually diagnosed in women in their 50s or 60s, some women develop breast cancer much earlier. In these women, the disease is often very aggressive. Compared to older women, young women with breast cancer have a lower overall survival rate and their cancer is more likely to recur locally or to metastasize. It would be useful to be able to recognize those younger women at the greatest risk of cancer recurrence so that they could be offered intensive surveillance and adjuvant therapy; those women at a lower risk could have gentler treatments. To achieve this type of &#x0201c;stratification,&#x0201d; the genetic changes that underlie breast cancer in young women need to be identified. In this study, the researchers discover a gene that is genetically altered (by mutations or deletion) in early-onset breast cancer and then investigate whether its expression can predict outcomes in women with this disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4a1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers used &#x0201c;suppression subtractive hybridization&#x0201d; to identify a new gene in a region of human Chromosome 1 where loss of heterozygosity (LOH; a genetic alteration associated with cancer development) frequently occurs. They called the gene <italic>DEAR1</italic> (<italic>ductal epithelium-associated RING Chromosome 1</italic>) to indicate that it is expressed in ductal and glandular epithelial cells and encodes a &#x0201c;RING finger&#x0201d; protein (specifically, a subtype called a TRIM protein; RING finger proteins such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been implicated in early cancer development and in a large fraction of inherited breast cancers). DEAR1 expression was reduced or lost in several ductal carcinomas in situ (a local abnormality that can develop into breast cancer) and advanced breast cancers, the researchers report. Furthermore, many breast tumors carried <italic>DEAR1</italic> missense mutations (genetic changes that interfere with the normal function of the DEAR1 protein) or had lost both copies of <italic>DEAR1</italic> (the human genome contains two copies of most genes). To determine the function of DEAR1, the researchers replaced a normal copy of <italic>DEAR1</italic> into a breast cancer cell that had a mutation in <italic>DEAR1</italic>. They then examined the growth of these genetically manipulated cells in special three-dimensional cultures. The breast cancer cells without <italic>DEAR1</italic> grew rapidly without an organized structure while the breast cancer cells containing the introduced copy of <italic>DEAR1</italic> formed structures that resembled normal breast acini (sac-like structures that secrete milk). In normal human mammary epithelial cells, the researchers silenced <italic>DEAR1</italic> expression and also showed that without <italic>DEAR1</italic>, the normal mammary cells lost their ability to form proper acini. Finally, the researchers report that <italic>DEAR1</italic> expression (detected &#x0201c;immunohistochemically&#x0201d;) was frequently lost in women who had had early-onset breast cancer and that the loss of <italic>DEAR1</italic> expression correlated with reduced local recurrence-free survival, a strong family history of breast cancer and with a breast cancer subtype that has a poor outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s4a1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings indicate that genetic alteration and loss of expression of <italic>DEAR1</italic> are common in breast cancer. Although laboratory experiments may not necessarily reflect what happens in people, the results from the three-dimensional culture of breast epithelial cells suggest that DEAR1 may regulate the normal acinar structure of the breast. Consequently, loss of <italic>DEAR1</italic> expression could be an early event in breast cancer development. Most importantly, the correlation between <italic>DEAR1</italic> expression and both local recurrence in early-onset breast cancer and a breast cancer subtype with a poor outcome suggests that it might be possible to use DEAR1 expression to identify women with early-onset breast cancer who have an increased risk of local recurrence so that they get the most appropriate treatment for their cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4a1e"><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000068">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000068</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study is further discussed in a <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000073">Perspective by Senthil Muthuswamy</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The US National Cancer Institute provides detailed information for patients and health professionals on all aspects of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/breast">breast cancer</ext-link>, including information on genetic alterations in breast cancer (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The MedlinePlus Encyclopedia provides information for patients about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000913.htm">breast cancer</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/breastcancer.html">MedlinePlus</ext-link> also provides links to many other breast cancer resources (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK charities <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/cancertype/breast">Cancerbackup</ext-link> (now merged with MacMillan Cancer Support) and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=3266">Cancer Research UK</ext-link> also provide detailed information about breast cancer</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in women with an early onset of the disease (&#x02264;45 years of age) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1000068-Jemal1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Biomarkers are urgently needed to identify young women who have an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence and would therefore benefit from heightened surveillance and adjuvant therapy. However, in order to stratify early-onset cancers, the genetic mechanisms that underlie breast cancer in young women must first be elucidated.</p><p>The initiation and progression of breast cancer is thought to involve not only a disruption of cellular pathways that underlie proliferation, differentiation, and death, but also perturbation of extracellular signaling pathways that influence differentiation and tissue architecture. The architecture of the human mammary gland is an elaborate branched ductal lobular network terminating in individual acinar units composed of an inner layer of polarized, luminal epithelial cells surrounding a hollow lumen and an outer layer of myoepithelial cells separated from the stroma by an intact basement membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1000068-Fish1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

Cell growth, differentiation, and death in the mammary epithelium are therefore in an intricate balance, the regulation of which is, at least in part, governed by microenvironmental signals from the extracellular matrix (ECM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1000068-Petersen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Experimental modeling of the ECM using 3D basement membrane culture recapitulates the architecture of mammary ductal epithelium in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1000068-Petersen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1000068-Weaver1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

D. Anderson Cancer tumor bank revealed that 13&#x00025; contained genetic alterations in <italic>DEAR1,</italic> including three missense mutations, three intronic alterations, and a silent mutation not observed in screening controls or the SNP database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000068.s009">Table S2</xref>). One missense mutation was observed in a breast tumor derived from a 36-year-old female, occurring one nucleotide downstream of the 21MT mutation and thereby altering the same codon 187 (CGG&#x02192;CAG, R187Q) as the 21MT cell line mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000068.s009">Table S2</xref>). This mutation was observed in adjacent tissue but not in 136 normal alleles or the SNP database. Two missense mutations were identified in later-onset breast tumor samples, both affecting exon 5 (GTC&#x02192;ATC, V473I and GTC&#x02192;ATC, V350I) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000068.s009">Table S2</xref>) and present in both tumor and adjacent normal samples but not in controls or the SNP database. In addition, the exon 5 mutation was not observed in normal lymph node from the same individual whose tumor contained the codon 473 mutation, indicating that the sequence alteration in the tumor was a somatic mutation of the <italic>DEAR1</italic> sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We also identified a HD in a primary tumor (9BT) obtained from a 39-year-old with triple-negative breast cancer. The deletion maps within the core promoter region of <italic>DEAR1</italic> using PMA (assays 1 and 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000068.s010">Table S3</xref>) on bisulfite-treated DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>). Genomic PCR confirmed the HD using STS markers that spanned microsatellite sequences MS1 and MS2, located upstream of the <italic>DEAR1</italic> core promoter and in the first intron, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000068.s010">Table S3</xref>). Results indicated that the MS1 region upstream of the 5&#x02032; UTR was retained in the 9BT sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), thus mapping the breakpoint distal to MS1 and spanning the region identified by PMA. The distal boundary of the deletion was identified using primers that detected microsatellite sequence MS3 downstream of MS2 in intron 1, indicating that the HD encompassed the promoter and exon 1 with retention of exon 2 (MS3). Subsequent PMA detected a deletion of both the <italic>CHD5</italic> and <italic>p73</italic> genes, which lie distal to <italic>DEAR1</italic> in Chromosome 1p, suggestive of a terminal deletion of one allele with a breakpoint within the <italic>DEAR1</italic> promoter, which then resulted in LOH encompassing two distal candidate tumor suppressors on Chromosome 1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Importantly, the HD was detected by two separate methodologies, indicating a breakpoint in both alleles within the <italic>DEAR1</italic> promoter region. Thus, within a region of LOH for breast cancer and multiple epithelial tumors, we have identified a HD in an early-onset breast tumor. Additionally, because PMA detected heterozygous deletion of distal genes to <italic>DEAR1</italic>, and genomic PCR detected the HD limited to the <italic>DEAR1</italic> promoter and exon 1, our results are consistent with a microdeletion in one allele and a terminal deletion with a breakpoint in the promoter of <italic>DEAR1</italic> in the second allele, thereby deleting the entire <italic>DEAR1</italic> coding region as well as the distal arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). The PMA analysis of 14 breast cancer cell lines and 20 tumor samples did not reveal promoter methylation in any of the samples.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>DEAR1 Restores Acinar Morphogenesis in 3D Basement Membrane Culture</title><p>In order to determine if the mutations in <italic>DEAR1</italic> are important to the genesis or progression of breast cancer and are not mere &#x0201c;passenger&#x0201d; mutations, we performed functional assays. To determine the effect of genetic complementation of the missense mutation affecting codon 187 in the breast cancer progression model as well as in a breast tumor sample, full-length <italic>DEAR1</italic> wild type and R187W mutant cDNA were introduced into 21MT to generate stable transfectants. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed up-regulation of DEAR1 RNA levels following stable transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). cDNA sequencing confirmed expression of predominant wild-type <italic>DEAR1</italic> transcripts in 21MT/J and 21MT/L transfectants and as well as the R187W mutant transcripts in control 21MT/&#x00394; (unpublished data). Protein expression levels on Western analyses were very similar among transfectants and controls, including HMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g002">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1000068.s004">S4</xref>). 21MT cells, wild-type transfectants (21MT/J) and (21MT/L), and R187W transfectant 21MT/&#x00394; were then plated in 3D basement membrane culture. Results indicated that over 60&#x00025; of 21MT cells in 3D culture formed large, disorganized structures as determined by staining with propidium iodide followed by visualization using confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Introduction of the tumor-associated R187W missense mutation in 21MT/&#x00394; also resulted in a similar percentage of large, irregularly shaped multiacinar structures as observed in 21MT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). However, introduction of wild-type <italic>DEAR1</italic> into 21MT cells resulted in acinar morphogenesis with &#x0003e;80&#x00025; of wild-type transfectants producing small, spherical acini. Forty percent of these structures contained a central lumen surrounded by a single layer of polarized epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g004">Figure 4B and 4D</xref> &#x0005b;<italic>i</italic>&#x0005d;) unlike the vast majority of multiacinar structures observed in 21MT and missense mutant controls as visualized by confocal and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g004">Figure 4B, 4C, and 4D</xref> &#x0005b;<italic>i</italic>&#x0005d;).

Staining with E-cadherin allowed the visualization of cell&#x02013;cell contacts and emphasized the distorted cell structures in 21MT and 21MT/&#x00394; in which cells of various sizes and shapes were observed with many misshapen cells visualized by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g004">Figure 4D</xref> &#x0005b;<italic>ii</italic>&#x0005d;). 21MT and 21MT/&#x00394; transfectants in 3D culture also showed diminished polarized expression of alpha-6-integrin, which is normally expressed on the basolateral surface at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast to 21MT and 21MT/&#x00394;, E-cadherin staining in wild-type <italic>DEAR1</italic> transfectants was properly localized at cell&#x02013;cell contacts. Furthermore, acini displayed uniform cell size and clear basal orientation of nuclei with increased basal localization of alpha-6 integrin, indicating a restoration of ordered acinar architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g004">Figure 4D</xref> &#x0005b;<italic>iii</italic>&#x0005d;). Furthermore, caspase 3 staining detected active luminal apoptosis in day 13 acinar structures in wild-type transfectant clones, recapitulating a defined event in normal mammary acinar morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1000068-g004">Figure 4D</xref> &#x0005b;<italic>iii</italic>&#x0005d;).

Elegant studies using 3D culture have allowed the experimental targeted manipulation of key signaling pathways that dramatically altered the differentiation state of invasive tumor cells to one resembling a more normal cell phenotype irrespective of the genetic alterations in the tumor cell genome. Thus, although it is experimentally feasible to phenotypically alter the ECM and the growth of tumor cells in vivo and in vitro, we now have genotypically complemented a tumor-associated mutation, indicating that replacement of a single gene can restore epithelial differentiation despite multiple genetic abnormalities in a breast cancer cell line and, furthermore, that <italic>DEAR1</italic> is a dominant regulator of an important pathway to tumorigenesis in early-onset breast cancer.</p><p>In that regard, critical pathways underlying transformation and malignant progression in mammary tumorigenesis involve a disruption of normal controls on proliferation, on epithelial architecture and polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1000068-Fish1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1000068-Petersen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In mammalian cells, mechanisms governing polarity and proliferation have been shown to involve separate pathways. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling through AKT drives proliferation in mammary acini, whereas PI3K&#x02013;RAC signaling is necessary for loss of tissue organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1000068-Liu1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

Also of importance is the recent finding of Bagchi et al. in which chromosome engineering identified <italic>CHD5</italic> as a candidate tumor suppressor within Chromosome 1p36, distal to <italic>DEAR1</italic> at 1p35.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1000068-Bagchi1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>CHD5</italic> maps to a region associated with LOH in epithelial tumors, as well as brain tumors and hematopoietic neoplasms, suggesting that <italic>CHD5</italic> is a critical player in many types of cancer. Interestingly, in the breast tumor sample showing HD for <italic>DEAR1</italic>, one copy of Chromosome 1p contains a microdeletion of <italic>DEAR1</italic>, while the second copy deletes the entire short arm, including <italic>CHD5</italic>, but the breakpoint for the deletion lies within <italic>DEAR1</italic>. <italic>CHD5</italic> maps to a genomic interval associated with LOH in late-stage tumors; thus, the finding that <italic>DEAR1</italic> seems to play a role in the earliest stages of breast tumorigenesis would suggest a mechanism for mutation or deletion of <italic>DEAR1</italic> as an initiating event that could lead to the LOH for distal Chromosome 1p loci and thus haploinsufficiency of <italic>CHD5</italic>.</p><p>The present study also describes the potential clinical significance of <italic>DEAR1</italic> genetic alteration and loss of expression in breast tumorigenesis. Mutation and homozygous deletion of <italic>DEAR1</italic> were discovered in young women. We therefore examined the 21T series as a model to determine if <italic>DEAR1</italic> could be functionally linked to early onset disease. Our data indicate that <italic>DEAR1</italic> mutation and loss of function play a role in early-onset disease. These data do not indicate, however, that <italic>DEAR1</italic> does not play a role in breast cancer in older women or that DEAR1 discriminates breast cancers by age. Rather, these data highlight that <italic>DEAR1</italic> plays a role in the etiology of breast cancer in young women. Intriguingly, <italic>DEAR1</italic> maps to a genomic interval for which both linkage and LOH in familial breast cancers have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1000068-Milikan1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data demonstrate that in our young cohort, DEAR1 correlates significantly with triple-negative cancers as well as a strong family history of breast cancer. Thus, it is a formal possibility that <italic>DEAR1</italic> loss of function and mutation might play an important role in germline predisposition to breast cancer or that <italic>DEAR1</italic> lies in a critical genetic pathway involved in both inherited and sporadic breast cancer. The loss of function of upstream pathway members could inactivate <italic>DEAR1</italic> expression, a potential explanation for the higher frequency of loss of expression than mutation that we observed.</p><p><italic>DEAR1</italic> expression was also a statistically significant prognostic marker for local recurrence-free survival over 20 y postsurgery. Previously, this cohort had been examined for markers that might predict local recurrence, including ER, PR, HER-2/neu, p53, and cytokeratin 19; however, only cytokeratin 19 was statistically significant for predicting local recurrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1000068-Parikh1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. The finding that <italic>DEAR1</italic> expression independently predicts local recurrence in early onset disease is important given that local recurrence following breast conservation surgery in younger women is a major clinical issue. Young women with breast cancer have significantly higher rates of local recurrence than older women, with local recurrence following breast conservation therapy and radiotherapy occurring earlier and with a worse prognosis in many studies than in older cohorts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1000068-Fisher1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed.1000068-Haffty2">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Thus, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic markers to identify women with a heightened risk of recurrence for which more aggressive surveillance and treatment might be warranted, as well as individuals with favorable prognosis who might be spared rigorous therapeutic regimens and for whom breast conservation treatment might be the preferred surgical option. Our data suggest that <italic>DEAR1</italic> loss of function may play an important role in the loss of differentiation and the poor outcome associated with a high frequency of early-onset cancers. The finding that <italic>DEAR1</italic> correlates with the triple-negative breast cancer subtype also suggests an impact of loss of <italic>DEAR1</italic> expression on the differentiated state in this subtype of basal tumors of the breast. Thus, the clear delineation between <italic>DEAR1</italic> expression and recurrence, and the correlation of <italic>DEAR1</italic> expression with the subtype of breast tumors with poor prognosis, suggest that <italic>DEAR1</italic> is an important biomarker for stratifying early-onset disease; and these data in conjunction with its role as a dominant mediator of differentiation in 3D culture point to a critical role for <italic>DEAR1</italic> in a genetic pathway that is important in early-onset breast cancer, the elucidation of which could have an important impact on early detection and targeted therapy for malignancies of the breast.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1000068.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Suppression subtractive hybridization cloning of <italic>DEAR1</italic>.
