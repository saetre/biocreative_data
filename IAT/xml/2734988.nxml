In contrast, recent studies have proposed that, in response to doxorubicin, NF-&#x003ba;B can be pro-apoptotic through repression of anti-apoptotic target genes. However, there is little evidence analyzing the outcome of NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition on the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in studies describing pro-apoptotic NF-&#x003ba;B activity. In this study, we further characterize the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B in response to doxorubicin and evaluate its role in chemotherapy-induced cell death in sarcoma cells where NF-&#x003ba;B is reported to be pro-apoptotic. Doxorubicin treatment in U2OS cells induced canonical NF-&#x003ba;B activity as evidenced by increased nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated p65 at serine 536 and increased DNA&#x02013;binding activity. Co-treatment with a small molecule IKK&#x003b2; inhibitor, Compound A, abrogated this response. RT&#x02013;PCR evaluation of anti-apoptotic gene expression revealed that doxorubicin-induced transcription of cIAP2 was inhibited by Compound A, while doxorubicin-induced repression of other anti-apoptotic genes was unaffected by Compound A or siRNA to p65. Furthermore, the combination of doxorubicin and canonical NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition with Compound A or siRNA to p65 resulted in decreased cell viability measured by trypan blue staining and MTS assay and increased apoptosis measured by cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and cleaved caspase 3 when compared to doxorubicin alone. Our results demonstrate that doxorubicin-induced canonical NF-&#x003ba;B activity associated with phosphorylated p65 is anti-apoptotic in its function and that doxorubicin-induced repression of anti-apoptotic genes occurs independent of p65. Therefore, combination therapies incorporating NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitors together with standard chemotherapies remains a viable method to improve the clinical outcomes in patients with advanced stage malignancies.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nuclear Factor-&#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) plays a major role in a number of oncogenic processes, including development, metastasis and treatment outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Basseres1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Shen1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. This family of evolutionarily conserved transcription factors (p65 or RelA, p50/p105, p52/p100, RelB and cRel), which share a common Rel homology domain, typically exists as homo- or hetero-dimers in the cytoplasm where they are bound by inhibitory &#x003ba;B proteins (I&#x003ba;B), such as I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;. In response to a variety of stimuli, the inhibitory &#x003ba;B kinase (IKK) complex, consisting of two catalytic subunits (IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2;) and a regulatory subunit (IKK&#x003b3;/NEMO), can phosphorylate the I&#x003ba;B proteins targeting them for degradation by the 26S proteasome. As a result, NF-&#x003ba;B is released and can translocate to the nucleus to modulate gene transcription. A number of target genes have been identified, including anti-apoptotic proteins, proteins involved in angiogenesis, and proteins regulating cellular proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Kim1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Shen1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The activation of anti-apoptotic gene transcription by NF-&#x003ba;B has been linked to the ability of malignancies to resist the cytotoxic effects of standard chemotherapeutics. Previous work from our laboratory and others has demonstrated that NF-&#x003ba;B is activated in response to a number of chemotherapies and irradiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Wang1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically, in fibrosarcoma cells, the induction of NF-&#x003ba;B activity by etoposide resulted in increased expression of A1/Bfl-1 while inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B blocked the induction of A1/Bfl-1 and resulted in enhanced etoposide-induced cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Wang2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover in colon cancer cells, NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition combined with CPT-11 (active metabolite of camptothecin) resulted in decreased xenograft growth when compared to chemotherapy alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Cusack1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Cusack2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar effects of NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition have also been demonstrated in lung cancer and breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Chen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Gangadharan1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies collectively support an important role for NF-&#x003ba;B in the chemoresistance of solid tumors.</p><p>However, some recent reports have challenged this model and proposed that NF-&#x003ba;B activity seen in response to DNA damage induced by ultraviolet radiation and chemotherapeutics can function to promote cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Ashikawa1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Ho1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The most common stimuli used to reportedly induce pro-apoptotic NF-&#x003ba;B activity are the anthracycline, doxorubicin, and its analogues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Ashikawa1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Ho1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Two distinct mechanisms have been proposed to mediate this effect. Campbell et al. demonstrated that in osteosarcoma cells daunorubicin induces recruitment of NF-&#x003ba;B together with histone deacetylases to silence the transcription of Bcl-xL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Campbell1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, Ho et al. demonstrate that treatment of breast cancer cells with doxorubicin generates an NF-&#x003ba;B complex that is deficient in both phosphorylation and acetylation and represses anti-apoptotic gene transcription in a mechanism independent of histone deacetylases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Ho1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies further suggest that NF-&#x003ba;B activation may be required for doxorubicin to induce cell death and therefore that combining targeted NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition could actually serve to counteract the desired cell killing effects of chemotherapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Campbell1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Ho1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. While these two studies describe mechanisms by which NF-&#x003ba;B can silence the expression of selective genes, there is little evidence in the literature demonstrating that inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activity renders chemotherapy less effective.</p><p>Answering this question is critical to determining the potential benefits or hazards to employing NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition as an adjunct to standard chemotherapy. Currently, the primary chemotherapy treatment of advanced stage sarcomas is doxorubicin, which only yields a 15&#x02013;35&#x00025; response rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Thornton1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Hueman1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This dismal response, in combination with the fact that the therapeutic options have not changed in 20 years, highlights the highly chemoresistant nature of this disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Thornton1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. As such, we employed the osteosarcoma model used by Campbell et al. in order to further evaluate and characterize the response of NF-&#x003ba;B to doxorubicin, specifically focusing on determining whether the induced activation of NF-&#x003ba;B is pro- or anti-apoptotic. To that end, in this study, we demonstrate that doxorubicin-induced repression of certain anti-apoptotic genes occurs through a mechanism that is independent of canonical NF-&#x003ba;B activity. Moreover, we show that doxorubicin-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activity in sarcomas is transcriptionally active and that targeted inhibition of canonical NF-&#x003ba;B activation enhances the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin through increased apoptotic cell death.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Compound A blocks doxorubicin-induced activation of canonical NF-&#x003ba;B</title><p>Initially, we sought to characterize the effects of IKK inhibition using the small molecule IKK&#x003b2; inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Ziegelbauer1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, Compound A, on the ability of doxorubicin to activate NF-&#x003ba;B. To that end, U2OS cells were stimulated with doxorubicin (2 &#x000b5;M) for 3 hours with or without a one hour pretreatment with Compound A (5 &#x000b5;M). Cells treated with DMSO served as controls. Activation of the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway was assessed by measuring the phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; at the serine 32 and 36 residues (<italic>p</italic>-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;<sup>32,36</sup>). Additionally, we evaluated the phosphorylation status of p65 at the serine 536 residue (<italic>p</italic>-p65<sup>536</sup>) as this modification has been shown to be important for transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Basseres1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Together these results demonstrate that doxorubicin activates the canonical NF-&#x003ba;B pathway and that targeting the IKK complex with Compound A efficiently blocks doxorubicin-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activity.

Consistent with the EMSA results, U2OS cells treated with doxorubicin for 3 and 6 hours had a significant increase in nuclear translocation of p65 when compared to DMSO-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006992-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

These results confirm that in response to doxorubicin, U2OS cells activate NF-&#x003ba;B leading to its accumulation in the nucleus.

Following treatment with doxorubicin alone or in combination with Compound A for 3 and 6 hours, total RNA was extracted and evaluated for mRNA levels of potential NF-&#x003ba;B target genes by real time RT-PCR. First, we analyzed the effects of doxorubicin treatment on the transcription of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, as it is directly regulated by NF-&#x003ba;B. Following three hours of doxorubicin stimulation, we determined that the mRNA levels of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; were increased nearly 5-fold compared to DMSO-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006992-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). By 6 h, the transcriptional activation began to subside and only a 2-fold elevation in I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; mRNA was identified. This pattern of induction corresponds to the strong induction of p65 phosphorylation described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006992-g001">Figure 1A and 1C</xref>).

Doxorubicin treatment increased transcription of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and cIAP2, decreased transcription of XIAP, Survivin, Bcl-xL, and Bcl2, and did not alter cIAP1 transcription (black bars). Inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activation with Cmpd A blocked the induction of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and cIAP2, but had no effect on the doxorubicin-mediated repression of the other anti-apoptotic genes (gray bars). (B) U2OS cells were transfected with either a non-targeting control siRNA (siCont) or siRNA directed against p65 (sip65). After 48 h incubation, the cells were treated with doxorubicin (Dox) for 12 hours and changes in levels of anti-apoptotic proteins were assessed by western blot. Knockdown of the p65 subunit decreased the basal expression of cIAP2, but did not alter baseline protein levels of XIAP, Bcl-xL, or Survivin.

We selected genes that belong to both the Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (IAP) family and the Bcl-2-like protein family as they have been reported to be NF-&#x003ba;B regulated, both positively and negatively, in various cellular model systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Shen1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, we determined that doxorubicin treatment had varying effects on these genes. While there was no effect of doxorubicin on the expression of cIAP1 compared to DMSO-treated controls, there was a significant 2.5-fold induction of cIAP2 mRNA transcription following 3 hours of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006992-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). On the other hand, when we examined other IAPs, we found that exposure to doxorubicin resulted in transcriptional repression of XIAP and Survivin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006992-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly, doxorubicin's ability to silence gene expression was also seen with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006992-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with the results seen by Campbell et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Campbell1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>However, in cells pretreated with Compound A prior to doxorubicin stimulation, we discovered that NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition had no effect on basal expression of cIAP1, although combination treatment did result in a modest decrease in cIAP1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006992-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). When we evaluated cIAP2, we found that the addition of Compound A successfully inhibited the doxorubicin-induced increase in transcription, in addition to substantially decreasing basal mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006992-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Contrary to these results, combining NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition with doxorubicin did not alter the pattern of transcriptional repression of XIAP, Survivin, Bcl-2, or Bcl-xL seen in cells treated with doxorubicin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006992-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). These results provide further evidence that NF-&#x003ba;B is transcriptionally active in response to doxorubicin as evidenced by the regulation of cIAP2, which mirror the results seen with I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;. Moreover, our data reveal that the ability of doxorubicin to cause transcriptional repression of the anti-apoptotic genes XIAP, Survivin, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL is not dependent on NF-&#x003ba;B activity, at least that regulated by IKK&#x003b2;.</p><p>In order to expand on these results and further evaluate if the effects at the mRNA level translated to protein expression, we selectively depleted the p65 subunit in U2OS cells using siRNA and then evaluated the effects of doxorubicin treatment on anti-apoptotic proteins. Cells transfected with a non-targeting siRNA (siCont) served as controls. The successful depletion of p65 was confirmed using western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006992-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the increased transcription of cIAP2 did not translate to increased protein levels following exposure to doxorubicin. However, in the absence of p65, the levels of cIAP2 were significantly decreased basally and in response to doxorubicin (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). On the other hand, similar to the transcriptional results seen with Compound A, the knockdown of p65 did not alter the baseline protein expression of XIAP, Survivin, or Bcl-xL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006992-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

These results in combination with the transcriptional results seen using IKK inhibition support a role for NF-&#x003ba;B in both basal and doxorubicin-induced expression of cIAP2, and further suggest that NF-&#x003ba;B canonical activity is not mechanistically important for doxorubicin-induced repression of anti-apoptotic genes such as XIAP, Survivin, and Bcl-xL.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition enhances the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin through increased apoptosis</title><p>Having established that NF-&#x003ba;B activity has a selective transcriptional effect on cIAP2 and no effect on the doxorubicin-induced repression of other anti-apoptotic genes, we then explored the outcome of NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition on the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin.

This difference in exposure to doxorubicin suggests that an earlier assessment of response may be critical to identify changes in p65 phosphorylation. The importance of early evaluation of treatments on NF-&#x003ba;B activity is also evident in the assessment of transcriptional targets, as this early increase in <italic>p</italic>-p65<sup>536</sup> did correlate with increased transcription of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and cIAP2. On the other hand, Ho et al. demonstrated that doxorubicin treatment in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells did not increase p65 phosphorylation at serine 536 at any time from 10 minutes up to 24 hours and concordantly demonstrated a decrease in cIAP2 transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Ho1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, identifying the presence or absence of this modification could serve as a marker to determine whether canonical NF-&#x003ba;B activated by chemotherapeutics is transcriptionally active or repressive, respectively.</p><p>In addition to the absence of post-translational phosphorylation at serine 536, reports in the literature supporting a repressive function for NF-&#x003ba;B have relied on evaluating a limited subset of anti-apoptotic genes and correlating those expression patterns with luciferase reporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Campbell1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Ho1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Campbell2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this correlation can be difficult in the setting of transient activation of NF-&#x003ba;B and time required to accumulate firefly luciferase for an accurate reading. For instance in U2OS cells, we reveal that the induction of transcription of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and cIAP2 is identified early following 3 hours of doxorubicin treatment, and subsequently declines. Under such conditions, the use of a luciferase reporter assay, which requires sufficient treatment times to allow for translation and accumulation of firefly luciferase, may not accurately depict the subtle changes at individual promoters at shorter time points. This issue is evident in our study, where despite identifying increased mRNA levels for two NF-&#x003ba;B target genes, the NF-&#x003ba;B luciferase reporter assay shows decreased expression of the reporter gene in cells treated with doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006992.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

As a result, in the present study we incorporated several techniques to assess the outcome of combining targeted NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition with chemotherapy on cell growth, cell number and apoptosis. Using the IKK&#x003b2; inhibitor, Compound A, we illustrate that blocking the induction of NF-&#x003ba;B activity can enhance the efficacy of doxorubicin, as evidenced by decreased cell growth and increased levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved Caspase 3. We then further confirmed that canonical NF-&#x003ba;B signaling is important to the chemoresistance of U2OS cells by showing similar increases in apoptosis when cells were first depleted of p65 using siRNA prior to treatment with doxorubicin. Based on these results, NF-&#x003ba;B is anti-apoptotic in its function in response to doxorubicin and inhibiting the activation of canonical NF-&#x003ba;B is an effective means for overcoming the chemoresistance in sarcomas.</p><p>However, the mechanism underlying the anti-apoptotic function of NF-&#x003ba;B in U2OS cells remains elusive. In light of the fact that selective depletion of cIAP2 did not generate enhanced apoptosis (data not shown), the classical model of NF-&#x003ba;B-mediated induction of anti-apoptotic genes may not be sufficient, in and of itself, to explain the added benefits seen in the combination treatment groups.

In our study we demonstrate that doxorubicin treatment induces an increase in nuclear accumulation of p52, and we further show that IKK inhibition with Compound A abrogates this response. Further studies will be necessary to determine if the increase in nuclear p52 is the result of true activation of the non-canonical pathway through IKK&#x003b1;-mediated phosphorylation of p100 and its subsequent cleavage to p52, or if there are other mechanisms downstream of IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2; that are driving additional NF-&#x003ba;B subunits to the nucleus. In addition to determining the mechanism leading to increased nuclear p52, it will be important to identify its contribution to chemoresistance in response to doxorubicin. Although we demonstrate that its knockdown in isolation did not enhance cell death, p52 may contribute in other ways to the ability of U2OS cells to evade cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy. Specifically, further investigation of the potential role of p52 in the regulation of the cell cycle in osteosarcoma cells treated with doxorubicin will be important as others demonstrated p52's ability to influence the expression of several key cell cycle regulators such as Cyclin D1 and p21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Nadiminty1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006992-Schumm1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, as the drive to design and discover new cancer therapeutics continues, it is important to realize the importance of the IKK&#x003b1; subunit in cancer chemoresistance.
