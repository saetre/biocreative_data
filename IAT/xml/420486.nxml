The human homologue of PLC&#x003b4;4 has not been extensively characterized. Accordingly, we investigate the effects of overexpression of human PLC&#x003b4;4 on cell signaling and proliferation in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The cDNA for human PLC&#x003b4;4 has been isolated and expressed ectopically in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Overexpression of PLC&#x003b4;4 selectively activates protein kinase C-&#x003c6; and upregulates the expression of epidermal growth factor receptors EGFR/erbB1 and HER2/erbB2, leading to constitutive activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathway in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells stably expressing PLC&#x003b4;4 demonstrates several phenotypes of transformation, such as rapid proliferation in low serum, formation of colonies in soft agar, and capacity to form densely packed spheroids in low-attachment plates. The growth signaling responses induced by PLC&#x003b4;4 are not reversible by siRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overexpression or dysregulated expression of PLC&#x003b4;4 may initiate oncogenesis in certain tissues through upregulation of ErbB expression and activation of ERK pathway. Since the growth responses induced by PLC&#x003b4;4 are not reversible, PLC&#x003b4;4 itself is not a suitable drug target, but enzymes in pathways activated by PLC&#x003b4;4 are potential therapeutic targets for oncogenic intervention.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) plays a role in the inositol phospholipid signaling by hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>). This reaction produces two intracellular second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which cause the increase of intracellular calcium concentration and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition to hydrolyzing PIP<sub>2</sub>, PI-PLC can also utilize phosphatidylinositol (PI) or PI-4-phosphate as substrates.</p><p>The PLC family in murine or human species is comprised of 11 subtypes. On the basis of their structure, they have been divided into four classes, &#x003b2; (&#x003b2;1, 2, 3 and 4), &#x003b3; (&#x003b3;1 and 2), &#x003b4; (&#x003b4;1, 3 and 4), &#x003b5;, and &#x003b6; types. Positive regulation mechanisms of PLC by association with membrane receptors are well characterized in &#x003b2;- and &#x003b3;-type isozymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. &#x003b2;-type isozymes are activated by the G<sub>&#x003b1; </sub>or G<sub>&#x003b2;&#x003b3; </sub>subunit released from heterotrimeric G<sub>&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3; </sub>proteins after ligand stimulation. &#x003b3;-type isozymes are activated by the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues through the activation of receptor or nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. &#x003b5;-type enzymes possess both PLC and ras dependent guanine nucleotide exchange (RasGEF) activity. As such, PLC&#x003b5; may mediate the effects of G protein-coupled receptors through two divergent pathways involving PI hydrolysis as well as direct activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. PLC&#x003b6;, a sperm protein that shows similarity to a truncated PLC&#x003b4; with the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain deleted, is involved in the triggering of Ca<sup>++ </sup>oscillations in eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]; however, it remains to be documented whether PLC&#x003b6; does have PLC enzymatic activity.</p><p>The regulation of &#x003b4;-type PLC activity is less understood; however, certain isoforms of &#x003b4;-type PLC such as &#x003b4;1 can be regulated through interaction with a dual function G-protein (G<sub>h</sub>) that also has transglutaminase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Another &#x003b4;-type PLC isozyme known as PLC&#x003b4;4 has been implicated to have a key role in cell proliferation, as its mRNA is expressed in higher levels in regenerating liver than in normal resting liver and in tumor cells such as hepatoma and src-transformed cells than in non-transformed cells. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining showed that the murine PLC&#x003b4;4 is predominantly present in nuclei with its expression level markedly induced by serum in serum-starved murine cells, whereas the amounts of PLC&#x003b2;1, PLC&#x003b3;1, and PLC&#x003b4;1 do not change significantly after serum stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The rat PLC&#x003b4;4 level has also been found to be markedly elevated in a fast proliferating hepatoma H3924A cell line comparing to a slow growing hepatoma H7795 line; however, immunohistochemical staining and western analysis of subcellular fractions show rat PLC&#x003b4;4 is mainly expressed in the cytoplasmic fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These results suggest that PLC&#x003b4;4 is expressed in response to mitogenic stimulation and plays important roles in cell growth and tumorigenesis. Splice variants of rat PLC&#x003b4;4 with enzymatic PLC activities or with dominant-negative activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and the promoter region of murine PLC&#x003b4;4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] have also been described. Gene knockout by homologous recombination shows PLC&#x003b4;4<sup>-/- </sup>sperms are not able to initiate the acrosome reaction required for egg fertilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Despite the extensive characterization of the murine or rat PLC&#x003b4;4 enzyme, the effect of overexpression of the human form of PLC&#x003b4;4 in cells has not been characterized. This paper reports the molecular cloning of human PLC&#x003b4;4 and examines the signaling pathways that are affected by ectopic expression of PLC&#x003b4;4 in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Human PLC&#x003b4;4 expression in normal and tumor tissues</title><p>Based on sequence homology with the rat PLC&#x003b4;4, we have assembled a full-length cDNA for human PLC&#x003b4;4. More recent search of the Genbank database showed the coding region of our human PLC&#x003b4;4 cDNA matches 100% with an annotated protein product from the Mammalian Gene Collection (GenBank# BC006355), suggesting no PCR errors were introduced during the assembly of our full length clone. Alignment of the PLC&#x003b4;4 cDNA sequence with human genome <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway"/> shows PLC&#x003b4;4 gene to be located at chromosome 2q35 and contains 16 exons that span about 30 kbp. In addition to the full length PLC&#x003b4;4 clone, a splice variant of PLC&#x003b4;4, PLC&#x003b4;4b, with exons 7, 8, and 9 deleted was isolated, resulting in the introduction of a premature stop codon after amino acid residue 274. Scanning of protein motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] within the human PLC&#x003b4;4 coding sequence identified a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, EF-hand domains, PI-PLC-X and PI-PLC-Y catalytic domains, and a C2 domain that are commonly found in PLC&#x003b4; proteins, whereas PLC&#x003b4;4b contains only the coding regions for the PH and EF-hand domains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Northern blot analysis of normal tissues using human PLC&#x003b4;4 cDNA as a probe shows PLC&#x003b4;4 is most highly expressed in skeletal muscle and kidney tissues, and at moderate level in intestinal tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lower left panel). To assess the relative abundance of full length PLC&#x003b4;4 and splice variant PLC&#x003b4;4b, primers located upstream and downstream of the coding region for exons 7, 8, and 9 were used to detect PCR products generated from cDNA samples derived from various normal human tissues. For all tissues where full length PLC&#x003b4;4 (800 bp product) can be detected, the splice variant PLC&#x003b4;4b (300 bp product) can also be detected readily (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lower right panel). To test whether PLC&#x003b4;4 may be differentially expressed in certain normal vs tumor cells, we examined the expression of PLC&#x003b4;4 using Cancer Profiling Arrays (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) that contain hundreds of genetically matched cDNA pairs isolated from tumor and normal tissue samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Consistent with data from Northern analysis, normal tissues from kidneys show the highest expression of PLC&#x003b4;4, and the moderate expression of PLC&#x003b4;4 in normal intestinal tissues can also be extended to stomach, colon, and rectal tissues from the rest of the alimentary tract. PLC&#x003b4;4 expression is found to be downregulated in a high percentage of these tumor tissues as well as in prostate, vulva, thyroid, skin, and pancreatic tissues, whereas PLC&#x003b4;4 expression is found to be upregulated in a high percentage (&#x0003e;25%) of breast and testicular tumor tissues and in a low percentage (&#x0003c;5%) of lung and uterine tumor tissues, when compared to the corresponding normal tissues.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Linear map of hPLC&#x003b4;4 isoforms and expression in normal tissues</bold>.

When using PIP<sub>2 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, panel A) as the substrate, PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing clones in MCF-7 cell extracts show about 3 to 5 fold increase in PLC activity when compared to cells (~25 nmol/min/mg) transfected with a control vector expressing EGFP (Clonetech, Palo Alto, CA); whereas with PI as the substrate, PLC&#x003b4;4a overexpressing clones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, panel B) show about 20 to 50 fold increase in PLC activity when compared to untransfected MCF-7 cells (~6 nmol/min/mg) or cells transfected with a control vector. These results show the human PLC&#x003b4;4 cDNA isolated does encode an active enzyme with PLC activity. The more substantial increase in activity when using PI as opposed to using PIP<sub>2 </sub>as the substrate may be due to the preference of human PLC&#x003b4;4 for PI over PIP<sub>2 </sub>and/or the preference of the endogenous PLC isoforms present in MCF-7 for PIP<sub>2 </sub>over PI. Similar to other PLCs, PLC&#x003b4;4 can therefore use both PI and PIP<sub>2 </sub>as substrates, although the preference for PIP<sub>2 </sub>to PI may vary from one PLC isoforms to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>PLC assays in PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing cells and expression of GFP-PH domain/PLC&#x003b4;4 fusion protein in MCF-7 cells</bold>.

Fusion protein comprised of the PH domain of PLC&#x003b4;4 and GFP was localized mainly in the cytoplasmic region (panel C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1476-4598-3-15-3"/></fig><p>Since the murine PLC&#x003b4;4 has been found to be expressed predominantly in nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], nuclear fraction from a PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing clone (Sample#2, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, panel B) was prepared to examine the distribution of PLC activity in nuclear vs whole cell extracts. The nuclear extract was found to contain about 1/3 of the total PLC activity when compared to whole cell extract, suggesting that, unlike murine PLC&#x003b4;4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] but similar to rat PLC&#x003b4;4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], human PLC&#x003b4;4 is mainly found in cytoplasmic fractions. The structure of the PH domain is the major factor that determines the subcellular localization of PLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Consistent with cytoplasmic location based on cell fractionation data, fusion protein with green fluorescent protein (GFP) linked to the PH domain of PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressed in cells are associated with cytoplasmic membrane structures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, panel C). GFP fusion constructs for PH domain of PLC&#x003b2;1 have also been found in cytoplasmic membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], whereas that of PLC&#x003b4;1 have been found mainly in plasma membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Including conservative amino acid changes, the matches between the PH domains of PLC&#x003b4;1 and PLC&#x003b4;4 exceed 80%, suggesting subtle changes in the PH domain can affect protein localization.</p></sec><sec><title>PLC&#x003b4;4 selectively activates protein kinase C-&#x003c6; in MCF-7 cells</title><p>Since DAG is a key lipid second messenger generated from hydrolysis of PI or PIP<sub>2 </sub>by PLC and protein kinase C (PKC) is the major family of proteins that are activated by DAG, we examined whether PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpression would lead to activation of PKCs in MCF-7 cells. Analysis of PKC activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, left panel) using a phospho-PKC (pan) antibody that can detect PKC&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;I, &#x003b2;II, &#x003b4;, &#x003b5;, or &#x003b7; isoforms when a serine near the carboxy-terminus is autophosphorylated showed some or all of these PKC isoforms were already activated in cells transfected with control vector, pCivirPu, and no enhancement of overall phosphorylation was detected in cells overexpressing PLC&#x003b4;4. Similarly, no enhancement of PKC phosphorylation was observed using an antibody specific for the detection of the subset of PKC&#x003b1; or PKC&#x003b2;<sub>II </sub>when thr638 or thr641 was phosphorylated respectively. On the contrary, PKC&#x003c6; was activated in all four independent isolated lines of PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing cells, whereas no phosphorylation was detected in vector control cells using an antibody specific for the detection of the PKC&#x003c6; when thr538 was phosphorylated. No consistent change in phosphorylation trend was seen between PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing cells and control cells when using an antibody specific for the detection of the subset of PKC&#x003b6; or PKC&#x003bb; when thr410 or thr403 was phosphorylated respectively, suggesting that the two outliers, one in the PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing samples and one in the vector samples, may represent clonal variations. Hence PKC&#x003c6; is the isoform of PKC that shows significant accentuation of activation in PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing MCF-7 cells. Another method to assess PKC activation is to follow the phosphorylation of serine in PKC substrates using an antibody specific for the consensus motif of PKC substrates that detects phosphorylated serineresidues when surroundedby Arg or Lys at the -2 and +2 positions anda hydrophobic residue at the +1 position in proteins. Samples from MCF-7 transfected with vector controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, right panel) showed two major phosphorylated bands, whereas PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing cells showed a few additional weak phosphorylated bands, consistent with the data that only a limited subset of PKCs are activated with PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpression.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of PLC&#x003b4;4 selectively activates PKC-&#x003c6; in MCF-7 cells</bold>.

Analysis of Erk1/2 or p44/42 MAPK activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) using an antibody specific for dually phosphorylated Erk1/2 at Thr202 and Tyr204 showed Erk1/2 was activated in all four independent isolated lines of PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing cells, whereas little phosphorylation was detected in vector control cells. The increase in activated Erk1/2 in PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing cells is due to modifications in protein phosphorylation rather than to change in Erk1/2 proteins level, as similar levels of expression were found using an antibody for the detection of total levels of endogenous Erk1/2 proteins in all samples. Similarly, kinases upstream of the Erk signaling pathway such as MAPK or Erk kinases (MEK1/2) as well as downstream of the Erk pathway such as such as the 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) were also activated in PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing cells based on western blot analysis with antibodies specific for MEK1/2 when phosphorylated at Ser217/221 and for p90RSK when phosphorylated at Thr359/Ser363. On the contrary, key proteins, such as stress activated protein kinase (SAPK) or Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), the 38 kDa mitogen activated kinase (p38 MAPK), and Akt or protein kinase B, involved in two alternative mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathways and the phosphoinositide-3-phosphate kinase (PI3K) pathway, respectively, showed no change in activation in PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing cells based on western blot analysis with antibodies specific for p46 and 54 SAPK when dually phosphorylated at Thr183/Tyr185, for p38 MAPK when dually phosphorylated at Thr180/Tyr182, and for Akt when phosphorylated at Ser473. Hence PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpression selectively activates the Erk or the p44/42 MAPK pathway constitutively with minimal effects on the SAPK/JNK, the p38 MAPK, and the PI3K pathways.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of PLC&#x003b4;4 activates Erk1/2 pathway in MCF-7 cells</bold>.

Accordingly, we have isolated the cDNA for human PLC&#x003b4;4 to probe the expression of PLC&#x003b4;4 using northern blot and cDNA expression panel derived from normal tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and Cancer Profiling Arrays (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) derived from genetically matched cDNA pairs isolated from various tumor and normal tissue samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The truncated splice variant of PLC&#x003b4;4, PLC&#x003b4;4b, was found to expressed in the same tissues where full length PLC&#x003b4;4 could be detected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lower right panel), consistent with the recent discovery of widespread use of a mechanism that coupled alternative splicing with a premature stop codon for the downregulation of a transcript through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. A somewhat analogous splice variant with premature stop codon has been isolated for rat PLC&#x003b4;4 with dominant-negative activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; however, coexpression of human PLC&#x003b4;4 along with PLC&#x003b4;4b has not led to significant reduction of PLC activity in MCF-7 cells in our hands (data not shown) possibly due to subtle differences between the human and the rat sequences. Though PLC&#x003b4;4 expression was found to be downregulated in the majority of tumor tissues, it was found to be upregulated in a high percentage (&#x0003e;25%) of breast and testicular tumor tissues. The overexpression of PLC&#x003b4;4 in testicular tumor is of interest, as the only observed phenotype in PLC&#x003b4;4<sup>-/- </sup>mice is having defective sperms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], suggesting PLC&#x003b4;4 plays an important role in testis and that deregulation of PLC&#x003b4;4 expression in testis can lead to oncogenesis. With the exceptions of a few universal tumor antigens such as telomerase, survivin, mdm2, cytochrome P450 1B1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and sphingosine kinase 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] that are overexpressed in most tumor tissues, the differential overexpression of PLC&#x003b4;4 in selected tumor tissues is consistent with the expression pattern of most individual oncogenes, where overexpression is only found in restricted tissues as opposed to all tumor tissues, despite the fact that various tumor tissues do share a common cluster of overexpressed genes related to cell cycling and DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Hence experiments in addition to expression profiling are required to determine whether PLC&#x003b4;4 is a gene with oncogenic potential.</p><p>We have studied the effects of overexpression of human PLC&#x003b4;4 on cell signaling and proliferation in this study. MCF-7, a breast cancer cell line of low tumorigenicity, was chosen for ectopic expression of PLC&#x003b4;4, since profiling of tissue arrays showed PLC&#x003b4;4 can be overexpressed in breast tumor tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Constitutive overexpression of PLC&#x003b4;4 selectively activates protein kinase C-&#x003c6; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, left panel), whereas the activation states of all other isoforms of PKC studied are not affected by PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpression based on using phospho-specific PKC isoform-specific antibodies. The data is consistent with results from another phospho-specific antibody against the consensus motif of PKC substrates, showing slight enhancement of phosphorylation of PKC substrates with PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, right panel).</p><p>Using antibodies that target signaling pathways for cell proliferation, we have found that PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpression leads to constitutive activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathway in MCF-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) and of kinases both upstream and downstream of the Erk signaling pathway such as Erk kinases (MEK1/2) and the 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK), whereas key proteins involved in two alternative MAPK pathways and the PI3K pathway, such as SAPK/JNK, p38 MAPK, and Akt, respectively, showed no change in activation in PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing cells. PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpression also upregulates the expression of epidermal growth factor receptors EGFR/erbB1 and HER2/erbB2 in MCF-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Of the four ErbB isoforms, cells co-expressing ErbB1 and ErbB2 have been found to be the most aggressive in forming tumors in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Though upregulation of EGFR expression is often associated with the downregulation of estrogen receptor (ER&#x003b1;) expression in breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], no significant change was found in ER&#x003b1; expression in PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing MCF-7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Since both EGFR transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and ErbB2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] have been found to be upregulated by phorbol ester, it is possible that the DAG generated from PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpression may activate selective PKCs such as PKC-&#x003c6;, leading to enhancement of EGFR and ErbB2 gene transcription and activation of the Erk signaling pathway.</p><p>We have examined several cell growth parameters to determine whether enhancement of ErbB1/2 expression and activation of Erk pathway in PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing MCF-7 cells can be translated into a more proliferative state of cell growth. MCF-7 cells stably expressing PLC&#x003b4;4 demonstrate several phenotypes of transformation; namely, enhanced rate of proliferation and saturating cell density in low serum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), improved efficiency in forming colonies in soft agar (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>), and capacity to form more densely packed spheroids in low-attachment plates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). These data suggest that PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpression may contribute to a transformation phenotype by promoting both anchorage dependent and independent cell growth.</p><p>A criterion for validation and selection of new drug targets is to determine whether there is evidence of the reversal of the transformation phenotype using genetic means or drug leads. We have been able to knock down the expression of PLC&#x003b4;4 in PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing cells by transfecting siRNAs specific for PLC&#x003b4;4 sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>); however, no reduction in ErbB1 expression level and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing cells in the presence of siRNA could be detected. The growth signaling responses induced by PLC&#x003b4;4 are hence not reversible by siRNA. The inability for siRNAs for PLC&#x003b4;4 to knock down growth signaling responses suggests PLC&#x003b4;4 may play a role in the initiation of carcinogenesis by inducing other genetic changes, as a neoplastic state can sometimes be irreversible by becoming independent of the initiating oncogenic event through induction of genome destabilization. For instance, even transient induction of <italic>MYC </italic>activity was able to sustain tumorigenesis in certain cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Overexpression of ErbB2, a receptor induced by PLC&#x003b4;4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), has also been associated with genetic instability in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. These results suggest that PLC&#x003b4;4 per se may be a difficult target to be manipulated with drugs, and the sites for intervention may lie instead on other enzyme targets in pathways activated by PLC&#x003b4;4, such as the ErbB receptors and the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase cascade. The validation of some these targets has been confirmed with two approved drugs, Herceptin<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>specific for ErbB2 and Iressa<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>for EGFR tyrosine kinase, with numerous inhibitors for the ErbB receptor family in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and with the studies of Raf inhibitor BAY 37-9751 and MEK inhibitor CI-1040 along the ERK pathway in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>As activation of ErbB can activate another isoform of PLC, PLC&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], it is also possible that activation PLC&#x003b3; may compensate for the knockdown of PLC&#x003b4;4 by siRNA and that compounds capable of inhibiting multiple isoforms of PLC may be more suitable for oncogenic intervention. A black-box approach can also be used to screen for compounds by high throughput screening that would inhibit growth signaling responses induced by PLC&#x003b4;4 with differential cytotoxcity in PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing MCF-7 cells versus matched vector control cells. The use of human engineered tumor cells has been successful in identifying new as well as classical genotype-selective anti-tumor compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overexpression or dysregulated expression of PLC&#x003b4;4 may initiate oncogenesis in certain tissues through upregulation of ErbB expression and activation of ERK pathway. PLC&#x003b4;4 can therefore be a useful tumor marker for breast or testicular cancer tissues. Since the growth signaling responses induced by PLC&#x003b4;4 are not reversible by siRNA, a surrogate for a PLC&#x003b4;4-specific inhibitor, PLC&#x003b4;4 itself is probably not a suitable drug target for development, but enzymes in pathways activated by PLC&#x003b4;4 are potential therapeutic targets for oncogenic intervention. Alternatively, a black-box approach can be used to screen compounds with differential cytotoxcity in PLC&#x003b4;4 overexpressing MCF-7 cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Isolation of human PLC&#x003b4;4 cDNA</title><p>Search of the Genbank database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] of expressed sequence tag (dbEST) using the rat PLC&#x003b4;4 protein sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] as probe identified an I.M.A.G.E.

Protein concentrations were determined and the lysates were used for the assays. The assay of hydrolysis of PIP<sub>2 </sub>or PI was based on methods described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].

The sense strands for each siRNA duplex were as follows. PLC-&#x003b4;4 specific siRNA #1 beginning at nt 1612, 5'-GAGCAGAACCTTCAGAATAdTdT-3', #2 beginning at nt 457, 5'-GAGCAGGGCTTCACCATTGdTdT-3', #3 beginning at nt, 765, 5'-GGAAGGAGAAGAATTCGTAdTdT-3', #4 beginning at nt 1752, 5'-GATATCATCTTTCTCTGAAdTdT-3' and "Smart Pool" siRNAs which combined the above PLC-&#x003b4;4 siRNAs #1&#x02013;4. The following siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon Research (sense strands); Lamin A/C 5'-CUGGACUUCCAGAAGAACAdTdT-3' and Non-specific Control I 5'-NNATGAACGTGAATTGCTCAA-3'. Human MCF7-PLCd4c16 breast cancer cells were grown in RPMI1640, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded at 60,000 cells/well in a six-well dish. These seed density resulted in 15% confluency and was optimal for transfection efficiencies and growth by 72 hrs. Cells were transfected with 27 nM siRNA in serum free Opti-MEM I using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California). Following 4 hr incubation with siRNAs, fetal bovine serum to 2% v/v final was added. Cells were harvested and extracts prepared for Western analysis 72 hr after transfection.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DWL conceived of the study, participated in its design and coordination, and drafted the manuscript.
