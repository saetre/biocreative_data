Dissecting the genetic basis of morphological variation, such as adaptive pigmentation, allows us to answer several long-standing evolutionary questions: How many genes contribute to adaptive phenotypes? What are the relative sizes of their effects? Are adaptive alleles generally dominant, semidominant, or recessive? What types of genes are involved in adaptive change? Do adaptive mutations generally occur in coding or regulatory regions?

These regions show the most divergence in pigmentation between the subspecies and together accurately encapsulate the difference in color and pattern. We measured total pelage reflectance (brightness) and scored pigment pattern on individual hairs for four facial traits (rostrum, cheek, eyebrow, and earbase) and also calculated the extent of dorsal, rump, and tail pigmentation as three additional traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050219-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The phenotypic data show no evidence for sexual dimorphism or maternal effects. The phenotypic correlation (<italic>r</italic>) between traits ranged from 0.29 to 0.82 (the highest value between earbase and cheek), suggesting that while some genes cause similar pigmentation differences among different body parts, other genes have more localized effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050219-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). The distribution of phenotypic scores among F<sub>2</sub> individuals was not consistent with simple Mendelian inheritance for any of the traits with the exception of tail stripe, which shows a bimodal distribution of scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050219-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B).

Because pigmentation has served as a model pathway for studies of gene action and interaction in a variety of biological processes, there are over 100 well-characterized genes known to affect pigmentation in laboratory mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Each of the three QTL regions contains only a single pigmentation gene from the homologous regions (bounded by homologous microsatellite markers) of the closely related model organisms <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mus musculus</named-content> and <italic>Rattus norvegicus:</italic> these genes are the <italic>Agouti signaling protein</italic> (<italic>Agouti;</italic> LG 7), the <italic>melanocortin-1 receptor</italic> (<italic>Mc1r;</italic> LG 1), and the c<italic>-kit receptor</italic> (<italic>Kit;</italic> LG 14).

Application of Multiple QTL model (MQM) mapping methods shows that none of the other eight candidate genes or 113 microsatellites is significantly associated with pigmentation variation. Our results suggest that nearly all of this difference is likely due to the three pigmentation genes <italic>Agouti, Mc1r,</italic> and <italic>Kit,</italic> although it is formally possible that other closely linked loci affect the color difference between subspecies. Below, we refer to these three QTLs using the names of the candidate genes.</p><table-wrap id="pbio-0050219-t001" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Location and Magnitude of QTLs Affecting Pigmentation Pattern</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050219.t001"/></table-wrap><p>Each of the two regions of largest effect, <italic>Agouti</italic> and <italic>Mc1r,</italic> influence all seven pigmentation traits (LOD &#x0003e; 5.8). <italic>Agouti</italic> explains the greatest amount of pigment variation for three traits (cheek, eyebrow, and tail), while <italic>Mc1r</italic> explains the greatest amount of variation for two traits (rostrum and earbase). Both regions contribute equally to the extent of dorsal and rump pigmentation. The relative phenotypic effect of these two regions varies among traits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050219-t001">Table 1</xref>). For example, <italic>Agouti</italic> explains 78&#x00025; of the variation in tail striping, but only 9&#x00025; of the variation in dorsal pigmentation, while <italic>Mc1r</italic> explains 27&#x00025; of the variation in rostrum pigmentation but only 1&#x00025; of the variation in tail striping. Depending on the trait, the combination of these two loci explains between 19&#x00025; and 80&#x00025; of the variation for each of the pigmentation traits. The candidate gene <italic>Kit</italic> mapped to the only QTL of small effect, which explained less than 3.2&#x00025; of the phenotypic variation among traits. This region is associated with only four traits (rostrum, cheek, earbase, and tail; LOD &#x0003e; 3.0), thus showing more spatial specificity than the two regions of major effect. The remaining phenotypic variance is likely attributable to other loci of small effect that are undetectable in a cross of this size and to environmental and/or epigenetic variation. Thus, a small number of chromosomal regions<italic>&#x02014;</italic>and perhaps only a few genes<italic>&#x02014;</italic>are responsible for most of the difference in color pattern between subspecies.</p><p>One of the classical ways to determine the effects of genetic variation on pigmentation is to analyze the allelic composition of extreme classes in an F<sub>2</sub> or backcross (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b014">14</xref>). An analysis of the most extreme phenotypes among our F<sub>2</sub> progeny shows a striking association between phenotype and the allelic variation (&#x0201c;light&#x0201d; allele derived from the beach parents &#x0005b;L&#x0005d; and &#x0201c;dark&#x0201d; allele derived from the mainland parents &#x0005b;D&#x0005d;) at <italic>Agouti</italic> and <italic>Mc1r</italic>. Of the 50 F<sub>2</sub> progeny with the lightest dorsal pigmentation, 42 had at least one light <italic>Mc1r</italic> allele (LL or LD <italic>Mc1r</italic> genotypes; &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Similarly, of the 113 F<sub>2</sub> progeny lacking a tail stripe, 112 had at least one light <italic>Agouti</italic> allele (LL or LD <italic>Agouti</italic> genotypes; &#x003c7;<sup> 2</sup> test, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).</p><p>The direction and magnitude of QTL effects were gauged by comparing phenotypic means among the F<sub>2</sub> offspring. For the two major QTLs, the derived <italic>Agouti</italic> and <italic>Mc1r</italic> alleles increase the average coat reflectance (i.e., produce lighter color) and reduce the extent of dorsal, rump, and tail pigmentation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050219-t001">Table 1</xref>), changes consistent with the idea that these alleles were fixed by natural selection in beach mice. In addition, population-specific alleles of <italic>Mc1r</italic> and <italic>Agouti</italic> show differences in dominance for all traits. For example, 30 F<sub>2</sub> progeny lack pigmentation on the rump. Among these mice, the distribution of <italic>Mc1r</italic> alleles (DD &#x0003d; 0, DL &#x0003d; 2, and LL &#x0003d; 28) suggests that the light <italic>Mc1r</italic> allele is largely recessive. By comparison, the distribution of <italic>Agouti</italic> alleles in the same 30 F<sub>2</sub> progeny (DD &#x0003d; 0, DL &#x0003d; 15, and LL &#x0003d; 15) suggests that the light <italic>Agouti</italic> allele is dominant to the dark allele. These patterns are consistent with the dominance hierarchy of these genes seen in laboratory mice, in which either recessive loss-of-function mutations in <italic>Mc1r</italic> or dominant gain-of-function mutations in <italic>Agouti</italic> yield lighter pigmentation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Mc1r is an integral membrane protein of melanocytes, which are pigment-producing cells. Agouti, the ligand of Mc1r, is an inverse agonist that, when bound, reduces Mc1r activity (via lowered cAMP signaling) resulting in lighter pigmentation. Thus, it is the biochemical interaction between these two proteins that controls the switch between dark eumelanin and light phaeomelanin production in melanocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

The beach and mainland sequences did not differ by any fixed nonsynonymous mutations, demonstrating that amino acid changes in <italic>Agouti</italic> are not responsible for the color differences. In addition, sequencing of <italic>Agouti</italic> cDNA products showed that both mainland and beach mice produced an intact and spliced <italic>Agouti</italic> transcript similar to that observed in <italic>Mus</italic>. Because most of the <italic>Agouti</italic> mutations that produce light coloration in laboratory mice involve gain-of-function <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, we also tested the prediction that an increase in <italic>Agouti</italic> expression contributes to the light coloration of beach mice.</p><p>To examine whether differences in expression level of <italic>Mc1r</italic> or <italic>Agouti</italic> influence color patterning, we conducted gene expression assays (reverse transcriptase PCR &#x0005b;RT-PCR&#x0005d; and quantitative-PCR &#x0005b;q-PCR&#x0005d;) on adult skin taken from five of the seven assayed pigmentation areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050219-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

Comparing <italic>Agouti</italic> expression in <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. polionotus</named-content> to its sister species <italic>P. maniculatus,</italic> we find that the increased expression in beach mice is a derived trait because both <italic>P. p. subgriseus</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. maniculatus</named-content> have similarly low levels of <italic>Agouti</italic> expression.

We found evidence of epistasis in several pigmentation traits (e.g., eyebrow: LOD score &#x0003d; 11.28; &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.001 and rostrum: LOD score &#x0003d; 10.32; &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.001). We also examined the effect of <italic>Mc1r</italic> genotypes on different <italic>Agouti</italic> backgrounds (and vice versa) using a categorical measurement of pigmentation. We detected epistasis for all seven of the traits but most strikingly for cheek pigmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050219-g005">Figure 5</xref>): F<sub>2</sub> mice with the <italic>Agouti</italic> DD genotype always have fully pigmented hairs regardless of <italic>Mc1r</italic> genotype. In fact, for all seven traits there is no difference in phenotype between individuals who have either the DD or DL <italic>Mc1r</italic> genotypes on an <italic>Agouti</italic> DD genetic background (Student's t-test, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), and for only a few traits (e.g., tail) is the <italic>Mc1r</italic> LL genotype visible on the <italic>Agouti</italic> DD background. In contrast, in F<sub>2</sub> mice having the <italic>Agouti</italic> LL genotype, the <italic>Mc1r</italic> genotype explains all of the variation in cheek pigmentation (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 1.0 and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001); and double mutants (<italic>Agouti</italic> LL and <italic>Mc1r</italic> LL) always lack visible pigment in their cheek hairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050219-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Clearly, <italic>Mc1r</italic> genotype has a significant effect on pigmentation only on the light <italic>Agouti</italic> (LL and LD) background, a pattern mirrored in all seven traits.

In the pigmentation pathway, <italic>Mc1r</italic> is downstream of <italic>Agouti</italic> action, and in the laboratory variation in <italic>Mc1r</italic> has been shown to mask the action of <italic>Agouti</italic> alleles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, we show here that <italic>Agouti</italic> can mask <italic>Mc1r,</italic> even though the dominance hierarchy of alleles remains identical to that seen in laboratory mice. We can explain this pattern of &#x0201c;reverse epistasis&#x0201d; mechanistically. The single mutation in <italic>Mc1r</italic> significantly decreases agonist (&#x003b1;MSH) binding, and hence cAMP signaling, but does not eliminate the receptor functionality of its protein product &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. However, it is only with increased expression of <italic>Mc1r</italic>'s antagonist <italic>Agouti</italic> that the phenotypic effects of this weakened <italic>Mc1-receptor</italic> are revealed, a result consistent with <italic>Agouti</italic>'s ability to decrease cAMP production independent of &#x003b1;MSH. Thus, it is clear that epistasis is a property of particular alleles rather than of loci themselves, and thus epistatic interactions observed in the laboratory may differ from those seen in natural populations &#x0005b;see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In sum, our genome-wide linkage map for <italic>Peromyscus</italic> allowed us to identify three genetic regions, two of which have major phenotypic effects on the adaptive difference in color pattern between subspecies of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. polionotus</named-content>. Moreover, these regions contain the well-studied <italic>Agouti</italic> and <italic>Mc1r</italic> pigmentation genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. While mutations in <italic>Mc1r</italic> are correlated with pigmentation in a number of wild vertebrates &#x0005b;see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, our results are, to our knowledge, the first example of variation at the well-studied <italic>Agouti</italic> locus being associated with adaptive variation of animal coloration in nature.</p><p>Our results also have several implications for understanding the genetic basis of adaptation. First, this subspecific difference in color pattern is produced by a few interacting genes of large effect, supporting the idea that adaptations can involve relatively few genes rather than, as is often believed, many genes of small effect &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. When an animal suddenly invades a novel habitat, their ancestral phenotype is often very different from the new optimal phenotype (as was almost certainly true for beach mice). Indeed, population genetic theory predicts that mutations of large effect will often be involved in adaptation in these circumstances &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, a prediction consistent with several studies on the genetic basis of mimicry and crypsis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b026">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Second, both structural mutations (a single amino acid change reducing <italic>Mc1r</italic> signaling potential) and regulatory mutations (a derived increase in <italic>Agouti</italic> expression) contribute to adaptive change, and this change involves both recessive (<italic>Mc1r</italic> L) and dominant (<italic>Agouti</italic> L) alleles. These results support the idea that adaptation is not necessarily driven largely by <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; or by (semi) dominant alleles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Third, we show that the nature of epistasis between <italic>Mc1r</italic> and <italic>Agouti</italic> in wild populations does not mirror that seen in the laboratory, suggesting that one should be cautious not only about extrapolating the genetics of laboratory strains to evolution in nature, but also about inferring the directionality of biochemical pathways from patterns of gene interactions. Finally, most genetic studies of morphological change have concentrated on the loss of phenotypic traits through loss-of-function mutations (e.g., reduced armor in stickleback fish &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, absence of wing spots in <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, and lack of pigment in cavefish &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050219-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;).
