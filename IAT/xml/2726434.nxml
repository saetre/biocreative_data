This transition is driven by a transient transcriptional wave regulated by transcription factor complexes termed MBF/SBF in yeast and E2F-DP in mammals. Here we apply genomic, genetic, and biochemical approaches to show that the Yox1p homeodomain protein of fission yeast plays a critical role in confining MBF-dependent transcription to the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. The <italic>yox1</italic> gene is an MBF target, and Yox1p accumulates and preferentially binds to MBF-regulated promoters, via the MBF components Res2p and Nrm1p, when they are transcriptionally repressed during the cell cycle. Deletion of <italic>yox1</italic> results in constitutively high transcription of MBF target genes and loss of their cell cycle&#x02013;regulated expression, similar to deletion of <italic>nrm1</italic>. Genome-wide location analyses of Yox1p and the MBF component Cdc10p reveal dozens of genes whose promoters are bound by both factors, including their own genes and histone genes. In addition, Cdc10p shows promiscuous binding to other sites, most notably close to replication origins. This study establishes Yox1p as a new regulatory MBF component in fission yeast, which is transcriptionally induced by MBF and in turn inhibits MBF-dependent transcription. Yox1p may function together with Nrm1p to confine MBF-dependent transcription to the G1/S transition of the cell cycle via negative feedback. Compared to the orthologous budding yeast Yox1p, which indirectly functions in a negative feedback loop for cell-cycle transcription, similarities but also notable differences in the wiring of the regulatory circuits are evident.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Cells proliferate by growth and division, which is supported by different gene groups that are periodically induced at specific times when they are required during the cell cycle. These genes not only need to be induced at the right time but also repressed when they are no longer required; mistakes in gene regulation can lead to problems in cell proliferation and diseases such as cancer. A well-known regulatory complex functions just before cells replicate their DNA to induce genes required for this important transition. We show that in fission yeast this regulatory complex (MBF) induces a gene whose encoded protein (Yox1p) in turn binds to MBF and represses MBF-regulated genes. In the absence of Yox1p, the MBF-regulated genes do not fluctuate during the cell cycle but remain constantly induced. Thus, MBF sets up not only the induction but also the timely repression of its target genes via Yox1p. We also provide a global analysis of all the genes regulated by Yox1p and MBF. Together, our data uncover a new negative control loop, further highlighting the sophistication of gene regulation during the cell cycle, and illustrating regulatory similarities and differences between organisms.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcript levels of many genes fluctuate periodically as a function of cell growth and division, peaking at specific phases of each cell cycle.

Furthermore, we establish Yox1p as a new regulatory MBF component with a critical role in the MBF-dependent transcriptional program. In agreement with our observation that Yox1p does not directly bind to MBF-regulated promoters but via MBF, no enrichment of homeodomain-related motifs is evident within the promoters of the shared target genes (Matias Piipari, personal communication) and the binding sites of Yox1p and Cdc10p coincide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000626-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The Yox1p and Cdc10p target genes show higher transcript levels and higher Pol II occupancy in the absence of Yox1p, and they also require Yox1p for their periodic down-regulation during the cell cycle. Consistently, Yox1p accumulates as cells progress into S-phase, and its binding to promoters peaks when MBF-dependent transcription is repressed. Yox1p therefore plays a negative role for the transcription of its target genes outside of G1/S.</p><p>Yox1p provides a negative feedback: it is transcriptionally activated by MBF and in turn binds to MBF and transcriptionally represses the MBF target genes (including <italic>yox1</italic> itself).

Notably, genetic perturbation of <italic>yox1, nrm1</italic>, or <italic>cig2</italic> leads to increased MBF-dependent transcription, although <italic>cig2</italic> mutants show residual transcriptional repression of MBF targets outside of G1/S. All proteins seem therefore to be required, but are not sufficient, to repress MBF transcription outside of G1/S. This repression is not essential in rapidly growing cells: <italic>cig2&#x00394;, nrm1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>yox1&#x00394;</italic> cells are viable, although all deletion mutants show some cell elongation phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-Bueno1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>; unpublished data; this study). It is possible that the repression becomes more critical under specific conditions such as inhibited proliferation during nutrient limitation.

The following evidence indicates that Yox1p and Nrm1p act in the same pathway. The increase of MBF-dependent transcript levels in unsynchronized <italic>yox1</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000626-g003">Figure 3</xref>) is similar to that observed in <italic>nrm1</italic>&#x00394; cells (unpublished data). Moreover, a <italic>yox1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>nrm1</italic>&#x00394; double deletion mutant does not show any increased MBF-regulated transcript levels compared to either single deletion alone (unpublished data).

Furthermore, binding of Yox1p to MBF-regulated promoters depends on Nrm1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000626-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that Yox1p and Nrm1p operate in the same negative feedback loop in which the role of Yox1p in transcriptional repression depends on Nrm1p. Whether Nrm1p depends on Yox1p for its association with MBF or is a connector protein required for Yox1p-dependent repression of MBF-regulated transcription remains to be determined.</p><p>Besides the negative feedback loop based on Yox1p, both yeasts also seem to apply positive feedback loops based on the SBF-regulated <italic>SWI4</italic> in budding yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-McInerny1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-Foster1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> or the MBF-regulated gene <italic>cdc10</italic> in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-Rustici1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>; this study) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000626-g006">Figure 6</xref>), although Cdc10p may have both positive and negative roles in MBF-mediated transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-Dutta1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-McInerny2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Cells arrested in S-phase with incompletely replicated DNA show persistent expression of MBF-dependent genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-Rustici1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-Baum1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, which depends on the DNA replication checkpoint pathway and is required for cell survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-Chu1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-Dutta1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is possible that Yox1p is also involved in regulating the persistent MBF-dependent transcription during the checkpoint response or in mediating checkpoint recovery.</p><p>Yox1p also binds to genes encoding all four canonical histones (<italic>hht1, hhf1, hta1, htb1</italic>) and the histone variant <italic>pht1</italic>, while Cdc10p binds only to <italic>hta1</italic>, <italic>htb1</italic>, and <italic>pht1</italic>. It therefore seems that Yox1p can also bind independently of MBF to some target genes that are not regulated by MBF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000626-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). With the exception of <italic>pht1</italic>, which is &#x0223c;2-fold higher expressed and shows no periodic transcription in <italic>yox1&#x00394;</italic> cells, we could detect only subtle, if any, effects on histone gene expression in the absence of Yox1p, which may therefore only have a marginal role in the poorly understood control of these highly regulated genes. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Yox1p also binds to the genes encoding histones H3 and H4, but not to H2A and H2B, and it has been suggested to play a role in their transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-Horak1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

Intriguingly, <italic>hip1</italic> is a Cdc10p (but not a Yox1p) target according to our data, although <italic>hip1</italic> transcript levels do not seem to be cell cycle-regulated. It is possible that this regulatory interaction becomes more important during specialized conditions such as starvation or meiosis.</p><p>Cdc10p showed more promiscuous binding across the genome than Yox1p. Many of the additional target regions coincided with origins of mitotic replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-Heichinger1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, and most replication origins were associated with Cdc10p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000626-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). The genes flanking replication origins are not enriched for MBF- or cell cycle-regulated genes, and these regions do not seem to be enriched for MCB elements recognized by MBF (Matias Piipari, personal communication). It is possible that Cdc10p simply binds to these chromatin regions because they are depleted of nucleosomes and thus accessible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-Field1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this finding also raises the intriguing possibility that Cdc10p, either alone or in complex with other proteins, is directly involved in controlling replication origins, in addition to its role in transcriptionally regulating genes functioning during replication. Cdc10p would certainly be present at the right places and at the right time during the cell cycle for such a role. Notably, <italic>Drosophila</italic> dE2F1, the functional equivalent of Cdc10p, also binds to origins of replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-Bosco1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.

Future research will establish whether Cdc10p plays an active role at replication origins and is directly involved in controlling DNA replication.</p><p>In conclusion, we have uncovered an additional regulatory layer, based on the homeodomain protein Yox1p, to switch-off MBF-dependent transcription during S-phase progression. Similar roles have been identified for Cig2p and Nrm1p. The requirement for these multiple, non-redundant negative feedback mechanisms is striking. Although potentially rendering down-regulation of G1/S transcripts during S-phase less robust, this system might provide an additional mechanism by which checkpoint activation could override the regular periodic transcriptional program, by directly regulating Yox1p (as has been shown for Nrm1p and Cdc10p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-deBruin1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-Dutta1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>) and may thus reflect the importance of timely and robust activation of G1/S transcription in response to problems with DNA replication. It will be important to tease out how the different regulatory layers are coordinated with each other during regular cell proliferation, during meiotic differentiation, and in response to perturbation of DNA replication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast Strains, Experimental Conditions, and Phenotyping</title><p>The <italic>yox1</italic> gene was deleted in a diploid background made from strains JB5 (<italic>ade6-210 h<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>) and JB6 (<italic>ade6-216 h<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic>) using the <italic>KanMX6</italic> marker with a PCR-based approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-Bhler2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, resulting in strain JB361 (<italic>yox1&#x00394;::kanMX6 ade6<sup>&#x02212;</sup> h<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>). <italic>yox1</italic> was C-terminally tagged with a <italic>3HA</italic> epitope in strain JB22 (<italic>972 h<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic>) with the PCR-based approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000626-Bhler2">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> and verified by western blot, resulting in strain JB644B (<italic>yox1-3HA::kanMX6 h<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic>).
