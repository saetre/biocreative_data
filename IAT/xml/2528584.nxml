We show that stimulation of interphase cells with the mitogens epidermal growth factor or lysophosphatidic acid activates the extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase (ERK), which phosphorylates the Golgi structural protein GRASP65 at serine 277. Expression of a GRASP65 Ser277 to alanine mutant or a GRASP65 1&#x02013;201 truncation mutant, neither of which can be phosphorylated by ERK, prevents Golgi orientation to the leading edge in a wound assay. We show that phosphorylation of GRASP65 with recombinant ERK leads to the loss of GRASP65 oligomerization and causes Golgi cisternal unstacking. Furthermore, preventing Golgi polarization by expressing mutated GRASP65 inhibits centrosome orientation, which is rescued upon disassembly of the Golgi structure by brefeldin A. We conclude that Golgi remodeling, mediated by phosphorylation of GRASP65 by ERK, is critical for the establishment of cell polarity in migrating cells.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>B.

The generation and maintenance of cellular polarity is essential for directional cell migration and must be established for migration to occur. Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 regulate many aspects of polarization, including actin polymerization and microtubule stabilization at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jaffe and Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ridley, 2006</xref>). The activation of Cdc42 induces the reorganization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, which causes the nucleus to move to the back of the cell and the microtubule organizing center together with the Golgi to orient facing the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gomes et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest important roles for the polarized localization of the Golgi at the leading edge. Cell migration requires the regulated transport of vesicles and the addition of new membranes to the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jaffe and Hall, 2005</xref>). Polarized secretion at the leading edge is regulated by the exocyst, which is essential for exocytosis, and also organizes actin polarization at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zuo et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, the directional delivery of membranes and proteins toward the leading edge is dependent on Golgi-localized protein kinase D, which regulates the formation of transport vesicles from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Liljedahl et al., 2001</xref>). Inhibition of protein kinase D blocks both membrane delivery to the cell surface and directional cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Prigozhina and Waterman-Storer, 2004</xref>). These examples suggest that vesicle formation and fusion are tightly coupled to directed cell motility. Additionally, delivery of adhesion molecules and cytoskeletal components are all important functions of a polarized Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mellor, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Polarization before cell migration is induced by mitogens that activate extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase (ERK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pullikuth and Catling, 2007</xref>). Active ERK and H-Ras, as well as scaffolding proteins of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK, have been localized on the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Torii et al., 2004</xref>). Stimulation of cells with EGF activates ERK, which phosphorylates the Golgi protein GRASP65 on Ser277 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>). To confirm the role of ERK in mitogen-induced Golgi polarization, we analyzed the orientation of the Golgi toward the leading edge. Confluent monolayers of normal rat kidney (NRK) cells were serum starved for 24 h, wounded with a razor blade, and allowed to recover. Wounding alone had no effect, allowing polarization to be controlled by the addition of mitogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gomes and Gundersen, 2006</xref>). Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), serum, or EGF was added for 90 min and the cells were then stained for GM130 to visualize the polarization of the Golgi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Golgi polarization was determined by well-established criteria: the Golgi in cells facing the wound was counted as oriented when the majority of the staining was located within a 120&#x000b0; angle facing the wound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gomes et al., 2005</xref>). With no mitogens added, 39% of the cells showed a polarized Golgi, similar to the predicted random orientation of 33% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). We consistently observed Golgi polarization levels above 33%, which is perhaps caused by the stimulation of removing the adjacent cell with the razor blade. Upon stimulation with LPA, serum, or EGF, the Golgi polarized (63, 68, and 58%, respectively). This effect was abolished by preincubation for 30 min with the MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126, suggesting that the polarization of the Golgi toward the wound is dependent on ERK activation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>ERK-induced Golgi orientation is inhibited by GRASP65 1&#x02013;201.</bold> (A) Mitogen-induced Golgi orientation depends on ERK signaling.

The Golgi was labeled with an antibody against GM130 (red) and DNA was stained with Hoechst (blue). Golgi were counted as oriented (&#x0002b;) if the majority lay in a 120&#x000b0; angle facing the wound edge at the top of the image, and not oriented if the majority was outside the angle (&#x02212;).

Nonmyristoylated G2A GRASP65 is cytosolic, whereas the other constructs are targeted to the Golgi. (D&#x02013;F) GRASP65 1&#x02013;201 inhibits Golgi polarization.

GRASP65 regulates Golgi cisternal stacking in vitro and in intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barr et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">S&#x000fc;tterlin et al., 2005</xref>) with oligomers of GRASP65 holding adjacent cisternae together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wang et al., 2003</xref>), and its additional roles include lateral linking of Golgi stacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Puthenveedu et al., 2006</xref>). GRASP65 is composed of two distinct domains: the N-terminal GRASP domain, responsible for oligomerization, and the C-terminal regulatory domain, which contains all phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Preisinger et al., 2005</xref>). Mitotic phosphorylation causes a loss of oligomerization, which results in cisternal unstacking followed by an extensive remodeling of the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barr et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>To test whether ERK modifies the regulatory domain of GRASP65 during Golgi polarization, we expressed the GRASP domain (residues 1&#x02013;201) fused to GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Because GRASP65 1&#x02013;201 is insensitive to kinase activity, a constitutive oligomer, and prevents cisternae from unstacking or remodeling, the mutant should delay or inhibit Golgi orientation. After expression of the cDNA in wound-edge cells by microinjection, we assessed Golgi orientation in response to mitogens. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref> shows a typical immunofluorescence image of cells at the wound edge expressing either GRASP65 1&#x02013;201 or the control protein G2A GRASP65 1&#x02013;201, where the glycine at position two is replaced by an alanine (G2A) to abolish the myristoylation, and therefore Golgi targeting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 1998</xref>). In control cells and cells expressing G2A GRASP65 1&#x02013;202, the Golgi achieve maximum orientation after 90-min stimulation with LPA, whereas in cells expressing GRASP65 1&#x02013;202, inhibition of Golgi orientation is observed after 90 min and maintained after a 270-min addition of LPA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). The inhibitory effect of GRASP65 1&#x02013;201 on Golgi polarization persisted after stimulation with serum, EGF, or LPA for 90 min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>), suggesting that the regulatory domain of GRASP65 is essential for mitogen-stimulated Golgi orientation.</p><p>GRASP65 is phosphorylated at Ser277 by ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>). GRASP65 is also phosphorylated in mitosis at Ser277 and at three other sites by cdk1/cyclinB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Preisinger et al., 2005</xref>). To test if GRASP65 phosphorylation by ERK is induced by other mitogens known to cause Golgi orientation, we used a previously characterized antibody against phospho-Ser277 of GRASP65, which also recognizes mitotically phosphorylated GRASP65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>). In the absence of mitogens, the phospho-GRASP65 antibody stained mitotic cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), whereas the surrounding interphase cells showed little or no signal (images acquired equally). Stimulation with serum, EGF, or LPA considerably increased phosphorylation of GRASP65 in interphase cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). U0126 abolished GRASP65 phosphorylation in interphase cells, whereas the mitotic signal was unaffected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>), suggesting separate regulation of GRASP65 phosphorylation in mitosis and interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>ERK phosphorylates GRASP65 in response to mitogens.</bold> (A) Antibodies against phosphorylated Ser277 of GRASP65 (phospho-GRASP65) detect mitotic cells (arrows) but not serum-starved interphase cells.

We therefore investigated whether the phosphorylation of GRASP65 by ERK induces changes in the Golgi structure. Serum-starved NRK cells were stimulated with serum, EGF, or LPA, and lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for phospho-Ser277 GRASP65. Stimulation led to an increase in active ERK and to phosphorylation of GRASP65 as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>), which was inhibited by preincubation with U0126 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). GRASP65 was also phosphorylated when purified rat liver Golgi (RLG) membranes were incubated with recombinant MEK and ERK, which was abolished by preincubation with U0126 or the kinase inhibitor staurosporine, suggesting that these kinases are sufficient for GRASP65 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>GRASP65 phosphorylation by ERK causes loss of oligomerization and Golgi unstacking.</bold> (A) Serum-staved NRK cells were treated with serum, EGF, or LPA for 10 min.

Serum, EGF, and LPA induced phosphorylation of ERK and GRASP65, which was abolished by U0126 (30-min preincubation). (B) RLG membranes were treated with recombinant MEK/ERK and then subjected to Western blotting for phospho-GRASP65 and GRASP65.

We therefore analyzed the MEK/ERK-treated RLG membranes by EM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Untreated membranes showed 55% of the cisternae in stacks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Addition of MEK/ERK reduced stacking to 24%, suggesting that ERK causes unstacking, which correlates with GRASP65 phosphorylation. GRASP65 regulates stacking through oligomerization of the N-terminal GRASP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). In mitosis, phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain causes separation of oligomers and, in turn, cisternae. To determine whether GRASP65 oligomerization is regulated by MEK/ERK in interphase, we performed a bead-aggregation assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>). When beads coated with recombinant GRASP65 were treated with interphase cytosol, 77% of GRASP65 FL beads were in aggregates, indicating oligomerization. Upon further incubation with MEK/ERK, aggregation was reduced to 20%, a value similar to treatment with mitotic kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). S277A GRASP65 FL beads showed comparable aggregation with interphase cytosol (70%) but were insensitive to MEK/ERK (83%), suggesting that S277A GRASP65 FL is a constitutive oligomer. Therefore, MEK/ERK treatment results in a loss of GRASP65 oligomerization, which correlates with the EM observation that MEK/ERK treatment results in cisternal unstacking of Golgi membranes.</p><p>During cell migration, the centrosome orients toward the leading edge, as does the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Magdalena et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cau and Hall, 2005</xref>).

BFA was removed and LPA was added for 90 min, after which nonexpressing cells and cells expressing GRASP65 FL and G2A GRASP65 1&#x02013;201 showed centrosome polarization to a similar extent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that BFA treatment restored centrosome orientation to control levels in cells expressing S277A GRASP65 FL and GRASP65 1&#x02013;201 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, B and C</xref>), such that the inhibited centrosome polarization was rescued by breaking apart the Golgi structure with BFA. Our results suggest that centrosome polarization cannot be achieved without Golgi reorganization. One possibility is that the bulky Golgi could exert a drag force, which cannot be overcome by the polarization forces acting on the centrosome and cytoskeleton. In any case, we have demonstrated a closely integrated mechanism in which Golgi remodeling by phosphorylation of GRASP65 acts as a negative regulator of Golgi and, surprisingly, centrosome orientation.</p><p>We have explored the effects of ERK phosphorylation on GRASP65 during Golgi orientation toward the direction of cell migration. Our data indicate that ERK phosphorylates GRASP65 in interphase cells, resulting in the loss of GRASP65 oligomerization and causing subsequent Golgi cisternal unstacking. Preventing GRASP65 phosphorylation with phosphorylation-resistant mutants inhibits Golgi and centrosome orientation, leading to the conclusion that Golgi remodeling by kinase signaling is critical for the polarization of migrating cells.</p><p>Golgi remodeling has been best described in mitosis, where unstacking and vesiculation are driven by the phosphorylation of Golgi proteins including GM130, GRASP65, and GRASP55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shorter and Warren, 2002</xref>). Phosphorylation of GRASP65 by mitotic kinases leads to the loss of oligomerization followed by unstacking and lateral unlinking of Golgi cisternae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barr et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Feinstein and Linstedt, 2007</xref>). Ser277 of GRASP65 is phosphorylated in mitosis by cdk1/cyclinB1 and by ERK in interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that GRASP65 phosphorylation may organize similar processes during interphase and mitosis. We report here that inhibiting interphase GRASP65 phosphorylation by ERK prevents Golgi reorganization, which is required for Golgi polarization. We conclude that interphase and mitotic phosphorylation of GRASP65, although differently regulated and required for unique cellular processes, produce similar consequences for Golgi structure, including loss of oligomerization and unstacking of cisternae. Therefore, phosphorylation of GRASP65 functions to regulate Golgi remodeling whether during mitosis or cell polarization.</p><p>The fragmented Golgi structure of mitotic cells is, however, not found during interphase by light microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>). The amount of Golgi reorganization could be a function of the extent of GRASP65 phosphorylation. GRASP65 phosphorylation in mitosis involves at least four distinct sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Preisinger et al., 2005</xref>), but only Ser277 is known to be phosphorylated during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, mitotic Golgi fragmentation depends on the phosphorylation of other Golgi proteins, including GM130 and GRASP55, which are not phosphorylated during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lowe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Feinstein and Linstedt, 2007</xref>). Therefore, decreased GRASP65 phosphorylation and the lack of phosphorylation of other Golgi proteins correlate to the lesser extent of Golgi remodeling during interphase. Maintaining the Golgi structure and organization in polarizing cells would allow for the quick upstart of directed membrane traffic necessary for migration once the Golgi faces the leading edge.</p><p>In summary, our work reveals that remodeling of the Golgi structure is required for the polarization of the Golgi toward the direction of cell migration. The Golgi remodeling is achieved by phosphorylation of GRASP65 by ERK, causing loss of GRASP65 oligomerization and cisternal unstacking. Furthermore, we found that centrosome polarization cannot be achieved without Golgi remodeling, showing that Golgi remodeling is critical for cell polarization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>The following reagents were used: LPA (Sigma-Aldrich), EGF (PeproTech), U0126 (LC Laboratories), and staurosporin (EMD).
