In Iceland, this condition is caused by the L68Q mutation in the cystatin C gene, with contemporary carriers reaching an average age of only 30 years. Here, we report, based both on linkage disequilibrium and genealogical evidence, that all known copies of this mutation derive from a common ancestor born roughly 18 generations ago. Intriguingly, the genealogies reveal that obligate L68Q carriers born 1825 to 1900 experienced a drastic reduction in life span, from 65 years to the present-day average. At the same time, a parent-of-origin effect emerged, whereby maternal inheritance of the mutation was associated with a 9 year reduction in life span relative to paternal inheritance. As these trends can be observed in several different extended families, many generations after the mutational event, it seems likely that some environmental factor is responsible, perhaps linked to radical changes in the life-style of Icelanders during this period. A mutation with such radically different phenotypic effects in reaction to normal variation in human life-style not only opens the possibility of preventive strategies for HCCAA, but it may also provide novel insights into the complex relationship between genotype and environment in human disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>This work focuses on the L68Q mutation in the cystatin C gene which causes hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy (HCCAA), an autosomal dominant disease with high penetrance in contemporary Icelanders, manifest by lethal brain hemorrhages in young normotensive adults. On the basis of both DNA haplotype and genealogical analyses, we determined that all known copies of the L68Q mutation derive from a common ancestor born roughly 18 generations ago, around 1550. Furthermore, we were able to show a rapid change in its penetrance for obligate carriers born from 1825 to 1900, demonstrated by a drastic reduction in life span, from 65 years to the present-day average of 30 years. The detrimental phenotypic impact of the L68Q mutation appears to have emerged in reaction to common life-style changes almost three centuries after the mutation occurred. We believe that this is the first report of phenotypic flexibility of a monogenic disease in reaction to life-style changes that fall within the normal range of behavior of a single population in the space of a few generations. Our results underline how single gene disorders with simple Mendelian inheritance can be affected by environmental factors, resulting in changed disease status.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyloid deposits are found in various diseases, both genetic and sporadic, such as Alzheimer's disease and the prionoses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000099-Barnham1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Concurrently a parent-of-origin effect became evident whereby those who inherited the disease gene from the mother had, on average, a 9.4 years shorter life span compared to those who inherited it from the father.</p><p>How can we account for the rather drastic reduction in the life span of L68Q carriers that seems to have occurred three centuries after the mutation arose? It is unlikely that this is due to an additional, but currently undocumented, mutation acting as a modifier of the risk conferred by the L68Q mutation. Indeed, an additional mutation would need to have occurred many times in several different extended families. Alternatively, and even less plausible, a putative modifier mutation would have needed to spread from very low frequency to near fixation in each of the L68Q carrier families in the space of a few generations. Rather, we postulate the involvement of some environmental factor that came into play around 1825 and reached saturation around 1900, possibly a dietary factor such as the increased consumption of carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000099-g007">Figure 7</xref>) or salt (for food preservation). The notion of an environmental modifier of disease risk conferred by the L68Q mutation is supported by the observation that the decrease in life span was delayed by about 20 years in the remote Northwest coastal region A compared to the West and South regions B and C combined. Thus, the life-style changes associated with economic development in Iceland during the 19<sup>th</sup> century occurred later in remote regions than in regions closer to the capital Reykjavik.</p><fig id="pgen-1000099-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000099.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Changes in the percentage of dietary energy.</title><p>Derived from fat (blue line), protein (red line), and carbohydrates (green line) in Iceland from the year 1790&#x02013;1940 (adapted from Jonsson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000099-Jonsson2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>). Iceland was an isolated island with relatively little importation of food at the beginning of our study period, which then underwent drastic changes of dietary habits during the latter part of the 19th century. Records of imported food items per capita show a shift in the proportion of energy derived from carbohydrates from 25 &#x00025; in 1840 to approximately 50 &#x00025; in 1900; the proportion of energy derived from fat and protein decreased accordingly.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000099.g007"/></fig><p>It is interesting that in the same time period (the 19<sup>th</sup> century) a parent-of-origin effect of the L68Q mutation is seen in the context of the life span reduction of carriers. This could be explained by a transgenerational epigenetic mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000099-Morgan1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, such as the one described for the agouti viable yellow mutation in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000099-Wolff1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000099-Waterland1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> where the frequency of disease in offspring can be changed with dietary methyl supplementation of pregnant dams. However, although cystatin C has a large CpG region in the promoter, the gene is not known to be a metastable epiallele or reside in a known imprinting region.</p><p>The conclusion that environmental factors alter the phenotypic impact of mutations underlying serious heritable disorders is not novel. A classic example is the dietary treatment of phenylketouria (PKU) patients to prevent cognitive damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000099-Scriver1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. What is unusual about the findings reported here is rather that the detrimental phenotypic impact of the L68Q mutation appears to have emerged in reaction to life-style changes that fall within the normal range of behavior of a single population in the space of a few generations. Even this may not be without parallel, as a reduced life span over time coupled with a maternal effect has also been described in another familial amyloid disease in Sweden, i.e. FAP (familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy) which is caused by a mutation (V30M) in the transthyretin gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000099-Drugge1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Such diseases challenge simplistic views of Mendelian diseases as solely genetic in nature and insensitive to environmental factors. An understanding of the phenotypic flexibility of the L68Q mutation might provide the possibility for preventive or therapeutic strategies to deal with HCCAA. Such an understanding may also be relevant to other common but pathophysiologically related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, where cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is very common. Finally it may also present an opportunity for more general insights into the complex relationship between genotype and environment in human disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Family Data</title><p>A total of 36 individuals from nine families with known histories of ICH were diagnosed as carriers of the L68Q mutation through direct genotyping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000099-Abrahamson1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The ancestors of these individuals were found by tracing pedigrees, either with the help of Arnason <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000099-Arnason1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, published pedigrees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000099-Jensson1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, or with the deCODE Genetics genealogy database that contains information about the relationships between 740.000 Icelanders, past and present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000099-Helgason1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Ancestors who were obligate carriers of L68Q were defined as parents or common ancestors of known carriers whose inferred carrier status minimizes the number of transmission events of the mutation in the genealogies. For most individuals, the only available phenotypic information was age at death, as the first signs of HCCAA can be subtle such as personality changes and dementia. Death certificates (first issued in Iceland in 1911) and parish records were also checked and the cause of death was noted when known. The year of birth, and death, of spouses of obligate L68Q carriers were noted when available.</p><p>The nine extended families thus defined contain 202 individuals, including 92 ancestors who are obligate carriers. Although the cause of death for these obligate carriers was often consistent with ICH, we also included those who died from other causes such as drowning or infections. In some cases, family members with no offspring or contemporary descendants were defined as obligate carriers, when their death certificate (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;61) or their parish record (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;17) indicated brain hemorrhage. Individuals were excluded if no information was available about cause of death. Limiting the analyses to all carriers born before 1940 (to exclude those who have an exceptionally long life span) we hereafter refer to 157 carriers as the <italic>confirmed carrier group</italic>.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned known and obligate carriers, there are 34 deceased individuals who are strongly suspected of having been carriers of the L68Q mutation, but for whom no DNA samples were available. The inference of carrier status for these individuals is based on death certificates (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;17) and parish records (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;17) that indicate brain hemorrhage as the cause of death. Using the same approach as before to trace obligate carrier ancestors, we identified six new families and 30 new obligate carriers.

The microsatellites spanned the physical map positions 14.7&#x02013;38.3 Mb (NCBI build 35) on chromosome 20, with the L68Q mutation located at position 23,563,968 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000099.s001">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>PCR amplifications were set up, run, and pooled on Gilson Cyberlab robots. The reaction volume was 5 &#x000b5;l, and, for each PCR, 20 ng of genomic DNA was amplified in the presence of 2 pmol of each primer, 0.25 U AmpliTaq Gold, 0.2 mM dNTPs, and 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (buffer was supplied by the manufacturer, Applera). Cycling conditions were as follows: 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min, followed by 37 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 15 s, annealing for 30 s at 55&#x000b0;C, and 1 min extension at 72&#x000b0;C. One primer of each primer pair was fluorescently labeled. The PCR products were pooled into panels of 8&#x02013;16 markers, mixed with size standards, and analyzed on ABI 3700 sequencing machines using Genescan (version 3.0) peak-calling software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
