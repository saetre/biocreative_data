Our study was designed to investigate the mechanisms of GM-CSF in autoimmunity using a model of autoimmune heart inflammatory disease (myocarditis). The pathological sequel after immunization with heart myosin has been shown previously to depend on IL-1, IL-6, IL-23, and IL-17. We found that innate GM-CSF was critical for IL-6 and IL-23 responses by dendritic cells and generation of pathological Th17 cells in vivo. Moreover, GM-CSF promoted autoimmunity by enhancing IL-6&#x02013;dependent survival of antigen specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells.

These Th17 cells have been suggested to mediate inflammation associated with several organ-related autoimmune diseases including experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), collagen-induced arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), and experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Evidence supporting a new concept in which IL-23&#x02013;dependent Th17, and not IL-12&#x02013;dependent Th1, cells are responsible for autoimmune inflammation came from reports showing that IL-12 (p35)&#x02013;deficient and IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;deficient mice developed normal or even exaggerated autoimmune inflammation, whereas IL-23 (p19)&#x02013;deficient and IL-17&#x02013;deficient mice were protected. Consequently, there has been a strong interest in defining effector cytokines produced by the pathological Th17 cells and the conditions and factors determining development and activity of Th17 cells. Besides IL-17A and IL-17F, Th17 cells have been reported to coexpress the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), and IL-22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Similar to Th1 and Th2 development, the cytokine environment plays a critical role in positive and negative regulation of Th17 development. TGF-&#x003b2;, IL-6, and IL-1 have been shown to induce IL-17 production in naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), whereas IL-23 turned out to be essential for expansion and survival of Th17 effector memory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). IL-6 plays a key role as it inhibits TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;induced Treg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) differentiation and induces ROR&#x003b3;t (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), a transcription factor specifically required for Th17 development. In contrast, IL-27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) and IL-25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) have been shown to negatively regulate Th17 development.</p><p>Granulocyte macrophage&#x02013;colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli such as LPS, IL-1, and TNF-&#x003b1; by a variety of different cells, including endothelium, fibroblasts, muscle cells, and macrophages, and by activated T cells (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). It was first described as a hematopoietic cytokine promoting proliferation and differentiation of macrophages, granulocytes, and DC from precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). However, GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed normal development of myeloid cells, including macrophages and DC, except a defect of alveolar macrophage function resulting in alveolar proteinosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). In contrast, analysis of GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice demonstrated an essential role of GM-CSF for development of autoimmune inflammatory diseases such EAE and collagen-induced arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). In addition, anti&#x02013;GM-CSF therapy from time of immunization or from first signs of clinical disease completely prevented or ameliorated autoimmune inflammation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). It has been proposed that GM-CSF promotes T cell proliferation and pathological Th1 responses indirectly by activation of macrophages, DC, and microglia cells in the initiation or the effector phase and possibly the generation of chemoattractant gradients for recruitment of inflammatory cells to the target organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). However, the precise mechanisms have remained elusive.</p><p>In this study, we have determined the mechanism of action of GM-CSF in development of EAM, an animal model of human dilated cardiomyopathy, the most common form of cardiomyopathy (&#x0223c;80&#x02013;90% of cases) for which mortality rates remain unacceptably high. EAM is induced by immunization of susceptible mice with cardiac myosin or a peptide located in the head portion of myosin heavy chain &#x003b1; (myhc&#x003b1;<sub>614-629</sub>) emulsified in CFA. Previous reports have demonstrated that the cytokines IL-6, IL-1, IL-23, and IL-17 are crucial for development of EAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), whereas IFN-&#x003b3; is a negative regulator of heart inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Thus, the cytokine network responsible for pathological inflammation in the heart (EAM) and brain (EAE) appears to be very similar.</p><p>We found that GM-CSF was essential to inhibit apoptosis and promote IL-17 production by autoimmune CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells.

Moreover, production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-&#x003b1; by DC of WT and GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was comparably increased upon stimulation with CpG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>) or LPS (not depicted).

Therefore, we hypothesized that reduced CD4 T cell numbers in the absence of GM-CSF resulted from enhanced cell death. To test this, we measured apoptosis and cell death by staining transgenic CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from draining LN with Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) after OVA/CFA immunization.

Although activated DC are among the main producers of the latter proinflammatory cytokines, DC do not produce GM-CSF.

Both IL-6 and IL-23 are essential for the development of EAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>), and colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>), demonstrating the importance of these two cytokines for development of organ-related autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Although some of these studies showed reduced CD4 T cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>) and IFN-&#x003b3; production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>) in the absence of IL-6, it is now thought that IL-6 mediates autoimmune disease by promoting development of pathogenic Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). However, in addition to Th17 development, IL-6 has been shown to prevent apoptosis of effector and memory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). Similarly, we found that reduced expansion of antigen-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in immunized GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was caused by enhanced apoptosis and not a defect in T cell activation or cell division rate.</p><p>It has been shown previously that a soluble factor secreted by activated DC was able to restore impaired proliferation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). We have identified that this factor is IL-6. Delivery of recombinant IL-6 to GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in osmotic minipumps or to APC-T cell cocultures in vitro restored proliferation by inhibition of apoptosis of antigen-specific GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. It should be noted that we failed to reconstitute autoimmune myocarditis in GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and recovery of Th17 cells was achieved partially with variable results by implantation of IL-6&#x02013;secreting osmotic minipumps or by infection with recombinant adenovirus expressing IL-6 (mAd5-IL6; reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). However, these approaches also failed to reconstitute Th17 development and autoimmune myocarditis in IL-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (unpublished data), indicating that local availability, concentration, and/or half-life of exogenous and ectopically produced IL-6 are not sufficient to reconstitute endogenous IL-6 levels required for disease development. In addition, restoration of Th17 cells and autoimmunity in GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may require supplementation of both IL-6 and IL-23, as indicated by our results.</p><p>Although we cannot exclude that other antiapoptotic cytokines stimulated by GM-CSF show a similar effect than IL-6 for T cell survival, we have shown that addition of IL-1 or IL-2 could not restore expansion of GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Although GM-CSF production by activated T cells can contribute to T cell proliferation in vitro, particularly when no other GM-CSF&#x02013;producing cell is present in the microenvironment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4 B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6 C</xref>), our in vivo adoptive transfer experiments with TCR tg CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells demonstrate that GM-CSF production by non&#x02013;T cells is critical for survival of antigen-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 F</xref>). Indeed, we found that a gemisch of Macrophages and DC isolated from WT mice at day 7 after myhc&#x003b1;<sub>614-629</sub>/CFA immunization produced GM-CSF (unpublished data). Interestingly, although CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC isolated from naive WT BALB/c mice and BM-DC did not produce GM-CSF upon TLR stimulation (i.e., CpG, LPS) or in cocultures with CD4 T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), we could measure GM-CSF in supernatants of CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells purified from immunized mice, although less than in the gemisch of macrophages and DC (not depicted). It is tempting to speculate that blood circulating inflammatory monocytes (CX3CR1<sup>low</sup>Gr1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), which differentiate into functional DC in inflamed tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>), have the ability to produce GM-CSF.</p><p>The absence of GM-CSF receptor on naive and effector CD4 T cell subsets excludes direct regulation of Th17 lineage commitment by GM-CSF. Consistently, addition of GM-CSF to DC/CD4 T cell cocultures did not induce Th17 differentiation in vitro. However, stimulation of DC with microbial ligands or immunization with CFA adjuvants promoted DC IL-6 production (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>; and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A&#x02013;C</xref>), resulting in GM-CSF production by activated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, which was required for Th17 polarization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, E and F</xref>). Requirement of GM-CSF for Th17 development was overcome in the presence of TGF&#x003b2;/IL-6 or TGF&#x003b2;/IL-21, further indicating that GM-CSF acts indirectly by enhancing production of Th17-polarizing cytokines.</p><p>Consistent with a key role of IL-6 and IL-23 in generation and maintenance of Th17 cells, we found that impaired IL-6 and IL-23 production was associated with reduced numbers of Th17 cells in immunized GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in vivo. Interestingly, numbers of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing cells determined by ELISPOT were also strongly reduced in GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice immunized with myhc&#x003b1;<sub>614-629</sub>/CFA, whereas development of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IL-17<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (Th1) cells was unaffected in GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice after adoptive transfer of DO11.10 transgenic T cells and immunization with OVA/CFA. In contrast, a population of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IL-17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> double producers was also reduced in this setting. Unfortunately, we could not distinguish IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IL-17<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IL-17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells specific for myhc&#x003b1;<sub>614-629</sub> by ELISPOT, and it is possible that the majority of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing cells actually represent IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IL-17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> double producers. The dynamics of IL-17 and IFN-&#x003b3; production during differentiation of distinct subpopulations depends on the number of antigen-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and the strengths of TCR stimulation (unpublished data), which may also explain possible differences in adoptive transfer of OVA<sub>323-339</sub>-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and development of endogenous CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells specific for myhc&#x003b1;<sub>614-629</sub>.</p><p>The balance of Th17 and Treg cells is key for development of autoimmunity. Development of Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Treg cells is enhanced at the expense of Th17 cells in IL-6&#x02013;deficient mice immunized with the encephalitogenic peptide MOG<sub>35-55</sub>, which prevents development of EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). It is important to note that we did not find significant differences in Foxp3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Treg cells in immunized GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071119/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071119/DC1</ext-link>), which may indicate that IL-6 levels in GM-CSF<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are sufficient to balance development of Treg cells. However, it remains to be shown whether Treg number and function are similar in autoimmune myocarditis and EAE and the different genetic backgrounds (BALB/c vs C57BL/6).</p><p>Our results do not exclude a role for GM-CSF in the effector phase of the response. Elegant studies have demonstrated previously that GM-CSF production by encephalitogenic T cells is required for the development of EAE, probably by activation of microglial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). Similarly, GM-CSF produced by myosin-specific effector CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells may activate heart-resident macrophages. Indeed, GM-CSF mRNA is up-regulated in the heart of rats with autoimmune myocarditis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>), and we found that a high frequency of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells activated in vitro under Th17-polarizing conditions or CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells isolated from the CNS of mice with EAE coexpress GM-CSF and IL-17 (unpublished data), demonstrating that GM-CSF is an effector cytokine of Th17 cells.</p><p>In summary, our studies demonstrate a previously unrecognized role of GM-CSF in survival of Th17 cells that mediate autoimmunity. GM-CSF regulates autoantigen-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells indirectly through stimulation of IL-6 and IL-23 production by DC and macrophages in the presence of microbial products, as illustrated in the scheme shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. Our results may have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of cancer and other immunotherapies using GM-CSF as potent adjuvant.</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for GM-CSF&#x02013;mediated autoimmunity.</bold> PAMPs such as CpG and mycobacterial components in CFA induce DC activation/maturation and production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, which promote activation of naive CD4 T cells (Thp) and secretion of GM-CSF, IFN-&#x003b3;, and IL-17. Macrophages (and possibly subpopulations of DC) can produce GM-CSF directly upon encounter of PAMPs. GM-CSF further enhances IL-6 and IL-23 production by DC and macrophages. IL-6 acts at two levels on activated T cells. It enhances survival (both Th1 and Th17) and, together with TGF-&#x003b2;, drives ROR&#x003b3;t expression to allow further Th17 polarization.
