The majority of malignancies were distributed equally between T and B cell neoplasms and included lymphoblastic T cell lymphoma (LTCL), lymphoblastic B cell lymphoma (LBCL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the histiocyte/T cell rich variant of DLBCL (DLBCL-HA/T cell rich DLBCL), splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), follicular B cell lymphoma (FBL) and plasmacytoma (PCT). Most of these neoplasms were highly similar to human diseases. Also, some non-lymphoid malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and histiocytic sarcoma were found. Interestingly, composite lymphomas, including Hodgkin-like lymphomas, were also detected that had CD30<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (H/RS)-like cells, representing a tumor type not previously described in mice. Analysis of microdissected H/RS-like cells revealed their origin as germinal center B cells bearing somatic hypermutations and, in some instances, crippled mutations, as described for human Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Transgene integration in an oncogene was excluded as an exclusive driving force of tumorigenesis and age-related lymphoma development suggests a multi-step process. Thus, this DR4 line is a useful model to investigate common molecular mechanisms that may contribute to important neoplastic diseases in man.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The similarities between genomes and genetic pathways underlying tumor development in mice and humans make mouse models ideal for the study of cancer pathogenesis. Numerous inbred, virus-induced or genetically-engineered mouse models of human malignancy have been developed in the past to gain insight into mechanisms of tumorigenesis.</p><p>Several mouse models exist for hematopoietic malignancies which correspond to distinct tumor entities, including B or T cell lymphomas or myeloid leukemias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Kogan1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Morse1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. A number of these models rely on tumor transplantation, which poorly reflects the process that occurs in human malignancy, particularly with respect to multi-step events. This can be partially rectified with the use of spontaneous tumor models that are created by introducing known genes, such as chromosomal translocations which occur in human tumors. As examples, B cell malignancies were induced by translocation of the myc-locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Janz1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, knock-in of the proto-oncogene Bcl-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Jardin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> or knock-out of the p53 tumor suppressor gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Hoogervorst1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Spontaneous T cell malignancies were generated by expression of mutated Notch1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Lin1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, in Emu-myc transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Mikkers1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> or by induction of Moloney mouse leukemia virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Eriksson1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, leukemic malignancies were forced through integration of fusion-genes that mimic chromosomal alterations, such as myc-IgH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Park1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, CALM/AF10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Deshpande1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> or through introduction of murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Largaespada1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. These various models share the characteristic that principally one distinct lineage-specific tumor-type is detected in each mouse strain.</p><p>We discovered that an established MHC class II transgenic (tg) mouse line, developed by Ito and coworkers as a model for autoimmunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Ito1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> developed spontaneous tumors starting around eight months of age. Extensive cellular and molecular characterization revealed that widely diverse hematopoietic neoplasms occur in these mice, which arise from different lineages and represent different stages of lymphocyte development. Surprisingly, many of these neoplasms had phenotypes that are characteristic of human hematological diseases. Therefore, this mouse line provides a unique tumor model that broadly extends the possibilities to study potential multistep-processes involved in tumorigenesis in vivo, with high relevance to human hematological malignancy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Various Hematological Malignancies Develop in DR4-H2E and F1 Mice</title><p>The previously published DR4-H2E transgenic mouse line expresses a chimeric human-mouse MHC class II gene (HLA-DR4/H2E<sup>d</sup>). DR4-H2E mice express MHC class II chimeric molecules, composed of the human DR4&#x003b1; and DR4&#x003b2; peptide binding-domains, coupled to mouse MHC class II (H2E&#x003b1;<bold><sup>d</sup></bold> and H2E&#x003b2;<bold><sup>d</sup></bold>) constant domains, respectively. One DR4-H2E transgenic founder line was backcrossed to MHC class II-deficient mice (C2d&#x02013;C57BL/6 background) to eliminate expression of endogenous mouse class II molecules and DR4-H2E homozygous mice (hereafter DR4 mice) were established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Ito1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. All offspring of DR4 parental mice expressed chimeric class II molecules on splenic B cells but not T cells, as depicted using a monoclonal antibody specific for human DRB1&#x0002a;0401 molecules (data not shown). These results confirmed homozygosity of the DR4-H2E transgene in the parental line. Cellular interactions were preserved with CD4 coreceptors on murine T cells by retaining the alpha-2 and beta-2 domains of mouse MHC class II in the chimeric protein.</p><p>Our new finding is that DR4 mice spontaneously develop hematopoietic malignancies at high frequency (69.7&#x00025;). To explore the role of DR4 homozygosity versus murine H2 class II deficiency on tumor occurrence, DR4 animals were crossed with wildtype C57BL/6 mice, yielding DR4 heterozygous F1 mice which carry one normal H2<sup>b</sup> MHC haplotype and thereby are no longer H2 class II deficient. Tumor development in F1 mice would imply a dominant oncogenic effect associated with DR4-H2E transgene heterozygosity and only a minor contribution of H2 class II deficiency to tumorigenesis. Indeed, DR4 heterozygous F1 mice also developed different types of lymphoma with high frequency, as described in more detail below. Tumor appearance was assessed in 132 DR4 and 125 F1 mice, yielding frequencies of 69.7&#x00025; (92 of 132) and 52.8&#x00025; (66 of 125), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008539-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0008539-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008539.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Survival plot and comparison of neoplasm distribution between DR4 and F1 mice.</title><p>(A) Tumor-free survival of DR4 and F1 mice within 24 months shown by the frequency of diseased mice in DR4 and F1-strains in relation to their age.

Where possible, molecular characterization of LTCL was supported by TCR surface phenotyping of neoplastic cells using corresponding V&#x003b2;-specific monoclonal antibodies. The frequency of tumor cells in starting materials of LTCL varied from 36&#x02013;99&#x00025;, perhaps reflecting the status of tumor progression in the examined animals (data not shown). Despite cellular heterogeneity, the TCR V&#x003b2;-repertoires of all tumors were restricted to a few prominent amplicons. Furthermore, in all cases but one (i.e. Mouse ID-10), only a single amplicon sequence displayed the characteristics of a functional V&#x003b2;-chain. In several tumors, a second amplicon revealed a &#x0201c;non-functional&#x0201d; rearranged TCR sequence. The presence of some contaminating normal T cells was evident in the background of electropherograms, but these sequences were below a signal threshold that allowed individual sequences to be defined, suggesting they were composed of mixtures of different sequences (data not shown).

These animals spontaneously develop a variety of lymphoid malignancies in both the T and B cell lineages. Furthermore, the neoplasms represent different developmental stages of T cells (DP and SP T cells) and B cells (pre, pro, immature, mature, plasma cells). While the majority of malignancies were derived from the lymphoid lineage, the development of several cases of AML point towards the possibility that lymphoid, or even earlier precursor cells with lymphoid characteristics, occasionally transformed into myeloid tumors, as recently proposed by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Deshpande1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Malignant transformation was strongly restricted to the hematopoietic lineage since only one case of carcinoma was observed in the more than 250 mice that underwent multi-organ histological examination. This probably reflects a high propensity for rapidly dividing hematopoietic cells to undergo malignant transformation.</p><p>The expression of only one transgenic chromosome 16 in heterozygous F1 mice was sufficient to allow development of similarly diverse neoplasms. Since only 70&#x00025; of DR4 mice and 53&#x00025; of F1 mice developed tumors, DR4-H2E transgene expression/integration alone was not sufficient for tumorigenesis. The observation that malignancy first appeared around eight months of age is consistent with a time-dependent, multi-step process of transformation in these mice. The primary hit may impact an early cell, perhaps a stem or early progenitor/precursor cell, since some myeloid malignancies were observed but the final events in tumorigenesis were only manifest at later stages of cellular development<monospace>.</monospace> A single transformation event, occurring in an early stem/precursor cell, seemed unlikely since this should lead to polyclonal tumors, whereas the vast majority of lymphomas were monoclonal with respect to TCR or IgH rearrangements. Nevertheless, the strong propensity for B and T cell lymphomas may be related to events occurring during Ig or TCR receptor rearrangement that contributed to a postulated accumulation of genetic hits needed for ultimate transformation. When tumors were first apparent they were very aggressive and caused fulminant and wide-spread disease, arguing against an early development of tumors that remained quiescent and unseen during the first months of life.</p><p>Among the diverse malignancies, the appearance of H-like and R/S-like cells in the compartment of T cell/histiocytic-rich DLBCL is of particular interest. Various investigators have attempted to establish murine models of HL by transplanting human HL cell lines or freshly isolated HL biopsies into immunodeficient SCID mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Bargou1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Kapp1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-vonKalle1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. These models are limited by their xenogeneic nature, whereas the DR4 mice described here provide cases of spontaneous disease with morphological and phenotypic similarities to human T cell/histiocyte rich DLBCL and HL with characteristic H/RS-like cells. Single cell analysis of IgH-rearrangements in the H/RS-like cells revealed a B cell origin in four of five examined cases. Furthermore, &#x0201c;crippled&#x0201d; mutations in the hypervariable CDR3-regions suggested a pre-apoptotic germinal center B cell origin in at least two cases, as shown for some human H/RS cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Kanzler1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Kuppers1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In most human composite lymphomas, a shared precursor for the HL and accompanying B cell tumor was demonstrated by presence of common Ig sequences and shared mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Brauninger1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Zettl1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, sequence comparisons of the microdissected HL-like cells and the accompanying DLBCL-HA or SMZL in DR4 mice showed clonally unrelated V<sub>H</sub>, D<sub>H</sub> and J<sub>H</sub>-families. Likewise, the group of Caleo described a composite human HL and mantle cell lymphoma as two clonally unrelated tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Caleo1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, comparison of IgH sequences with germline configurations revealed accumulation of mutations in framework (FR1&#x02013;FR3) and complementarity-regions (CDR1&#x02013;CDR3) of murine H/RS-like cells that were not detected in accompanying DLBCL-HA or SMZL (data not shown), revealing their origin from two distinct B cells. Nevertheless, the appearance of additional mutations outside the CDR3-region supports the conclusion that murine H/RS-like cells were derived from GC B cells and the crippled mutations seen in two cases were the result of ongoing somatic mutations rather than being due to aberrant VDJ recombination.</p><p>The cellular and molecular analyses of the DR4 mice provide substantial insight into the basis of tumor development. The genomic DR4-H2E transgenes used for creation of DR4 mice contained the murine class II promoter and locus control regions (LCR), enabling natural expression of the chimeric proteins in the appropriate cells and at the appropriate stages of development, as expected for a normal H2 class II molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Ito1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Thereby, the DR4-H2E transgene was not aberrantly expressed in time or place in a manner that could contribute to tumor development.</p><p>It cannot be ascertained whether the chimeric class II protein plays a direct role in lymphoma development since only one founder line was retained by the original investigators and is available for study today. To the best of our knowledge this type of lymphoma development is unique to these DR4 mice since a literature search did not reveal a similar phenotype in other MHC class II tg mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Grusby1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Sonderstrup1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. However, long periods of observation may be needed to detect tumors. If the DR4-H2E chimeric protein is directly involved, its expression alone is not sufficient for tumor development because only 70&#x00025; of homozygous DR4 mice developed tumors, as ascertained by monitoring of all DR4 mice throughout their entire natural lifespan. It remains to be determined whether the chimeric class II protein impinges on particular cellular interactions or functions that could contribute to malignant transformation. It should be noted that chimeric protein expression in tumor cells was not essential, since the T cell tumors were all class II negative (data not shown). H2 class II deficiency appeared not to be essential for tumorigenesis since heterogenous F1 mice were also affected, despite carrying one normal H2 haplotype. Since the frequency of tumors was lower in F1 compared to DR4 mice, further studies are required to determine if there is some subtle impact of H2 class II deficiency on tumor development.</p><p>At first, it seemed most plausible that transgene insertion impacted on one or several murine loci, causing oncogenic effects. The finding that integration of both constructs occurred at a single site ruled out multiple hits due to multiple transgene insertion sites. Furthermore, identification of the exact transgene integration site failed to reveal disruption of a known suppressor gene or activation of a potential oncogene since no annotated gene is located within 1 MB in both directions of the insertion site. However, it is possible that long-range effects on other loci, aberrant recombination events, or abnormal chromosomal pairing and segregation caused by transgene integration could contribute to tumorigenesis. It is also possible that impacts on non-coding sequences localized near the integration site could play a role in tumor development. The age-related appearance of tumors suggests a multi-step process. Future broad scale approaches, therefore, will be needed to further pinpoint the complex mechanisms contributing to lymphoma development.</p><p>In summary, this DR4 line is a unique lymphoma &#x0201c;generator&#x0201d; that yields diverse hematological malignancies. The majority of lymphomas, including the DP LTCL, SMZL and DLBCL-HA described in these mice, represent significant diseases in man, whereas most other naturally occurring hematological tumors in mice do not share major characteristics with human tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Ward1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The appearance of several cases of AML opens the door to better elucidate the origin of these leukemias in relation to lymphoid malignancies. Furthermore, the identification of neoplasms with CD30<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> H/RS-like cells with a probable origin from GC B cells may contribute to development of a long-sought mouse model for human HL. Current xenogeneic models of HL are hampered by low engraftment efficiency and the need for immune suppression. In addition, these transplanted cells lack the characteristic morphological phenotype of human HL. Therefore, a number of features of the DR4 line make it a useful model to investigate common molecular mechanisms that may contribute to important neoplastic diseases in man. Based on the high frequency of spontaneous tumor development, this DR4 line can also be used to assess targeted therapies with potential for wide application in different hematopoietic malignancies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>DR4 tg mice have a C57BL/6 background <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008539-Ito1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> and were a kind gift of Z.
