Somatic mutations of <italic>BRCA1 </italic>have been reported in up to 10% of cases of sporadic ovarian cancer, but they are extremely rare in sporadic breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, reduced BRCA1 protein expression is detected in high-grade sporadic breast and ovarian tumors, suggesting that epigenetic downregulation of <italic>BRCA1 </italic>contributes to their aggressive clinical course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The existence of cancer stem cells associated with <italic>BRCA1 </italic>mutations or downregulation has not been reported.</p><p>In spite of early detection and aggressive surgical and chemotherapeutic approaches, no significant 5-year survival benefits have been achieved in patients harboring <italic>BRCA1 </italic>mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. During the past several years, cancer stem cells have been subjected to increasing scrutiny as a potential cause of relapse and drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Several groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] identified a small subpopulation of highly tumorigenic cells from human breast tumors bearing the CD44<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>-/low </sup>lineage phenotype, which have drug-resistant phenotype and the capacity to form tumors after transplantation in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. Subsequent enrichment in Sca-1 positive cancer stem cells was shown for mouse mammary tumor models, such as mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Her2/neu and MMTV-Wnt1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and Thy1/CD24 expression further defined cancer stem cells in the Wnt1 model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. No studies have yet been conducted to characterize <italic>Brca1</italic>-deficient cancer stem cells.</p><p>Multiple mouse models with targeted deletion of <italic>Brca1 </italic>in the mammary gland generate tumors with low penetrance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Increased incidence of these tumors is observed in mice harboring two <italic>Brca1</italic><sup>&#x00394;<italic>exon</italic>11 </sup>genes in a <italic>p53</italic><sup>+/- </sup>background, with uniform deletion of p53 in these tumors. Lymphomas were also reported in this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, the <italic>Brca1 </italic>deficient mouse mammary tumors have variable penetrance and latency, which makes it nearly impossible to use these models to standardize therapies and to study the stem cell population. To overcome these difficulties, we developed and characterized 16 cell lines from five independent <italic>Brca1</italic><sup>&#x00394;exon11</sup>/<italic>p53</italic><sup>+/- </sup>tumors. We examined these cell lines for specific cell populations using multiple known stem cell markers. Cell populations expressing putative stem cell markers were more resistant to chemotherapeutic agents than were parental cells, and had other characteristics of cancer stem cells, including reconstitution of tumors by as few as 50 to 100 cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Generation of cell lines from <italic>Brca1 </italic>mouse mammary tumors</title><p><italic>Brca1 </italic>tumor cell suspensions were prepared as described by Varticovski and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] from <italic>Brca1</italic><sup>&#x00394;11</sup><italic>p53</italic><sup>+/- </sup>mammary tumors. Briefly, mice were euthanized with CO<sub>2</sub>, and tumors were collected aseptically and mechanically dissociated. Cells were passaged through a 40 &#x003bc;m mesh screen, and were further dissociated by serial passage through a syringe with 18 to 25 gauge needles. Cells were plated at low density for selection of individual clones. Cells were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in 5% carbon dioxide in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, glutamine, and fetal bovine serum starting with 2% and progressively increasing to 10%. More than 40 clones were isolated using cloning cylinders and a total of 16 cell lines were developed from five independent primary tumors. Each cell line was passaged weekly and maintained in culture for up to 50 passages.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of unsorted cells that survive in long-term cultures in the absence of attachment</title><p>The ability of cells to grow in the absence of attachment was tested by plating cells on low-binding plates (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA). Under these conditions, some cell lines showed surviving floating colonies that formed compact spheroids after 3 to 4 weeks of culture. Spheroid formation frequency for each cell line was tested by plating cells in limiting dilution from 500 to 1 cell/well on 96-well low-binding plates in sextuplicate. The number of colonies was scored weekly, and the spheroids were dispersed into single cells and upstaged to six-well plates after 3 weeks. To obtain single cell suspension, spheroids were collected and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Single cell suspension was obtained by incubation in collagenase/dispase and DNAse (Roche, Switzerland), filtering through a 40 &#x003bc;m filter to remove remaining aggregates (Fisher Scientific), and plated directly onto 96-well tissue culture plates for drug testing or passaged onto a new low-binding plate for expansion.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of cell surface markers</title><p>Cell lines grown as monolayer were trypsinized, and cells grown as spheroids were dispersed to obtained single cell populations, as above.

Serial dilutions of doxorubicin, cisplatin, etoposide, and 17-DMAG in medium were added to the cells on the following day or as indicated. Dose-response curves to single drugs at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after exposure were generated to determine the range of concentrations to be used in combination. For drug interaction studies, drugs were added sequentially (with the 17-DMAG introduced with a 24-hour delay) or simultaneously in a final volume of 100 &#x003bc;l. Cytotoxicity was measured using the Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), which is a colorimetric method for determining the number of viable cells based on bioreduction of the tetrazolium compound MTS (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-5-[3-carboxymethoxyphenyl]-2-[4-sulfophenyl]-2<italic>H</italic>-tetrazolium, inner salt) by metabolically active cells. After exposure to a single drug or after a total of 48 hours in sequential addition experiments, 20 &#x003bc;l MTS reagent was added to each well and the plates were incubated in a humidified 37&#x000b0;C incubator with 5% carbon dixoide for 1 to 4 hours. Absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using a 96-well plate reader.

In addition, a distinct subpopulation of cells was evident, namely a CD24<sup>-/low </sup>population (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>), which was not previously observed in any of the parental cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref> and data not shown).

Cell lines derived from B, P2, and P3 tumors had small aggregates and floating nonviable cells.

Previous studies corroborate that <italic>BRCA1 </italic>deficiency results in genetic instability associated with centrosome amplification, defective cell cycle checkpoint control, and impaired DNA damage repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We found that that same <italic>Brca1</italic>-deficient genetic background gave rise to mammary tumors with two distinct and non-overlapping populations of cells that bear cell surface markers previously assigned to tumor-initiating cells from human breast and other organs. Differences in cancer stem cell populations, which constitute a minute fraction of total tumor, may underlie some of the difficulties in using the genome-wide approach to characterizing molecular profiles for these tumors.</p><p>Previous studies showed that 200 CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-/Low </sup>human breast cancer cells reconstitute the entire population of cancer cells <italic>in vitro </italic>and form tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas larger numbers of parental cells or cells sorted for the absence of these markers are needed to generate smaller, slower growing tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We found that CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>- </sup><italic>Brca1</italic>-deficient mouse mammary tumor cells have cancer stem cell characteristics <italic>in vitro</italic>, and 50 of these cells are sufficient to initiate tumors in mice.</p><p>CD44 is a complex, multispanning, transmembrane glycoprotein whose expression correlates with drug resistance and poor prognosis in many malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In addition to hyaluronic acid, CD44 binds fibrinogen, fibronectin, collagen, laminin, fibroblast growth factor-2, other heparin-binding growth factors, and osteopontin, an inflammatory cytokine that is associated with metastatic progression. Recent reports suggested heterogeneity in human breast cancer stem cells that express CD44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Whether CD44 expression plays a direct role in drug resistance by activating multiple survival pathways via growth factor receptors or integrin-mediated 'inside-out' signaling is not known and warrants further investigation.</p><p>Although expression of CD24 negatively correlated with stem cell characteristics in human breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], the situation is more complex in mouse mammary tumors. In murine mammary gland the CD24<sup>low </sup>cells correspond to myoepithelial cells and have high mammary fat pad reconstitution capacity, whereas the CD24<sup>+ </sup>population has low capacity for reconstitution and is devoid of normal mammary stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Furthermore, Weinberg and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] recently reported that mammosphere-forming and tumor-initiating capacities reside within CD24<sup>+ </sup>freshly isolated normal mammary cells, but when these cells are briefly cultured the CD24<sup>- </sup>population was enriched with cancer stem cells. These previously reported differences in expression of CD24 in different tumor types and in normal mouse mammary epithelium support our search for the role of CD24<sup>- </sup>cells in combination with a more established marker, CD44, in <italic>BRCA1</italic>-deficient tumors.</p><p>Expression of CD133 in cancer-initiating cells is well documented for brain, prostate, and colon cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] but has not been described in breast cancer. We detected 2% to 4% of CD133<sup>+ </sup>cells in multiple cell lines derived from one <italic>Brca1 </italic>tumor with characteristics similar to those found in CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>- </sup>cells, including drug resistance, the ability to form spheroids with further 30% enrichment in CD133<sup>+ </sup>cells, expression of stem cell genes, and <italic>in vivo </italic>reconstitution of tumors with as few as 100 cells. CD133, also known as prominin-1, is a cell-surface glycoprotein with five transmembrane domains and two large glycosylated extracellular loops that localize to membrane protrusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The function of CD133 in cancer stem cells has not been established, but one alternatively spliced form binds cholesterol and thus may be involved in Hedgehog signaling, which is required for primitive cell differentiation and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>We previously described generation of tumors from cell suspensions from multiple genetically engineered mouse mammary tumors and their expansion by transplantation in na&#x000ef;ve recipients <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Gene expression analysis of individual <italic>Brca1 </italic>mammary tumors and their subsequent passages <italic>in vivo </italic>revealed substantial heterogeneity in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], as predicted by differences in frequency and identity of cancer stem cell populations in cell lines derived from these tumors. Thus, in contrast to other models, such as MMTV-PyMT and MMTV-wnt1, in which pooling individual mouse tumors can generate sufficient material for basic and translational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], <italic>Brca1 </italic>tumors will need to be analyzed individually and these studies are limited by the size of each original tumor. Thus, generation of cell lines provided valuable reagents for these studies.</p><p>A fundamental characteristic of cancer stem cells is their resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Much understanding of <italic>BRCA1 </italic>drug resistance comes from studies of a single human cell line, namely H1937, which is null for the <italic>BRCA1 </italic>gene. Although replacement of this gene increases resistance to vinorelbine and cisplatin, it does not change sensitivity to other agents, such as docetaxel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This suggests that other mechanisms may determine drug resistance in that cell line. Consistent with these observations, we found that H1937 cells contain a significant (2% to 3%) population of cells expressing CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>- </sup>and no detectable CD133<sup>+ </sup>(data not shown). The contribution of these cells to drug sensitivity remains to be determined.</p><p>Over-expression of several ABC transporters has been linked to drug resistance. Our analysis showed that <italic>Abcb1b </italic>expression correlated with an increase in cells having stem cell markers in A1.8 and RP.1 cell lines. Expression of <italic>Abcb1b </italic>was further enriched in A.8 cells sorted for stem cell markers. However, this did not occur in RP.1 cells, because CD133<sup>- </sup>cells, but not CD133<sup>+ </sup>cells, exhibited greater expression of <italic>Abcb1b</italic>. Increased <italic>Abcg2 </italic>expression, previously associated with cancer stem cells, was evident in all <italic>Brca1 </italic>cell lines, regardless of presence or absence of putative stem cell fraction. Furthermore, the highest expression of <italic>Abcg2 </italic>was detected in B.15, a cell line that was not enriched in stem cell markers and did not form spheroids. Thus, expression of other transporters, or different drug resistance mechanisms, such as aldehyde dehydrogenase, which was over-expressed in both CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>- </sup>and CD133<sup>+ </sup>cell types, may be operational in <italic>Brca1 </italic>cancer stem cells. Aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 participates in oxidation of retinol to all-<italic>trans </italic>retinoic acid, and confers drug resistance to chemotherapeutic agents by an uncertain mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>We previously demonstrated schedule-dependent synergy of the HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG with doxorubicin for lymphoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Here, we found that addition of 17-DMAG simultaneously or after chemotherapeutic agents sensitizes <italic>Brca1 </italic>cancer stem cells to three types of DNA-damaging agents: doxorubicin, cisplatin, and etoposide. Because HSP90 inhibitors impair multiple signal transduction pathways, resulting in decreased cell survival and DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], our data showed that functional inactivation of <italic>Brca1 </italic>is particularly vulnerable to this combination. Whether HSP90 inhibitors sensitize other cancer stem cells to chemotherapeutic agents remains to be established. Development of cancer stem cell-directed therapies has been hampered by inability to expand cancer stem cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Enrichment of cancer stem cells in spheroids formed by <italic>Brca1 </italic>cell lines provides ample material for studies of cancer stem cell biology and preclinical testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>Brca1</italic>-deficient mouse mammary tumors harbor heterogeneous cancer stem cell populations, and CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>- </sup>cells also identify human breast cancer stem cells. In addition, long-term spheroid-forming assay may allow rapid screening of tumors for enrichment in cancer stem cells, identification of additional stem cell markers, and development of potentially curative therapies that target the putative cancer stem cell.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ABC = ATP-binding cassette; CI = Combination Index; 17-DMAG = 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin hydrochloride; IC<sub>50 </sub>= 50% inhibitory concentration; MMTV = mouse mammary tumor virus; MTS = 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2<italic>H</italic>-tetrazolium, inner salt; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline; RT-PCR = reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MHW developed all cell lines, and performed the flow cytometry labeling, RNA extraction and analysis, as well as drug testing <italic>in vitro</italic>.
