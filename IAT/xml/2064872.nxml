However, it is largely unknown how the sumoylation pathway is regulated. Here, we report that nitric oxide (NO) causes global hyposumoylation in mammalian cells. Both SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and E3 ligase protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (Pias3) were targets for S-nitrosation. S-nitrosation did not interfere with the SUMO conjugating activity of Ubc9, but promoted Pias3 degradation by facilitating its interaction with tripartite motif-containing 32 (Trim32), a ubiquitin E3 ligase. On the one hand, NO promoted Trim32-mediated Pias3 ubiquitination. On the other hand, NO enhanced the stimulatory effect of Pias3 on Trim32 autoubiquitination. The residue Cys459 of Pias3 was identified as a target site for S-nitrosation. Mutation of Cys459 abolished the stimulatory effect of NO on the Pias3-Trim32 interaction, indicating a requirement of S-nitrosation at Cys459 for positive regulation of the Pias3-Trim32 interplay. This study reveals a novel crosstalk between S-nitrosation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation, which may be crucial for NO-related physiological and pathological processes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>SUMO modification is an important mechanism for posttranslational regulation of protein function including transcription, intracellular transport, DNA repair, replication, and cell signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Hay1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Three SUMO isoforms (SUMO1, 2, 3) exist. The enzymatic reactions of SUMO modification are similar to those in ubiquitin modification and involve the E1-activating enzyme consisting of an Aos1/Uba2 heterodimer, the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and the E3 ligase that promotes the transfer of SUMO from the E2 enzyme to substrate proteins. The protein inhibitors of activated STAT (Pias) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Kotaja1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, nuclear pore component RanBP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Pichler1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, and polycomb protein Pc2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Kagey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> have been identified as SUMO E3 ligases. Mammalian cells contain four members of the Pias family (Pias1, 3, x, and y) that share a similar domain structure. These ligases bring the reaction partners in close proximity and this leads to an increased rate of isopeptide bond formation. The conjugation of proteins with SUMO can be reversed by isopeptidases, allowing for dynamic regulation of SUMO-dependent processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Hay1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Little is known about the regulation of the sumoylation pathway itself. One example of such regulation is that the viral protein Gam-1 can inhibit sumoylation by targeting E1 and E2 for degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Boggio1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to cause repression of sumoylation by crosslinking E1 subunit Uba2 to the E2 subunit Ubc9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Bossis1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

S-nitrosation can link NO signaling to other cellular events through crosstalk with various other post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Hess1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the connection between S-nitrosation and sumoylation modifications has not been established. We noted that several SUMO-related enzymes contain conserved cysteines, raising the possibility that NO species might influence the biological function of these proteins through direct post-translational modification. In this report, we show that both SUMO E2 (Ubc9) and E3 (Pias) enzymes are targets for S-nitrosation. Importantly, S-nitrosation of Pias3 regulates its stability and thereby counteracts the sumoylation pathway. Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism through which sumoylation is regulated, which provides new insight into the function of S-nitrosation in human health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Nitric oxide causes global hyposumoylation by a different mechanism than H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></title><p>To investigate whether nitric oxide (NO) can regulate the formation of SUMO-conjugated species, HEK293 cells were transfected with the expression vector encoding the HA-tagged SUMO1, SUMO2, or SUMO3, and then treated with or without 500 &#x000b5;M GSNO (a widly-used NO donor and S-nitrosating agent) for 4 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Hess1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Qu1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The cells were lysed directly in Laemmli buffer and immunoblotted with HA antibody. We observed a marked reduction in the levels of both SUMO1 and SUMO2 conjugates, but only a slight reduction in SUMO3 conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g001">Fig 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Simultaneous accumulation of free SUMO1 and SUMO2 was also observed in GSNO-challenged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g001">Fig 1<italic>A</italic></xref>), suggesting that overall hyposumoylation was attributed to altered utilization rather than reduced expression of SUMO1/2 modifier.

Notably, several sumoylated substrates, including SP3 and PML, were deconjugated upon GSNO or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001085.s001">Fig <italic>S1</italic></xref>). The analysis of endogenous SUMO1 conjugates in HeLa cells revealed a dose-dependent repression of overall sumoylation in response to less than 1 mM of GSNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g001">Fig 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Correspondingly, global ubiquitination was also downregulated in a dose-dependent manner under GSNO treatment, in sharp contrast to its insensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Bossis1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. It should be pointed out that much higher concentrations (2&#x02013;8 mM) of GSNO induced a significant increase in overall sumoylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001085.s002">Fig <italic>S2</italic></xref>), a phenomenon that has recently been reported for high concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Bossis1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.

HeLa cells were transfected with HA-Ubc9 and then stimulated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or GSNO. Immunoblotting showed a DTT-sensitive crosslink between Ubc9 and Uba2 upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, consistent with the previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Bossis1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. GSNO, however, could not induce such a crosslink (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001085.s003">Fig <italic>S3</italic></xref>). Considering that Ubc9 contains redox-sensitive cysteines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Bossis1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, we next investigated whether NO could give rise to Ubc9 thiol modification. HEK293 cells transfected with HA-Ubc9 were treated with GSNO and the lysates were subjected to the biotin-switch assay, in which the S-nitrosation can be specifically identified as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Chung1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Jaffrey1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g002">Fig 2<italic>A</italic></xref>, HEK293-expressed Ubc9 was readily S-nitrosated under GSNO treatment. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified Cys75 of Ubc9 as the target for S-nitrosation. Given that the SUMO transfer process involves a <italic>trans</italic>-esterification reaction between Uba2 and Ubc9, we examined whether S-nitrosation of Ubc9 could compromise its ability to receive SUMO. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g002">Fig 2<italic>B</italic></xref>, stimulation of cells with GSNO did not impair the formation of the Ubc9-SUMO thioester bond. In sharp contrast, the thioester intermediate rapidly disappeared upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. Next, in order to know whether S-nitrosation of Ubc9 affects its ability to conjugate SUMO to substrate protein, the Ubc9 fusion-directed sumoylation system, in which Ubc9 can direct sumoylation to fused p53 in a manner independent of E3 ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Jakobs1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, was employed. Immunoblotting revealed that the Ubc9-fused p53 was effectively mono- and di-sumoylated in HEK293 cells expressing p53-Ubc9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g002">Fig 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). The sumoylation of p53 was dependent on the catalytic activity of fused Ubc9, because mutation of Ubc9 at Cys93 diminished such modification and the endogenous p53 was not sumoylated even in the presence of overexpressed Ubc9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g002">Fig 2<italic>C</italic></xref>), consistent with the previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Jakobs1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Using this system, we observed that unlike H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which deconjugated the mono- and di-sumoylated species efficiently, sumoylation of p53 was hardly influenced by GSNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g002">Fig 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). This experiment indicates that NO does not interfere with the SUMO conjugating activity of Ubc9, provided that Ubc9 and the protein substrate are &#x0201c;close&#x0201d; enough to each other in vivo. To further support the above conclusion that NO does not interfere with the SUMO conjugating function of Ubc9, either Ubc9 (WT) or Ubc9 (C75S) was overexpressed in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001085.s004">Fig. <italic>S4</italic></xref>). One may predict that, if S-nitrosation of Ubc9 can result in repression of sumoylation, at least overexpression of Ubc9 (C75S), the S-nitrosation-deficient Ubc9 mutant, could prevent GSNO-caused hyposumoylation. However, the outcome was negative (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001085.s004">Fig <italic>S4</italic></xref>). Together, these results indicate that NO results in overall hyposumoylation in a Ubc9-independent manner.</p><fig id="pone-0001085-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001085.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>S-nitrosation of Ubc9 did not compromise its SUMO E2 enzyme activity.</title><p>(A) S-nitrosation of HA-Ubc9 (wild-type or cysteine mutants) in HEK293 cells stimulated with 500 &#x000b5;M GSNO determined by biotin-switch assay.

To determine the mechanism by which Trim32 was recruited to the Pias3-localized nuclear compartment, LMB, a CRM1-targeting nuclear export inhibitor, was used. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g004">Fig 4<italic>C</italic></xref>, LMB prevented the colocalization of Trim32 and Pias3 in the nucleus as well as preventing the stimulatory effect of Pias3 on Trim32 cytosolic aggregation.

Next, we explored the possible effect of Pias3 on Trim32, including autoubiquitination and potential sumoylation of Trim32. It turned out that Trim32 could not be sumoylated, even in the presence of overexpressed Pias3 (data not shown). Interestingly, the autoubiquitination of Trim32, an indicator of ubiquitin E3 ligase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Chung1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Albor1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, was enhanced by cotransfected Pias3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g004">Fig 4<italic>E</italic></xref>), indicating that association with Pias3 elevates the ligase activity of Trim32. Finally, we examined the possible regulatory role of NO on the Trim32-Pias3 interplay. It was observed in a GST pulldown assay that addition of GSNO markedly strengthened the Pias3-Trim32 association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g004">Fig 4<italic>B</italic></xref>).

As for the functional interplay between Pias3 and Trim32, both Trim32-mediated Pias3 ubiquitination and Pias3-stimulated autoubiquitination of Trim32 were found to be substantially enhanced in the presence of GSNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g004">Fig 4<italic>D, E</italic></xref>). Together, these observations indicate that NO promotes the association and bidirectional influence between Trim32 and Pias3, which may facilitate Trim32-mediated Pias3 ubiquitination.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>S-nitrosation of Pias3 positively regulates Pias3-Trim32 association</title><p>Since S-nitrosation has been reported to facilitate protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Hara1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, we speculated that NO-mediated specific molecular modification of Pias3 (or Trim32) might regulate its interaction with Trim32 (or Pias3). Using the biotin-switch method, we verified that Pias3, as well as other members of the Pias family, could be efficiently S-nitrosated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g005">Fig 5<italic>A</italic></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001085.s008">Fig <italic>S8</italic></xref>). The absence of S-nitrosated Trim32 under GSNO treatment revealed the specificity of the above modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g005">Fig 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Furthermore, Pias3 was found to be constitutively S-nitrosated in HEK293 cells ectopicly expressing iNOS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001085.s009">Fig <italic>S9</italic></xref>), indicating a role of endogenously produced NO in modifying Pias3.

To further confirm this, HEK293-expressed Pias3 mutant (C459S), whose cysteine 459 was mutated to serine, was subjected to the biotin-switch assay. As expected, mutation of Pias3 at Cys459 substantially diminished its S-nitrosation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001085.s011">Fig <italic>S11</italic></xref>). Next, we investigated whether S-nitrosation of Pias3 regulated its association with Trim32. It was demonstrated by GST-pull down assay that although the Pias3 bearing a C459S mutation still retained the ability to associate with Trim32 in the absence of GSNO, the stimulatory effect of GSNO on Pias3(C459S)-Trim32 association disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g005">Fig 5<italic>C</italic></xref>). In addition, the GSNO-enhanced binding of wild-type Pias3 to Trim32 could be abolished by dithiothreitol (DTT), a nitrosothiol-reducing reagent (data not shown).

This work may have implications in three different conceptual areas. First, it reveals a unique mechanism to counteract the sumoylation pathway.

Su, SUMO; S, substrate protein.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001085.g006"/></fig><p>Firstly, we demonstrated a novel biological phenomenon, namely that NO led to desumoylation of most SUMO targets, which was due to at least in part, destabilization of SUMO E3 ligase Pias3. Unlike the effects of low concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>or the virus protein Gam1, both of which target SUMO E1 and E2 enzymes, NO failed to interfere with Ubc9-mediated transfer of SUMO from Uba2 to the target protein, although it could S-nitrosate Ubc9 at a non-catalytic cysteine. Despite targeting E3, the efficiency of NO in the repression of global sumoylation is high. The effect obtained with 500 &#x000b5;M GSNO was comparable to that of 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a much stronger oxidant. Moreover, the endogenous NO produced in LPS-stimulated macrophages demonstrated a slight inhibitory effect on overall sumoylation, an effect that is however more significant than that obtained with endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from activated NADPH oxidase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Bossis1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. It should be pointed out that, although S-nitrosation-dependent degradation of Pias3 contributes to loss of SUMO conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g003">Fig.3<italic>B</italic></xref>), global sumoylation profile may be controlled by the net effect of NO on multiple protein targets. For example, Pias family members including Pias3, Piasx&#x003b1;, Piasx&#x003b2; and Piasy were all found as S-nitrosated targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001085.s008">Fig <italic>S8</italic></xref>). In addition, most of SUMO isopeptidases (such as Senp) contain redox-sensitive cysteine(s). If these isopeptidases can be inhibited by higher concentrations of NO, one may understand why high concentration of GSNO showed a stimulatory effect on overall sumoylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Bossis1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, it is not contradictory that various SUMO-related enzymes coordinately respond to certain signal and control sumoylation. This is indeed evidenced by a recent report that the cAMP pathway repressed global sumoylation in human endometrial stromal cells by differentially affecting the protein contents of various SUMO E3 ligases and isopeptidases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Jones1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Concerning the molecular mechanism by which NO promotes Pias3 degradation, we observed the S-nitrosation-stimulated recruitment of ubiquitin E3 ligase to Pias3. This biological phenomenon reflects S-nitrosation-tuned protein-protein interactions. In our study, S-nitrosation of a single cysteine C459 was found to be sufficient to mediate regulation of association of Pias3 and Trim32. However, C459 is not located in the N-terminal region of Pias3 that harbors the Trim32-binding site (data not shown), suggesting that S-nitrosation probably regulates Pias3-Trim32 interaction by inducing a conformational change in Pias3. At this point, our finding seems similar to a report that S-nitrosation of GAPDH at a single cysteine stimulates its association with Siah1, a ubiquitin E3 ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Hara1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, NO enhanced Pias3-Trim32 affinity but did not affect the intranuclear localization of Pias3, suggesting that ubiquitination of Pias3 might occur in the nucleus. During preparation of this manuscript, Depaux et al reported an intranuclear degradation of Pias proteins by Siah2, another ubiquitin E3 ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Depaux1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In cells coexpressing Pias1 and Siah2, Siah2 was translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus where it colocalized with Pias1, and was distributed into cytosolic aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Depaux1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. This report is highly consistent with our finding, and suggests a possibility that NO may also stimulate the interplay of Pias3 with other ubiquitin E3 ligases. Unraveling the effect of NO in the regulation of the Siah2-Pias pathway would be an interesting topic for future study.</p><p>Although SUMO and ubiquitin pathways are highly similar, little is known about signal-directed coupling of the two systems. We show here that NO links ubiquitination to sumoylation by promoting the binding of ubiquitin and SUMO E3 ligases, a process intergrating three kinds of post-translational modifications: S-nitrosation, sumoylation and ubiquitination. Recently, a crosstalk between S-nitrosation and ubiquitination has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Chung1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. NO was shown to inhibit the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of Parkin through S-nitrosation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Chung1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. By such mechanism, NO might cause disappearance of the bulk of ubiquitin conjugates, as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001085-g001">Fig 1<italic>C</italic></xref>. In fact, based on a similar idea, we have investigated the possible influence of S-nitrosation on the SUMO E3 ligase activity of Pias3; however, the result was negative (data not shown). The insensitivity of Pias3 activity to NO is consistent with the fact that the C459 of Pias3 that is S-nitrosated does not reside in the catalytic RING domain. Therefore, we speculate that S-nitrosation probably serves mainly as a negative regulatory mechanism to control the stability of Pias3 and thereby tune the sumoylation pathway. However, it should not be ignored that Pias3 protein itself is a negative regulator of pro-inflammatory gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Jang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001085-Chung2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, Pias3 may also serve as an intranuclear NO sensor, whose degradation represents a step to turn on inflammatory gene expression under nitrosative stress.</p><p>In summary, we report here that NO regulates sumoylation through S-nitrosation-dependent degradation of Pias3. Since SUMO modification participates in the regulation of multiple protein functions, repression of sumoylation may mediate a number of NO-related cellular events and pathological processes. For instance, desumoylation of PML and SP3 may be involved in NO-elicited transcriptional regulation. In addition, NO has been shown to desumoylate DJ-1 in neural cells, whose sumoylation is required for the full protective functions of DJ-1 (unpublished observation). Therefore, identifying proteins whose SUMO modification is reduced under nitrosative stress and unraveling the related functional consequences presents an exciting and important challenge for future research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents, plasmids and antibodies</title><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), S-methyl thiocarbamate (SMT), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), iodoacetamide, and MG132 were purchased from Sigma.

MS/MS spectra were acquired by using a full scan followed by five MS/MS scans in a data-dependent mode. Precursors that were detected twice within 15 s were put on a dynamic exclusion list for a period of 60 s. MS/MS data were processed with in-house Bioworks (version 3.2, Thermo Electron Corporation, San Jose, CA) as described below: MS/MS spectra were extracted from the raw files by using SEQUEST with the following parameters; MW range: 250&#x02013;4,000; threshold, 1,000; precursor mass tolerance: 2; group scan tolerance, 2; minimum group count, 1; precursor charge state, auto; MSn level, auto. Raw data were searched against NCBI human Refseq protein database (version: 2006.9.18) and filtered with the following criteria: Xcorr&#x0003e;1.9 for singly charged, &#x0003e;2.5 for doubly charged and &#x0003e;3.75 for triply charged ions; Delta Cn&#x0003e;0.1; RSp&#x0003c;5; and preliminary score (Sp)&#x0003e;500. Cysteines either modified by MMTS (&#x0002b;46), nitrosation (&#x0002b;29), sulphination (&#x0002b;32) or sulphonation (&#x0002b;48) and methionine oxidation (&#x0002b;16) were all specified as differential modifications. MS/MS spectra were manually validated by the following criteria: (i) a continuous b or y-ion series of at least five residues and (ii) the top three most intense fragment peaks assigned to either an a, b, y-ion, to an a, b, y-ion resulting from a neutral loss of water or ammonia, or to a multiply protonated fragment ion. All acquired data were further validated by Trans-Proteomics Pipeline (TPP, Institute of System Biology, Seattle) with PeptideProphet&#x000ae;(Keller et al., 2002) &#x0003e;0.99 and ProteinProphet&#x000ae;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.0 as a threshold for peptides and protein validation, respectively (data not shown). The above results represent three independent experiments.</p><p>Materials used: MMTS (Pierce), sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega), formic acid and acetonitrile were HPLC-grade from J.T. Baker Chemicals. Synergi Hydro-RP silica (4 &#x003bc;, 80 &#x000c5;) was from Phenomenex.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001085.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>HEK293 cells transfected with GFP-PML (left) or HA-SP3 (right) were treated with H2O2 (1 mM) for 1h or with GSNO (0.5 mM) for indicated time, lysed in Laemmli buffer and immunoblotted with anti-GFP or anti-HA.</p><p>(0.29 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001085.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001085.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>HeLa cells were treated with increasing concentrations of GSNO for 4 h, lysed in Laemmli buffer, and immunoblotted with anti-SUMO1 or anti-actin.</p><p>(0.09 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001085.s002.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001085.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>HeLa cells transfected with HA-Ubc9 were incubated with 0.5 mM H2O2 for 30 min or with 0.5 mM GSNO for the indicated time, lysed in Laemmli Buffer with (lanes 3 and 10) or without (other lanes) DTT and immunoblotted with either anti-HA (left) or anti-Uba2 (right).
