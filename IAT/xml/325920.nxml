As in the alpha 2 type I gene the coding information for the C-propeptide of the type III collagen gene is subdivided in four exons. Similarly, the amino proximal exon contains sequences for both the carboxy terminal end of the alpha-helical segment of collagen and for the beginning of the C-propeptide in both genes. Therefore, this organization of exons must have been established before these two collagen genes arose by duplication of a common ancestor. In several subsegments the deduced amino acid sequence for the C-propeptide of type III collagen shows a strong homology with the corresponding amino acid sequence in alpha 1 and alpha 2 type I. For one of these homologous amino acid sequences, however, the nucleotide sequence is much better conserved than for the others. It is possible that a mechanism of gene conversion has maintained the homogeneity of this nucleotide sequence among the interstitial collagen genes. Alternatively, the conserved nucleotide sequence may represent a regulatory signal which could function either in the DNA or in the RNA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00354-0228.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2733"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00354-0229.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2734"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00354-0230.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2735"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00354-0231.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2736"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00354-0232.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2737"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00354-0233.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2738"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00354-0234.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2739"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00354-0235.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2740"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00354-0236.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2741"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00354-0237.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2742"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00354-0238.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2743"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00354-0239.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2744"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
