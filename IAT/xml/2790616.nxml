In both mammalian tumor and yeast cells that lack telomerase, telomeres are maintained by an alternative recombination mechanism. Here we demonstrated that the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> type I survivors derived from telomerase-deficient cells were hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents. Assays to track telomere lengths and drug sensitivity of telomerase-deficient cells from spore colonies to survivors suggested a correlation between telomere shortening and bleomycin sensitivity. Our genetic studies demonstrated that this sensitivity depends on Mec1, which signals checkpoint activation, leading to prolonged cell-cycle arrest in senescent budding yeasts. Moreover, we also observed that when cells equipped with short telomeres, recruitments of homologous recombination proteins, Rad51 and Rad52, were reduced at an HO-endonuclease-catalyzed double-strand break (DSB), while their associations were increased at chromosome ends. These results suggested that the sensitive phenotype may be attributed to the sequestration of repair proteins to compromised telomeres, thus limiting the repair capacity at bona fide DSB sites.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Telomeres are the specialized DNA-proteins complexes at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that allow intact ends to be distinguished from broken chromosomes, prevent chromosomes from end-to-end fusion, degradation, genomic instability and the associated risk of cancer. In most organisms, telomeric DNA is composed of a tandem array of short sequences. For example, these repeats in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> consist of &#x0223c;350&#x000b1;75 bp of duplex TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>/C<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>A tracts. Internal to the TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>/C<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>A tracts are two classes of middle repetitive DNA elements, called X and Y' <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008224-Zakian1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Most survivors are type I, which have multiple tandem copies of the subtelomeric Y' element followed by very short terminal tracts of TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>/CA<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008224-Lundblad1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008224-Teng1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In a minor fraction of the survivors (type II), the lengths of telomere sequence are increased heterogeneously from several hundred base pairs to 10 kb or longer (Teng and Zakian, 1999). The generation of type I survivors depends on the presence of helicase Rad54, Rad51 that acts in strand invasion, Rad55-Rad57 complex that stabilizes recombination filament <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008224-Krogh1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, and 5&#x02032;-to-3&#x02032; exonuclease Exo1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008224-Bertuch1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

These results indicate that in mammals, as in yeast, telomere attrition resulting from lack of telomerase or alterations in telomere structure triggers characteristic DNA damage-initiated checkpoint. Additionally, not only do short telomeres share some of the biological and mechanistic features of DNA damage sites, they also exert effects on cellular response to DNA damage.

The induction kinetics showed that all strains remained only approximately 20&#x0223c;27&#x00025; of the original signal after two-hour induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008224.s004">Figure S4</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008224-g004">Figure 4B</xref> shows the quantitative results of ChIPs using a polyclonal antibody against Rad51 (left) or Rad52 (right).

PCR primers specific to the <italic>ASP3</italic> gene (which is on a different chromosome from <italic>MAT</italic>) were included as an internal control. Compared to wild type cells, type I survivors showed only 8&#x00025; and 16&#x00025; in bindings of Rad51 and Rad52, respectively, to the HO-induced DSB, while the pre-senescent <italic>tlc1</italic> mutant displayed similar results as wild type cells.

Therefore, it was not the lower protein expression that caused the decreased bindings of repair proteins to the HO cut site. To exclude the possibility that the reduced recruitments of HR proteins in type I survivors is caused by the different phases which WT and type I cells may be in, we conducted the ChIP experiment with both strains arrested in G2/M phase, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). From the data above, we propose that the sensitive phenotype to DNA-damaging agents in cells with short telomeres may be resulted from their impaired ability to recruit sufficient DNA repair proteins to damaged sites.</p><p>To determine whether the gathering of repair proteins at short telomeres perturbed their recruitment to DSBs, the amount of Rad51 and Rad52 bound at the left telomere of chromosome VII (VII-L) was examined by ChIP in strains containing the modified chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008224-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Since telomeres were constantly subject to recombinant events upon loss of telomerase and thus were likely to relocate or lose the sequence designed for quantification, the maintenance of the <italic>URA3</italic> marker in the telomere of type I survivors were confirmed by Southern blot before ChIP analysis (data not shown). ChIP samples were quantitated by real-time PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008224-g005">Figure 5B</xref> (left), there was a 3.2-fold enrichment of telomere sequences in the anit-Rad51 immunoprecipitate of type I cells, whereas both wild-type and pre-senescent <italic>tlc1</italic> mutant strains showed a 1.9-fold enrichment. Similar results were found with Rad52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008224-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, right). While the short VII-L telomeric DNA was enriched 4.3-fold in the anti-Rad52 immunoprecipitate of type I survivors, there was only 1.5 and 1.6-fold enrichment in wild-type and pre-senescent <italic>tlc1</italic> mutant strains, respectively. As expected, the two-hour treatment with bleomycin (1.5 mU/ml) before ChIP samples were collected did not decrease the level of Rad52 bound to the telomere in type I survivors (data not shown). However, to exclude the possibility that the higher association of Rad proteins to the modified telomere in type I cells was attributed to some artifacts formed during the ChIP procedure, we further investigated whether these sequestered repair proteins can be released from telomeres to bona fide DSBs upon subjection to exogenous DNA damage. Towards this aim, before ChIP samples were collected, a portion of yeast culture was treated with high concentration of bleomcyin (7.5 mU/ml) for two hours. As a result, the bindings of both Rad proteins at VII-L reduced to the wild-type level in type I cells after treated with bleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008224-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, both wild-type and pre-senescent <italic>tlc1</italic> mutant strains displayed indistinguishable bindings of Rad proteins at VII-L before and after bleomycin treatment. All together, these results demonstrate that sequestration of Rad51 and Rad52 at short telomeres reduces the efficiency of their recruitments to an induced DSB site and that the mere onset of telomerase deprivation in pre-senescent <italic>tlc1</italic> mutant does not lead to the same level of biased distribution of Rad proteins as shown in type I survivors.</p><fig id="pone-0008224-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008224.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Sequestration of repair proteins at telomeres in type I survivors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The left arm of chromosome VII-L in YPH499 UT strain was modified by integration of fragments containing the <italic>URA3</italic> and telomeric sequence at the <italic>ADH4</italic> locus.

In this study, we observed that type I survivors are exclusively hypersensitive to DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008224-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We have proved that this phenotype was not caused by some permanent genetic distortions since it could be complemented by a plasmid-borne <italic>TLC1</italic> and elevated mutation rates were not detected in type I cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008224-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008224.s003">S3</xref>). We further discovered that the sensitive response to DSBs is not only restricted to type I survivors, but also applies to <italic>tlc1</italic> senescent cells before any survivor formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008224-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Once TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> tracts are lengthened through the recombination pathway, such as in type II survivors, cells can be recovered from the DSB-sensitive phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008224-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008224-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) demonstrated that the overall TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> tracts of senescent <italic>tlc1</italic> mutants and type I survivors are relatively shorter than those of wild type or type II survivor strains. This indicates a correlation between short telomeres and ineffective DSB repair.</p><p>Our finding of the reduced binding of HR proteins to a single cut site along with the observation of increased association of HR proteins with telomeres in type I survivors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008224-g004">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008224-g005">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008224-g006">6</xref>) provides a potential mechanistic basis for the impaired DSB response in organisms with dysfunctional telomeres. Similar observations have been proposed in two recent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008224-Meyer1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008224-Khadaroo1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, both of which reported a robust Rad52 localization with the telomere in the <italic>est2</italic> mutant. Meyer and Bailis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008224-Meyer1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> have also demonstrated a correlation between this sequestration of Rad52 to telomeres in the <italic>est2</italic> mutant and reduced localization to an induced DSB formation. One apparent difference with our results is that the pre-senescent <italic>est2</italic> mutant strain in the Meyer <italic>et al.</italic> experiments showed increased binding of Rad52 to the telomere, whereas we did not observe this in our pre-senescent <italic>tlc1</italic>mutant. The discrepancy can be explained by the divergent strain backgrounds that generate different rates of senescence. Additionally, our ChIP results are consistent with the observation that pre-senescent <italic>tlc1</italic> mutant is not as sensitive as senescent cells or type I survivors to bleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008224-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>The idea of competition between DNA damage sites has also been reported elsewhere: the inhibitory effect of NHEJ on the initiation of DSB resection in G1 phase is able to be suppressed by four or more DSBs, indicating that some components of NHEJ may become limiting in the presence of multiple breaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008224-Zierhut1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Because shortened telomeres mimic DSBs, we speculate that DSB repair proteins, either for HR or NHEJ, might become limiting as well in the presence of shortened telomeres that resemble DSB sites.</p><p>One surprising finding was that the <italic>MEC1</italic> removal leads to a dramatic increase in the bleomycin resistance in type I survivors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008224-g008">Figures 8B</xref>), indicating that type I sensitivity to bleomycin is dependent on <italic>MEC1</italic>. Type I survivors persistently displayed phosphorylated Rad53 even in the absence of bleomycin and the bleomycin-induced Rad53 mobility shift was almost abolished in conjunction with the abrogation of <italic>MEC1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008224.s005">Figure S5</xref>), suggesting that type I sensitivity to DSBs might be attributed to the persistent Mec1-related checkpoint activation. These findings were quite striking, because checkpoint activation is normally expected to coincide with improved damage resistance. However, here we observed that diminished checkpoint activation by deleting <italic>MEC1</italic> dramatically promoted bleomycin tolerance of type I survivors. Nonetheless, similar results have been reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008224-Pike1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, as the abolished Rad53 phosphorylation in <italic>mec1</italic> mutants is suppressed by deletion of <italic>MDT1</italic>. This improved checkpoint activation paradoxically worsened bleomycin tolerance compared to <italic>mec1</italic> single mutants. Moreover, Alabert et al. have reported similar conflicting observations that Mrc1-dependent checkpoint activation prevents homolgous recombination at DNA DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008224-Alabert1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. They proposed that ssDNA exposed at stalled forks is the key signal to recruit HR machinery and suppress potentially dangerous HR at DSBs, since ssDNA is already present at the stalled fork and DSB repair depends on the formation of the 3&#x02032; ssDNA overhangs. These findings prompt us to hypothesize that short telomeres distinguish themselves from DSBs through exposed 3&#x02032; overhangs to trigger Mec1-dependent checkpoint activation and thus prevent HR at DSBs that still need resection. In fact, the idea that Mec1 is required to recognize signals emanating from short telomeres was supported by a recent ChIP result showing that Mec1 interacts physically with critically short telomeres, thereby sensing and transducing the signal for G2/M cell-cycle arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008224-Abdallah1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, even though type I survivor formation seems to be one major alternative pathway to repair the damage caused by dysfunctional telomeres, these survivors, nevertheless, resemble the senescent cells that suffer from a prolonged arrest. This prolonged arrest indicates an attempt to repair &#x0201c;chromosomal end damage&#x0201d; in type I cells. Combined with the ChIP and IF data, it is tempting to speculate that in the absence of Mec1, short chromosomal ends are not properly recognized as DNA damage sites, thereby becoming less competitive for DNA repair proteins that are normally recruited to bona-fide DSBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008224.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Further investigations are needed to clarify this possibility. Altogether, this study suggests that the translocation of Rad51, Rad52, and likely other repair factors to telomeres contributes to the Mec1-dependent hypersensitivity to DSBs in telomerase deficient cells.</p><p>Studies of the role of telomerase in the maintenance of genome integrity in mammalian cells have provided insight into the molecular aspects in aging and cancer, and in particular, epithelial carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008224-DePinho1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.

The work presented here suggests another mechanism by which aged organisms may suffer from increased rates of unrepaired DNA damage and its concomitant risk of cancer.
