Autophagy has recently been implicated in protection against cancer, neurodegeneration, and infection, and interest is increasing in additional roles of autophagy in human health, disease, and aging. To search for novel cytoprotective features of this pathway, we carried out a genetic mosaic screen for mutations causing increased lysosomal and/or autophagic activity in the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larval fat body. By combining <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics with live-cell imaging of the fluorescent dye LysoTracker Red and fixed-cell imaging of autophagy-specific fluorescent protein markers, the screen was designed to identify essential metazoan genes whose disruption causes increased flux through the autophagy-lysosome pathway. The screen identified a large number of genes associated with the protein synthesis and ER-secretory pathways (<italic>e.g.</italic> aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, <italic>Oligosaccharyl transferase</italic>, <italic>Sec61&#x003b1;</italic>), and with mitochondrial function and dynamics (<italic>e.g. Rieske iron-sulfur protein, Dynamin-related protein 1</italic>). We also observed that increased lysosomal and autophagic activity were consistently associated with decreased cell size. Our work demonstrates that disruption of the synthesis, transport, folding, or glycosylation of ER-targeted proteins at any of multiple steps leads to autophagy induction. In addition to illuminating cytoprotective features of autophagy in response to cellular damage, this screen establishes a genetic methodology for investigating cell biological phenotypes in live cells, in the context of viable wild type organisms.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The proteasome and the lysosome are the two major routes for cellular digestion of macromolecules. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is highly regulated, specific, and energy-intensive, and biophysical constraints limit the proteasome to degradation of individual proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Ravid1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). In contrast, the lysosome, an acidic membrane-bound organelle containing a broad spectrum of acid hydrolases, degrades substrates non-specifically, and direct regulation of individual steps is minimal. The large size of lysosomes allows degradation not only of individual proteins, but of large complexes, lipids, and whole organelles, and enables recycling of the resulting raw materials (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Xie1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>). Defects in lysosomal function cause upwards of 40 lysosomal storage disorders that result in a buildup of undigested material and a wide spectrum of often organ- or cell type-specific secondary effects including neuronal damage or degeneration, and mild to severe developmental impairment (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Vellodi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>). Bulk cargo for degradation is delivered to the lysosome by macroautophagy, a cellular recycling process conserved from yeast to man (hereafter referred to simply as autophagy). Autophagy enables cellular survival in nutrient-poor environments, removal of old or damaged organelles and macromolecules, and is implicated as a protective factor in a wide variety of human disease, from cancer to neurodegeneration to pathogen defense (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Mizushima1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>Initially characterized genetically and biochemically in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Tsukada1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, autophagy is a multi-step process. The &#x0201c;core&#x0201d; machinery of autophagy involves nearly 20 proteins, and much progress has been made in understanding such unique features as ubiquitin-like conjugation reactions involving both proteins and lipids, and the formation and enlargement of the unusual double membrane enclosure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Xie1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Fusion of the autophagosome to the lysosome releases the cargo-containing inner membrane into the lysosome for degradation by the more than 50 resident acid hydrolases. After degradation, effluxors mediate the release of nutrients to the cytoplasm for reuse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Yang1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, a key step in autophagy's primal function as a response to nutrient deprivation.</p><p>A high degree of homology between yeast and metazoans has enabled the study of the autophagy-lysosome pathway in multicellular animals. In both yeast and metazoans, target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling suppresses autophagy in nutrient-replete environments as part of its growth-promoting function, and permits autophagy when cells are starved. In higher organisms, TOR not only responds to nutrients but is also a major effector of growth factor signaling through the PI3K pathway, thus tying autophagy to the regulation of cell growth and cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Scott1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and to the coordination of organismal growth and feeding behavior (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Arsham1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>Autophagy is also regulated by developmental signals. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, autophagy is induced during the late larval stages by the steroid hormone ecdysone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Rusten1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, allowing the animal to break down and recycle larval material in the course of metamorphosis. While autophagy is not strictly required for embryonic development in flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Juhasz1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> or mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Komatsu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Kuma1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, it appears to be necessary for embryonic implantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Tsukamoto1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and perinatal survival in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Kuma1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Loss of autophagy also impairs T- and B-cell development, proliferation, and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Miller1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Pua1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Autophagy declines with age, and this decline has long been thought to play a role in aging-related cellular damage and senescence; in support of a role for autophagy in aging, it has recently been shown to be required (though not sufficient) for dietary restriction-induced lifespan extension in worms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Hansen1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Jia1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Autophagy thus functions not only in cell autonomous responses to nutrient depletion as in yeast, but in regulatory and disease processes unique to multicellular organisms.</p><p>Because the bulk of our current genetic and biochemical knowledge of autophagy comes from seminal early genetic screens in yeast, it is not clear to what degree newer functions of autophagy rely on metazoan-specific signaling pathways. We therefore designed a genetic screen to search for novel cytoprotective features of the autophagy-lysosome pathway by looking for mutations that activate the pathway as a signaling or defense response. Using existing genetic tools in <italic>Drosophila</italic> we screened mitotic mosaic clones homozygous for lethal P-element insertions that caused enlargement of the lysosomal compartment as measured by LysoTracker Red, a fluorescent dye. Experiments were performed using collections of FRT-linked recombinogenic P-element insertions on <italic>Drosophila</italic> chromosome 2 L, and were carried out in the larval fat body, the primary nutrient storage organ of the developing larva, and one in which background lysosomal and autophagic activity are extremely low.</p><p>The screen revealed a large number of gene disruptions which amplify LysoTracker activity (which we termed LT&#x0002b;), typically in concert with decreased cell and nuclear size, and which were enriched for genes involved in protein synthesis, folding, transport, and degradation, and those involved in mitochondrial function and morphology. The former group included tRNA charging, translocation into the ER, glycosylation, and the unfolded protein response (UPR), while the latter included electron transport and mitochondrial fusion and fission. Because of the large size and monolayer tissue architecture of fat body cells and the sophisticated recombination and gene expression tools generated by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> community, the mosaic approach in fat body allows for the visualization of cell biological phenotypes in live cells in the context of a fully developed wild type animal organ and provides a useful set of tools for investigating a wide range of cellular phenotypes including cell size and shape, intracellular trafficking, and organellar dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A Genetic Screen Reveals a Large Number Of Mutants With Elevated and Punctate LysoTracker Staining</title><p>To increase the odds of identifying novel regulators of lysosomal trafficking and autophagy, we designed a screen to identify mutations that activate or derepress, as opposed to block, lysosomal accumulation. We thus expected the screen to identify genes whose activity normally suppresses lysosomal accumulation or autophagy, or genes whose mutations cause cellular stress or damage that would induce these pathways as a defense response. We investigated essential genes using publicly available collections of lethal P-element insertions linked to centromere-proximal FRT recombination sites generated by the Szeged Stock Center and the BruinFly project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Chen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. We focused our analysis on 383 recessive-lethal P-element insertions on chromosome 2 L (&#x0223c;20&#x00025; of the genome), representing a substantial fraction of the predicted essential loci on this chromosome arm.</p><p>The FLP-FRT recombination system was used to generate homozygous mutant mitotic clones for each of the 383 P insertions. Mutant clones were identifiable by their lack of GFP expression and proximity to homozygous twin-spots which had 2 copies of the GFP gene, in otherwise normal heterozygous animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006068-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The genetic dosage of GFP was easily distinguishable under an epifluorescent microscope. Mosaic fat bodies from well-fed early third instar F1 larvae were dissected and immediately stained with LysoTracker Red, a fluorescent dye which is taken up by negatively charged membrane-bound cellular compartments including autolysosomes and lysosomes. This enabled simple and rapid assessment of the level of lysosomal activity in mutant cells vs. wild type cells in a single microscopic field. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006068-g001">Figure 1</xref>, the very low baseline level of LysoTracker staining in the fat bodies of well-fed wild type animals allowed easy identification of cells with elevated LysoTracker staining (denoted LT&#x0002b;) versus normal (LT&#x02212;).</p><fig id="pone-0006068-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006068.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>System of mitotic recombination for screening increased lysosomal activity in mosaic mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body.</title><p>Adult virgin females of the GFP indicator strain (<italic>y w hsflp</italic>; <italic>UAS-2xeGFP FRT40A Fb-Gal4</italic>, hereafter referred to as FRT40AGFP) were crossed to males carrying P-element-induced mutations distal to FRT40A on chromosome 2 L (A). 6&#x02013;8 hr embryo collections were immediately heat shocked at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 hour to activate the Flp recombinase. Flp-catalyzed mitotic recombination and subsequent chromosomal segregation early in embryogenesis leads to three cellular genotypes, distinguishable in the larval fat body by their GFP dosage: mutant (&#x02212;/&#x02212;, 0 GFP); heterozygote (&#x0002b;/&#x02212;, 1 GFP); and wild type (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;, 2 GFP).

This enrichment compared to the EMS set is not unexpected, given that the P-elements were pre-selected to have recessive lethal phenotypes, but suggests that even when using EMS, there are a large number of mutable genes affecting lysosomal trafficking pathways. Nearly all LT&#x0002b; mutants also had reduced cell size of varying severity, but the converse was not true&#x02014;some mutations led to small cells with no elevation in LysoTracker staining (7&#x00025; and 3&#x00025; of the Szeged and BruinFly collections; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006068-t001">Table 1</xref>). In no case did we observe dominant or non-autonomous induction of LysoTracker staining in heterozygous cells. We also identified a number of cell lethal mutants that generated wild type twin spots but no apparent corresponding mutant clone, implying that recombination had occurred but that the mutant cells did not survive. The difference in LT&#x0002b; mutants between the two sets of P-elements is balanced by a higher rate of LT&#x02212; small cell phenotypes as well as apparent cell lethals in the Szeged vs. the BruinFly set.

Of particular interest were enrichments within the LT&#x0002b; group in the cellular components ER and mitochondria (1.99 and 2.17 fold enrichment, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006068-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>); the molecular functions electron carrier activity, actin binding, and peptidase activity (1.59, 1.99, and 9.95 fold, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006068-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>); and the biological processes translation, catabolic process, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, and amino acid and derivative metabolic process (2.49, 2.65, 3.18, and 3.98 fold, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006068-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Because of the small sample size for many of these categories and statistical correction for the large number of comparisons, the increased association of mutations in specific functional categories with LysoTracker activation, while suggestive, is not statistically significant and should be interpreted with caution.

In part, this reflects the selection of P-elements that disrupt essential genes, increasing the probability of impinging on critical pathways. The number of LT&#x0002b; mutants also attests to the importance of the autophagy-lysosome pathway as a response to cellular damage or malfunction, since many of the LT&#x0002b; mutations are in essential metabolic, biosynthetic, or quality control pathways. While many of the mutations likely cause significant cell stress or damage, the fact that the cells are still alive three or more days into development suggests that there may also be regulatory functions involved. It should also be noted that for some genes with two or more proximal lethal P-elements, only one was found to cause a LT&#x0002b; phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006068.s001">Table S1</xref>).

An excess of uncharged tRNAs resulting from decreased tRNA synthetase activity could induce autophagy by mimicking a nutrient-poor state, or by causing decreased fidelity of protein synthesis. However, the fact that tRNA disruption did not lead to GFP-Atg8a punctae argues against autophagy as the mechanism of action.

It is interesting to note that, while many of the known disease-specific mutations in human and mouse are limited to individual tRNA synthetases, the phenotype in our study appears to be more general. This could be because the sensitivity of our screen might identify mutations that would be subclinical, or that certain cell types are particularly sensitive to the loss of particular amino acids, such as those that act as neurotransmitters.

These mutants caused increased LysoTracker staining in the absence of discernable autophagosomes, suggesting they may lead to increased lysosomal activity through an autophagy-independent mechanism. Alternatively, they may cause an early or transient increase in autophagy which is not visible under our experimental conditions but persists in the form of increased lysosomal volume. This is supported by the fact that several of the mitochondrial mutants show reduced GFP-Atg8a levels, consistent with increased autophagic turnover of this fusion protein. It is also possible that the GFP-Atg8a and LysoTracker phenotypes are being caused by a block in the later steps of degradation, resulting in a pileup of autophagic intermediates which are formed and acidified, but fail to be destroyed.

Table lists all P-element insertion stocks and RNAi insertion stocks tested, from a total of four stock centers. Phenotype designations are as follows: for RNAi expression experiments LysoTracker positive phenotypes were listed simply as LT&#x0002b;. For FRT40A mitotic clones, LT&#x0002b; phenotypes were classified as LT1 (intense punctate staining); LT2 (mild to moderate, with some punctae); LT3 (mild or intermittent phenotype, including diffuse as opposed to punctate staining); S (small cell size without LysoTracker phenotype); and L (apparent cell lethal). Type (mitotic or RNAi) and source of constructs are listed, and can be sorted by any field. Gene disruption assignments for P-element insertions were downloaded from previously published descriptions and initial characterizations of the P-element collections: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/163/1/195/DC1">http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/163/1/195/DC1</ext-link><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006068-Oh1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bruinfly.ucla.edu/subsets.php?id=3">http://www.bruinfly.ucla.edu/subsets.php?id=3</ext-link>. Where two genes were potentially disrupted, both are listed. Additional information was obtained by personal communication from the curators of the BruinFly project and from FlyBase release 5.15. For BruinFly stocks, the primary ID listed is the Kyoto Stock Center ID; BruinFly ID is listed separately.
