We investigated the association of TGF-&#x003b2;1 with the anti-proliferative effect of upstream stimulatory factor (USF) in Fischer rat thyroid cell line (FRTL-5) cells. [Methyl-<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine uptake was measured after treatment of FRTL-5 cells with TGF-&#x003b2;1 to identify its anti-proliferative effect. USF-1 and USF-2 proteins were in vitro translated, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed to identify the interaction between USF and the TGF-&#x003b2;1 promoter. FRTL-5 cells were transfected with USF cDNA, and then the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1 was examined with Northern and Western blotting. The cell cycle-regulating proteins associated with TGF-&#x003b2;1 were also measured. TGF-&#x003b2;1 significantly inhibited [methyl-<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine uptake in FRTL-5 cells. Two specific binding sites for USF were found in the TGF-&#x003b2;1 promoter: -1,846~-1,841 (CACATG) and -621~-616 (CATGTG).

It was originally identified as a cellular transcription factor, which is important for expression of the adenovirus major late promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Two different genes, defined as USF-1 and USF-2, have been isolated from HeLa cells, and these genes encode 43 and 44 kDa polypeptides, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). These two peptides have identical DNA-binding specificities and transcriptional activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). USF-1 and USF-2 polypeptides are highly divergent in their N-terminal sequences, but they share a highly conserved C-terminal basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (B-HLH-LZ) sequence that is important for the dimerization and DNA-binding of USF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Proteins of the B-HLH-LZ gene family bind to the DNA sequences of the general type CANNTG, which is referred to as the E-box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). USF has been reported to inhibit cellular growth and proliferation in some cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). We have recently observed that USF also inhibits the cellular proliferation of rat thyroid cells, Fischer rat thyroid cell line (FRTL-5) cells, and papillary thyroid carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1 (TGF-&#x003b2;1) is a potent, naturally occurring inhibitor of cellular growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The role of TGF-&#x003b2; in tumorigenesis can be suppressive or promoting depending on the developmental stage of a tumor and its cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). During an early phase of tumorigenesis, TGF-&#x003b2; inhibits tumor development and growth by inducing the arrest of the cell cycle and possibly apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). TGF-&#x003b2;1 is known to bind to FRTL-5 cells and inhibit their cellular growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>Because both TGF-&#x003b2;1 and USF suppress FRTL-5 cell proliferation, and because USF increases the activity of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in some cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), we investigated the effect of USF on the expression and function of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in order to clarify the mechanism of the anti-proliferative effect of USF in FRTL-5 cells. First of all, we assessed whether USF binds to the TGF-&#x003b2;1 promoter.

Among them, the affinities for binding to T2 and T3 were much stronger. Cold competitors eliminated the DNA-protein complexes, and a specific anti-USF-1 or anti-USF-2 antibody shifted these complexes to an upper position to make 'super-shifts' (as indicated by the white arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).

We have recently observed that both USF-1 and USF-2 play a role in suppressing the cellular proliferation of normal thyrocytes and thyroid papillary carcinoma cells, while they maintained the TSH-stimulated production of cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, the exact mechanism of the anti-proliferative effect of USF overexpression was not identified. TGF-&#x003b2;1 is a potent, naturally occurring inhibitor of cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), it has a high affinity for FRTL-5 cells, and it inhibits their cellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>); therefore, this study examined the role of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in FRTL-5 cells overexpressing USF.</p><p>Inhibition of cellular growth by TGF-&#x003b2;1 has been observed in normal feline thyroid cells, human thyroid cells, and the human papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). First of all, we confirmed that TGF-&#x003b2;1 significantly decreased the uptake of [methyl-<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine in FRTL-5 cells. Therefore, we conducted a study on the relationship between USF and TGF-&#x003b2;1. There have been a few reports on this relationship thus far: USF-1 and USF-2 are known to bind to the TGF-&#x003b2;1 promoter and increase its activity in mesangial cells, glioblastoma, embryonal carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and choriocarcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, the effect of USF on the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in thyrocytes has not yet been reported. USF binds to DNA as a homodimer or heterodimer at a specific site that is characterized by an E-box (5'-CANNTG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that USF-1 and USF-2 proteins strongly bound to the specific sequences (CACATG in -1,846 to -1,841 and CATGTG in -621 to -616) of the TGF-&#x003b2;1 promoter, and the overexpression of USF increased the mRNA and protein levels of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in FRTL-5 cells. Other E-boxes such as E1 and E4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> were very week in their affinity to USF, which suggests that there are other factors than nucleotide sequences determining the binding of USF at E-box. It is apparent in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref> because even E-boxes having the same sequences in the TGF-&#x003b2;1 promoter showed different affinity to USF. Taking into consideration the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1, these findings suggested that USF might inhibit cell proliferation through the induction of TGF-&#x003b2;1 after binding to its promoter.</p><p>As commented on earlier, TGF-&#x003b2; regulates cellular growth and proliferation in a cell-specific manner. In most epithelial cells, TGF-&#x003b2; is a potent inhibitor of cellular growth and proliferation; it arrests the cell cycle in the G1 phase by modulating the cell cycle regulators, especially the CDK inhibitors, CDK4, CDK2, cyclin D, and cyclin E, and by eventually dephosphorylating Rb protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). TGF-&#x003b2; induces the expression of CDK inhibitors such as p15, p21, and p27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). They, in turn, downregulate CDK4 and G1/S phosphatase CDC25A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), and they decrease the expression of c-Myc, which again down-regulates p15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Inactivation of the CDK-cyclin complexes contributes to dephosphorylation of Rb protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Rb protein is a primary target of the action of TGF-&#x003b2;1, and as Rb dephosphorylation induces G1 phase arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), the main anti-proliferative mechanism of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on the thyroid cells has been reported as G1 phase arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, we were not able to observe G1 arrest in the USF-overexpressing FRTL-5 cells, although the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1 was increased. We did not evaluate the mechanism for it, but overexpression of USF might influence the activity of G1 phase-related cyclin modulators and the phosphorylation status of Rb protein. Instead, we observed G2/M phase arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The G2/M phase arrest was accompanied by the modification of the expression of the G2/M-related regulators such as cyclin B1 and CDK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The effect of TGF-&#x003b2;1 on the progression of the G2/M phase is not yet clear. We observed the increase of p27 which could contribute to the G2/M phase arrest. Hashimoto et al. recently reported that TGF-&#x003b2;1 induced the cell cycle arrest not at G1 phase but at G2 phase in some hepatoma cells, which was thought to be through the stabilization of Wee1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Although we did not examine the activity of Wee1, the overexpression of USF might affect Wee1 activity and induce G2/M arrest. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the role of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in the USF-regulated anti-proliferative effects on FRTL-5 cells is very limited, regardless of the binding activities of USFs to TGF-&#x003b2;1 promoter.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that TGF-&#x003b2;1 decreased the proliferation of FRTL-5 cells. We also observed that overexpression of USF-1 and USF-2 increased the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in FRTL-5 cells after specifically binding to the TGF-&#x003b2;1 promoter. However, dephosphorylation of Rb was not induced, and this was concordant with the finding that cell cycle arrest was observed at the G2/M phase, and was not seen at the G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The mechanism related to the reason that USF-induced TGF-&#x003b2;1 expression did not cause dephoshorylation of Rb protein will be evaluated and reported on in the future.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work was supported by the <funding-source>Samsung Biomedical Research Institute grant</funding-source>, #SBRI <award-id>C-A3-226-3, C-A5-332-1</award-id>, and <award-id>C-A6-426-1~2</award-id>.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sawadogo</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Roeder</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Interaction of a gene-specific transcription factor with the adenovirus major late promoter upstream of the TATA box region</article-title><source>Cell</source><year>1985</year><volume>43</volume><fpage>165</fpage><lpage>175</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">4075392</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Carthew</surname><given-names>RW</given-names></name><name><surname>Chodosh</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharp</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An RNA polymerase II transcription factor binds to an upstream element in the adenovirus major late promoter</article-title><source>Cell</source><year>1985</year><volume>43</volume><fpage>439</fpage><lpage>448</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">4075400</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sawadogo</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Dyke</surname><given-names>MW</given-names></name><name><surname>Gregor</surname><given-names>PD</given-names></name><name><surname>Roeder</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Multiple forms of the human gene-specific transcription factor USF.

Cold competitors eliminated the DNA-protein complexes, and a specific anti-USF-1 or anti-USF-2 antibody shifted these complexes to an upper position to cause 'super-shifts' (white arrows).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jkms-23-870-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) of the complexes between USF and the E2/E3 of the different loci in the TGF-&#x003b2;1 promoter. There were two loci of CA<underline>CA</underline>TG (E2) and CA<underline>TG</underline>TG (E3), respectively: -1,846~-1,841 (E2) and -3,514~-3,509 (E2'), and -621~-616 (E3) and -1,563~-1,558 (E3'). Specific sites for USF binding were identified by performing EMSA with four probes (T2, T2', T3, and T3') that contained each E-box. The specific sites were revealed as -1,846~-1,841 and -621~-616. Black arrows indicate the DNA-protein complexes, and the white arrows indicate their super-shifts according to the specific antibodies.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jkms-23-870-g003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Effects of USF-1 and USF-2 overexpression on the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in the FRTL-5 cells. Total RNA and protein were isolated from FRTL-5 cells that were transiently overexpressed with USF. Northern (left panel) and Western blotting (right panel) were performed to evaluate the mRNA and protein levels of USF and TGF-&#x003b2;1. Expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1 was induced by the overexpression of USF-1 and USF-2. Three sets of experiments were repeated. GAPDH was used as the internal control for Northern blotting, and tubulin was used as the internal control for Western blotting.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jkms-23-870-g004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Effects of USF-1 and USF-2 overexpression on the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1-related proteins in FRTL-5 cells. Total protein was isolated from FRTL-5 cells that transiently overexpressed USF, and Western blotting was then performed. The p27 levels were increased by USF overexpression, but the cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E, and CDK2 levels were not changed. Accordingly, dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein was not observed. Three sets of experiments were performed, and tubulin was used as the internal control.</p><p>ppRb, hyperphosphorylated Rb; pRb, hypophosphorylated Rb.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jkms-23-870-g005"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Primer sequences of USF-1, USF-2, TGF-&#x003b2;1, and GAPDH</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jkms-23-870-i001"/><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>*</sup>, Primer sequence of mouse.</p><p>USF, upsteam stimulatory factor; TGF-&#x003b2;1, transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>E-boxes in the rat TGF-&#x003b2;1 promoter and the oligomer sequences containing each E-box</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jkms-23-870-i002"/><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>*</sup>, E-boxes in each oligomer sequences are in bold print and the discriminating sequences are underlined.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2;1, transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
