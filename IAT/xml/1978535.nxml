In a co-expression system, KCNE1 was more readily co-precipitated with co-expressed HERG than was KCNE2.&#x000a0;When forward protein trafficking was prevented (either by Brefeldin A or engineering an ER-retention/retrieval signal onto KCNE cDNA) the intracellular abundance of KCNE2 and its association with HERG markedly increased relative to KCNE1.&#x000a0;HERG co-localized more completely with KCNE1 than with KCNE2 in all the membrane-processing compartments of the cell (ER, Golgi and plasma membrane). By surface labeling and confocal immunofluorescence, KCNE2 appeared more abundant at the cell surface compared to KCNE1, which exhibited greater co-localization with the ER-marker calnexin. Examination of the extracellular culture media showed that a significant amount of KCNE2 was extracellular (both soluble and membrane-vesicle-associated). Taken together, these results suggest that during biogenesis of channels HERG is more likely to assemble with KCNE1 than KCNE2 due to distinctly different trafficking rates and retention in the cell rather than differences in relative affinity. The final channel subunit constitution, <italic>in vivo</italic>, is likely to be determined by a combination of relative cell-to-cell expression rates and differential protein processing and trafficking.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The five members of the KCNE gene family encode small membrane peptides that associate with voltage-gated ion channel proteins to regulate their behavior.

We quantified the amount of KCNE protein that associated with HERG by taking the densitometry value of precipitated KCNE proteins divided by total KCNE protein expressed in the cell lysates normalized to tubulin. This measure of relative binding of KCNEs to HERG (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000933-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) showed that KCNE1 more readily associated with HERG than KCNE2. Addition of ER-retention/retrieval signal to the KCNEs resulted in greater association of the proteins with HERG. The overall degree of association of HERG with KCNE1-ER and KCNE2-ER was comparable however, the increase over wild type was greater for KCNE2 than for KCNE1. Given that the ER-retention signal increases the duration of KCNE2 in the ER these results are in agreement with results that previously showed KCNE1 association with KCNQ1 primarily occurring in the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Krumerman1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the markedly increased binding of HERG with KCNE2 upon ER retention suggests that differences between KCNE1 and KCNE2 integration into the channel may be more a function of opportunity for interaction than different affinities. KCNE1-L51H displayed similar degree of binding affinity to HERG as KCNE2 wild type, but much lower than seen with KCNE1 wild type or the ER-retention/retrieval mutants.

BFA treatment resulted in several changes in KCNE and HERG proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000933-g004">Figure 4</xref>). One of the most obvious was the altered gel mobility of the proteins, likely due to altered glycosylation. The usual 150 kDa and 135 kDa HERG species (representing mature glycosylated and immature core glycosylated forms, respectively) were replaced by a single band that was intermediate in gel mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000933-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

Accordingly, we examined culture media from cells expressing KCNE subunits for appearance of KCNE proteins. To assay for both membrane-bound and free KCNE proteins we performed ultracentrifugation and immunoprecipitation from the culture media after it was gently centrifuged to clear the media of dead cells and debris. Immuno-reactivity of both KCNE1 and KCNE2 was detected in the media although KCNE2 appeared much more abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000933-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The post-ultracentrifugation pellet contained a portion of the KCNE proteins that primarily consisted of the higher glycosylation forms compared to those seen in the cell lysates. The KCNE2 protein that was immunoprecipitated from the post-centrifugation supernatant consisted of a smaller 20 kDa species (at the same gel migration as the lowest glycosylation from cell lysates) and a 40 kDa species (not represented in the cell lysates). When samples immunoprecipitated from the media were boiled in loading buffer prior to electrophoresis, the 40 kDa band collapsed into the 20 kDa species suggesting the existence of a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000933-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

In this study we have focused on the physical protein-protein association and trafficking of KCNE1 and KCNE2 with HERG. Our results show that in the HEK heterologous expression system KCNE1 associates with HERG more robustly than KCNE2. This difference is abolished if forward trafficking of KCNE2 is slowed or blocked by molecular or chemical methods. Prevention of forward trafficking predictably altered the subcellular distribution of KCNE2 from its prominent peripheral localization towards the intracellular compartments where it acquired considerable overlap with HERG. Manipulation of forward trafficking also caused a distinct increase in cellular accumulation of KCNE2; an effect that was not seen with KCNE1 or HERG. A considerable fraction of KCNE2 also appears exported from the cell as both membrane bound and free forms. Taken together these results suggest that KCNE2 is more rapidly processed and trafficked to the cell surface than either KCNE1 or HERG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000933-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).

KCNQ1 and KCNE1 trafficking mutants in mammalian cell systems have provided evidence that assembly occurs early in the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Krumerman1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, a finding subsequently confirmed by another group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Chandrasekhar1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Precedence for early ER assembly of other K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel subunits exists. The ER was shown as site of voltage-dependent Shaker-type K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel synthesis, tetramer assembly and processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Nagaya1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Kosolapov1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. The incorporation of KCNE1 into KCNQ1 channels with a possible stoichiometry of 2:4 KCNE1&#x02236;KCNQ1 has been suggested as a sequential process of dimerization of dimers which is also likely to occur within the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Chen2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Tu1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. The actual site(s) of final subunit assembly however may also include early Golgi compartments since the ER-retention/retrieval mutants of KCNE1 and KCNE2 probably enter the Golgi and are repeatedly retrieved into the ER. That KCNE1-L51H showed decreased binding to HERG supports this since its behavior suggests that it never advances into any Golgi compartment but is likely shunted to the quality control mechanisms for early (possibly co-translational) degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Oyadomari1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. An alternative interpretation however, is that mis-folding of KCNE1-L51H may reduce its affinity for HERG channel proteins.</p><p>The abundance of KCNE2 on the cell surface compared to intracellular compartments was much greater than that of either KCNE1 or HERG. This suggests that its forward trafficking rate differs from the other two proteins. That it appeared on the surface at a location even more peripheral than co-expressed HERG and that a fraction appeared exported from the cell leads us to consider alternative routes of traffic and secretion. We analyzed KCNE1 and KCNE2 for possible secretory signal sequences, non-classical secretory protein prediction, (SignalP, SecretomeP, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services</ext-link>) which showed that the N-termini of KCNE1 and KCNE2 had a moderate probability of representing secretion signal sequences but no likely signal peptide cleavage sites. Another established method for export of integral membrane proteins is via exosomes, small membrane vesicles that are transported to the cell exterior via multi-vesicular endosome (MVE) pathways. MVEs, in some cases, traffic directly to the cell surface from the ER, bypassing Golgi compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Johnstone1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Exosomes originate from endosomes as intraluminal vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-vanNiel2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, and can carry various and unique subsets of membrane and cellular proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Fevrier1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Exosome secretion participates in the eradication of obsolete proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-vanNiel2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> but recent findings indicate that exosomes constitute a potential mode of intercellular communication, as in the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Li1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Release of exosomes by tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Pilzer1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref> and their implication in the propagation of pathogens such as retroviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Kramer1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> and prions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-PortoCarreiro1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref> suggests their participation in pathological situations. Recent studies show that human kidney tubules secrete exosomes containing aquaporin-2 water channels, epithelial sodium channels and other apical plasma-membrane transporters into the urine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Pisitkun1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study, the ultracentrifugation fractions (the established method to collect exosomes) contained glycosylated KCNE2 proteins comparable to those from total cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000933-g005">Figure 5</xref>), supporting exosome-mediated transport of a portion of KCNE2 proteins to the extracellular environment. Since both of KCNE1 and KCNE2 were detected from exosome fractions, exosomes may not be the KCNE2-specific mechanism involved in preferential export. The abundance of KCNE2 in exosome fractions however, was greater than KCNE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000933-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>By what mechanism do KCNE1 and KCNE2 move differently through the cell? There are several possibilities. Amino acid sequence-specific sorting signals have been described within the transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic domains of the membrane proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Pelham1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. An alternative mechanism that does not employ specific signal sequences involves the chain length and hydrophobicity of transmembrane segments of membrane proteins. This hypothesis stems from the observations that membrane proteins exiting the Golgi destined for the cell surface have longer transmembrane domains than those staying resident in ER and <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Bretscher1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Munro1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. In these studies transmembrane domains of plasma membrane proteins analyzed had a generally greater length (on average 21 residues) whereas the Golgi enzymes have consistently shorter membrane-spanning regions of approximately 17 residues, and are frequently enriched in residues with large side chains such as phenylalanine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Bretscher1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Munro1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Transmembrane domain length also determines membrane targeting of syntaxin 3, 4 and 5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Watson1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi/ER localization of syntaxin 5 was determined by a transmembrane segment length of 17 amino acids, whereas the surface membrane locale of syntaxins 3 and 4 were dictated by segments of 23&#x02013;25 residues in length. Differences in the lipid composition and bilayer thickness of ER, Golgi and plasma membranes underlie the proposed mechanism by which transmembrane segment length determines efficiency of forward trafficking. ER and <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi membranes are rich in phosphoglycerides and have low amounts of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids with an estimated thickness of &#x0223c;37&#x000c5;. The plasma membrane is more abundant in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids and has a higher degree of fatty acid chain saturation with an estimated membrane thickness of &#x0223c;43&#x000c5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Mitra1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Specialized areas of the plasma membrane that are highly enriched in these constituents are lipid rafts. There is a gradient of transition of these membrane components from ER through the Golgi. The efficiency of transition through the secretory pathway of membrane proteins may be determined by the more energetically favorable milieu: fewer hydrophobic residues of long transmembrane segments will be exposed to aqueous environment in thicker lipid bilayers. KCNE1 and KCNE2 do not have obvious retention signals within their transmembrane domains or C-termini by database searches to date. Prediction of transmembrane helices of KCNE1 and KCNE2 from amino acid sequence by analysis programs suggests that the transmembrane domain of KCNE2 may be 3-4 residues longer than that of KCNE1 (25 for KCNE2 and 21 for KCNE1, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000933-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000933-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Although at 21 residues the transmembrane helix of KCNE1 should allow for transit to the surface, it may move through the Golgi less efficiently than KCNE2, thereby explaining our findings. Clearly, further investigation is warranted to determine if differential trafficking of KCNE1 and KCNE2 are controlled by signal sequences versus sequence-independent transmembrane length.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0000933-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0000933.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Secondary structure analyses of KCNE protein sequence to predict transmembrane helices.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0000933-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0000933.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0000933-t001-1"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">Location of TM within the proteins</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GRAVY<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt106">5</xref> coefficient</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Estimated TMS (in AA)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Predict Protein<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">1</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MENSAT<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt103">2</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WaveTM<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt104">3</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SAPS<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt105">4</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>KCNE1</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><sup>46</sup>Y-<sup>64</sup>S</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><sup>45</sup>A-<sup>66</sup>I</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><sup>44</sup>A-<sup>63</sup>L</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><sup>44</sup>A-<sup>66</sup>I</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.973&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;TM</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>KCNE2</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><sup>46</sup>F-<sup>70</sup>S</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><sup>46</sup>F-<sup>69</sup>V</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><sup>46</sup>F-<sup>69</sup>V</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><sup>46</sup>F-<sup>72</sup>V</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.288&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;TM</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>For the first 4 methods, amino acid positions are given, For the Grand AVerage of hydropathicity (GRAVY) the calculated coefficients are given: a more positive value represents greater hydrophobicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000933-Kyte1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></fn><fn id="nt102"><label>1</label><p>PredictProtein at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein">http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="nt103"><label>2</label><p>MENSAT at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://saier-144-37.ucsd.edu/memsat.html">http://saier-144-37.ucsd.edu/memsat.html</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="nt104"><label>3</label><p>WaveTM at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://athina.biol.uoa.gr/bioinformatics/waveTM/">http://athina.biol.uoa.gr/bioinformatics/waveTM/</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="nt105"><label>4</label><p>Statistical analysis of protein sequences at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/saps/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/saps/</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="nt106"><label>5</label><p>GRAVY coefficients of the transmembrane domains of KCNE1 and KCNE2 were calculated using ProtParam at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ca.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html">http://ca.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html</ext-link>.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Remarkably, a consistent finding was the presence of a fraction of immature KCNE2 (and to a lesser extent, KCNE1) as well as a slower migrating isoform of KCNE2 predicted to be double the mass from culture media supernatant after ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000933-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). That the higher mass KCNE2 protein collapsed into the lower size with sample heating suggests that it represented a dimer of the 20kDa form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000933-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Moreover, PNGaseF treatment argues against the higher form representing a higher glycosylated species. Whether these proteins represent truly soluble forms of KCNE2, an integral membrane-spanning protein, is unclear at this point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000933-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). There is only a single membrane-spanning region in KCNEs. Therefore, it is conceivable that if two KCNE2 subunits were to dimerize by interaction between hydrophobic membrane-spanning regions that the overall aqueous solubility of the oligomer could increase, leading to direct exit from the plasma membrane into the eternal milieu. It is possible that the higher molecular weight species that shifts with boiling represents binding to another protein of equal mass however, this seems less likely given that no other prominent peptide appeared on mass spectrometry analysis.</p><p>To summarize, our study shows that despite structural similarity of the KCNE1 and KCNE2 family members that they associate differentially with HERG due primarily to different trafficking rates and characteristics rather than different affinities for the channel. Thus, the constituents of channel complexes in native organs may not simply be a matter of co-expression within a given cell or relative subunit affinity. Protein processing and trafficking may play an important and regulated role in controlling channel characteristics. Questions that these results raise include: do these mechanisms apply to other KCNE-K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channel interactions; are they functional <italic>in vivo</italic>; and are they differentially operational in different tissues?</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000933.s001"><label>Animation S1</label><caption><p>KCNE1-calnexin 3D animation</p><p>(9.66 MB AVI)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000933.s001.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0000933.s002"><label>Animation S2</label><caption><p>KCNE2 3D animation</p><p>(4.85 MB AVI)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0000933.s002.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Drs.
