In contrast to the previous studies, we observed very little difference in the expression of E-cadherin or &#x003b2;-catenin in LMP1 or EGFP-positive cells. Both HaCaT and MDCK cells showed minimal effect of LMP1 on the expression of E-cadherin, &#x003b2;-catenin. Interestingly, LMP1 sequences from both normal B cells or from NPC showed no effect on the expression of E-cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin.

Consistent with data presented in panel A, we observed no evidence of &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity in LMP1-expressing cells.</p><p>These experiments were undertaken to reassess the role of LMP1 in modulating the canonical Wnt pathway. We have used human epithelial and keratinocyte cell lines to express different sequence variants of LMP1 and studied its effect on the regulation of E-cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin interaction/function. The effect of LMP1 expression was assessed using both a transient and stable expression system. Confocal microscopic studies showed none of the LMP1 sequences (derived form either normal B cells or NPC) had any dramatic effect on the expression of E-Cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin. Furthermore, we also found no effect of LMP1 on the interaction of E-Cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin and the downstream &#x003b2;-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity. Based on this extensive and in depth analysis, we propose that it is unlikely that LMP1 plays any significant role in the modulation of the Wnt pathway. It is very difficult to precisely identify the reason for difference in the results described here and those described previously by other groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003254-Tsai1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003254-Tan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. One possible reason might be that different cell lines respond differentially to LMP1 signalling. For example our studies were primarily based on human epithelial cell line HaCaT, while other groups have used canine epithelial cell line (MDCK). Furthermore, it is also possible that minor differences within the LMP1 sequences used by different groups may differentially impact on the expression of E-Cadherin and other mediators of Wnt pathway.</p><p>It is important to stress here that our studies do not refute a potential role of EBV in activating &#x003b2;-catenin and its transcriptional activity. It is possible that another EBV protein(s) play a crucial role in regulating &#x003b2;-catenin activity in virus-infected normal and malignant cells. Indeed, recent studies by Morrison and colleagues have shown that EBV-encoded Latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) activates &#x003b2;-catenin in epithelial cells through the PI3/AKt pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003254-Morrison2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003254-Morrison3">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

After incubation, these cells were washed in PBS plus Calcium and Magnesium (PBSCM) and then fixed in 3&#x00025; paraformaldehyde and permeabilised with 0.1&#x00025; Saponin (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) in 5&#x00025; FCS/PBSCM. After fixation, cells were incubated with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies specific for LMP1 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), &#x003b2;-Catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA) and E-Cadherin (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA), and TRITC conjugated anti-Phalloidin antibody (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) in 5&#x00025; FCS/PBSCM and incubated on the cells for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing in 0.1&#x00025; Saponin/PBSCM, cells were incubated with anti-mouse Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Baltimore Pike, PA). Finally the cells were washed and examined by confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP2; Leica, Mannheim, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Surface Labeling, Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting</title><p>Monolayers of HaCaT cells stably expressing LMP1 or EGFP were washed with cold PBS (pH 8.0) and labelled with 2 mM EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The reaction was quenched with PBS and 100 mM Glycine prior to solubilisation with modified radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (Upstate Inc. Waltham, MA). These cell extracts were initially incubated with E-Cadherin-specific antibody for 2.5 hours followed by an overnight incubation with Protein G Sepharose beads (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). After incubation, beads were extensively washed with RIPA buffer and protein samples resolved using standard SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), and antibodies specific for E-Cadherin, &#x003b2;-catenin or &#x003b1;-catenin (BD transduction laboratories, San Jose, CA),. Protein bands were detected using Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer, Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and their intensity compared by densitometric analysis using Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In some experiments protein samples from EGFP and LMP1-GFP expressing cells were directly resolved on the SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin, and antibodies specific for LMP1, E-Cadherin, &#x003b2;-catenin, &#x003b1;-catenin or GSK3&#x003b2; (Becton Dickson Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA), GAPDH (Ambion, Austin, TX) and Axin (Zymed Laboratories Inc. San Francisco, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Intracellular stability analysis of &#x003b2;-catenin</title><p>The human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT was transiently transfected with expression constructs encoding LMP1-GFP or EGFP as described above. At 30 h posttransfection, cyclohexamide (50 &#x000b5;g/ml) was added to 1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells and equal aliquots of cells were removed at time points 0 min, 45 min, 90 min, 135 min and 180 min; and lysed in RIPA buffer, resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with antibodies specific &#x003b2;-catenin. Protein bands were detected using Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus densitometricaly analysis using Imagequant software.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Analysis of &#x003b2;-catenin transcription activity</title><p>Approximately, 10<sup>6</sup> HaCaT cells were co-transfected with TOPFlash or FOPFlash (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). in combination with EGFP or LMP1-GFP expression plasmids (B95.8, CAO, HS6, NPC9 or QC) at a ratio of 1&#x02236;2. After incubation for 24 h, a small aliquot of these cells was analysed for GFP expression by FACSCalibur and cell numbers were accordingly standardised based on GFP positive cells. These cells were used in luciferase reporter assays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). The TOPFlash luciferase activity produced by each sample is shown relative to the matching FOPFlash activity produced.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Gene transfection and luciferase reporter assay</title><p>HaCaT cells were grown to late-log phase of cell growth prior to co-transfection. On the day of transfection, luciferase reporter plasmids for either NF-&#x003ba;B (3.Enh-Luc) or STAT (pGRR5-Luc) (Fielding et al., 2001) were combined with LMP1-GFP expression plasmids (B95&#x02013;8, CAO, HS6, NPC9 or QC) and pEGFP-N1 expression vector in a 1&#x02236;2 ratio. Electroporation was used for the STAT co-transfections where 9 &#x000b5;g of total DNA was used for 5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells, and 0.8 &#x000b5;g total DNA was added to 2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells when using Effectene&#x02122; (Qiagen) for the NF-&#x003ba;B co-transfections. After growth for 24 hours in RPMI medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10&#x00025; FCS, cells were harvested and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 2&#x00025; FCS. To measure successful transfection a small aliquot was taken for FACScan (Becton Dickson) analysis of GFP expression, and the volume remaining was subsequently standardized to the sample of lowest efficiency. The transfection efficiencies were generally between 40&#x02013;50&#x00025;. To report the transcription factor activity, the cells were pelleted and lysed with 120 &#x000b5;l of Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega) and the luciferase activity measured on 20 &#x000b5;l triplicates by addition of Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega). The luciferase activity produced by each sample was calculated relative to the activity produced by the prototype B95-8-LMP1.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
