CpG islands on the active X chromosome of mammals are also unmethylated. However, islands on the inactive X chromosome are heavily methylated. We have identified a CpG island in the 5' region of the G6PD gene, and two islands forty Kb 3' from the G6PD gene, on the human X chromosome. Expression of the G6PD gene is associated with concordant demethylation of all three CpG islands. We have shown that one of the two islands is in the promoter region of a housekeeping gene, GdX. In this paper we show that the second CpG island is also associated with a gene, P3. The P3 gene has no homology to previously described genes. It is a single copy, 4 kb gene, conserved in evolution, and it has the features of a housekeeping two genes is within the CpG island and that sequences in the islands have promoter function.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0166-a" xlink:role="9534"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0167-a" xlink:role="9535"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0168-a" xlink:role="9536"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0170-a" xlink:role="9538"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0171-a" xlink:role="9539"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0159.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9527"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0160.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9528"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0161.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9529"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0162.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9530"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0163.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9531"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0164.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9532"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9533"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9534"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9535"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9536"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9537"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0170.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9538"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0171.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9539"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0172.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9540"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0173.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9541"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0174.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9542"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00162-0175.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9543"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
