Although studied in model human cell lines such as HeLa, very little is known about the role of the CSN in haemopoietic cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Greater than 95% knockdown of the non-catalytic subunit CSN2 and the deneddylating subunit CSN5 of the CSN was achieved in the human myeloid progenitor cell line K562. CSN2 knockdown led to a reduction of both CSN5 protein and mRNA whilst CSN5 knockdown had little effect on CSN2. Both knockdowns inhibited CSN deneddylase function as demonstrated by accumulation of neddylated Cul1. Furthermore, both knockdowns resulted in the sequential loss of Skp2, Cdc4 and &#x003b2;-TrCP F-box proteins. These proteins were rescued by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, indicating the autocatalytic degradation of F-box proteins upon loss of CSN2 or CSN5. Interestingly, altered F-box protein gene expression was also observed in CSN2 and CSN5 knockdowns, suggesting a potential role of the CSN in regulating F-box protein transcription.</p><p>Loss of either CSN subunit dramatically reduced cell growth but resulted in distinct patterns of cell death. CSN5 knockdown caused mitotic defects, G2/M arrest and apoptotic cell death. CSN2 knockdown resulted in non-apoptotic cell death associated with accumulation of both the autophagy marker LC3-II and autophagic vacuoles. Treatment of vector control K562 cells with the autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1 recapitulated the growth kinetics, vacuolar morphology and LC3-II accumulation of CSN2 knockdown cells indicating that the cellular phenotype of CSN2 cells arises from autophagy inhibition. Finally, loss of CSN2 was associated with the formation of a CSN5 containing subcomplex.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that CSN2 is required for CSN integrity and the stability of individual CSN subunits, and postulate that CSN2 loss results in a phenotype distinct from that of cells lacking CSN5 possibly as a consequence of altered CSN5 activity within a resultant CSN subcomplex. Our data present the first evidence for the sequential loss of F-box proteins upon CSN manipulation and are the first to identify a potential link between CSN function and autophagy.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The regulated expression and degradation of proteins are critical to all aspects of cell development and proliferation. The two main routes for eukaryotic intracellular protein clearance are the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy-lysosome pathway. A key component involved in regulating degradation of proteins by the UPS is the COP9 signalosome (CSN). The CSN is an eight-subunit (CSN1-8) protein complex, highly conserved amongst eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] originally identified in Arabidopsis as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Through its function in the regulation of the UPS, the CSN has been implicated in the regulation of biological processes as diverse as DNA replication and repair, cell-cycle progression and cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Degradation of cellular proteins by the 26S proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] is preceded by ubiquitination of target proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], a process mediated by three enzyme complexes; a ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) and a ubiquitin ligase (E3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The E3 ligase interacts with the protein substrate and thus confers the specificity of the UPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The largest known class of E3 ubiquitin ligases comprises the Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) of which the best studied is the SCF (Skp1, Cul1, F-box protein) complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The cullin subunit (Cul1) of the SCF forms a scaffold to recruit and bring into close proximity the E2 and its substrate, thereby facilitating ubiquitin transfer from the E2 to target proteins (SCF structure reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]). The RING protein (Hrt1/Roc1/Rbx1) is the fourth subunit of the SCF and is responsible for E2 recruitment, whilst the variable F-box protein subunit, recruited to the SCF complex via the adaptor protein Skp1, binds substrates selectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In yeast, over 19 F-box proteins are known, over 400 in A. thaliana, and ~70 in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Since each cullin (Cul1-5) forms complexes with a variable substrate recognition subunit (SRS) (F-box proteins for Cul1 as above, VHL box proteins for Cul2, BTB proteins for Cul3, WD40 proteins for Cul4 and SOCS box proteins for Cul5, reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]) specificity in CRL target protein recruitment is achieved by the large number of variable SRS containing CRLs. It is thought that, altogether, the human genome may have the capacity to code for as many as 350 different CRLs.</p><p>Given the potential number and diversity of target proteins requiring CRL mediated ubiquitination for degradation, dynamic regulation of the CRL complex repertoire in a cell at any given time is essential. All cullins studied (Cul1-5) have been shown to be modified by neddylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], which facilitates their ubiquitin ligase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] possibly via increased E2 affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The deneddylation of cullins is mediated by the CSN complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Although initial studies indicated a negative role for deneddylation, further studies have implicated deneddylation in the positive regulation of CRL activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It has since been proposed by several groups that optimal CRL activity requires the cyclic neddylation and deneddylation of the cullin subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, it is thought that F-box proteins themselves are targeted for degradation in part by autoubiquitination within the SCF complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The deneddylation of cullins by the CSN is believed to regulate the autoubiquitination of SRSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], thereby modulating CRL composition and activity. Furthermore, the CSN has been shown to be associated with a deubiquitinase activity which may further stabilize autoubiquitinated SRSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The CSN complex is therefore an integral regulator of CRL activity and subsequent protein degradation.</p><p>In this present study we have investigated the effects of knocking down CSN2 and CSN5 in the model K562 cell line, a model of human erythrocyte and megakaryocyte progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Whilst knockdown of either CSN2 or CSN5 resulted in common changes including the sequential loss of F-box proteins Skp2, Cdc4 and &#x003b2;-TrCP other important differences occurred. For example CSN5 knockdown resulted in apoptotic cell death associated with aberrant mitosis, whereas CSN2 knockdown cells underwent non-apoptotic cell death that was associated with both inhibition of autophagy and the formation of a novel CSN5 containing CSN subcomplex.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>CSN2 and CSN5 knockdown and resulting aberrant SCF activity</title><p>Plasmids encoding short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to either CSN2 or CSN5 were electroporated into K562 cells together with H-2K<sup>k </sup>plasmid and transfected cells sorted by anti- H-2K<sup>k </sup>magnetic beads. Three days post transfection, neither CSN2 nor CSN5 protein could be detected by western blot analysis in their respective knockdown protein extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Furthermore, CSN2 knockdown of over 99% and CSN5 knockdown of over 95% was achieved at the mRNA level relative to mock transfectants as measured by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This level of knockdown was maintained throughout the time course of the experiments (data not shown). Transfection with either the H-2K<sup>k </sup>plasmid alone or co-transfection with H-2K<sup>k </sup>plasmid and empty vector (shVC) had no effect on the level of CSN2 or CSN5 mRNA or protein relative to mock transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and data not shown). Co-transfections with H-2K<sup>k </sup>and a vector encoding a control scrambled shRNA sequence had no effect on the level of CSN2 or CSN5 mRNA or protein relative to cells co-transfected with empty vector (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), demonstrating that the results were specific and not due to off-target effects.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>CSN2 and CSN5 knockdowns result in Cul-1 hyperneddylation, loss of Skp-2 and accumulation of p27</bold>.

For example, CSN8 knockdown has been shown to result in the loss of CSN3, CSN5 and CSN7 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We therefore determined CSN5 and CSN2 protein levels in CSN2 and CSN5 knockdown cells, respectively, by western blotting. A significant reduction in CSN5 protein was observed in cells lacking CSN2, whilst depletion of CSN5 had no effect on CSN2 protein or mRNA levels relative to vector control cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> and data not shown). Interestingly, CSN2 knockdown not only resulted in loss of CSN5 protein, but also in the significant reduction of CSN5 mRNA as determined by QRT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, P = 0.011).</p><p>Consistent with previous studies of CSN deregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], both CSN2 and CSN5 knockdowns were associated with accumulation of neddylated Cul1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>) indicating functional dysregulation of the CSN following knockdown of either subunit. Studies demonstrating Cul1 hyperneddylation in CSN deficient cells have also demonstrated degradation of the F-box protein Skp2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In agreement with these observations, complete loss of Skp2 protein was observed in both the CSN2 and CSN5 knockdown cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Skp2 binds to and mediates the ubiquitination of multiple proteins, including the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27<sup>kip1 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Consistent with loss of Skp2, knockdown of CSN2 and CSN5 resulted in the accumulation of p27 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of CSN2 and CSN5 results in the sequential loss of F-box proteins</title><p>Skp2 is one of many F-box proteins that can bind to the Cul1/Roc1/Skp1 complex, thereby altering the substrate specificity of the SCF (F-box proteins reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]). Analysis of three such F-box proteins, Skp2, Cdc4 and &#x003b2;-TrCP revealed a sequential loss of protein in CSN2 and CSN5 knockdown cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, part D). In CSN2 knockdown cells, Skp2 protein was reduced by ~60% by day 2 and over 90% by day 6, whereas Cdc4 was lost at a slower rate with 30&#x02013;40% lost by day 3 increasing to ~70% by day 6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Loss of &#x003b2;-TrCP was still more retarded with ~70% protein remaining at day 6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). By day 9, all three F-box proteins were undetectable in CSN2 knockdown cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Similar sequential loss of F-box proteins was observed in CSN5 knockdown cells. At day 4 post transfection Skp2 protein could not be detected, Cdc4 protein was greatly reduced but remained detectable, and &#x003b2;-TrCP was largely unaffected (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, part D).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Loss of CSN2 and CSN5 results in sequential loss of F-box proteins</bold>.

Treatment of both CSN2 and CSN5 knockdown cells with MG132 resulted in Skp2, Cdc4 and &#x003b2;-TrCP protein rescue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), indicating involvement of the proteasome in the loss of these F-box proteins. However the strength of the observed rescue varied. Importantly, CSN subunit depletion also affected levels of F-box mRNA. CSN2 knockdown resulted in a significant reduction of Skp2 mRNA by day 2 post transfection. Thus it is likely that transcriptional changes also contribute to loss of Skp2 protein in these cells. In contrast Cdc4 and &#x003b2;-TrCP mRNAs were significantly increased following CSN2 knockdown despite clear loss of protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). CSN5 depletion resulted in a modest reduction of all three F-box protein mRNAs but not enough to account for the observed loss of protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Collectively these data indicate that, with the possible exception of Skp2 in CSN2 knockdown cells, proteasomal degradation rather than transcriptional repression was the main driver of F-box protein loss in CSN2 and CSN5 knockdown K562 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Both CSN2 and CSN5 knockdowns result in reduced cell growth and cell death</title><p>Knockdown of either CSN2 or CSN5 dramatically diminished cell proliferation, followed by loss of cell viability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Analysis of cumulative growth demonstrated that proliferation of cells lacking CSN2 was significantly reduced when compared to that of shVC cells by day 4 post transfection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, P = 0.034), whilst loss of proliferation following CSN5 knockdown was even more marked (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> insert, P = 0.0023). This difference in diminished proliferation was corroborated by measurement of thymidine incorporation. At day 3 post-transfection, there was no significant difference in the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into cellular DNA between shVC and CSN2 knockdown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) whereas the CSN5 knockdown cells already had markedly reduced thymidine incorporation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, P = 0.0012). However, by day 5 the CSN2 knockdown cells also had a significant decrease in thymidine incorporation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, P = 0.0072) which decreased even further by day 7 (P = 1.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5</sup>). Thus, although the changes in Cul1 neddylation and F-box protein levels are very similar between the CSN2 and CSN5 knockdowns, differences were apparent in the growth kinetics of the cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Both CSN2 and CSN5 knockdowns result in reduced cell growth</bold>.

Despite leading to significantly reduced cell proliferation, loss of CSN2 did not affect the cell cycle distribution of K562 cells as compared to shVC K562 cells by day 6 post transfection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Given the significantly reduced cell numbers in CSN2 knockdown by day 6, this would suggest that these cells are growing more slowly, rather than arresting at any stage in the cell cycle. In contrast, CSN5 knockdown resulted in a reduction in cells in G1 (25.7% compared to shVC 35.5%, P = 0.0044), loss of cells from S phase (21% compared to shVC 45.7%, P = 3.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5</sup>) and accumulation in G2/M (33.5% compared to shVC 15.7%, P = 0.0011) by day 4 post transfection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Morphological analysis of Jenner-Giemsa stained CSN5 knockdown cells identified a significant number of large cells which appeared to be arrested in late mitosis with chaotically organized condensed chromosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Cells of these morphologies were not observed in either shVC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) or CSN2 knockdown (Fig. Six A) cells. To investigate this morphology further, shCSN5 cells were immunostained for tubulin. As can be seen in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, shVC cells retained the ability to form a mitotic spindle and correctly aligned chromosomes at various stages of mitosis were observed. In striking contrast, cells lacking CSN5 demonstrated either aberrant or absent microtubule structures. In these cells, the condensed chromatids appeared to be either misaligned or indeed not associated with the spindle structures at all (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).

Annexin V binds phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid which is translocated from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane during early apoptosis. Propidium iodide is taken up by all cells but is efficiently effluxed by viable cells, whereas dead/dying cells remain PI-positive. In accordance with the marked increase in the sub-G1 fraction of shCSN5 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), knockdown of CSN5 lead to significant increases in both early apoptotic (annexin V<sup>+ve</sup>:PI<sup>-ve</sup>) (21.9 &#x000b1; 1.8%, P = 0.0015) and late apoptotic (annexin V<sup>+ve</sup>:PI<sup>+ve</sup>) cells (42.3 &#x000b1; 2.5%, P = 0.0006) compared to shVC cells (5.9 &#x000b1; 1.9% and 5.5 &#x000b1; 2.2%, respectively; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Furthermore, CSN5 knockdown cells demonstrated cleavage of caspase 9 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), consistent with death by apoptosis in these cells. In marked contrast, CSN2 knockdown showed only a relatively small increase in annexin V positive cells (5.5 &#x000b1; 0.8% and 12.5 &#x000b1; 0.9%, respectively; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>) and no caspase 9 activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Instead, the CSN2 knockdown cells demonstrated increased retention of PI in the annexin V<sup>-ve </sup>cell population (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, P = 3.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5</sup>).

Thus knockdown of CSN2 in K562 cells did not result in overt apoptosis. Taken together these data indicate that knockdown in K562 cells of CSN5, but not CSN2, resulted in apoptotic cell death and that loss of cell viability in the CSN2 knockdowns was likely to be by a non-apoptotic mechanism.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>CSN5, but not CSN2, knockdown results in apoptotic cell death</bold>.

Jenner-Giemsa staining of cytospins identified large vacuoles in a significant proportion of CSN2 knockdown cells which were not present in either shVC or shCSN5 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Staining with the autophagosome/autophagic vacuole marker monodansylcadaverine (MDC, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]) identified these large vacuoles as autophagic bodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Moreover, western blotting identified a highly significant accumulation of the autophagy associated LC3-II protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] in CSN2 knockdown cells relative to shVC cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). In contrast, no increase of LC3-II was detected in CSN5 knockdown cells. To demonstrate this we used a prolonged exposure (12 hours) of autoradiographs that allowed detection of basal expression of LC3-II in shVC cells and demonstrated that this was not increased in shCSN5 knockdown cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Thus, knockdown of CSN2, but not CSN5, appeared strongly associated with autophagy. However, LC3-II accumulation can occur as a result of either enhanced autophagy or inhibition of autophagy dependant LC3-II degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Indeed, treatment of vector control cells with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) resulted in a growth pattern almost identical to that of shCSN2 cells, whilst having a relatively small additional effect on shCSN2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Furthermore, treatment of vector control cells with the late stage autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 recapitulated both the vacuolar morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>) and the LC3-II protein accumulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>) observed in cells lacking CSN2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>).

However, the cellular responses to CSN2 or CSN5 knockdown were markedly different. Since it has previously been shown that depletion of individual subunits can destabilize the CSN holocomplex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] we reasoned that one explanation for the differences between CSN2 and CSN5 knockdown cellular responses may be due to the generation, in CSN2 knockdowns, of CSN5 containing CSN subcomplexes with altered activities. To investigate this, 2-dimensional native gel electrophoresis was performed on knockdown cells day 3 post transfection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Loss of CSN2 results in the formation of CSN5 containing CSN subcomplexes</bold>.

A multitude of proteins have been shown to associate with CSN subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and larger complexes have previously been observed. Monomeric CSN2 and CSN5 were also observed in the shVC cell extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref> and data not shown). Following knockdown of CSN2, CSN2 protein was no longer detectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). CSN5 protein, as also shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, was greatly reduced in cells lacking CSN2, with significant loss of the CSN complex relative to vector controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Interestingly, a longer exposure of the autoradiograph identified a CSN5 containing subcomplex of ~242 KDa in cells lacking CSN2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The achievement of almost complete CSN2 and CSN5 knockdown in this study has provided a powerful tool to study the function of these CSN subunits more closely. At the molecular level, CSN2 and CSN5 knockdowns resulted in aberrant SCF activity, with the accumulation of neddylated Cul-1, loss of the F-box protein Skp2 and an increase in the Skp2 target protein, p27. This complements another report in which CSN4 and CSN5 knockdown also resulted in increased neddylation of Cul-1 with a concomitant loss of Skp2 and increase in p27 protein in human epithelial cell lines rather than haemopoietic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thus it appears that the CSN complex has highly conserved activities across cells from different cell lineages and that disruption of the complex by loss of any subunit causes derangement of these activities.</p><p>It was also observed that CSN2 knockdown not only results in loss of CSN5 protein but also results in a significant reduction of CSN5 mRNA. Moreover, both CSN2 and CSN5 knockdown resulted in temporal alterations of F-box protein mRNA. Together with other recent reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], this data suggests that CSN subunits or the CSN complex as a whole may have a direct role in transcriptional regulation of CSN subunits and F-box proteins. However, it is also possible that the altered mRNA levels observed are due to secondary effects of aberrant CRL mediated protein degradation such as accumulation of proteins involved in transcriptional regulation.</p><p>Here we show for the first time sequential loss of F-box proteins following knockdown of CSN subunits. Moreover, protein levels were at least partially restored in both knockdowns upon treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. These observations are in accordance with the finding that F-box proteins are autocatalytically degraded in the presence of hyperneddylated Cul-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, the three f-box proteins studied were each lost at a different rate, with the loss of Skp2 protein being the most rapid. The sequential loss of F-box proteins is of great interest as it may explain published results which document the loss of particular F-box proteins at a specific time point post CSN manipulation, but no reduction in other F-box proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The CSN5 knockdown cultures contained aberrantly large cells and were associated with G2/M arrest and apoptosis. This data complements previous studies demonstrating that CSN5 loss inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Closer analysis of CSN5 knockdown cells identified disorganized condensed chromatids and abnormal mitotic spindles in the large cells. A recent report described stabilization of the microtubule end-binding protein 1 (EB1) by the CSN complex in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. EB1, which is a master regulator of microtubule dynamics, was shown to bind the CSN via CSN5, and was also shown to be reduced in cells lacking CSN1 or CSN3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. EB1 has recently been shown to directly interact with and regulate the activity of Aurora B, one essential component of the chromosomal passenger complex that is required for correct chromosomal alignment and spindle assembly checkpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Furthermore, the dynamic behaviour of Aurora B on mitotic chromosomes has been shown to be regulated by a Cul3 E3 ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Given that we observed hyperneddylated Cul3 in the CSN5 knockdown cells (data not shown), our data suggests that CSN5/the CSN complex is integral to the regulation of multiple components of the mitotic machinery.</p><p>K562 cells in which CSN2 had been knocked down did not display apoptosis markers as in CSN5 knockdown cells, but were instead associated with features of autophagy. Interestingly, autophagy inhibitors recapitulated the cell growth kinetics, vacuolar morphology and LC3-II accumulation of cells lacking CSN2, whilst treatment of CSN2 knockdown cells with one of these inhibitors (3-MA) had a comparatively mild effect on cell growth. These findings suggest that CSN2 knockdown K562 cells undergo autophagy inhibition resulting in non-apoptotic cell death. This is the first data to show an association between the CSN complex and autophagy.</p><p>The distinct phenotypes observed between CSN2 and CSN5 knockdowns may arise as a result of aberrant CSN5 activity within the observed CSN subcomplex in cells lacking CSN2. However, it is important to note that both the CSN subunits studied here have CSN independent functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], and that CSN5 has been shown to function within a CSN subcomplex in K562 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possible contribution of the independent functions of CSN2 and CSN5 to the phenotypic differences observed between the knockdowns. It is also noteworthy that the subcomplex observed in this study may be a result of CSN complex breakdown in the absence of CSN2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], rather than a functional complex contributing to the observed phenotypic differences between knockdowns. Moreover, as we see no effect of CSN5 loss on the level of CSN2 protein, one possibility not investigated here is the formation of a CSN2 containing subcomplex in the absence of CSN5. This is an intriguing possibility, particularly given the recent findings of Su et al who demonstrated an increase in the proportion of CSN2 residing in mini-complexes upon CSN8 knockdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It will be of great interest to determine the precise mechanism accounting for the divergent phenotypes encountered here, and is something which is currently under investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have shown that loss of either CSN2 or CSN5 in human K562 cells results in significant loss of viability but by very different mechanisms, potentially attributable to the formation of a CSN5 containing subcomplex in the absence of CSN2. Furthermore, we have provided data to suggest a possible function of the CSN complex in the transcriptional regulation of both its own components and CRL subunits. Finally, we have demonstrated here for the first time the sequential loss of F-box proteins in the absence of the CSN complex and have provided the first evidence of a link between the CSN complex and autophagy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin and 10% v/v foetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Gibco) and maintained at 37&#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

The following primers (Sigma Genosys) and FAM/TAMRA labeled probes (Eurogentec) were used:</p><p><underline>CSN2</underline>, 5'-CCTCATCCACTGATTATGGGAGT-3' (forward),</p><p>5'-CATCATAATTCTTGAAGGCTTCAAAA-3' (reverse),</p><p>5'-CCCTCAAGTGCATTTTACCACCACATTCTCT-3' (probe);</p><p><underline>CSN5</underline>, 5'-ATATCCGCAGGGAAAG-3' (forward),</p><p>5'-GGTCCTTCATCAGGAGGTTTGT-3' (reverse),</p><p>5'- TGGCGCCTTTAGGACATACCCAAAGG-3' (probe);</p><p><underline>Skp2</underline>, 5'-CGCTGCCCACGATCATTT-3' (forward),</p><p>5'-CCATGTGCTGTACACGAAAAGG-3' (reverse);</p><p><underline>Cdc4</underline>, 5'-ACGACGCCGAATTACATCTGT-3' (forward),</p><p>5'-ACTCCAGCTCTGAAACATTTTTAGC-3' (reverse);</p><p><underline>&#x003b2;-Trcp</underline>, 5'-GAGGCATTGCCTGTTTGCA-3' (forward)</p><p>5'-TGTCCCATAATCTGATAGTGTTGTCA-3' (reverse)</p><p><underline>18S</underline>, 5'-GCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTCTTG-3' (forward),</p><p>5'-CATTCTTGGCAAATGCTTTCG-3' (reverse).</p><p>Preoptimised primers and probes to 18S ribosomal RNA were used as internal standards in TAQMAN QRT-PCR (Applied Biosystems). Cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained graphically for test genes and 18S internal standards. &#x00394;Ct values were calculated by subtracting 18S Ct from test gene Ct, and average &#x00394;Ct values obtained from duplicates. Relative mRNA levels were determined by subtraction of mock transfection &#x00394;Ct values from shVC/shCSN2/shCSN5 &#x00394;Ct values to give a &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct value and conversion through 2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CP conceived of and designed the study, carried out all laboratory experimentation except for that carried out by REH and FLK, and drafted the manuscript.

K562 cells were transiently co-transfected with HKK plasmid together with either empty vector or vector control scramble plasmid. HKK positive cells were sorted 24 hours post-transfection, re-cultured and harvested day 9 post transfection. (A) The levels of CSN2, CSN5, Cul1, Skp2, p27, LC3-II and caspase-9 protein was determined by western blot.
