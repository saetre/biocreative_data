When administered to Pr55Gag-expressing insect cells (Sf9), DSB inhibits the assembly and budding of membrane-enveloped virus-like particles (VLP).

DSB differs from conventional protease (PR) inhibitors in that it does not bind to PR, but interferes with the PR-mediated Gag processing. The ultimate cleavage of the C-terminal capsid domain CAp25 into CAp24 + SP1 is required for production of fully infectious virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. DSB blocks this step, and decreases or abolishes virus infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Several lines of evidence indicate that the CA-SP1 junction is the preferred target of DSB in HIV-1 Gag precursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although there is no available structural data on DSB-Gag complex which could explain its inhibitory activity at the molecular level, data from <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], as well as the encapsidation of DSB in equimolar ratio to Gag <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], suggested that the mechanism of inhibitory activity of DSB results from the direct binding of DSB to the Gag polyprotein, or/and to a transient Gag structural intermediate which occurs during virus assembly.</p><p>The latter observation incited us to study the possible effect of DSB on assembly of recombinant HIV-1 Gag precursor (Pr55Gag) expressed in heterologous, eukaryotic system. We observed a dose-dependent negative effect of DSB on the process of assembly and release of HIV-1 VLP from recombinant baculovirus AcMNPV-Pr55Gag-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This effect was not due to a block in Gag synthesis, and was independent of the N-myristoylation of Pr55Gag and its plasma membrane addressing. It did not depend on the presence of the p6 domain at the C-terminus of Gag. The same effect was observed with the Gag precursor of SIVmac (Pr57Gag<sup>SIV</sup>), although at significantly higher DSB concentrations, suggesting that the DSB inhibitory activity on Gag assembly was not as strictly sequence-dependent as the negative effect on Gag processing at the CA-SP1 junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition, we found a lower stability of delipidated cores assembled in the presence of DSB, compared to control cores, suggesting a weakening of Gag-Gag interaction occurring in the presence of DSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Using Gag mutants and a chimeric HIV-MuLV Gag precursor, we mapped the DSB-responsive domain in terms of Gag assembly to the hinge region overlapping the C-terminal end of the CAp24 and the SP1 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The DSB concentration at which we observed an inhibitory activity on Gag assembly in insect cells (IC50 ~8&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M) was apparently disproportionate compared to the usual doses required for blocking the CAp25 cleavage in HIV-1-infected mammalian cells. However, a wide range of IC-50 values have been reported for the DSB inhibition of virus maturation, varying from nanomolar (0.35 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and 7.8 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]) to micromolar values (10 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]), depending on the different assays used. In addition, in Pr55Gag-expressing Sf9 cells, the bulk of Gag protein molecules synthesized at 48 h pi has been evaluated to be as high as 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>per cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The addition of DSB at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml to 10<sup>6 </sup>cells corresponded to 12 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9 </sup>DSB molecules per cell, i.e. a DSB to Gag stoichiometric ratio of 24: 1 at this DSB concentration. A 24-fold excess of DSB over Gag was therefore compatible with a mechanism of Gag assembly inhibition due to a stoichiometric interaction between the drug and its protein target.</p><p>Whatever the molecular mechanism, our observation raised the question of the difference between Pr55Gag-expressing Sf9 cells, in which DSB inhibited VLP assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], versus HIV-1-infected human cells, in which DSB was found to block the CA-SP1 (CAp25) to CAp24 maturation cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and to have limited effects on virus assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In our experimental model of baculovirus-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], assembly of Pr55Gag was analyzed in a context devoid of PR and of glycoproteins (Gp) SUgp120 and TMgp41, three viral components which have been identified as directly or indirectly involved in the antiviral effects of betulinic acid derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the aim to reconcile the different antiviral activities of DSB, we explored cellular and viral determinants of the DSB response, and their possible role in modulating the degree of susceptibility to DSB of the VLP assembly process. Among the viral candidates, we analyzed EnvGp160, the precursor to the envelope glycoproteins (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]), and two inner core components, the Vpr and Vif proteins. Vpr is packaged into the virion in substoichiometric amounts with Gag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and Vif, which is also coencapsidated with Gag, has been found to exert a control on proteolytic processing of Gag in insect cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>We found that coexpression of wild-type Vif protein (Vif<sup>wt</sup>) with Pr55Gag restored the VLP assembly in DSB-treated Sf9 cells at levels observed in the absence of the drug, suggesting an antagonistic effect of Vif towards DSB. Data obtained with Vif mutants indicated that the anti-DSB function of Vif required the integrity of the zinc binding domain (ZBD) recently identified in the Vif protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], but was independent of the Vif packaging function. Electron microscopic analysis showed that coexpression of Pr55Gag and Vif<sup>wt</sup>, in the presence or absence of DSB, resulted in a major change in the VLP egress pathway: the majority of VLP budded in intracytoplasmic vesicles and were released by exocytosis, instead of budding at the plasma membrane as in cells expressing Pr55Gag alone. With ZBD mutants of Vif however, the VLP budding pathway was similar to that observed in cells expressing Pr55Gag alone. Our data suggested that the anti-DSB effect of Vif, a novel function associated with its ZBD, was the indirect consequence of its effect on the cellular pathway of VLP assembly and budding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Antiviral effects of DSB and cellular context</title><p>We first compared the effect of DSB on VLP assembly and release in our reference model of AcMNPV-Pr55Gag-infected Sf9 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and in a <italic>trans</italic>-packaging mammalian cell line. 5BD.1 cells derive from CMT3-COS cells by integration of a discontinuous HIV-1 progenome, and stably express the <italic>gag</italic>, <italic>gagpol</italic>, <italic>rev </italic>and <italic>env </italic>gene products but no Nef protein. 5BD.1 cells also express Vif protein in significant amounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. 5BD.1 and Sf9 cells represented a similar situation in terms of VLP content, as both cell types produced VLP devoid of viral genomic RNA. DSB was added to monolayers of 5BD.1 cells at increasing concentrations for 30 h, and whole cell lysates and VLP recovered from culture medium were analyzed for Gag protein content at the end of this time period.</p><p>The intracellular Gag content was found to remain constant throughout the period of DSB treatment in both Sf9 and 5BD.1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Ai</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Bi</xref>), which confirmed that DSB had no significant effect on the level of Gag protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, a drastic decrease in the yields of extracellular VLP was observed at DSB doses superior to 4 &#x003bc;g/ml in Pr55Gag-expressing Sf9 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Aii</xref>; and refer to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). By contrast, only a moderate decrease in VLP production (20&#x02013;30%) was detected for DSB-treated 5BD.1 cells at high DSB concentrations (12 to 16 &#x003bc;g/ml; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Bii</xref>). Protein analysis of VLP showed that their Gag protein content mainly consisted of Pr55Gag and CAp24 proteins, with other minor species migrating at the expected position for intermediate cleavage products, e.g. Pr47 to Pr41 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Bii</xref>). Prolonged exposure of autoradiograms of immunoblots reacted with radiolabelled secondary antibody revealed a discrete alteration of the Gag processing at high DSB concentrations: there was a progressive increase in the amount of uncleaved CAp25 versus the CAp24 species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1Biii</xref>), as expected from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of DSB on HIV-1 VLP production by (A) insect cells and (B) mammalian cells</bold>. <bold>(A)</bold>, Sf9 cells infected with AcMNPV-Pr55Gag were treated with increasing concentrations of DSB in DMSO-aliquots for 30h at 18h pi, as indicated on top of the panels.

This suggested that the DSB sensitivity of the VLP assembly pathway might be modulated by the cellular context in which the HIV-1 Gag precursor was expressed, or/and by viral proteins present in 5BD.1 cells and absent from Sf9 cells. The following experiments were designed to address this issue, and to determine which factor(s) possibly interfered with DSB inhibitory activity and accounted for the difference in DSB response between Sf9 and 5BD.1 cells, as well as other mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Absence of detectable effect of EnvGp160 or Vpr on the DSB inhibition of VLP assembly in Sf9 cells</title><p>The best candidates to act as viral modulators of the Gag assembly response to DSB were the HIV-1 proteins coencapsidated with Gag, in particular those which are active participants in the virus assembly pathway (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]). This was the case for the envelope glycoprotein Gp160, which has been shown to interact with the MA protein via the cytoplasmic tail of its TMgp41 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], as well as for auxiliary viral proteins Nef, Vpr and Vif.</p><p>In order to test this possibility, Sf9 were coinfected with AcMNPV-Pr55Gag and AcMNPV-Gp160, and subjected to increasing doses of DSB for 30 h, at 18 h pi. Culture medium samples were collected at 48 h pi and assayed for production of extracellular VLP. Results were compared with VLP yields from Sf9 cells infected with AcMNPV-Pr55Gag alone and treated in parallel with DSB at the same doses. No significant difference in the DSB effect on VLP assembly was detectable with or without coexpression of EnvGp160 (data not shown). This excluded the direct or indirect participation of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins in the level of susceptibility to DSB of assembly and extracellular release of VLP by Sf9 cells.</p><p>Nef in its processed form, called Nef core, has been shown to be a <italic>bona fide </italic>component of the virion inner core [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].

However, in recombinant Pr55Gag-expressing Sf9 cells, a cellular context devoid of PR and other viral proteins, DSB showed a dose-dependent inhibitory activity on VLP assembly and release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The aim of the present study was to understand this dual inhibitory activity, and explain the apparent discrepancy between the DSB effects observed in mammalian and non-mammalian, insect cells. We first explored the effect of DSB on VLP production in 5BD.1 cells, a mammalian <italic>trans</italic>-packaging cell line producing VLP devoid of viral genome, as the VLP produced by AcMNPV-Pr55Gag-infected Sf9 cells. We found that DSB had only a moderate inhibitory effect on VLP yields at high DSB doses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), indicating that VLP assembly in 5BD.1 cells was less sensitive to DSB inhibitor, compared to Pr55Gag-expressing Sf9 cells. This suggested that the DSB negative effect on the VLP assembly process might be modulated by factors depending on the cellular or/and viral context.</p><p>We therefore investigated on the possible influence of viral components on the pattern of anti-assembly effect of DSB, and in particular the role of viral partners of Pr55Gag within the capsid. Coexpression of recombinant Pr55Gag with EnvGp160 or Vpr did not modify the level of inhibition of VLP assembly by DSB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), whereas coexpression of Vif<sup>wt </sup>restored the production of VLP in DSB-treated cells to levels found in the absence of the drug (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A panel of recombinant Vif mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) were then tested for their anti-DSB activity. We found that the DSB-antagonistic effect of Vif was retained in packaging-defective mutants of Vif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), but abolished by a Cys-to-Ser substitution at position 133 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Bii</xref>), a mutation which destroyed the zinc finger-like structure or ZBD. A phenotype similar to that of VifC133S was observed for mutant VifS116V (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Bi</xref>), which carried a mutation on the N-terminal side of the large loop (loop 2) generated by the four HCCH coordinates with the Zn atom (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

Our results therefore suggested that (i) the anti-DSB effect and packaging into VLP were two independent functions in Vif; (ii) the function of Vif which negated the DSB-induced inhibition of VLP assembly depended on the integrity of the zinc-binding domain, and more precisely on a discrete region of loop 2 overlapping residue 116 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). This region differed from the Vif packaging signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>EM analysis of Sf9 cells coexpressing Gag and Vif<sup>wt </sup>or Vif mutants gave some insight into the cellular mechanism of anti-DSB activity of Vif. Sf9 cells coexpressing Pr55Gag and Vif<sup>wt</sup>, with or without treatment with inhibitory doses of DSB, showed a high proportion of VLP budding into intracytoplasmic vesicles and egressing via exocytosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7b&#x02013;e</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This contrasted with cells expressing Pr55Gag alone, in which the majority of VLP budded at the plasma membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>). When Pr55Gag was coexpressed with one or the other of the ZBD mutants, VifS116V or VifC133S, we observed a drastic change in VLP budding, compared to Vif<sup>wt </sup>coexpression, consisting of a reversion to the plasma membrane budding pathway, as in Sf9 cells expressing Pr55Gag alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Since both ZBD mutants lacked the anti-DSB activity and failed to redirect VLP to the vesicular compartment, as did Vif<sup>wt</sup>, it might be hypothesized that the antagonistic activity of Vif towards DSB would be the indirect effect of a Vif-mediated change in the VLP assembly sites and mode of cellular exit.</p><p>It has been shown that the assembly and release of HIV-1 virions proceeds via two pathways, depending upon the cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]: (i) in primary human macrophages, virions preferentially follow the exosomal pathway via MVBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]; (ii) in HeLa cells and T lymphocytes, the major exgress route consisted of plasma membrane addressing and direct budding at the cell surface, but MA polybasic signal mutants of Gag use the MVB pathway in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].

The hypothesis formulated above implied that the intravesicular budding and exocytic pathway of VLP would be less sensitive to DSB inhibitory activity than the plasma membrane assembly and budding pathway usually observed in insect cells. If confirmed, this would be an example of drug resistance mechanism (DSB, in the present case) which involves the bypass of a drug-sensitive assembly and budding pathway by the virus or virus-like particle progeny.</p><p>The results of our study suggested that DSB and other betulinic acid derivatives could be considered not only as antivirals for patients treatment in vivo, but also as chemical probes to analyse the molecular and cellular mechanisms of retroviral Gag assembly in vitro. In the latter context, considering Vif as a determinant of the budding pathway usage in Sf9 cells, and as a modulator of the DSB response in terms of VLP assembly, any evaluation of potential HIV-1 assembly inhibitors using the baculovirus-insect cell system should be carried out in the presence of the Vif protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemical synthesis of DSB</title><p>The title compound 3-<italic>O</italic>-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl)-betulinic acid (C<sub>36</sub>H<sub>56</sub>O<sub>6</sub>; MW = 584.8) was obtained as originally described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] with a few minor modifications described in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Cells</title><p>Simian 5BD.1 packaging cells (obtained from D.
