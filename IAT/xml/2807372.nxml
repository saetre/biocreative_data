The few patients with saposin C deficiency develop a Gaucher disease-like central nervous system (CNS) phenotype attributed to diminished glucosylceramide (GC) cleavage activity by acid &#x003b2;-glucosidase (GCase). The <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of saposin C were examined by creating mice with selective absence of saposin C (C&#x02212;/&#x02212;) using a knock-in point mutation (cysteine-to-proline) in exon 11 of the <italic>psap</italic> gene. In C&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, prosaposin and saposins A, B and D proteins were present at near wild-type levels, but the saposin C protein was absent. By 1 year, the C&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice exhibited weakness of the hind limbs and progressive ataxia. Decreased neuromotor activity and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation were evident. Foamy storage cells were observed in dorsal root ganglion and there was progressive loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells and atrophy of cerebellar granule cells. Ultrastructural analyses revealed inclusions in axonal processes in the spinal cord, sciatic nerve and brain, but no excess of multivesicular bodies. Activated microglial cells and astrocytes were present in thalamus, brain stem, cerebellum and spinal cord, indicating regional pro-inflammatory responses. No storage cells were found in visceral organs of these mice. The absence of saposin C led to moderate increases in GC and lactosylceramide (LacCer) and their deacylated analogues. These results support the view that saposin C has multiple roles in glycosphingolipid (GSL) catabolism as well as a prominent function in CNS and axonal integrity independent of its role as an optimizer/stabilizer of GCase.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Saposin C is one of four saposins (A, B, C and D) that derive from a common precursor, prosaposin, by proteolytic processing in the late endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C1">1</xref>). Each saposin is an 80 amino acid lysosomal glycoprotein with a role in enhancing the activity of specific cognate enzymes in GSL degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C2">2</xref>). Saposin B presents a specific GSL, sulfatide, to its hydrolase, arylsulfatase A, for cleavage to galactosylceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C3">3</xref>). In both humans and mice, saposin B deficiency results in sulfatide accumulation and a metachromatic leukodystrophy-like disease that is similar to arylsulfatase A deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C5">5</xref>). Saposin C interacts with GCase, leading to optimal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C6">6</xref>). Biochemical studies have shown that in addition to its activation function toward GCase, saposin C protects GCase from proteolytic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C7">7</xref>). Point mutations in saposin C lead to a Gaucher-like disease due to diminished GC cleaving activity in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C9">9</xref>). Both saposin B and C have <italic>in vitro</italic> effects on hydrolysis of LacCer by activation of galactosylceramide-&#x003b2;-galactosidase, GM1-&#x003b2;-galactosidase and other &#x003b2;-galactosidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C10">10</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, saposins A and C enhance GCase activity in the presence of negatively charged phospholipids, but saposin A and C have different membrane interaction modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C12">12</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, saposin A and C specifically enhance the activities of galactosylcerebrosidase and GCase, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C13">13</xref>). Saposin D facilitates acid ceramidase degradation of ceramide to sphingosine and fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C14">14</xref>).</p><p>The structure of saposin C is restrained by three disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C15">15</xref>). Biophysical studies have shown that saposin C has membrane fusion properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C17">17</xref>). This fusion occurs by the formation of intervesicular saposin C dimers as a bridge between acidic phospholipid vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C18">18</xref>). This fusogenic property is thought to be involved in the maturation of multivesicular bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C19">19</xref>). Dissection of the saposin C peptide and <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies indicate regional localization of these multiple functions to specific regions of the protein, including neuritogenic activity and GCase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C20">20</xref>). The fusogenic and neuritogenic activities localize to the 40 amino acids of the N-terminal, whereas the COOH-half contains the GCase activation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C20">20</xref>). The former functions can be duplicated with the appropriate saposin C peptide fragments. In comparison, activation of GCase requires the COOH-half within a &#x02018;saposin&#x02019; structure with intact disulfide bonds. The N-terminal 35&#x02013;40 amino acid sequence is not critical to this GCase activation function, as the corresponding peptide sequence from saposin B can fulfill the overall requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C21">21</xref>).</p><p>Point mutations of human saposin C present as variants of Gaucher disease. A neuronopathic (type 3) variant phenotype was associated with a C385F mutation, whereas an apparent non-neuronopathic variant occurred in the presence of an L394P substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C22">22</xref>). The neuronopathic variant showed a progressive neurological deterioration and increased GC levels in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C9">9</xref>).</p><p>To facilitate dissection of the physiological roles of saposin C, a mouse containing a knock-in of a cysteine-to-proline substitution in saposin C was created. The resultant saposin C-deficient mice presented with slowly developing neurological impairment that correlated with mild GSL accumulation and CNS pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation and verification of saposin C-deficient mice</title><p>The codon for the fifth cysteine of saposin C was mutated (Cys&#x02192;Pro) in the targeting vector (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP531F1">1</xref>A) to destroy the disulfide bond that stabilizes the saposin C protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C4">4</xref>).

The primary manifestations in the saposin C&#x02212;/&#x02212; mouse were of neurodegeneration that was slow in onset and slow to progress. Within the CNS, the spinal cord and cerebellum were the primary organs involved and in particular showed axonal ballooning, neuronal loss and axonal deterioration, particularly in the spinal cord. In the cerebellum, granule cell loss was followed by Purkinje cell loss that progressed from lobules III to X, with resultant decreases in cerebellar size. Within the cerebellum, astrogliosis and some infiltration by CD68+ microglial cells indicated a significant pro-inflammatory reaction. Importantly, at both the light microscopic and the ultrastructural levels, the cerebral cortical neurons and hippocampal neurons were unchanged compared with saposin C+/&#x02212; littermates, yet hippocampal LTP in Schaefer collaterals was severely reduced. Biochemically, minor storage of GC and GS was present in the spinal cord, and some increases in LacCer and LacSph were present in the cerebellum, with minor changes in LacSph in the spinal cord. No histological storage was evident in visceral tissues, and the levels of GSL in the visceral tissues were normal. The deficiency of saposin C as well as the resultant histological and biochemical changes in the CNS and in the viscera, were accompanied by decreases in GCase activity and protein, thus verifying the effect of saposin C as a proteolytic protector for GCase within the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C7">7</xref>). These findings provide insight into the functions of saposin C independent of its function in the degradation of GC, and highlight potential previously unrecognized functions related to LacSph. Because of the ultrastructural inclusions evident in axons of the saposin C&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, the current findings indicate cellular effects on axonal transport and secondary retrograde neuronal degeneration. Interestingly, the previously observed increase in multivesicular body formation in prosaposin-deficient mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C25">25</xref>) was not seen in the isolated saposin C-deficient mice described here.</p><p>The data presented demonstrate that saposin C is a non-essential enhancer for GC degradation <italic>in vivo</italic> at the levels produced in these mice <italic>in vivo</italic>, i.e. GCase residual activity is present, whereas with an essential activator, a total deficiency of GCase function would exist. The total absence of GCase is incompatible with extra uterine survival in the mouse. However, saposin C optimizes the hydrolysis of GC by GCase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C12">12</xref>), and probably also of GS. Importantly, saposin C is a stabilizer of GCase in lysosomes, protecting it from proteolytic digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C7">7</xref>). When saposin C is absent in the presence of a detrimental mutation in GCase, the activity of GCase drops below a threshold level and enhances the accumulation of GC and GS in various tissues (Sun <italic>et al</italic>., in review). Thus, saposin C appears to be an optimizer of GCase activity: it interacts with GCase, whether mutant or WT, and protects these enzymes against proteolytic digestion by lysosomal proteases.</p><p>Although total deficiency did not lead to massive increases in GC or GS in all tissues, excluding the spinal cord, saposin C could facilitate the hydrolysis of other GSLs <italic>in vivo</italic>. Specifically, <italic>in vitro</italic> saposin C is involved in the metabolism of LacCer and ceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C26">26</xref>). Also, both saposin C and B enhance the degradation of LacCer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C10">10</xref>). The unchanged levels of LacCer in the saposin C deficient mice in the visceral tissues, cerebral cortex and spinal cord, were not unexpected since saposin B can compensate for the deficiency of saposin C. In addition, the normal levels of ceramide in the saposin C deficient mice indicate a compensatory effect of saposins D and C in the degradation of ceramide by acid ceramidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C28">28</xref>).</p><p>Of interest were the significant increases in LacCer and LacSph in the cerebellum of the saposin C deficient mice. Such accumulations, particularly of LacCer, were also found in prosaposin deficiency and in Niemann-Pick C mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C31">31</xref>). LacCer is a bioactive lipid that has been shown to participate in osteoclastogenesis, angiogenesis and neural inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C34">34</xref>). The biological activities of LacSph have not been well studied, but in analogy to other lysophinoglipids, GS and galactosylsphingosine, this lysolipid probably has significant toxicity to sensitive tissues, including neurons. Indeed, LacSph mobilizes calcium in isolated brain microsomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C35">35</xref>), suggesting its participation in a pathway that could lead to neuropathological consequences and neuronal inflammation. Similar to several other lysosomal storage diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C37">37</xref>), saposin C deficient mice showed sensitivity of Purkinje cells to the disease state. Why this should be true for Purkinje cells, and secondarily granule cells that show specific degeneration in particular lysosomal storage diseases and in the saposin C deficient mice, is unknown, but this sensitivity has now been observed in several models, including saposin D, Niemann-Pick C, Niemann-Pick A, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, neuronal ceroid lipofucinoses and lysosomal acid phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C41">41</xref>), indicating vulnerability of these cells to metabolic abnormalities including GSL.</p><p>In prosaposin-deficient mice and humans, fibroblasts and other tissues have been shown to have increased numbers of multivesicular bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C43">43</xref>). This has led to the suggestion that prosaposin and its function in GSL metabolism may be critical to the formation of multivesicular bodies, endosomes and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C44">44</xref>). However, in the CNS of the saposin C deficient mice no increase in multivesicular bodies was observed by EM studies. These studies were applied to both cortical neurons and the Purkinje cells. Consequently, multivesicular bodies formation does not appear to be a mechanism involved in pathologic degeneration in the cortex, cerebellum or spinal cord. Cell death caused by apoptosis was unlikely in these mice as suggested by negative TUNEL assay. However, saposin C may have additional functions in cellular metabolism beyond that for the degradation of GSLs, particularly GC, GS, LacCer and LacSph. As is evident in the spinal cord, retrograde axonal degeneration was present as evidenced by the large deposits in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This correlated with the presence of inclusion bodies within the axons and suggests a mechanism of retrograde degeneration caused by saposin C deficiency. The precise role in this transport process and potential release at synapses remains to be elucidated, but it seems to be fundamental to the pathological processes within the CNS.</p><p>The clinical and pathological phenotype presented in saposin C&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice was primarily related to neuronal dysfunction. Massive Purkinje cell death occurred in cerebellum. The spheroids that contained inclusion bodies were found in axons. These pathological defects correlated with the phenotype of ataxia and decreased coordination in saposin C&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. Axonal spheroids have been noted in several lysosomal storage diseases, including Niemann-Pick C, GM2 gangliosidoses, &#x003b1;-<italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosaminidase and &#x003b1;-mannosidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C48">48</xref>). Early findings on these lysosomal disease animal models suggest that the loss of Purkinje cells is secondary to axonal dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C48">48</xref>). The axonal dystrophy may affect anterograde or retrograde transport, which can cause axonal degeneration and cell death, as suggested in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C50">50</xref>). Deterioration of neuromotor function and impaired hippocampal LTP could be the result of such axonal dysfunction. Saposin C is a lysosomal protein, and lysosomes in the neuron are located in the soma. Further studies will be required to define how the deficiency of saposin C leads to axonal spheroids.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>Reagents from commercial sources: anti-fade/DAPI, methyl green, ABC Vectastain and alkaline phosphatase kit II (Black) (Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA), DIG Easy Hyb, anti-digoxigenin-AP, CDP-Star, positively charged nylon membranes and Lumi-film chemiluminescent detection film (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), Qiagen Quick-change II XL kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA), restriction enzymes (New England Labs, Beverly, MA), NuPAGE 4&#x02013;12% Bis&#x02013;Tris gel, NuPAGE MES SDS running buffer, AlexaFluor488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 4-methylumbelliferyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (4MUG, Sigma), M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent and BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and Hybond&#x02122;&#x02013;ECL&#x02122; nitrocellulose membrane and ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Construction of targeting vector and generation of saposin C&#x02212;/&#x02212;mice</title><p>Saposin C-deficient mice were created by knocking in a codon change to create the substitution cysteine-to-proline (C&#x02192;P) substitution in saposin C.

The membranes were blocked in 3% BSA for 1 h, followed by incubation overnight with the rabbit anti-mouse saposin D, C, A or B antibodies (1/500 in 0.15% milk and 1% BSA) to detect individual saposins and prosaposin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C28">28</xref>). Mouse anti &#x003b2;-actin monoclonal antibody (1/10 000 in 2% w/v dry milk) was applied to detect &#x003b2;-actin.

Because C&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice had normal levels of saposin A and galactosylceramidase, C&#x02212;/&#x02212; and WT mice should have the same levels of galactosylceramide. Consequently, the alterations of monohexosylceramide in the analyses reflect changes in GC. The GSL contents were normalized to phosphate content in the same sample after lipid extraction from tissue lysate. Three animals from each genotype were included in the analyses. Data were analyzed by Student's <italic>t</italic>-test using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Behavioral studies</title><p>The behavioral tests were conducted in the Animal Behavioral Collaborative Core at Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation.</p><sec id="s4h1"><title>Narrow bridges</title><p>Square beams (1 m) 25, 12 and 5 mm wide and round beams (1 m) with diameters of 28, 17 and 11 mm were used as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP531C57">57</xref>). The mice were trained by traversing the 12 mm beam for three consecutive days, four trials per day. Animals were considered to be trained when they crossed the 12 mm beam in &#x0003c;20 s. The test phase began on the fourth day. Each mouse in turn received two consecutive trials (up to 60 s/trial) on each square or round beam in a progression from widest to narrowest. Latency to traverse each beam and the number of times the hind foot slipped off the beam were recorded. A total of 26 saposin C&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice at 13 months and 17 WT male mice were tested as sex (male) and age-matched groups.

The circular runway was 105 cm in diameter with a 10 cm path width. Two quadrants of the ring were enclosed by black acrylic sidewalls and two quadrants were open; the latter had a 1 cm clear acrylic curb to prevent slipping off the edge. Overhead lights were turned off; a single dim halogen light source was used. Mice were placed in the enclosed quadrant and tested for 5 min. Test sessions were recorded and scored later for time in open area, head dip frequency and number of open area entries. A total of 26 saposin C&#x02212;/&#x02212; male mice at 13 months and 17 age-matched WT male mice were tested.

Stimulation and recording of resulting fEPSPs were from the Schaffer collateral pathway of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Slopes of EPSPs following high-frequency stimulation were recorded for 90 min. Brain slices were recorded in duplicate for each animal and the data were averaged per animal. Data were recorded using Performer 2.0 software (Alpha Med Sciences). Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with gene as a between subject factor and time as a within subject factor, the repeated measure were the fEPSP measurements following LTP induction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>FUNDING</title><p>We thank the Lipidomics Core, supported in part by <funding-source>NIH</funding-source><award-id>C06 PR018823</award-id>, at the Medical University of South Carolina.
