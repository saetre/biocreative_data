Aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway leads to cancer and degenerative diseases. &#x003b2;-catenin is a key signaling molecule that is frequently used as a direct monitor of Wnt pathway activation. This paper describes a multi-parametric method for quantitative analysis of cellular &#x003b2;-catenin protein levels in a rapid and high-throughput manner.

A consequence of this increase in cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin levels is the concomitant translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin to the nucleus where it interacts with transcriptional coactivators to initiate transcription of Wnt target genes. Since &#x003b2;-catenin is critical for relaying the Wnt signal, researchers frequently quantify total cellular levels of &#x003b2;-catenin to measure Wnt response or to detect perturbations of the pathway. The standard detection method relies on gel electrophoresis coupled with western blotting to quantify total endogenous protein. The limitations of this method are that it is low-throughput, requires large number of cells and contains inherent variability due to gel lane loading, thus hindering the rapid parallel analysis of multiple samples. Other methods for detecting &#x003b2;-catenin stabilization rely on the expression of &#x003b2;-catenin fused to genetically-encoded reporters such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003498-Kim1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003498-Naik1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, but these may result in artifacts due to &#x003b2;-catenin over expression. Cellular toxicity due to transfection is another frequently encountered problem.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>I developed a rapid, quantitative and high-throughput method for measuring Wnt-induced changes in endogenous &#x003b2;-catenin levels. The assay employs mouse L-cells because they are an established model system for studying Wnt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003498-Kishida1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. &#x003b2;-catenin in L-cells is predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm and is not present at cell junctions, allowing direct measurement of changes in Wnt-responsive cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin pools. After seeding in a 384-well plate at a density of 5000 cells/well for 24 h, cells were stimulated with purified Wnt3a ligand for 10 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The cells were then fixed and processed for staining with fluorophores in the infrared range to simultaneously detect &#x003b2;-catenin and nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003498-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). Anti-&#x003b2;-catenin antibody concentration was optimized for best signal to background ratio (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">methods</xref>), detected by secondary IR800 antibody (800 nm). DNA staining with DRAQ5 dye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003498-Smith1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> (700 nm) was used as a marker to normalize &#x003b2;-catenin signal for cell number, particularly important for monitoring a pathway known to affect proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003498-Yun1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Whole-cell fluorescent images of entire wells were acquired at low resolution at 700 nm (red) and 800 nm (green) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003498-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). L-cells stimulated with Wnt3a ligand exhibit 11-fold elevated levels of total &#x003b2;-catenin compared to non-stimulated cells without changes in the total DNA content as shown by an increase in the green signal, making the merged signal more yellow than red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003498-g001"><bold>Figure 1B, C</bold></xref>). The assay is highly reproducible with a standard deviation within 10&#x00025; of the mean of replicates (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4). Moreover, there is an excellent linear correlation (R<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.997) between the measured DNA fluorescence and the actual number of cells plated in each well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003498-g001"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>), thus allowing for sensitive monitoring of fluctuations in cell number under various treatment conditions. Because the assay is conducted in a 384-well plate format, it minimizes reagent usage and is readily scalable. For example, an entire dose response curve of Wnt3a in quadruplicate can be obtained in 6 h using one 384-well plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003498-g001"><bold>Figure 1E</bold></xref>).

In summary, this new method is versatile and can be readily adapted to a high-throughput format. It can also be utilized for assessing the cellular effects of inhibitors of GSK3&#x003b2; on &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation, or for screening compounds for Wnt pathway inhibition.</p><fig id="pone-0003498-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003498.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Monitoring cellular &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation in response to various stimuli.</title><p>(A) L-cells were treated with either Wnt3a (50 ng/ml), LiCl (50 mM) or MG132 (25 &#x000b5;M) for the indicated periods of time and processed for imaging as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">methods</xref>.

This shows that protein translation is absolutely required for Wnt-mediated accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin; it also suggests that in the early phase of Wnt3a activation, stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin originates from existing mRNA pools and is not translationally derived from newly transcribed mRNA.</p><fig id="pone-0003498-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003498.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Dependence of Wnt3a-driven accumulation of cellular &#x003b2;-catenin on new protein but not RNA synthesis.</title><p>L-cells were treated with Wnt3a (50 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of either cycloheximide (CHX, 100 &#x000b5;g/ml) or actinomycin D (ActD, 1 &#x000b5;M) and incubated for the indicated times (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0003498.g003"/></fig><p>Little is known about the experimental rate of accumulation of endogenous &#x003b2;-catenin upon Wnt activation in mammalian cells. To develop a better quantitative understanding of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway, I determined the initial rate of accumulation of cellular &#x003b2;&#x02013;catenin upon Wnt pathway activation and studied in detail its dependence on Wnt3a concentration in L-cells. A simplified kinetic model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003498-Lee2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway depicts that under basal conditions &#x003b2;-catenin is degraded due to a predominantly high rate of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003498-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>). The presence of Wnt3a inhibits phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin, thus stabilizing &#x003b2;-catenin and preventing its proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003498-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>). The model assumes that the intrinsic turnover rate of &#x003b2;-catenin through mechanisms other than phosphorylation and that are independent of Wnt is minimal. First, the effective Wnt3a concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) for half-maximal accumulation of intracellular &#x003b2;-catenin was calculated and shown to depend on the period of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003498-g004"><bold>Figure 4B, C</bold></xref>). For example, the EC<sub>50</sub> is &#x0223c;30 ng/ml for 4 h&#x02013;35 h and &#x0223c;50&#x02013;70 ng/ml for only 1 h&#x02013;2 h stimulation with Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003498-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>). These measurements define the sensitivity of the assay and establish optimal conditions for usage. Furthermore, &#x003b2;-catenin levels are upregulated within 30 mins after Wnt3a stimulation, exhibit a noticeable increase in intensity between 6&#x02013;8 h, and start to plateau after 10 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003498-g004"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref>). The rate of &#x003b2;&#x02013;catenin accumulation reflects its rate of cellular translation, which varies according to the concentration of Wnt3a presented to cells. At Wnt3a concentrations lower than &#x0223c;50 ng/ml, there is a linear correlation between initial rate and Wnt3a concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003498-g004"><bold>Figure 4E</bold></xref>); for example, the rate is 0.002 FI. h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 1.6 ng/ml Wnt3a and increases by 4-fold upon quadrupling the concentration of Wnt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003498-g004"><bold>Figure 4F</bold></xref>). However, at Wnt3a concentrations higher than &#x0223c;50 ng/ml, this linear relationship is lost as intracellular &#x003b2;-catenin starts to reach steady-state pools (see inflection and plateau in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003498-g004"><bold>Figure 4E, F</bold></xref>). In summary, the method reveals an unprecedented level of detail about the rate of accumulation of intracellular &#x003b2;-catenin, and is useful for deriving quantitative kinetic parameters about the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway that may serve as basis for future kinetic modeling of the pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003498-Lee2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

The described multi-parametric method is a rapid way to quantify levels of endogenous &#x003b2;-catenin and identify non-specific cytotoxic conditions that result in artifactual readouts. The assay is high-throughput and economical since it is conducted in a 384-well plate format and hence utilizes very small amounts of the expensive purified Wnt3a material. It also offers reproducibility and great speed compared to gel electrophoresis and western blotting. It can easily be used as a secondary screening assay to quickly assess whether pharmacologic inhibitors of Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling act upstream or downstream of &#x003b2;-catenin. For example, the Wnt inhibitor quercetin has no effect on Wnt-mediated &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation, indicating that it acts downstream of &#x003b2;-catenin. The limitation of the current method, however, is that it lacks spatial resolution and thus does not provide information on the cytoplasmic or nuclear localization of &#x003b2;-catenin nor its translocation behavior. Nevertheless, this assay is a quick diagnostic readout for (1) screening and validating the mechanism of action of modulators of &#x003b2;-catenin or GSK3&#x003b2;, and (2) quantifying the basal and Wnt-induced expression levels of &#x003b2;-catenin across different cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003498-Rubinfeld2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, this method offers temporal dynamic resolution and thus can be used to measure the kinetic rate of &#x003b2;-catenin translation as well as turnover and stabilization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Mouse fibroblast L-cells were obtained from ATCC, maintained as per the manufacturer's recommendations in growth medium (DMEM/10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum) in an incubator at 37&#x000b0;C and 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.
