Although motility is thought to be important throughout the trypanosome lifecycle, most studies of flagellum structure and function have been restricted to the procyclic lifecycle stage, and our knowledge of the bloodstream form flagellum is limited. We have previously shown that trypanin functions as part of a flagellar dynein regulatory system that transmits regulatory signals from the central pair apparatus and radial spokes to axonemal dyneins. Here we investigate the requirement for this dynein regulatory system in bloodstream form trypanosomes. We demonstrate that trypanin is localized to the flagellum of bloodstream form trypanosomes, in a pattern identical to that seen in procyclic cells. Surprisingly, trypanin RNA interference is lethal in the bloodstream form. These knockdown mutants fail to initiate cytokinesis, but undergo multiple rounds of organelle replication, accumulating multiple flagella, nuclei, kinetoplasts, mitochondria, and flagellum attachment zone structures. These findings suggest that normal flagellar beat is essential in bloodstream form trypanosomes and underscore the emerging concept that there is a dichotomy between trypanosome lifecycle stages with respect to factors that contribute to cell division and cell morphogenesis. This is the first time that a defined dynein regulatory complex has been shown to be essential in any organism and implicates the dynein regulatory complex and other enzymatic regulators of flagellar motility as candidate drug targets for the treatment of African sleeping sickness.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>African trypanosomes are protozoan parasites that cause African sleeping sickness, a fatal disease with devastating health and economic consequences. These parasites are indigenous to a 9 million-km<sup>2</sup> area of sub-Saharan Africa where 60 million people live at risk of infection every day. In addition to the tremendous human health burden posed by trypanosomes, their infection of wild and domestic animals presents a barrier to sustained economic development of vast regions of otherwise productive land. Current drugs used for treatment of sleeping sickness are antiquated, toxic, and often ineffective; thus, there is a dire need for the development of innovative approaches for therapeutic intervention. Trypanosomes are highly motile and this motility requires coordinated regulation of axonemal dynein, a molecular motor that drives beating of the parasite's flagellum. In the present work, the authors demonstrate that the protein trypanin, which is part of a signaling system that regulates the flagellar dynein motor, is essential in bloodstream stage African trypanosomes. This surprising finding raises the possibility that numerous enzymes and regulatory proteins that are necessary for flagellar motility may represent novel targets for chemotherapeutic intervention in African sleeping sickness.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Ralston KS, Hill KL (2006) Trypanin, a component of the flagellar dynein regulatory complex, is essential in bloodstream form African trypanosomes.

However, most of the work on flagellum structure-function in <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. brucei</named-content> has been conducted on the procyclic lifecycle stage and much less is known in the bloodstream stage. Moreover, almost all of the work conducted to date has focused on structural components of the axoneme and PFR, with very little known about enzymatic and regulatory activities that drive flagellar beat. One regulatory component is trypanin, a 54-kDa coiled-coil protein that is highly conserved among organisms with motile flagella &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. In procyclic cells, trypanin is localized along the length of the flagellum and functions as part of a flagellar dynein regulatory complex (DRC) that regulates axonemal dynein in response to signals from the central pair apparatus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. The human trypanin homologue binds microtubules directly and thus may link the DRC to the axoneme (K. Hill and R. Crosbie, unpublished data). Trypanin RNAi knockdown in procyclic <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. brucei</named-content> results in misregulation of flagellar beat and loss of directional cell motility, although these mutants remain viable &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Here we investigate the requirement of this flagellar dynein regulatory system in bloodstream form trypanosomes. We demonstrate that trypanin is localized to the flagellum of bloodstream form trypanosomes with a pattern that is indistinguishable from that seen in procyclic cells. Surprisingly, RNAi knockdown of trypanin in bloodstream cells is lethal. Trypanin-deficient mutants fail to initiate cytokinesis, but continue through multiple rounds of mitosis and kinetoplast replication, ultimately accumulating as large, amorphous cellular masses with multiple nuclei, kinetoplasts, flagella, and FAZ structures. These results implicate the DRC and other regulators of flagellar beat as candidate drug targets in trypanosomes and emphasize the dichotomy between factors that contribute to cell division and cell morphogenesis in different lifecycle stages of these pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trypanin Is Essential in Bloodstream Form African Trypanosomes</title><p>We previously reported that trypanin represents a broadly conserved protein family that is represented in several divergent eukaryotes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. We conducted a more thorough phylogenetic analysis of trypanin homologues using currently available genome databases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g001">Figure 1</xref>). A common feature of all organisms having trypanin homologues is that these organisms are capable of synthesizing motile flagella. Trypanin homologues were not identified in the genomes of organisms that lack flagella, e.g. fungi, slime molds and vascular plants. We also did not find any trypanin-homologous sequences in the genomes of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> or <italic>C. briggsae,</italic> which only have immotile sensory cilia.

The finding that trypanin is present in organisms as diverse as <named-content content-type="genus-species">Giardia lamblia</named-content> and humans suggests that the DRC originated very early in eukaryotic evolution.</p><p>In procyclic cells, trypanin is localized along the length of the flagellum and functions as part of a dynein regulatory system that regulates flagellar beat in response to signals from the radial spokes and central pair apparatus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Immunofluorescence of bloodstream form cells demonstrated that trypanin exhibits a punctate distribution along the length of the flagellum that is indistinguishable from that seen in procyclic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g002">2</xref>B). Likewise, biochemical fractionation demonstrates that trypanin fractionates quantitatively with the flagellar cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), as shown previously for procyclic-form cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. The flagellum of bloodstream form cells prepared for immunofluorescence was always detached from the cell body. Indeed, simply removing cellular membranes with non-ionic detergent caused flagellum detachment in bloodstream form cells, while the flagellum of procyclic cells remained firmly connected to the cell body under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g002">2</xref>E). The flagellum did not become detached when cells were first tethered to poly-L-lysine-coated slides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g002">Figure 2</xref>F).</p><p>To generate bloodstream form trypanin knockdowns, bloodstream form parasites were stably transfected with a Tet-inducible RNAi plasmid containing one of three different trypanin DNA fragments, trypanin (TPN)-A, B, or C, and clonal cell lines were obtained (Materials and Methods). For clarity, these cell lines are referred to as bloodstream form (BSF)-TPN-A, B, or C, respectively. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that trypanin mRNA was knocked down within 8 h of tetracycline-induced expression of the dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Knockdown was most effective using the largest trypanin fragment, TPN-C. We observed a doublet corresponding to trypanin mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, closed arrowheads) and both bands were equally knocked down. Western blots demonstrated that steady-state trypanin protein levels were reduced approximately 4&#x02013;8 fold following RNAi with TPN-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p><p>In procyclic parasites, trypanin knockdown results in loss of directional cell motility, but these mutants remain viable even though trypanin protein is undetectable by Western blot analysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Surprisingly, all three bloodstream form trypanin knockdown mutants exhibited a severe growth defect. In BSF-TPN-B, this was evident approximately 24 h after the addition of tetracycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), and by five days post-induction these mutants were not viable. Progression to a lethal phenotype was more rapid in BSF-TPN-C cells and was slowest in BSF-TPN-A cells (unpublished data). Thus, trypanin is essential in the bloodstream lifecycle stage and kinetics of progression to the lethal phenotype correlate with the degree of knockdown.</p><p>Close analysis of bloodstream form trypanin knockdown mutants revealed a failure in cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g005">5</xref>). Within 48 h of Tet-induction, clusters of three or more physically attached cells began to appear. Early during the induction, most clusters consisted of three to four cells joined together exclusively at their extreme posterior ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g004">4</xref>C). Cytokinesis in <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. brucei</named-content> initiates between the tips of the old and new flagella at the anterior end of the cell &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. The cleavage furrow then advances along a line between the two flagella until daughter cells are connected just at their posterior ends, with their flagella pointing in opposite directions. This process is best characterized in procyclic cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; and the general events are considered to be similar in bloodstream form cells, with the exception that positioning of the kinetoplast, basal body, and nuclei relative to one another differ between lifecycle stages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, it seemed that two cells had nearly completed cytokinesis, but remained attached at their posterior, underwent another round of division and again failed to separate. At later time points, clusters were progressively larger and the extent of contact was greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g004">Figure 4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g004">4</xref>E). When viewed live under phase-contrast microscopy, individual cell bodies were readily identifiable, but were completely attached to one another along their entire length and appeared to be surrounded by a contiguous membrane. The subpellicular cytoskeleton in <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. brucei</named-content> dictates cell shape and consists of a corset of parallel microtubules that subtend the plasma membrane. This entire structure is normally replicated during each round of cell division. Thus, it appeared as though these cells had replicated their subpellicular cytoskeletons, but had failed to initiate cytokinesis. Ultimately, cells in the culture progressed into large, multi-flagellated masses that were amorphous on one face and multi-flagellated on the other face. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrates that the cytoplasm and cell membrane are contiguous in cells with multiple flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g005">Figure 5</xref>), demonstrating that they have failed in cytokinesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Trypanin Mutants Proceed through Multiple Rounds of Organelle Replication</title><p>Recent work has demonstrated that trypanosomes possess novel cell cycle checkpoints and suggests that replication and segregation of the flagellum, FAZ, kDNA, and nuclear DNA are pivotal events in cell cycle progression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b026">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;.

The order of events for organelle replication during the cell division cycle in <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. brucei</named-content> has been described in detail &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; and is briefly summarized here. At the start of the cell cycle, G1 cells contain a single kinetoplast, flagellum, FAZ, and nucleus. The first event observed is maturation of the pro-basal body, which nucleates a new flagellum that emerges from the flagellar pocket posterior to the existing flagellum. The kinetoplast is subsequently replicated and divides, with the new kinetoplast moving posterior to the old kinetoplast while the new flagellum extends toward the anterior end of the cell, parallel to the existing flagellum. A FAZ subtends each flagellum along its length. Following kinetoplast division and flagellum elongation, mitosis ensues to yield a single cell with two copies each of the kinetoplast, flagellum, FAZ, and nucleus. At this point, cytokinesis initiates between the tips of the flagella at the anterior end of the cell. The cleavage furrow progresses unidirectionally from anterior to posterior to yield two daughter cells, each having a single kinetoplast, flagellum, FAZ, and nucleus.</p><p>Immunofluorescence with antibodies against the FAZ revealed that trypanin knockdown mutants contained up to six distinguishable, parallel FAZ structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) possess only one FAZ or, during cell division, two that extend in parallel from adjacent to the kinetoplast toward the anterior tip of the cell. The multiple FAZ structures in the mutants appear to be placed correctly and extend in parallel to the anterior end of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g006">Figure 6</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g006">6</xref>F). Thus, formation and extension of the FAZ, although critical for positioning of the site of cell cleavage in procyclic culture form (PCF) parasites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, is not sufficient to allow cytokinesis in bloodstream form cells. Similarly, flagellum replication is unaffected by loss of trypanin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Knockdown mutants frequently contained six distinguishable flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g007">Figure 7</xref>C), and in some cases as many as 13 were visible (unpublished data). Wild-type cells contain only one flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g002">Figures 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g007">7</xref>A) or two flagella during cell division &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. To determine whether placement of the flagellum is normal in trypanin knockdown mutants, cells were first adhered to poly-L-lysine-coated slides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g002">Figure 2</xref>F), allowing us to maintain flagellum attachment during immunofluorescence. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g008">Figure 8</xref>, the flagellum extended parallel to the FAZ along the cell body in knockdown and uninduced cells. The flagellum was also properly positioned adjacent to the FAZ when whole cells were examined by transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g008">Figure 8</xref>D, E) and was placed normally in phase-contrast images of live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, the flagella of trypanin knockdown mutants were positioned correctly along the FAZ.</p><p>We used 4&#x02032;,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining to monitor replication of the nucleus and kinetoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g007">7</xref>). Although wild-type cells contain one nucleus and one kinetoplast, or up to two nuclei and two kinetoplasts during cell division &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, trypanin mutants frequently contained multiple nuclei and kinetoplasts or a single diffuse nucleus with several kinetoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g007">7</xref>). In almost all cases, kinetoplasts were well-resolved from one another and initiated assembly of a new flagellum, indicating that kinetoplast segregation and basal body function were normal. Blocking mitosis in bloodstream form trypanosomes prevents cytokinesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. We were therefore particularly interested in determining whether the block in cytokinesis in trypanin knockdown mutants correlated with mitotic failure. In some cases, mitosis appeared to have failed, as indicated by the presence of more than two flagella and a single diffuse nucleus (arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g006">Figure 6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g006">6</xref>E). However, there were also several examples of cells having more than two flagella and two or more nuclei (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g007">7</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g007">7</xref>D), indicating that they had undergone at least one round of mitosis without cytokinesis and then continued through another round of flagellum replication.

Therefore, our results suggest that regulation of flagellar beat is essential in bloodstream form African trypanosomes.</p><p>We cannot rule out the formal possibility that trypanin has another, as yet unknown, role in the cell and that loss of viability is due to something other than trypanin's role in beat regulation.

It is possible that the cell senses fidelity of the flagellar apparatus and that reduction in trypanin protein levels, rather than a motility defect per se, is lethal. However, since loss of trypanin does not cause gross changes in axoneme ultrastructure in bloodstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020101-g008">8</xref>) or procyclic &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; cells, we consider this possibility less likely.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first time that a defined dynein regulatory complex has been demonstrated to be essential in any organism.

We further show that the cell division defect in bloodstream form cells is not due to abnormal replication of the FAZ, which serves as an important structural guide for cleavage furrow formation in procyclic cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.

Hence an essential role for flagellar beat, which requires numerous enzymatic and regulatory activities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, would greatly extend the potential of the flagellum as a drug target. In agreement with this idea, during preparation of this manuscript, Gull and co-workers also reported an essential role for flagellar proteins identified in a <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. brucei</named-content> extracted axonemal proteome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. A critical next step in exploiting these findings for potential development of novel chemotherapeutic strategies will be isolation of key enzymes necessary for flagellar motility, accompanied by structural studies to facilitate drug discovery.

In procyclic cells, it appears that cytokinesis failure reflects, at least in part, a direct requirement for flagellar beat during cell cleavage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. However, as noted below, the end-stage phenotypes of procyclic mutants and bloodstream mutants differ significantly. Abnormal flagellar beat might also disrupt replication or positioning of the flagellum, FAZ or kinetoplast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, all of which are important for cytokinesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. We find that these organelles are clearly replicated in bloodstream form trypanin knockdown mutants and appear to occupy their normal cellular positions. Likewise, these mutants often contain multiple nuclei, indicating that they can complete multiple rounds of mitosis. Therefore, the cytokinesis defect is not simply the indirect consequence of failed organelle replication or positioning.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that active flagellar beating is required for cell division in procyclic-form trypanosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; and our current results extend this finding to bloodstream form parasites. However, there are two important differences between these lifecycle stages. First, the requirement for flagellar beat appears to be more stringent in bloodstream form trypanosomes, since trypanin knockdown is lethal in the bloodstream form, whereas procyclic trypanin knockdown mutants are viable and capable of cell separation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The simplest interpretation of this result is that although severe flagellar beat defects impair division in procyclic cells, abnormal beat regulation is tolerated, whereas even modest perturbation of flagellar beat is lethal in bloodstream form parasites. A second notable difference is that procyclic motility mutants fail during the progression and/or completion of cell cleavage, accumulating as clusters of cells attached at their posterior tips &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, bloodstream form trypanin mutants ultimately fail at a much earlier stage of cell division. Analysis of kinetics of phenotype progression in bloodstream form trypanin mutants revealed that failure to initiate cytokinesis is preceded by a failure at the late-stages of cell separation. However, these mutants ultimately fail to initiate cytokinesis and accumulate as amorphous masses with multiple nuclei, kinetoplasts and flagella. These results emphasize the dichotomy between lifecycle stages with respect to factors that contribute to cell division and cell morphogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that there are differences in cell cycle regulation in procyclic versus bloodstream form trypanosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, and our work demonstrates that these differences extend to physical aspects of cell division. Whether there is a connection between flagellar beat and signaling events that control cell cycle progression remains to be determined, though the recent report of a polo-like kinase localized at or near the flagellum attachment zone &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d; make this a tantalizing speculation. The <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. brucei</named-content> flagellum is connected along its length to the cell body, such that flagellar movements are transmitted directly to the plasma membrane. Hence, flagellar beating and the concomitant forces exerted on the plasma membrane and cell body might be necessary to facilitate membrane and cytoskeletal rearrangements that accompany replication and separation of subpellicular microtubules. Clearly, many more exciting discoveries can be expected from continued efforts to ascertain the exact nature of the connection between flagellar beat and cell division in these deadly pathogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture and transfection.</title><p>BSF-SM cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d; and procyclic 29&#x02013;13 cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020101-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, which stably express T7 polymerase and Tet repressor, were used for all experiments.
