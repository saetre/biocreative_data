Distinct dominantly inherited mutations in Cx31 cause the skin disease erythrokeratoderma variabilis (EKV) and hearing loss with or without neuropathy. Functional studies reveal tissue-specific effects of these Cx31 disease-associated mutations. The Cx31 mutants (R42P)Cx31, (C86S)Cx31 and (G12D)Cx31 are associated with EKV and the mutant (66delD)Cx31 with peripheral neuropathy and hearing loss, however the mechanisms of pathogenesis remain to be elucidated. Expression of (R42P)Cx31, (C86S)Cx31 and (G12D)Cx31 <italic>in vitro</italic>, but not (WT)Cx31 or (66delD)Cx31, cause elevated levels of cell-type specific cell death. Previous studies suggest that Cx-associated cell death may be related to abnormal &#x02018;leaky&#x02019; hemichannels but we produced direct evidence against that being the major mechanism. Additionally, our immunocytochemistry showed upregulation of components of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in cells expressing the EKV-associated Cx31 mutants but not (WT)Cx31 or (66delD)Cx31. We conclude that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leading to the UPR is the main mechanism of mutant Cx31-associated cell death. These results indicate that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, ER stress may lead to abnormal keratinocyte differentiation and hyperproliferation in EKV patient skin.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Connexins (Cxs) are the major constituents of gap junctions, aqueous pores that connect the cytoplasms of two cells and allow the transfer of ions and small molecules (&#x0003c;1 kDa) between them. Six Cx proteins assemble to form a connexon/hemichannel, which can traffic to the plasma membrane and dock with a hemichannel from an adjacent cell to form an intercellular channel. Hemichannels may also have functional roles at the plasma membrane including paracrine signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C3">3</xref>) and the propagation of calcium waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C4">4</xref>). The importance of gap junction-associated cell communication is indicated by the association of mutations in Cx genes with a range of inherited human disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C7">7</xref>), mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C8">8</xref>) and expression and/or localization changes in various disease processes including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C9">9</xref>).</p><p>The epidermis of skin is predominantly composed of keratinocytes which undergo differentiation, ultimately leading to the formation of the stratum corneum to produce the skin barrier. Cx31 is highly expressed in the stratum granulosum in the upper differentiating layer of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C11">11</xref>) and is also found in peripheral nerves and the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C12">12</xref>). Germline mutations in the <italic>GJB3</italic> gene encoding Cx31 are associated with deafness, neuropathy and skin disease, indicating that Cx31 has a role in both epidermal differentiation plus auditory and neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C13">13</xref>). Multiple autosomal dominant [including (R42P)Cx31, (C86S)Cx31 and (G12D)Cx31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C15">15</xref>)] and recessive [(L34P)Cx31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C16">16</xref>)] Cx31 mutations are associated with the skin disease erythrokeratoderma variabilis (EKV), a disorder characterized by hyperkeratotic plaques with fixed and transient erythematous patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C17">17</xref>). A dominant neuropathy mutation, (66delD)Cx31, has also been identified in a family with sensorineural hearing loss and peripheral neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C12">12</xref>) and other mutations in Cx31 are associated with non-syndromic hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C20">20</xref>).</p><p>Previous investigations involving microscopy of EGFP-tagged Cxs expressed <italic>in vitro</italic> have shown that the EKV mutants and the neuropathy mutant have impaired trafficking to the plasma membrane with a predominantly cytoplasmic localization in contrast to the wild-type which forms aggregates at the plasma membrane and gap junction-like plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C21">21</xref>). Unlike wild-type or (66delD)Cx31, the expression of the EKV mutants are associated with elevated levels of <italic>in vitro</italic> cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C23">23</xref>) through a mechanism which remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Basal activity of Cx hemichannels is low, with the majority remaining closed most of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C24">24</xref>), but opening may be induced by stimuli including low extracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C26">26</xref>). Open hemichannels can release molecules such as ATP, glutamate and NAD+ and lead to uptake of others (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C1">1</xref>). Decreased cell viability caused by the expression of some Cx26 and Cx30 disease-associated mutants has been attributed to the presence of hemichannels at the plasma membrane which are &#x02018;leaky&#x02019; when cells are incubated in physiological levels of extracellular calcium, with rescue of the phenotype occurring under high levels of calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C28">28</xref>). It is suggested that this abnormal hemichannel activity can contribute to the disease phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C29">29</xref>). In contrast, data from another study investigating Cx26 skin and deafness mutants suggest that aberrant hemichannels are not the major mechanism of cell death for these mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C30">30</xref>).</p><p>In this investigation, high levels of cell death were still observed with (R42P)Cx31, (C86S)Cx31 and (G12D)Cx31 when incubated in high extracellular calcium, indicating that hemichannel-mediated cell death is not the major mechanism for these mutants. We describe a novel association of the expression of EKV-associated mutants with upregulation of components of the unfolded protein response (UPR) <italic>in vitro</italic>. Factors that induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in cells can lead to the UPR, a cellular process which can induce signalling pathways to cope with stresses, or if this fails, to induce cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C31">31</xref>). Though the precise molecular mechanism of action of the EKV-associated dominant Cx31 mutations still remains to be elucidated, our data indicate that these mutants induce ER stress, suggesting for the first time the major mechanism of the cell death phenotype of Cx31 skin disease mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cx31 mutants show defective trafficking and are located on cytoplasmic membranous structures</title><p>(WT)Cx31-EGFP and the mutants (R42P)Cx31-EGFP, (C86S)Cx31-EGFP and (66delD)Cx31-EGFP [and (G12D)Cx31-EGFP, data not shown] were expressed in HeLa, NTERT and SH-SY5Y cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP436F1">1</xref>). The localization of each specific mutant was comparable in all three cell types. Microscopy confirmed that (WT)Cx31-EGFP traffics to the cell surface membrane forming bright aggregates between cells, indicative of gap junction plaques. In contrast, the four mutants that were tested appear to mistraffic and have a cytoplasmic distribution. Cells expressing each of the mutants lack the gap junction-like aggregates between cells that are found with the wild-type. (G12D)Cx31-EGFP showed a similar behaviour (data not shown). These data are in agreement with the previous investigations performed in HeLa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C23">23</xref>) and fibroblast and keratinocyte cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C21">21</xref>).</p><fig id="DDP436F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Distinct subcellular localization patterns are observed upon expression of WT, skin disease- and neuropathy-causing Cx31 in HeLa, NTERT and SH-SY5Y cells.

These aggregates are not observed upon overexpression of any mutant, consistent with their inability to traffic properly to the plasma membrane. Cells expressing either of the skin disease mutants (R42P)Cx31-EGFP (B) or (C86S)Cx31-EGFP (C) display larger brighter aggregates than cells expressing the neuropathy mutant (66delD)Cx31-EGFP (D), which show protein residing on smaller diffuse punctate structures (distinct from the diffuse non-punctate EGFP localization (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp436/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>).

This diffuse punctate localization is distinct from the more homogenous undefined diffuse pattern of EGFP alone (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp436/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>), consistent with a soluble cytosolic protein, suggesting each of the Cx31 mutant proteins reside on cytoplasmic membranous structures.</p><p>Additionally, non-EGFP tagged constructs were used to confirm that the differences in trafficking of the different Cx31 proteins was not due to the presence of the EGFP tag (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp436/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>).</p><p>To confirm that the majority of the mutant protein does not form gap junction plaques, sequential detergent-based subcellular fractionation of cell lysates was performed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP436F2">2</xref>). This involved solubilizing crude cell lysate in saponin followed by Triton X-100 then SDS to assess each protein's detergent solubility. The Triton-insoluble pool of wild-type Cx31 (indicative of gap junction plaques) was greatly reduced for (66delD)Cx31-EGFP protein, which was present mainly in the Triton-soluble fraction. The absence of saponin-soluble (cytosolic) Cx protein indicates that all Cx proteins tested are present on membranous structures. Identical fractionation of cells expressing skin disease mutants was also performed; however, the low transfection efficiency of these mutants prevented conclusive results from being obtained (data not shown). Additionally, a microscopical approach was used to confirm these results by visualizing any remaining EGFP fluorescence after washing out soluble protein in saponin and/or Triton X-100. This supported (C86S)Cx31-EGFP also being on membranous structures like the other Cx31 proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp436/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3</ext-link>).</p><fig id="DDP436F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2.</label><caption><p>The Cx31 mutant 66delD is saponin-insoluble and Triton-soluble, indicating membranous localization.

The presence of (66delD)Cx31-EGFP protein solely in the Triton-soluble fraction indicates that the protein is mainly present on membranous structures. The additional presence of a Triton-insoluble pool of (WT)Cx31-EGFP (present in the SDS-soluble fraction) is indicative of gap junction aggregates.

To investigate if aberrant hemichannels lead to the EKV mutant-induced cell death phenotype, transfected cells were maintained in physiological or high calcium and cell death was quantified by FACS analysis of PI uptake (dead cells are permeable to PI).

In addition, time-lapse imaging of NEB1 keratinocyte cells microinjected with (G12D)Cx31-EGFP and incubated with the calcium-sensitive indicator dye Calcium Orange showed that loss of intracellular calcium occurred only after cell death, indicated by vesicle movement ceasing, rather than a continuous leaking that would be expected if abnormal hemichannels were responsible for cell death (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP436F4">4</xref>).

To determine whether the expression of EKV-associated mutants affect other components of the UPR as well as BiP/GRP78, immunocytochemistry was performed which showed that ATF6 and the transcription factor CHOP/GAAD153 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP436F8">8</xref>) as well as XBP1 (data not shown) were upregulated in HeLa cells expressing the EKV-associated mutant (C86S)Cx31-EGFP but not (WT)Cx31-EGFP.

Our data confirm and extend this observation. Confocal microscopy in three different cell lines revealed that the skin disease mutants are characterized by bright cytoplasmic aggregates (&#x0003e;3 &#x000b5;m in diameter) and the neuropathy mutant by smaller punctate structures (&#x0003c;2 &#x000b5;m in diameter), whereas subcellular fractionation demonstrates that both classes are membrane bound. This led us to hypothesise that this difference in intracellular localization could give an indication as to why the two classes of mutants cause different diseases and <italic>in vitro</italic> cell phenotypes.</p><p>The G12S and E208K Cx32 mutants, both linked to X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX), have been found to colocalize with the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C32">32</xref>) and the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C33">33</xref>), respectively.

In addition, we observed an upregulation of proteasome markers as well as proteins containing the ER resident motif KDEL and the ER chaperone BiP/GRP78.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Aberrant hemichannels are not the main mechanism of EKV-associated mutant cell death</title><p>ATP has been hypothesised as a paracrine signalling molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C3">3</xref>).

The cell death phenotype linked to the expression of hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia Cx30 mutants, G11R and A88V, has been attributed to aberrant hemichannel activity at the plasma membrane of oocytes maintained in low levels of extracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C3">3</xref>). A similar mechanism has been attributed to expression of keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome-associated Cx26 mutants G45E and D50N in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C28">28</xref>). Cell death could be rescued by raising the levels of extracellular calcium to close any hemichannels at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C28">28</xref>). However, another study could not reproduce these findings with (D50N)Cx26-EGFP expression in human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C30">30</xref>), suggesting that other mechanisms may account for a proportion of the observed <italic>in vitro</italic> human cell death attributable to some Cx mutants.</p><p>Quantification of cell death in HeLa cells expressing (R42P)Cx31-EGFP, (C86S)Cx31-EGFP and (G12D)Cx31-EGFP showed that although there was generally some reduction when the calcium levels were raised, levels of cell death still remained high. Time-lapse imaging of keratinocytes microinjected with (G12D)Cx31-EGFP and an indicator dye, Calcium Orange, showed that loss of intracellular calcium occurred only after cell death, indicated by vesicle movement ceasing, rather than a continuous leaking that would be expected if abnormal hemichannels were responsible for cell death. Although we do not exclude the possibility that some hemichannels reach the plasma membrane and exhibit aberrant activity, these data indicate that hemichannel-mediated cell death is not the main mechanism underlying the <italic>in vitro</italic> cell death phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Overexpression of the EKV mutants <italic>in vitro</italic> leads to upregulation of components of the UPR</title><p>The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER can induce ER stress leading to activation of the UPR pathway, a process which has been linked to the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders including heart disease, neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and cancer (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C31">31</xref>). ER stresses including disrupted redox regulation, glucose deprivation, viral infection, inclusion body diseases and high fat diet can lead to the induction of the UPR, with the objective of restoring normal ER function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C31">31</xref>). In mammals, the ER chaperone BiP/GRP78 is bound to inositol-requiring kinase (IRE1&#x003b1;), PERK (PRKR-like ER kinase) and ATF6 (activating transcription factor), however when unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, these transmembrane ER proteins are activated, signalling through pathways which can lead to the reduction of protein translation and increased the expression of ER chaperone proteins. If these mechanisms fail to control the stress, pathways leading to cell death are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C31">31</xref>). The UPR has been shown to be activated during normal epidermal keratinocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C37">37</xref>), thus deregulated UPR activity may lead to keratinocyte hyperproliferation.</p><p>In this study, we have shown that the <italic>in vitro</italic> expression of (R42P)Cx31-EGFP and (C86S)Cx31-EGFP but not wild-type nor (66delD)Cx31-EGFP was found to correlate with upregulation of the ER resident chaperone BiP/GRP78 and other components of the UPR including ATF6, XBP1 and CHOP/GAAD153.

There is one report of a recessive Cx mutant that did not appear to cause the nuclear translocation of CHOP/GAAD153 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C38">38</xref>), but our study shows that dominant Cx31 mutations associated with increased cell death do upregulate this protein.</p><p>It has been hypothesised that Cx mutants lead to pathogenesis by causing defective gap junction formation/regulation, by disrupting other Cxs in the cell, forming aberrant hemichannels or having an abnormal conformational structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP436C39">39</xref>).
