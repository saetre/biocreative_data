Nuclear accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin is the hallmark of active Wnt signaling and is frequently observed in human cancers. Although &#x003b2;-catenin shuttles in and out of the nucleus, the molecular mechanisms underlying its translocation remain poorly understood. Chibby (Cby) is an evolutionarily conserved molecule that inhibits &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;mediated transcriptional activation. Here, we identified 14-3-3&#x003b5; and 14-3-3&#x003b6; as Cby-binding partners using affinity purification/mass spectrometry. 14-3-3 proteins specifically recognize serine 20 within the 14-3-3&#x02013;binding motif of Cby when phosphorylated by Akt kinase. Notably, 14-3-3 binding results in sequestration of Cby into the cytoplasm. Moreover, Cby and 14-3-3 form a stable tripartite complex with &#x003b2;-catenin, causing &#x003b2;-catenin to partition into the cytoplasm. Our results therefore suggest a novel paradigm through which Cby acts in concert with 14-3-3 proteins to facilitate nuclear export of &#x003b2;-catenin, thereby antagonizing &#x003b2;-catenin signaling.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; Cby, Chibby; CRM-1, chromosome region maintenance protein 1; DN-14-3-3, dominant-negative 14-3-3; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; hRluc, synthetic Renilla luciferase; KD, kinase-dead; Lef, lymphoid enhancer factor; MBP, maltose-binding protein; NES, nuclear export signal; OA, okadaic acid; rPP2A, recombinant protein phosphatase 2A; Tcf, T cell factor; WT, wild-type.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>&#x003b2;-Catenin (armadillo in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) is a multifunctional protein that participates in several cellular processes, including cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and the canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takemaru, 2006</xref>). At the plasma membrane, &#x003b2;-catenin binds to type I cadherins to mediate actin filament assembly via &#x003b1;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nelson and Nusse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gates and Peifer, 2005</xref>). The remaining cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin is continuously degraded by the action of the so-called &#x0201c;destruction complex&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimelman and Xu, 2006</xref>). In this complex, the tumor suppressors Axin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) function as scaffold proteins that facilitate sequential phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin at the N terminus by casein kinase I&#x003b1; and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2002</xref>). Phosphorylated &#x003b2;-catenin is then recognized by the E3 ubiquitin ligase receptor &#x003b2;TrCP and targeted for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Binding of a Wnt ligand to cell surface receptors, Frizzled, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 ultimately leads to inactivation of the &#x003b2;-catenin destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cadigan and Liu, 2006</xref>). As a consequence, &#x003b2;-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm, translocates into the nucleus, and interacts with members of the DNA-binding T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (Tcf/Lef) family to activate Wnt target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stadeli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Willert and Jones, 2006</xref>). Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling plays key roles during embryonic development and in maintenance of organs and tissues in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadigan and Nusse, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pinto and Clevers, 2005</xref>). Moreover, perturbations of this signaling cascade have been linked to a range of human diseases, especially cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clevers, 2006</xref>). For instance, &#x003b2;-catenin signaling is aberrantly activated in &#x0003e;70% of colorectal cancers and to a lesser extent in other tumor types, promoting cancer cell proliferation, survival, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Polakis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lustig and Behrens, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Although it is well established that &#x003b2;-catenin can enter and exit the nucleus, the precise molecular mechanisms still remain largely unclear. It contains neither NLS nor nuclear export signal (NES) sequences. &#x003b2;-Catenin appears to be imported into the nucleus in an importin/karyopherin-independent fashion potentially by directly interacting with nuclear pore components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fagotto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yokoya et al., 1999</xref>). Conversely, APC has been shown to harbor functional NES sequences and facilitate nuclear export of &#x003b2;-catenin by the classical chromosome region maintenance protein 1 (CRM-1)&#x02013;dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henderson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosin-Arbesfeld et al., 2000</xref>). However, subsequent studies challenged this view by demonstrating that &#x003b2;-catenin can exit from the nucleus independent of APC and CRM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eleftheriou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wiechens and Fagotto, 2001</xref>). More recently, Axin was identified as a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling factor that enhances cytoplasmic localization of &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cong and Varmus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wiechens et al., 2004</xref>). Clearly, these findings suggest the existence of multiple mechanisms that fine-tune nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin levels. Intracellular distribution of &#x003b2;-catenin may also be regulated by cytoplasmic and nuclear retention through interaction with its binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tolwinski and Wieschaus, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Townsley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krieghoff et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We previously reported a &#x003b2;-catenin antagonist Chibby (Cby; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takemaru et al., 2003</xref>). Cby is a 14.5-kD protein evolutionarily conserved from fly to human. We demonstrated that Cby physically interacts with &#x003b2;-catenin in a manner that competes with Tcf/Lef factors, and thus represses &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;mediated gene activation. Reduction of Cby levels in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos by RNAi results in hyperactivation of this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takemaru et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tolwinski and Wieschaus, 2004</xref>), which highlights the biological importance of Cby's function. Recently, we found that Cby promotes adipocyte and cardiomyocyte differentiation of pluripotent stem cells through inhibition of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singh et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To further elucidate the molecular and cellular functions of Cby, we set out to isolate Cby-binding partners. Here, we detail the isolation of 14-3-3 proteins as novel Cby interactors. We show that 14-3-3 proteins interact with Cby upon phosphorylation of serine 20 by Akt kinase. Notably, direct docking of 14-3-3 induces cytoplasmic sequestration of Cby protein. An alanine substitution for serine 20 in Cby eliminates binding to 14-3-3 and partially compromises Cby's ability to inhibit &#x003b2;-catenin signaling. We also demonstrate that Cby and 14-3-3 form a trimolecular complex with &#x003b2;-catenin in tissue culture cells. Intriguingly, Cby and 14-3-3 collaborate to promote cytoplasmic localization of &#x003b2;-catenin. In support of this model, nuclear-targeted Akt inhibits &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;dependent transcriptional activation. Our findings, therefore, unravel a novel mechanism controlling the dynamic nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of &#x003b2;-catenin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of the &#x003b5; and &#x003b6; isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins as Cby-binding partners</title><p>To extend our understanding of Cby's function, we searched for Cby-interacting proteins using a maltose-binding protein (MBP) pull-down approach. Recombinant MBP or MBP-Cby fusion proteins were incubated with cell lysates prepared from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. Cby-associated proteins were pulled down using amylose beads and resolved by SDS-PAGE, yielding several proteins that coprecipitated specifically with MBP-Cby in comparison to the MBP control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The protein bands were excised, digested with trypsin, and processed for mass spectrometry. One of them, with an apparent molecular mass of 28 kD, was identified as 14-3-3&#x003b6;. Although mass spectrometry was not able to identify the copurifying 30-kD protein, prior studies have found copurification of 14-3-3&#x003b6; and 14-3-3&#x003b5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ory et al., 2003</xref>).

The 14-3-3 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies and analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-Flag antibodies to detect Cby (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, left) or vice versa (right). In a result consistent with the initial finding, the 14-3-3&#x003b6; and &#x003b5; isoforms bound to Cby to a similar extent. In addition, Cby also coimmunoprecipitated with 14-3-3&#x003b7;, which indicates that Cby interacts with multiple 14-3-3 isoforms.</p><p>Next, we took advantage of a dominant-negative form of 14-3-3&#x003b6; (DN-14-3-3&#x003b6;; R56A/R60A), which is unable to bind to its substrates yet retains the ability to form homo- or heterodimers with other 14-3-3 members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xing et al., 2000</xref>). As determined by coimmunoprecipitation assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), DN-14-3-3&#x003b6; exhibited significantly reduced affinity to Cby compared with the wild-type (WT) protein, which confirms that the interaction between Cby and 14-3-3 is specific.</p><p>To further evaluate the physiological relevance of the Cby-14-3-3 interaction, the association of endogenous proteins was examined (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Immunoprecipitates with rabbit anti&#x02013;pan&#x02013;14-3-3 antibodies were prepared from HEK293T cells in which both Cby and 14-3-3 are relatively abundantly expressed. Cby was readily detected in the 14-3-3 immunoprecipitates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>, lane 2) but not those performed using control rabbit IgG (lane 1).

HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged WT or mutant Cby and HA&#x02013;14-3-3&#x003b6;, followed by coimmunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibodies and immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies. Note that to compensate for protein levels, the amounts of DNA for CbyS18A/S20A, CbyS20A, and Cby&#x00394;1-22 were appropriately increased for transfection, and hence, roughly similar expression levels were observed for all the Cby mutants (bottom).

These expression constructs (200 ng each) were transfected into HEK293T cells as indicated, and Renilla luciferase activities were measured 24 h after transfection. A firefly luciferase plasmid was cotransfected to normalize transfection efficiency. Immunoblotting with anti-Cby antibodies (top left) or anti&#x02013;pan&#x02013;14-3-3 antibodies (top right) showed that these fusion proteins were stably expressed.

Upon overexpression of N-terminally Flag-tagged proteins in HEK293T cells, CbyS18A and CbyS22P were found to be present at levels similar to WT Cby (CbyWT), whereas the other Cby mutants (S18A/S20A, S20A, and &#x00394;1-22) were expressed at slightly lower levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The Cby mutants were then individually coexpressed with HA-tagged 14-3-3&#x003b6; in HEK293T cells, immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag antibodies, and immunoblotted for 14-3-3&#x003b6; with anti-HA antibodies. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, CbyS18A or CbyS22P, which harbors a motif that matches perfectly the mode II consensus sequence, interacted with 14-3-3&#x003b6; as efficiently as CbyWT. However, Cby mutants bearing a serine-to-alanine substitution or deletion of serine 20 (S18A/S20A, S20A, and &#x00394;1-22) almost completely lost their ability to bind to 14-3-3&#x003b6;.</p><p>To confirm the importance of serine 20 in 14-3-3 binding, we used the split synthetic Renilla luciferase (hRluc) assays for detecting protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paulmurugan and Gambhir, 2003</xref>). Cby was fused in-frame to the C-terminal portion of hRluc (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, Cby-RC), whereas 14-3-3 was linked to the N-terminal portion of hRluc (14-3-3-RN). Interactions between these fusion proteins would bring the N- and C-terminal portions of hRluc into close proximity and restore its activity. The constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells in various combinations, and hRluc activities were measured. As demonstrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, cotransfection of CbyWT, S18A, or S22P and 14-3-3&#x003b6; hRluc vectors resulted in high levels of hRluc activity. In contrast, coexpression of CbyS18A/20A, S20A, or &#x00394;1-22 and 14-3-3&#x003b6; hRluc fusion proteins produced only basal levels of hRluc activity. In addition, CbyWT efficiently bound to 14-3-3&#x003b7; and &#x003b5; but not to DN-14-3-3&#x003b6;. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the Cby serine 20 residue within the mode II 14-3-3&#x02013;binding motif mediates the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding of 14-3-3 to Cby is regulated by phosphorylation</title><p>In the majority of cases, 14-3-3 proteins recognize serine-phosphorylated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Muslin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yaffe et al., 1997</xref>). Having established that Cby serine 20 is key in its binding to 14-3-3, we investigated if phosphorylation regulates the interaction. To this end, Flag-Cby was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag affinity beads, followed by treatment with recombinant protein phosphatase 2A (rPP2A) in the presence or absence of its potent inhibitor okadaic acid (OA). The samples were then mixed with an equal amount of lysates from HEK293T cells expressing HA&#x02013;14-3-3&#x003b6;, the beads were precipitated and washed, and the proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for 14-3-3&#x003b6; using anti-HA antibodies. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref> (lane 2), phosphatase treatment significantly diminished Cby-14-3-3 interactions, and the inhibition was prevented in the presence of OA (lane 3). These results indicate that 14-3-3 binding to Cby depends upon the phosphorylation state of Cby. Consistent with this finding, we did not detect interactions between Cby and 14-3-3 by in vitro pull-down assays using bacterially produced Cby (unpublished data).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Cby seine 20 is phosphorylated by Akt, facilitating its interaction with 14-3-3</bold>.

Our data suggest that 14-3-3 proteins bind to Cby and sequester it in the cytoplasm. This raises the interesting possibility that Cby&#x02013;14-3-3 interactions regulate &#x003b2;-catenin signaling. To address this question, we performed Tcf/Lef luciferase reporter (TopFlash) assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korinek et al., 1997</xref>) in HEK293T cells using the three different 14-3-3 isoforms and Cby.

In all cases, coexpression of Cby showed repressive effects on TopFlash activity. Given the fact that all three 14-3-3 isoforms bind to Cby (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1 C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2 D</xref>) and sequester it into the cytoplasmic compartment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref> and not depicted), we concluded that overexpression of 14-3-3 proteins is most likely to exert pleiotropic effects on the TopFlash reporter, potentially by interacting with multiple cellular target proteins.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Association of Cby with 14-3-3 influences &#x003b2;-catenin signaling.</bold> (A) Effects of different 14-3-3 isoforms on &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;mediated transcriptional activation were evaluated by TopFlash assays.

In sharp contrast, the C-terminally truncated mutant (&#x003b2;-cateninS33Y&#x00394;C) was detected primarily in the nucleus, which implies that Cby binding ultimately controls &#x003b2;-catenin distribution. Intriguingly, coexpression with Cby and 14-3-3&#x003b6; resulted in a dramatic cytoplasmic shift of &#x003b2;-cateninS33Y, whereas no major changes were observed in the predominant nuclear localization of &#x003b2;-cateninS33Y&#x00394;C (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, B and C</xref>).

To test this, we assessed the effects of various forms of Akt on &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;mediated transcriptional activation using TopFlash assays (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).

Therefore, nuclear import/export of &#x003b2;-catenin represents a crucial step in regulating signaling competent &#x003b2;-catenin levels and serves as an attractive target for anti-cancer therapies, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly defined.</p><p>In this study, we have identified 14-3-3 proteins as novel Cby-binding partners. We demonstrated that 14-3-3 proteins specifically bind to serine 20 within the 14-3-3&#x02013;binding consensus motif of Cby. Their interaction entirely depends upon phosphorylation of this critical serine residue by Akt kinase. Furthermore, we found that association with 14-3-3 triggers cytoplasmic relocation of Cby protein. Intriguingly, Cby and 14-3-3 form a tripartite complex with &#x003b2;-catenin and act cooperatively to sequester &#x003b2;-catenin into the cytoplasmic compartment. In support of our model, Cby collaborates with nuclear Akt to repress &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;dependent transcriptional activation. Our results, therefore, suggest that inhibition of &#x003b2;-catenin signaling by Cby involves at least two distinct molecular mechanisms (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>); i.e., competing with Tcf/Lef transcription factors for binding to &#x003b2;-catenin in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takemaru et al., 2003</xref>) and facilitating nuclear export of &#x003b2;-catenin via interaction with 14-3-3 upon its phosphorylation by Akt. Consistent with this, Cby mutants defective in 14-3-3 binding (S18A/S20A, 20A, and &#x00394;1-22) unexpectedly exhibit significantly reduced ability to repress TopFlash activation by &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>) even though they accumulate in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>).

Later, it was found that Akt phosphorylates &#x003b2;-catenin at serine 552, which appears to enhance its interaction with 14-3-3&#x003b6; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2007</xref>). In both cases, ectopic expression of 14-3-3&#x003b6; resulted in a moderate activation (two- to fourfold) of &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;dependent transcription in TopFlash assays. We found that 14-3-3&#x003b6; enhances, whereas 14-3-3&#x003b7; and &#x003b5; isoforms repress, &#x003b2;-catenin activation of the TopFlash reporter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). One possible explanation for this observation is that 14-3-3 overexpression exerts complex biological effects, which makes our interpretation of the TopFlash results difficult. In fact, 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to interact with a plethora of target proteins ranging from transcription factors to various signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dougherty and Morrison, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pozuelo Rubio et al., 2004</xref>). However, it is interesting to note that, consistent with our results (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>), ectopic expression of 14-3-3&#x003b6; was found to cause the cytoplasmic enrichment of &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tian et al., 2004</xref>), potentially by interacting with endogenous Cby. Nonetheless, our findings indicate that the Cby&#x02013;14-3-3 interaction significantly contributes to their stable complex formation with &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). More importantly, 14-3-3 itself is not sufficient to sequester &#x003b2;-catenin into the cytoplasm, as 14-3-3 binding&#x02013;defective CbyS20A retains &#x003b2;-catenin in the nucleus even in the presence of excess 14-3-3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 C</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin and Cby by Akt provokes 14-3-3 binding to form a stable ternary complex followed by &#x003b2;-catenin nuclear export and termination of its signaling (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Similarly, it has been shown that Akt phosphorylates FoxO Forkhead transcription factors, and this promotes their interaction with 14-3-3, leading to their nuclear exit and cytoplasmic retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Van Der Heide et al., 2004</xref>). It is also noteworthy that, in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, 14-3-3/PAR-5 binds to and mediates nuclear export of TCF/POP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lo et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The key negative regulators of the Wnt&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin pathway, APC and Axin, have been shown to affect the nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling of &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henderson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosin-Arbesfeld et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cong and Varmus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wiechens et al., 2004</xref>). Both proteins carry functional NLS and NES sequences and export &#x003b2;-catenin from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in a CRM-1&#x02013;dependent manner, most likely for degradation. The Cby&#x02013;14-3-3 pathway represents yet another mechanism that controls &#x003b2;-catenin subcellular distribution. In addition to two putative NLS sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takemaru et al., 2003</xref>), Cby harbors a potential NES, and its localization is sensitive to leptomycin B (unpublished data), which is indicative of a CRM-1&#x02013;dependent process. At present, the relationship between APC&#x02013;, Axin&#x02013;, and Cby&#x02013;14-3-3&#x02013;dependent &#x003b2;-catenin nuclear export pathways is unclear. However, Cby does not form a complex with APC or Axin (unpublished data), which implies that the Cby&#x02013;14-3-3 route operates independently of that of APC and Axin.</p><p>Akt is a major effector of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling, which is activated by a diverse array of extracellular stimuli, and is known to promote cell growth, survival, and tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hennessy et al., 2005</xref>). Several lines of evidence indicate that Akt plays a positive role in Wnt&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin signaling, most likely through phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3, although its precise mechanism of action remains largely debatable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brazil et al., 2002</xref>). Here, we provide evidence that nuclear-targeted Akt inhibits, whereas membrane-tethered Akt stimulates, &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;mediated transcriptional activation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). It is possible that membrane/cytoplasmic activated Akt favorably phosphorylates and thus inactivates GSK3, whereas nuclear Akt phosphorylates &#x003b2;-catenin and Cby, which in turn facilitates 14-3-3 binding and subsequent nuclear exclusion of the ternary complex. The opposing roles of Akt in the Wnt&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin pathway may be temporally and spatially controlled in an in vivo scenario. Once activated at the plasma membrane in response to diverse stimuli, Akt translocates into the nucleus, where it phosphorylates and modulates the activity of nuclear factors including Forkhead transcription factors and p300/CBP coactivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andjelkovic et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borgatti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang and Chen, 2005</xref>). However, little is known about the physiological functions of nuclear Akt. Our results reveal that the subcellular compartmentalization of Akt differentially influences &#x003b2;-catenin signaling. This is reminiscent of GSK3, as it both positively and negatively affects Wnt&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin signaling depending on its intracellular location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zeng et al., 2005</xref>). It is also conceivable that phosphorylation of Cby at serine 20 is catalyzed by additional kinases because 14-3-3&#x02013;binding motifs have been shown to be substrates for various protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dougherty and Morrison, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitken, 2006</xref>). Clearly, further work will be required to define the cross-talk between the Wnt&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin and Akt signaling pathways.</p><p>In conclusion, our study reveals a new molecular mechanism for the regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin subcellular distribution by the combinatorial action of Cby and 14-3-3 proteins. As deregulation of 14-3-3 has been implicated in the development of several types of human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hermeking, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wilker and Yaffe, 2004</xref>), it would be of great interest to determine if &#x003b2;-catenin signaling is aberrantly activated in these tumor cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids and protein expression</title><p>Expression vectors for human Cby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takemaru et al., 2003</xref>), &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takemaru et al., 2003</xref>), and &#x003b2;-cateninS33Y-Flag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2007</xref>) have been described previously.

Human 14-3-3&#x003b5;, &#x003b6;, and &#x003b7; cDNAs were PCR amplified from HEK293T cDNA using a forward primer containing the HA sequence at the 5&#x02032; end, digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and subcloned into the pCS2&#x0002b; vector. Similarly, PCR fragments for Flag-Cby&#x00394;1-22 and &#x003b2;-cateninS33Y&#x00394;C (amino acids 1&#x02013;664)-Flag were inserted into the pCS2&#x0002b; and pQCXIP (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.), respectively. Cby single or double point mutants and DN-14-3-3&#x003b6; (R56A/R60A) were created using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
