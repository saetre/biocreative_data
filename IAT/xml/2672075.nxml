Stimulated by the finding that human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), a human exogenous retrovirus, causes a neurological disease (HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis) with similarities to MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], retroviruses have also been searched for in MS. This led to the detection of retrovirus-like particles containing reverse transcriptase activity in the supernatants from cultured cell of patients with MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. After molecular characterization of retroviral RNA sequences within such particles, this novel retroviral element was named MS-associated retrovirus (MSRV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Subsequent probing of human genomic DNA with MSRV sequences revealed endogenous retroviral sequences closely related to MSRV, the human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) family type W (HERV-W) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. HERVs are remnants of ancestral germ line infections by active retroviruses, which have thereafter been transmitted in a Mendelian manner. In humans, HERVs comprise approximately 8% of the genome (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]). They typically consist of an internal region containing <italic>gag</italic>, <italic>pro</italic>, <italic>pol</italic>, and <italic>env </italic>genes, flanked by two long terminal repeats (LTR). HERV-W is a multicopy family consisting of ~650 elements dispersed in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. About 280 of those elements contain internal sequences. The remaining elements lack internal regions because of recombinational deletion between the two LTRs, leaving a solo LTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Like almost all HERV families, HERV-W is highly defective due to acquisition of stop-codons, frameshift mutations, and deletions. In addition, many members of the HERV-W family represent processed pseudogenes that were generated through retrotransposition by long interspersed elements (LINE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Notably, no replication-competent HERV-W provirus could be identified so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Yet, a single HERV-W <italic>env </italic>locus (ERVWE1, chromosomal location 7q21.2) retained a complete open reading frame (ORF) for a functional envelope (Env) protein, termed Syncytin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Syncytin-1 is highly expressed in the placenta where it likely participates in the fusion of cytotrophoblast cells into the syncytiotrophoblast layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The ERVWE1 locus therefore appears to have been diverted into a <italic>bona fide </italic>human gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Intriguingly, in addition to the physiological function of Syncytin-1 in placental morphogenesis, several studies have provided evidence in support of a possible pathogenic role of HERV-W Env/Syncytin-1 in MS. HERV-W <italic>env</italic>/Syncytin-1 RNA levels were found to be higher in autopsied brain tissue from patients with MS than in brain tissue from controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Neuropathological investigations reported increased expression of HERV-W Env/Syncytin-1 protein in astrocytes and microglia in actively demyelinating brain lesions from patients with MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A potential pathogenic significance of HERV-W Env/Syncytin-1 expression in MS can be inferred from data showing that Syncytin-1 has indirect cytotoxic effects on oligodendrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that expression of Syncytin-1 in murine models results in demyelination <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>A putative MSRV Env protein was previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The surface (SU) domain of MSRV Env (AF331500), the amino acid sequence of which is 87% identical to Syncytin-1, has been shown to stimulate production of proinflammatory cytokines in human monocytes via engagement of CD14 and toll-like receptor 4. It also triggers maturation of human dendritic cells and confers on them the potential to polarize naive T-cells into Th-1-like effector T-lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Production of IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-6, and IL-12p40 following stimulation with MSRV Env SU of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with MS is significantly higher compared to PBMC from healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In addition, MSRV Env induces a polyclonal activation of T-cells bearing specific V&#x003b2; chains, reminiscent of immunopathogenic effects triggered by superantigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Altogether, those proinflammatory properties of MSRV Env appear compatible with a potential relevance of MSRV Env in the context of MS, too.</p><p>Despite the possible role of MSRV and HERV-W (Syncytin-1) in MS, the exact origin of MSRV and the precise relationship between MSRV and HERV-W have been hitherto unclear. MSRV has been defined by different overlapping cDNA clones that were generated from particle-associated RNA from plasma or supernatants of cultured cells from patients with MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Sequences of those cloned cDNAs were reported to be similar to HERV-W, but individual HERV-W proviruses from which those sequences may have originated could not be identified so far. To date, there exists no molecular clone containing a complete infectious MSRV genome, and the very nature of MSRV has thus remained uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This has further stimulated a discussion over the relative contributions of MSRV and HERV-W to the pathogenesis of MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>By analogy to some well-characterized animal retroviruses (e.g. Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus), it has been speculated that MSRV could be an exogenous member of an endogenous retrovirus family which consequently might be able to form novel proviral insertions in human genomic DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. If this was the case, it may be assumed that RNA transcripts from such proviral MSRV insertions are specifically detectable in individuals infected with MSRV. However, complicating the identification of such MSRV RNA transcripts, many of the HERV-W elements present in human genomic DNA, which all are very similar to MSRV, may produce RNA transcripts as well. We therefore asked which HERV-W loci are transcriptionally active in human cells, and whether transcripts corresponding to previously published MSRV sequences might be specifically detectable in patients with MS. Given the potential pathogenic role of MSRV/HERV-W Env proteins in MS, we focused our analysis on MSRV/HERV-W <italic>env </italic>sequences. Published MSRV <italic>env </italic>sequences were obtained from plasma of patients with MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Since MSRV sequences found in plasma are likely to originate from PBMC and since MSRV/HERV-W <italic>env </italic>sequences have previously been detected in human PBMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] we chose to analyze PBMC in this work.</p><p>Herein, we identify transcriptionally active HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci in PBMC from patients with MS and healthy controls. We also demonstrate that analysis of transcribed HERV-W <italic>env </italic>elements is complicated by frequent recombinations that are most likely generated <italic>in vitro</italic>. Based on these results we show that the published MSRV <italic>env </italic>and <italic>gag </italic>sequences can be explained as originating from endogenous HERV-W loci or recombinations among them. By clarifying the origin of MSRV sequences, our data help to settle a longstanding debate, and have important implications for the status of MSRV as well as for the potential role of MSRV/HERV-W Env in the pathogenesis of MS.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Transcriptionally active HERV-W env loci in human PBMC</title><p>We previously described an experimental strategy to identify distinct transcriptionally active HERV loci in human tissues and cells, which we applied to detect transcribed proviral loci for the HERV-K(HML-2) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Using this strategy, we aimed at identifying transcribed HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci and/or MSRV <italic>env </italic>sequences in PBMC from patients with MS and healthy controls. To this end, we performed RT-PCR on total RNA isolated from PBMC of 4 patients with MS and 4 healthy controls. An extensive DNAse digestion protocol assured the absence of contaminating genomic DNA in all samples studied (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We employed a pair of HERV-W <italic>env</italic>-specific PCR primers located in the region of HERV-W <italic>env </italic>coding for the SU domain and generating a PCR product of about 640 bp. The HERV-W <italic>env</italic>-specific PCR primers were designed to amplify the previously reported MSRV <italic>env </italic>sequence AF331500 and the HERV-W <italic>env </italic>locus on chromosome 7q21.2 (ERVWE1). In addition, they potentially recognize at least eight other HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci in the human genome, as determined by BLAT PCR analyses <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.brc.mcw.edu/cgi-bin/hgPcr"/>. However, according to more detailed comparisons with HERV-W <italic>env </italic>sequences retrieved from the human genome sequence, the actual number of HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci possibly amplified by the HERV-W <italic>env </italic>primers is probably even higher, since further loci with few mismatches to the primers are very likely to be amplified as well. PCR-products were subsequently cloned, and individual cDNA clones were sequenced. HERV-W <italic>env </italic>cDNA sequences were assigned to specific HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci in the human genome, based on characteristic nucleotide differences between HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci (see also Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of HERV-W <italic>env </italic>in human PBMC</bold>.

A multiple alignment of the genomic DNA sequences (March 2006 human genome assembly) of the seven HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci identified as transcriptionally active in human PBMC in this study is shown. HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci are designated according to their chromosomal location. The 7q21.2 HERV-W <italic>env </italic>locus (ERVWE1) serves as reference sequence.

To map HERV-W <italic>env </italic>cDNA sequences onto individual genomic HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci, all 332 sequences were analyzed using human BLAT searches at the UCSC Human Genome Browser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We thereby identified, in total, 7 transcribed HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci in human PBMC. A list of those HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci and their main characteristics are provided in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In particular, the previously well characterized HERV-W <italic>env </italic>locus on chromosome 7q21.2 (ERVWE1), that is, the gene encoding Syncytin-1, was found to be transcribed in human PBMC. The 7q21.2 locus contains a full-length HERV-W proviral copy, flanked by two complete HERV-W LTRs. As for the structure of the other 6 transcriptionally active HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci, all of them display incomplete 3'LTRs ending just downstream from the poly-A signal, the expected 3' end of the LTR R-region. In addition, two of those 6 elements (located on chromosome 6q21, and 15q21.3) show a deletion of the 5' LTR's first 255 nucleotides, corresponding to the expected LTR U3 region. The four remaining elements (5q11.2, 14q21.3, 17q12, and Xq22.3) are severely truncated at the 5' end, lacking the 5'LTR, the <italic>gag </italic>region, and varying portions of the 5' <italic>pol </italic>region. Structures of transcribed HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci are provided in additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>. In summary, except for the 7q21.2 locus, all HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci found to be transcriptionally active in human PBMC show characteristic features of HERV-W pseudogenes that have been generated by LINE machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In keeping with results obtained by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], our data therefore indicate that despite having truncated or completely missing 5'LTRs HERV-W pseudogenes can be transcribed. This implies that as yet unidentified promotors located upstream of those HERV-W pseudogenes drive their transcription.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci identified in this study as transcribed in human PBMC</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">HERV-W <italic>env </italic>locus</td><td align="center">strand</td><td align="left" colspan="2">location of amplicon in genome</td><td align="left">5' LTR</td><td align="left">3' LTR</td><td align="left">processed pseudogene</td><td align="left">full-length Env ORF</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">5q11.2</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="left">56852791</td><td align="left">56853425</td><td align="left">absent</td><td align="left">&#x00394;325&#x02013;780</td><td align="left">+</td><td align="left">-</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">6q21</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="left">106788519</td><td align="left">106789159</td><td align="left">&#x00394;1&#x02013;255</td><td align="left">&#x00394;327&#x02013;780</td><td align="left">+</td><td align="left">-</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">7q21.2 (ERVWE1)</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="left">91936808</td><td align="left">91937448</td><td align="left">complete</td><td align="left">complete</td><td align="left">-</td><td align="left">+ (538 aa)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">14q21.3</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="left">44559628</td><td align="left">44559996</td><td align="left">absent</td><td align="left">&#x00394;327&#x02013;780</td><td align="left">+</td><td align="left">-</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">15q21.3</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="left">53385554</td><td align="left">53386189</td><td align="left">&#x00394;1&#x02013;255</td><td align="left">&#x00394;327&#x02013;780</td><td align="left">+</td><td align="left">-</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">17q12</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="left">32765922</td><td align="left">32766546</td><td align="left">absent</td><td align="left">&#x00394;327&#x02013;780</td><td align="left">+</td><td align="left">-</td></tr><tr><td colspan="8"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Xq22.3</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="left">106183197</td><td align="left">106183837</td><td align="left">absent</td><td align="left">&#x00394;327&#x02013;780</td><td align="left">+</td><td align="left">-*</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The chromosomal location of transcriptionally active HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci is indicated in the first column.

About one third of HERV-W <italic>env </italic>cDNAs analyzed in this work indeed perfectly matched with genomic DNA sequences.

Although minor nucleotide differences may well be explained by the inaccuracy of Taq polymerase, sequencing errors, or sequence variations (SNPs) in genomic HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci, those possibilities seem unlikely to account for the relatively high numbers of nucleotide mismatches observed in some of the cDNA sequences. It has recently been shown that analyses of transcribed HERV sequences are complicated by recombinations between individual HERV transcripts, which most likely arise <italic>in vitro </italic>during reverse transcription because of template switches of reverse transcriptase and/or through PCR-mediated recombinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].

The binding regions of three further loci (5q11.2, 6q21, 15q21.3) contained a single nucleotide mismatch in the 5' end of either the forward or the reverse primer. Because the 15q21.3 and the 6q21 loci were the most frequently cloned loci in our study, the single nucleotide mismatches in these two loci appear unlikely to have had a significant negative impact on amplification. In the case of the 5q11.2 locus this possibility cannot be excluded, but seems unlikely given the results for the 15q21.3 and 6q21 loci.

The other two MSRV <italic>env </italic>sequences (AF127229 and AF331500) could be explained as recombinations between different HERV-W loci. AF127229 represents a recombination between two HERV-W loci located on chromsome 3p12.3 and 18q21.32. Likewise, AF331500 represents a recombination between two HERV-W elements on Xq22.3 and 5p12. Similar to the data shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the number of nucleotide mismatches between AF127229 or AF331500 and the best matching genomic HERV-W loci was strongly reduced when recombinations were assumed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).

Since the primers used in this investigation only amplify a limited number of genomic HERV-W <italic>env </italic>elements our study is not exhaustive, and it seems rather likely that more than seven HERV-W <italic>env </italic>elements are transcriptionally active in human PBMC. Additionally, HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci that are transcribed at very low rates could be missed in the cloning procedure unless much higher numbers of clones are generated.

Assignment of cDNAs to genomic HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci in the former investigations was based on rather short sequences (30 bp, excluding primers), containing only few informative nucleotides, that is, nucleotides that are exclusively present in a single genomic HERV-W <italic>env </italic>locus and thereby allow unambiguous assignment of cDNAs. Usage of a ~600 bp sequence (excluding primers) in the present work resulted in a higher number of informative nucleotides and thus strengthened the accuracy of the assignment. Our finding of ERVWE1 transcripts in human PBMC is consistent with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and corroborates that although ERVWE1 expression is most abundant in placenta this locus is transcribed in non-placental tissues as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have analyzed expression of HERV-W <italic>env </italic>RNA in PBMC or brain tissue from patients with MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Lack of systematic cloning, sequencing, and assignment of cDNA sequences to genomic HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci have impaired the exact identification of transcriptionally active genomic HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci responsible for the observed HERV-W <italic>env </italic>RNA expression in these investigations. Whereas in the present detailed analysis we could identify distinct transcriptionally active HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci, we did not observe significant differences in the transcriptional activity of those loci in PBMC from patients with MS versus healthy controls. Although the number of individuals studied was rather small, these data argue against a dysregulated transcription pattern of HERV-W <italic>env </italic>in PBMC from patients with MS. In contrast, a consistent finding of former investigations was a significantly higher global HERV-W <italic>env </italic>RNA expression in brain tissue from patients with MS as compared to brain tissue from patients with other neurological diseases or normal brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Using the methodological approach of the present work, it will therefore be interesting to identify the HERV-W <italic>env </italic>elements underlying upregulated HERV-W <italic>env </italic>RNA expression in MS brain tissue.</p><p>Antony and coworkers addressed this question by designing primers that specifically amplify HERV-W <italic>env </italic>7q21.2 (ERVWE1) and the MSRV <italic>env </italic>clone AF123882 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], which, as shown by our analyses, corresponds to a HERV-W <italic>env </italic>element on chromosome 15q21.3. These authors also employed a pair of degenerate (HERV-W<sub>deg</sub>) <italic>env </italic>primers that were based on the MSRV <italic>env </italic>clone AF331500, which, again as shown in this work, corresponds to a recombined cDNA originating from HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci on Xq22.3 and 5p12. According to the Antony et al. study, elevated HERV-W <italic>env </italic>RNA expression in MS brain tissue originates mainly from the HERV-W <italic>env </italic>elements amplified by the HERV-W<sub>deg </sub><italic>env </italic>primers and (somewhat less) from HERV-W <italic>env </italic>7q21.2, while HERV-W <italic>env </italic>15q21.3 expression was similar in patients and controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A BLAT-PCR search showed that the HERV-W<sub>deg </sub><italic>env </italic>primer pair potentially amplifies at least three genomic HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci, among them HERV-W <italic>env </italic>Xq22.3. It is thus tempting to speculate that HERV-W <italic>env </italic>Xq22.3 may significantly contribute to increased HERV-W <italic>env </italic>RNA expression in MS brain tissue. Again, using the methods described herein, this issue could be resolved in a straightforward manner.</p><p>Remarkably, we observed a high number (29.8%) of recombined sequences among the analyzed HERV-W <italic>env </italic>cDNAs. As detailed in a previous study on transcribed HERV-K(HML-2) sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], those recombinant cDNA sequences very likely resulted from <italic>in vitro </italic>recombinations that were due to template switches of reverse transcriptase during cDNA synthesis and/or PCR-mediated recombinations. Both of these mechanisms are well-recognized and have been proven experimentally to produce chimeric sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The percentage of recombined sequences detected in the present study was higher than that in the study on HERV-K(HML-2) in which ~5% of recombined clones were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. This is most likely explained by the fact that in the HERV-K(HML-2) study only cDNA sequences with more than 17 nucleotide mismatches to the best matching locus were analyzed for recombinations, whereas in the present work all cDNA sequences were scrutinized for recombinations. Altogether, our data indicate that during experimental studies of repetitive elements by RT-PCR, <italic>in vitro </italic>recombinations are relatively common and almost inevitable complications.</p><p>An important result of this investigation is that previously published MSRV <italic>env </italic>and <italic>gag </italic>sequences appear to either be derived from transcripts of specific genomic HERV-W elements or to result from recombinations among such transcripts (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Given the high frequency of <italic>in vitro </italic>recombinations between transcripts from different HERV loci observed in this and the study by Flockerzi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and given that MSRV clones were generated by methodologically similar approaches, it seems possible that the recombined MSRV <italic>env </italic>sequences (AF127229, AF331500) have resulted from <italic>in vitro </italic>recombinations as well.</p><p>An alternative explanation is that the recombined MSRV <italic>env </italic>sequences, and the recombined HERV-W <italic>env </italic>sequences isolated in this study, originated from novel, recombined, genomic HERV-W insertions. Hypothetically, such insertions could have formed <italic>in vivo </italic>after recombination of RNA transcripts from different HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci through template switches during reverse transcription. Although we cannot formally exclude this possibility, a number of points argue against it. First, all known HERV-W elements are defective and replication-incompetent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore, HERV-W is <italic>a priori </italic>rather unlikely to have the capacity to form new insertions in human DNA. Second, if there were novel recombined HERV-W loci in human DNA, one would expect to repeatedly observe defined recombined sequences originating from such insertions. However, this is neither the case with the 99 recombined HERV-W <italic>env </italic>cDNA sequences analyzed in this study nor with the published MSRV <italic>env </italic>clones. Third, given that about 30% of HERV-W <italic>env </italic>and 33% (2 of 6) of the investigated MSRV sequences represent recombinants, if all these recombinant MSRV/HERV-W <italic>env </italic>sequences were derived from novel proviral insertions, formation of such novel insertions would be an astonishingly frequent event. It seems very unlikely that as many recombined HERV-W loci should have been overlooked in previous genome sequencing projects.</p><p>Collectively, the most plausible and simplest explanation for the origin of MSRV <italic>env </italic>and <italic>gag </italic>sequences seems to be that those sequences originate from RNA transcripts from various endogenous HERV-W loci, or from <italic>in vitro </italic>recombinations among them. All of the HERV-W loci from which MSRV sequences are derived are defective and except for the 5p12 HERV-W <italic>env </italic>element, all of those loci resemble processed HERV-W pseudogenes. The human genome sequence was not yet available when MSRV was described, which hampered the identification of the precise origin of MSRV sequences at that time. It was, however, noted that those sequences cannot be attributed to a single replication-competent genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, the nature of MSRV was subsequently controversial, and it has been speculated that MSRV could be an exogenous, replication-competent retrovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In contrast, our present data clearly suggest that the published MSRV <italic>env </italic>and <italic>gag </italic>RNA sequences are not derived from the genome of a currently replication-competent exogenous retrovirus. In the light of these results and previous observations of an increased prevalence of MSRV <italic>pol </italic>transcripts in plasma from patients with MS as compared to healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], it may similarly be interesting to analyze which HERV-W <italic>pol </italic>elements those MSRV <italic>pol </italic>transcripts could be derived from.</p><p>Although our findings argue against MSRV being an autonomous retroviral entity, they do by no means rule out that individual HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci that correspond to MSRV sequences, or the Syncytin-1 (ERVWE1) gene, could be of relevance in MS. Indeed, we show that two MSRV <italic>env </italic>clones (AF331500, AF127228), which have been instrumental for the characterization of proinflammatory effects of MSRV Env [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and the generation of a monoclonal anti-MSRV/HERV-W Env antibody (6A2B2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], are derived from a HERV-W <italic>env </italic>locus on chromosome Xq22.3. This locus is highly remarkable as it is interrupted by only a single premature stop at codon position 39 and otherwise harbors a long ORF for a N-terminally truncated 475 amino acid HERV-W Env protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Bonnaud and colleagues described frameshift insertions/deletions (indels), that is, indels whose length is not a multiple of three, in 33 out of 36 analyzed genomic HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci. Interestingly, among the three loci without frameshift indels were the ERVWE1 gene and the Xq22.3 HERV-W <italic>env </italic>element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. We further note that the 475 amino acid Xq22.3 HERV-W <italic>env </italic>ORF is also present in the orthologous locus in chimpanzees (data not shown). These data may be taken as hints that selective pressure could act on the Xq22.3 HERV-W <italic>env </italic>locus, raising the possibility that Xq22.3 HERV-W <italic>env </italic>could exert a biological function. Our finding that the Xq22.3 HERV-W <italic>env </italic>locus is transcriptionally active in human cells indicates that it fulfills at least one essential prerequisite for a protein expression capacity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Neuropathological studies revealed that the 6A2B2 anti-HERV-W Env antibody reacts with an antigen that is strongly expressed by glial cells in MS brain lesions, but not in normal control brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Because Syncytin-1 has been thought to be the only HERV-W <italic>env </italic>locus capable of producing a HERV-W Env protein, and because 6A2B2 may crossreact with Syncytin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], the antigen detected by 6A2B2 in MS brain lesions was considered to be Syncytin-1. However, our analyses show that the protein against which the 6A2B2 antibody was raised is practically identical to the Xq22.3 HERV-W Env protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We meanwhile cloned Xq22.3 HERV-W <italic>env </italic>into a eukaryotic expression vector. Transient transfection of HeLa cells with this clone showed that the Xq22.3 HERV-W <italic>env </italic>has retained a coding capacity and can produce a HERV-W Env protein <italic>in vitro </italic>which is detected by the 6A2B2 antibody in immunocytochemistry and immunoblots (C. Crusius, S. Wahl, K. Ruprecht, manuscript in preparation). These data suggest that the antigen recognized by 6A2B2 in MS lesions could likewise originate from the Xq22.3 HERV-W <italic>env </italic>locus, provided that this locus has a protein expression capacity <italic>in vivo</italic>. More elaborate studies will be required to clarify the exact nature of the HERV-W Env protein detected in MS lesions. Further characterization of the putative Xq22.3-encoded HERV-W Env protein, especially in comparison to Syncytin-1, will be necessary for such clarification.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that several HERV-W <italic>env </italic>loci are transcribed in human PBMC, and that analysis of such transcribed HERV-W <italic>env </italic>elements is complicated by frequent recombinations, which are most likely generated <italic>in vitro</italic>. Based on these findings, we show that previously reported MSRV <italic>env </italic>and <italic>gag </italic>sequences can be explained as originating from (in some instances recombined) transcripts of defective HERV-W elements, arguing against MSRV sequences being derived from an infectious exogenous retrovirus. Our results should help to settle the issue of the nature of MSRV and contribute to the clarification of the roles of MSRV versus HERV-W Env (Syncytin-1) in MS. Indeed, our findings raise the intriguing possibility that a protein encoded by a HERV-W <italic>env </italic>element on chromosome Xq22.3 could be expressed in MS brain lesions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients with MS and healthy controls</title><p>Four patients with MS (3 female, 1 male) and 4 healthy controls (2 female, 2 male) were included in this study. The median age of patients was 34 (range 29&#x02013;39) and of controls 34.5 (29&#x02013;41) years. Clinical data of patients with MS were obtained by review of the medical records. All patients with MS had a diagnosis of definite MS according to Poser's criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Three patients had relapsing-remitting MS, and one patient had secondary progressive MS. The median expanded disability status scale score of patients with MS was 3.25 (1.5&#x02013;6.5). One patient was treated with interferon-beta 1a, and two patients were treated with glatiramer acetate by the time of blood collection. None of the patients had been treated with glucocorticosteroids for at least 6 months before blood collection. Participants provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the faculty of medicine, Julius-Maximilians University, W&#x000fc;rzburg. PBMC samples used in this work were collected and purified with Lymphoprep (Axis Shield, Oslo, Norway) gradient centrifugation as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].
