Approximately 33% of the tested subjects had at least one of the three HH mutations, and 1% of them were C282Y homozygotes or compound heterozygotes C282Y/H63D or C282Y/S65C, presenting an increased risk for iron overload disease.

The genotype frequencies in the Slovenian population agree with those reported for the Central European populations although some deviations where observed in comparison with other populations of Slavic origin. Regional distribution of the mutations should be considered when planning population screening.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism. Due to excessive intestinal absorption, iron accumulates in parenchymal cells of the liver, pancreas, heart and other organs with resultant damage to their structure and impairment of their function. It is one of the most common genetic diseases in Caucasians with a prevalence of nearly 1 in 300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Although the symptoms of the disease are often nonspecific, much of the organ damage is irreversible once it has occurred. Early detection and therapy is therefore very important as a part of preventive medicine. The discovery of the responsible gene <italic>HFE </italic>in 1996 enabled molecular analysis to be included in the diagnostic strategy for HH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A number of different <italic>HFE </italic>mutations have been reported so far. The majority of HH cases (52&#x02013;96%) in European regions are associated with a homozygous 845G&#x02192;A mutation within exon 4 of the <italic>HFE </italic>gene, which results in amino acid change at position 282 from cysteine to tyrosine (C282Y) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A second mutant allele 187C&#x02192;G detected with relatively high frequency occurs within the exon 2 of the <italic>HFE </italic>gene where aspartate replaces histidine at amino acid position 63 (H63D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The contribution of this allele to iron overload is most relevant in the case of combined heterozygosity with C282Y allele (C282Y/H63D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The third common mutation of <italic>HFE </italic>is 193A&#x02192;T substitution in exon 2 (S65C) and was shown to be generally benign, although a C282Y/S65C genotype may confer a slight increase in disease risk, contributing to a mild disease phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Many of the other <italic>HFE </italic>mutations described are private and rare, or they were found to be significantly enriched only in certain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Therefore the frequencies of the <italic>HFE </italic>mutations in the general population and in patients with clinically expressed disease have to be established in order to implement appropriate genetic tests in diagnostic and screening procedures for HH. There are very few studies providing information about the frequency of any of these three major HH mutations in populations of Slavic origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Only one study, based on RFLP method, is reported for the Slovenian population and is based on a limited number of subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, we have no data yet about the frequency of the <italic>HFE </italic>mutations in the Slovenian healthy population and in patients with clinically expressed disease nor do we have data about distribution of HH genotypes in different Slovenian regions.</p><p>Since HH is a genetic disorder that fulfils most of the WHO criteria for large-scale population screening program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the availability of a cost-effective method is an important issue. Although genetic testing for HH is generally not recommended as the first step in a wide population screening program because of uncertainty about the natural history of the disease, age-related penetrance and the psychosocial impact of genetic testing, its major role in confirmation of the diagnosis cannot be overlooked. Furthermore, family genetic testing performed among the relatives of a newly diagnosed patient also enables detection of subjects in the pre-symptomatic phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Many PCR-based methods were reported for HH mutation detection, however, real-time PCR-based assays with TaqMan technology seems to be one of the most prominent among them. The fluorescent TaqMan probes with minor groove binder (MGB) are shorter and thus significantly more specific for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) detection than standard DNA probes or allele specific PCR derivatives. The technology itself is completely flexible and suitable for the extremely high-throughout screening procedures since it combines the PCR amplification and detection into a single step therefore also minimizing the possibility of contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. An objection of so far reported TaqMan-based assays for the H63D and C282Y mutation detection was mainly the improper design of the probes for <italic>HFE </italic>codon 63 screening, which are too long and overlap the polymorphic position of the <italic>HFE </italic>codon 65 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This could lead to the misinterpretation of results obtained by those probes and therefore more optimized probes are critical for a reliable genotyping assay. It is worth to stress that the TaqMan probes for the detection of the S65C polymorphism have not been reported to date.</p><p>The aim of our work was (i) to develop an accurate, rapid and cost-effective diagnostic assay based on the TaqMan technology for the high-throughput detection of 187C&#x02192;G, 193A&#x02192;T and 845G&#x02192;A mutations in the <italic>HFE </italic>gene with validation on a small group of HH patients and (ii) to determine the frequencies of <italic>HFE </italic>mutations in the healthy population in Slovenia and to compare them with some other European populations, especially those of Slavic origin. The method described in this paper is now available for routine diagnostic and screening procedures for HH, opening new possibilities in preventive medicine and possibly in screening for potential new blood donors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and control subjects</title><p>Voluntary, unpaid, unrelated whole blood donors who attended blood donor sessions in 11 geographic regions of the Republic of Slovenia from May 2002 to January 2003 were randomly selected for the population study.

In addition, 21 patients, 20 men and 1 woman, with clinical and biochemical characteristics of HH who underwent therapeutic phlebotomy were included in the study. The mean age was 53 years for male patients (25 to 73 years) and 36 for female patient. In all patients the diagnosis of HH was confirmed by quantitative phlebotomy with removal of more than 4 grams of iron.

PCR conditions were 2 min at 50&#x000b0;C, 10 min at 95&#x000b0;C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95&#x000b0;C and 1 min at 60&#x000b0;C carried out by the ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystem). Allele discrimination was accomplished by running end point detection using ABI PRISM 7900HT and SDS 2.0 software.

The genotyping results obtained by the real-time PCR analysis using the TaqMan MGB probes are graphically presented for the case of S65C mutation detection in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The fluorescence of only one of the two probes in the reaction mixture increased exponentially in the case of the homozygous genotype, either wild-type or mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, upper panel represents 193A homozygous genotype), whereas a comparable and simultaneous increase in fluorescence of both probes at similar C<sub>T </sub>values was observed in the case of the heterozygous genotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, second panel represents 193A/T heterozygous genotype). The reliability of the codon 65 genotyping using HFE193A and HFE193T probes in the presence of the polymorphisms at both positions, 187 and 193, is shown in the case of the H63D/S65C combined heterozygote. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, third panel, the SNP at position 193 was successfully and accurately identified without any interfering effects from the SNP at position 187, which was not true for the probe that covers both polymorphic positions at the same time (data not shown).

Our contribution to the existing TaqMan-based fluorescent probes for <italic>HFE </italic>mutations detection was especially the construction of short specific MGB probes for SNP detection at positions 187 and 193. Using the ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System and SDS software, identification of samples with H63D, S65C and C282Y mutations in the <italic>HFE </italic>gene was simple and highly accurate. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, the real-time PCR results were easy to interpret either from the multicomponent amplification plot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) or from the scattered diagram of the end-point fluorescence measurements (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Genotype calls, as determined by real-time PCR analysis, were 100% concordant with genotypes obtained by RFLP and DNA sequencing.</p><p>We have also avoided the irregularity of many so far reported probes for analysis of the <italic>HFE </italic>position 187 by carefully designed short MGB probes for independent determination of both 187 and 193 genotypes. Even though the SNPs being only 6 nucleotydes apart the probes do not overlap the positions 187 and 193 and therefore do not interfere in the assay. Therefore, we have improved accuracy of the H63D genotyping assay. To date, our study is also the first time report of the population based S65C polymorphism genotyping in the <italic>HFE </italic>gene with the use of fluorescent TaqMan MGB probes with a nonfluorescent quencher in a high-throughput manner. Although we have improved real-time PCR assay for H63D, S65C and C282Y mutations detection, much larger surveys with <italic>HFE </italic>genotyping using several assay systems should not be overlooked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title><italic>HFE </italic>polymorphism for C282Y was underrepresented in the group of Slovenian HH patients</title><p>A small group of Slovenian patients with a clinically expressed disease who underwent therapeutic phlebotomy was included into our study to get positive controls for the test validation as well as for later standard preparation. Although the number of subjects is too small to make any serious conclusion it is evident from our results that the frequency of C282Y homozygotes in the group of HH patients is low (only 48%) when compared with other European populations (52&#x02013;96%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In 10% of HH patients none of the three major mutations were found. After further studies, including DNA sequencing, other mutations elsewhere in the <italic>HFE </italic>gene, such as frame-shift deletion c.471del in exon 3 resulting in a premature termination of a nonsense HFE protein, were recently found in one of our HH patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Mutations in <italic>ferroportin1 </italic>or <italic>TFR2 </italic>genes might also be involved with the phenotypic expression of HH symptoms in these patients and additional studies are on the way.</p></sec><sec><title>H63D allele frequencies differ among different Slovenian regions</title><p>To demonstrate the high-throughput capability of the assay, we have performed an investigation on 1282 blood donors from the Slovenian population as healthy representatives by analyzing the occurrence of H63D, S65C and C282Y single nucleotide polymorphisms within the coding region of the <italic>HFE </italic>gene. Since Slovenia has only 2 million residents, the regionally representative group of blood donors presents a very large sample. Allele frequencies of H63D, S65C and C282Y mutations were 12.8%, 1.8% and 3.6%, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Based on our results, homozygosity for the C282Y mutation was estimated to occur in 0.16% of the selected population which corresponds to 1 in 641 individuals. Compound heterozygosity for C282Y/H63D occurred in approximately 0.5% of probands. Taken together, approximately 1% of the Slovenian population are C282Y homozygotes or compound heterozygotes C282Y/H63D or C282Y/S65C, which all represent an increased risk for iron overload. More than 33% of tested subjects had at least one of the three mutations, linked to HH.</p><p>Comparing allele frequencies among different Slovenian regions revealed significantly higher frequency of H63D allele in one of northeastern regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The difference could be explained by the fact that the observed region is surrounded by mountains, characterized by relatively low migratory fluxes, and therefore a relatively isolated geographic area. Although the sample size for this region is too small to check for H-W equilibrium, the frequencies of H63D genotypes are within expected values. Regional distribution of H63D allele should be taken into account when planning wide population screening.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>HFE </italic>polymorphism prevalence in Slovenian population differs from those of other Slavic populations</title><p>In Europe, the population movements have contributed to the ethnic groups, cultures, and consequently, inheritance mixing. HH is one of the genetic diseases whose distribution is directly related to the population movements. The C282Y allele frequencies in the general population are distributed among a decreasing cline from northwest to southeast Europe with a higher prevalence in the populations having a heavier Celtic or Viking component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, the frequency of the H63D, S65C and C282Y mutations observed in the Slovenian population were compared with the frequencies observed in some other European populations. The prevalence of C282Y mutation in the Republic of Slovenia (3.6%) correlates with the reported northwest to southeast gradient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and geographic position of Slovenia. Compared to other nations of Slavic origin the frequency of the C282Y mutation is higher, but not significantly, comparing to Poland (3.1%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the Czech Republic (3.4%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and Croatia (3.3%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and lower than in Bosnia and Herzegovina (4.0%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Interestengly, the C282Y frequency significantly differs from the population of Serbia and Montenegro (1.6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], also Slavic in origin. Obviously, there is a considerably high difference in C282Y allele frequencies among nations of Slavic origin, which could support a late introduction of the mutation in Slavic nations or, alternatively, that more time passed, than generally believed, from the close connections among Slavic nations. In contrast, the frequency of C282Y mutation in Slovenia is considerably higher than in the Modena region of Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of allele frequencies of H63D, S65C and C282Y in the Slovenian population with other European populations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Country</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>n</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>H63D (%)</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>p value</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>S65C (%)</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>p value</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>C282Y (%)</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>p value</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Slovenia*</td><td align="left">1282</td><td align="left"><bold>12.8</bold></td><td></td><td align="left"><bold>1.8</bold></td><td></td><td align="left"><bold>3.6</bold></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Croatia* [11]</td><td align="left">200</td><td align="left"><bold>14.5</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td><td align="left"><bold>1.8</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td><td align="left"><bold>3.3</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hungary [30]</td><td align="left">240</td><td align="left"><bold>14.4</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td><td align="left"><bold>-</bold></td><td align="left">-</td><td align="left"><bold>3.4</bold></td><td align="left">NS<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Italy &#x02013; Modena [27]</td><td align="left">606</td><td align="left"><bold>14.9</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td><td align="left"><bold>0.7</bold></td><td align="left">0.015</td><td align="left"><bold>4.7</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Italy &#x02013; Ossola [29]</td><td align="left">2100</td><td align="left"><bold>14.2</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td><td align="left"><bold>-</bold></td><td align="left">-</td><td align="left"><bold>1.4</bold></td><td align="left">&#x0003c; 0.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Bosnia and Herzegovina* [12]</td><td align="left">200</td><td align="left"><bold>11.3</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td><td align="left"><bold>-</bold></td><td align="left">-</td><td align="left"><bold>4</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Serbia and Montenegro* [26]</td><td align="left">318</td><td align="left"><bold>15.7</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td><td align="left"><bold>1.6</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td><td align="left"><bold>1.6</bold></td><td align="left">0.012</td></tr><tr><td align="left">The Czech Republic* [9]</td><td align="left">481</td><td align="left"><bold>15</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td><td align="left"><bold>1.2</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td><td align="left"><bold>3.4</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Poland* [10]</td><td align="left">871</td><td align="left"><bold>16.2</bold></td><td align="left">0.002</td><td align="left"><bold>-</bold></td><td align="left">-</td><td align="left"><bold>3.1</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Germany [31]</td><td align="left">500</td><td align="left"><bold>10.8</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td><td align="left"><bold>-</bold></td><td align="left">-</td><td align="left"><bold>4.5</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Denmark [32]</td><td align="left">2501</td><td align="left"><bold>13.3</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td><td align="left"><bold>-</bold></td><td align="left">-</td><td align="left"><bold>5.7</bold></td><td align="left">&#x0003c; 0.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left">France [4]</td><td align="left">410</td><td align="left"><bold>14</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td><td align="left"><bold>1.95</bold></td><td align="left">NS</td><td align="left"><bold>7.7</bold></td><td align="left">&#x0003c; 0.001</td></tr><tr><td align="left">United Kingdom [21]</td><td align="left">10556</td><td align="left"><bold>15.3</bold></td><td align="left">&#x0003c; 0,001</td><td align="left"><bold>-</bold></td><td align="left">-</td><td align="left"><bold>8,2</bold></td><td align="left">&#x0003c; 0.001</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>n, number of subjects examined; -, no data; NS not significant.

The observed genotype frequency for H63D, S65C and C282Y mutations in the Slovenian population agrees with those reported for the Central European populations, although some deviations were observed in comparison with populations of Slavic origin. A revision of restrictions by the national guidelines on blood donation from otherwise healthy HH patients should be done before the implementation of population screening for HH in order to promote more blood donors necessary to mantain adequate blood supply.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MC and TV contributed equally to this study.
