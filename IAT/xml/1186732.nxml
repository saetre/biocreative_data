The differences in their function are thought to stem from their different gene expression patterns, morphologies, and synaptic connectivities. In this study, we have examined the photoreceptor cells of the <italic>retinal degeneration 7</italic><italic>(rd7)</italic> mutant mouse, a model for the human enhanced S-cone syndrome (ESCS). This mutant carries a spontaneous deletion in the mouse ortholog of NR2E3, an orphan nuclear receptor transcription factor mutated in ESCS. Employing microarray and in situ hybridization analysis we have found that the <italic>rd7</italic> retina contains a modestly increased number of S-opsin&#x02013;expressing cells that ultrastructurally appear to be normal cones. Strikingly, the majority of the photoreceptors in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina represent a morphologically hybrid cell type that expresses both rod- and cone-specific genes. In addition, in situ hybridization screening of genes shown to be up-regulated in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant retina by microarray identified ten new cone-specific or cone-enriched genes with a wide range of biochemical functions, including two genes specifically involved in glucose/glycogen metabolism. We suggest that the abnormal electroretinograms, slow retinal degeneration, and retinal dysmorphology seen in humans with ESCS may, in part, be attributable to the aberrant function of a hybrid photoreceptor cell type similar to that identified in this study. The functional diversity of the novel cone-specific genes identified here indicates molecular differences between rods and cones extending far beyond those previously discovered.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Vision begins with light entering the eye. This light is projected onto the retina, a thin neural structure lining the inside of the eye. Photoreceptors, among the most important cell types in the retina, are the first to receive the incoming rays of light. In mammals, there are two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods are specialized for nighttime vision, and cones for daytime and color vision. In this study, the authors examined the photoreceptors of a mouse with a gene mutation that causes photoreceptors to develop abnormally. Humans with a similar mutation have a form of blindness called enhanced S-cone syndrome (ESCS). Surprisingly, the majority of photoreceptors in this mutant mouse were found to have features of both normal rods and cones. It is possible that the abnormal features of these photoreceptors predispose them to undergo premature death. If this model accurately reflects the situation in human patients with ESCS, it may provide an explanation for the loss of vision seen in this disease. This study also elucidated previously unknown molecular differences between normal rods and cones. This new knowledge may contribute to a better overall understanding of the mechanisms underlying night, day, and color vision.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Corbo JC, Cepko CL (2005) A hybrid photoreceptor expressing both rod and cone genes in a mouse model of enhanced s-cone syndrome.

The cDNA microarray used in this study contains approximately 12,000 different cDNAs largely derived from the retina and nervous system, and the Affymetrix microarray contains over 34,000 genes. Experiments at all timepoints were carried out in triplicate, and stringent criteria were applied in deciding whether a given gene was up- or down-regulated in the mutant (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details).</p><p>These experiments demonstrated widespread up-regulation of cone-specific and cone-enriched genes in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina, especially by postnatal day 14 (P14) and P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Most known cone-specific or cone-enriched genes were found to be up-regulated in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g001">Figure 1</xref>, genes G1&#x02013;G15). The majority of these genes represent components of the phototransduction cascade (e.g., opsins, transducins, and phosphodiesterase subunits). In addition to these genes, several novel cone-specific genes of unknown function recently identified in our lab were also up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g001">Figure 1</xref>, genes G16, G17, G21, and G24; unpublished data). Finally, a wide range of other genes, most with no previously recognized role in the retina, were found to be up-regulated in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g001">Figure 1</xref>, G26&#x02013;G53; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-st001">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-st002">S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-sg001">Figures S1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-sg007">S7</xref>).</p><p><italic>Nr2e3</italic> expression is first detectable by in situ hybridization around embryonic day 18 (E18); it then peaks around P6 and subsequently decreases to adult levels by P21 (unpublished data). In accordance with this time course of expression, almost no gene expression changes were found at P0, with progressively more changes at later timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g001">Figure 1</xref>). One exception to this statement is the gene RIKEN cDNA 4933409K07 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g001">Figure 1</xref>, gene G47), which was the only gene shown to be up-regulated at all timepoints examined. Additional discussion of this gene and its unusual expression pattern will be presented below.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Two Distinct Patterns of Cone Gene Derepression in <italic>rd7</italic></title><p>In order to confirm these microarray results, an in situ hybridization analysis of the putative up-regulated cone genes was carried out in which the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant retina was compared with age-matched, wild-type controls. We found that the majority of the cone-specific genes that were up-regulated in microarray experiments were derepressed when assessed by in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g002">Figure 2</xref>). There were two major patterns of cone gene derepression. The more common pattern (type I) manifested itself as ectopic gene expression throughout the ONL, consistent with gene expression in all photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g002">Figure 2</xref>; upper left photomicrographs). Typical examples of this pattern of derepression are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g002">Figure 2</xref>, and many more are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-st001">Table S1</xref>. This pattern of expression contrasts sharply with the usual pattern of cone gene expression, which consists of scattered cells localized to the scleral edge of the ONL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The second category of cone gene derepression (type II) consisted of a patchy, salt-and-pepper pattern of ectopic expression in which individual positive cells were scattered throughout the ONL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g002">Figure 2</xref>, upper right photomicrographs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-st001">Table S1</xref>). Although numerous positive cells were present in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina (particularly in the ventral portion), there were clearly many interspersed cells that showed a complete absence of expression. In order to rule out the possibility that these scattered positive cells were simply the normal complement of cones that had failed to localize their cell bodies to the scleral edge of the ONL, the number of positive cells in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina was quantitated by dissociated cell in situ hybridization.</p><p>Dissociated cell in situ hybridization was performed using a probe for the S-cone opsin gene <italic>(Opn1sw),</italic> which shows type II derepression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g003">3</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g003">3</xref>C). S-opsin was expressed in 3.2&#x00025; of retinal cells in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant (66 S-opsin&#x02013;positive cells out of 2,056 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole &#x0005b;DAPI&#x0005d;-positive cells). This value is approximately 2-fold greater than the percentage of S-opsin&#x02013;positive cells identified in wild-type control retinas, 1.65&#x00025; (54 S-opsin-positive cells out of 3,271 DAPI-positive cells), and accords well with the previously reported value of 2- to 3-fold more S-opsin&#x02013;positive cells in <italic>rd7</italic> compared to wild type arrived at by antibody staining of tissue sections &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Previous studies have estimated that the total number of cones in the mouse retina is 2&#x00025; of all retinal cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;, and that S-opsin is largely repressed in cones in the dorsal third of the retina &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. The estimate of 1.65&#x00025; S-opsin&#x02013;positive cells in the wild-type retina is in agreement with these data. The fact that only 3.2&#x00025; of all retinal cells are S-opsin&#x02013;positive in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant also confirms that the majority of the photoreceptors (which make up just over 70&#x00025; of the cells in the adult mouse retina) do not express this gene. In order to assess whether these supernumerary S-opsin&#x02013;expressing cells coexpressed rod-specific markers, a double antibody staining for S-opsin and rhodopsin was performed. This study showed mutually exclusive domains of expression of S-opsin and rhodopsin in the photoreceptor outer segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g003">Figure 3</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g003">3</xref>F). This finding suggests that the supernumerary S-opsin&#x02013;expressing cells in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina may represent normal &#x0201c;blue&#x0201d; cones.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Novel Cone-Specific Genes Are Derepressed in <italic>rd7</italic></title><p>Given that the majority of known cone-specific genes showed marked derepression in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant, additional candidate genes up-regulated on microarray analysis were evaluated for cone-specific expression. In situ hybridization was performed on an additional 45 up-regulated genes, confirming that 21 of them were derepressed. Of these, at least ten showed a definite cone-specific or cone-enriched pattern of expression in the wild-type retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g001">Figure 1</xref>, genes G26&#x02013;G35). Several examples are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g004">Figure 4</xref>. Note that in the wild-type retina, there is a relatively weak pattern of scattered positive cells at the scleral edge of the ONL, consistent with a cone-specific pattern of expression. All of these genes show marked derepression in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina. A number of these novel cone-specific genes showed a striking localization of their transcripts to the photoreceptor inner segment (e.g., Bub1b and Tcta). This localization manifests in a section in situ hybridization as a dark band of staining just beyond the outer edge of the ONL immediately underlying the outer segment layer. Although such a pattern of transcript localization is commonly seen in many rod-specific genes (e.g., <italic>Rho</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g002">Figure 2</xref>; <italic>Pcdh21,</italic><italic>Rbp3,</italic> and <italic>Cnga1</italic> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-st002">Table S2</xref>), it is not easily appreciated in cone-specific genes, possibly due to the relative scarcity of cones in the mouse. In the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant retina in which such genes are widely derepressed, such a pattern of transcript localization often becomes apparent.</p><p>In addition to the ten genes that showed cone-specific expression in the wild-type retina, another 11 novel genes were derepressed in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina by in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g001">Figure 1</xref>, genes G36&#x02013;G46). Some of these genes showed faint expression in a cone-like distribution (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-st001">Table S1</xref>, genes G36, G40, and G44), and one appeared to be expressed throughout the ONL but at greater levels in cones than in rods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-st001">Table S1</xref>, gene G37). The remainder of the up-regulated genes did not have detectable cone staining in the wild-type retina. Despite this apparent absence of cone staining, the pattern of derepression in <italic>rd7</italic> suggests that these genes may also be novel cone-specific genes, albeit expressed at levels below the sensitivity threshold of our in situ hybridization assay.</p><p>In most cases, the novel cone genes identified in this study appear to have a type I pattern of derepression. However, due to the weakness of the signal in some cases, or transcript localization to the inner segment in others, it was not always possible to determine with confidence which of the two patterns of derepression (if either) each of these genes displayed. In terms of functional categorization, the novel cone genes cover a broad range including glucose metabolism <italic>(Pygm</italic> and <italic>Glo1),</italic> fatty acid metabolism <italic>(Elovl2),</italic> DNA repair <italic>(Smug1),</italic> cell cycle/chromosome segregation <italic>(Bub1b),</italic> carcinogenesis <italic>(Tcta),</italic> endothelial biology <italic>(Ece1),</italic> cytoskeletal function <italic>(Ebp4.1l1),</italic> and even otolith formation <italic>(Otop3)</italic>.</p><p>A relatively frequent finding among both previously identified cone-specific genes, as well as in some of those identified in the present study, is the occurrence of gene expression in an early photoreceptor precursor pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This pattern of expression consists of positive staining by in situ hybridization specifically at the scleral border of the retina during prenatal timepoints (in the range of E13&#x02013;E18). <italic>Gnb3</italic> and <italic>Thrb2</italic> are two examples of known cone genes with this early pattern of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Two of the 11 novel cone genes identified in this study also have this early photoreceptor pattern of expression <italic>(Ece1</italic> and <italic>Otop3)</italic>. Intriguingly, three genes shown to be up-regulated in <italic>rd7</italic> on microarray, but that had either no detectable signal by in situ hybridization at adult stages or no apparent change in expression by in situ hybridization between wild type and <italic>rd7,</italic> also showed this early photoreceptor pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g001">Figure 1</xref>, genes G48&#x02013;G50). The embryonic expression pattern of two of these genes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g005">Figure 5</xref> (the embryonic in situ hybridization for the third, G50, can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-st001">Table S1</xref>). Although the significance of such early photoreceptor expression is not known, it is possible that these genes may also be cone-specific but are expressed at undetectably low levels in the adult.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>M-Opsin and Thyroid Hormone Receptor &#x003b2;2 Are Unchanged in the <italic>rd7</italic> Mutant</title><p>Only two cone-specific genes failed to show any change in expression by either microarray or in situ hybridization in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant: M-opsin <italic>(Opn1mw)</italic> and thyroid hormone receptor &#x003b2;2 <italic>(Thrb2)</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-sg008">Figure S8</xref>).

Furthermore, the repression of S-opsin expression in the dorsal third of the mouse retina is thought to depend, at least in part, on Thrb2 since S-opsin shows dorsal derepression in the <italic>Thrb2</italic> mutant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

This finding is consistent with the normal expression pattern and function of <italic>Thrb2</italic> in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant.</p><p>One further finding to note is that the cell bodies of the M-opsin&#x02013;positive cells appear to be scattered throughout the ONL in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant at P14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-sg008">Figure S8</xref>). Despite this fact, their overall number does not appear to be increased relative to wild-type.

This gene showed a unique pattern of expression in the adult <italic>rd7</italic> mutant retina. Whereas there was only a barely detectable hint of expression in the inner nuclear layer (INL) in the wild-type retina, this gene showed strong expression in the middle and vitreal thirds of the INL as well as patchy expression in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and at the scleral edge of the ONL in <italic>rd7</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-st001">Table S1</xref>). This in situ hybridization pattern is consistent with staining in M&#x000fc;ller glia, the principal glial cell type of the mouse retina. One possible interpretation of this unusual expression pattern is that it represents an early reaction of M&#x000fc;ller glia to injury in this mutant.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>The Majority of the Photoreceptors in the <italic>rd7</italic> Retina Represent a Morphologically Hybrid Cell Type</title><p>In order to assess the morphologic effects of the above gene expression changes, the ultrastructure of the photoreceptor cell bodies in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant was examined.

In the wild-type mouse, cone cell bodies are aligned along the scleral border of the ONL, and they are larger than those of rods. They have a smaller, more irregular mass of nuclear heterochromatin that is often broken up into multiple discrete clumps connected by thin threads. They also have more abundant electron-lucent euchromatin than rods. Lastly, they frequently have a patch of organelle-rich cytoplasm next to their nuclei, usually containing large mitochondria &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Analysis of toluidine blue-stained semi-thin sections revealed that such cone-like cells were present in greater abundance in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina than in wild-type, and that their somata were scattered throughout the ONL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g007">Figure 7</xref>). A comparison between the distribution of these cells and those expressing S-cone opsin strongly suggests that they represent the same cell population (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g007">Figure 7</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g007">7</xref>F). Analysis of the nuclear morphology of dissociated retinal cells stained for S-cone opsin by dissociated cell in situ hybridization confirmed that this is the case (unpublished data). These findings, along with the absence of rhodopsin staining in these cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g003">Figure 3</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g003">3</xref>F), suggest that these &#x0201c;cone-like&#x0201d; cells in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant retina may represent supernumerary normal cones with an abnormal localization of their cell bodies.</p><p>In contrast to the cone cell body, the wild-type rod soma is small and nearly round.

The second cell population in the ONL of the <italic>rd7</italic> retina has some of the nuclear features of normal rods, such as a single, dense mass of heterochromatin and moderately electron-dense euchromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g007">Figure 7</xref>H); yet these cells also show features of cones. First, the euchromatin is, on average, more abundant in these cells than in wild-type rods (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g007">Figure 7</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g007">7</xref>H). In addition, comparison of the diagrammatic representation of the wild-type and <italic>rd7</italic> ONLs suggests that the average area of the S-opsin&#x02013;negative cells in <italic>rd7</italic> is greater than in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g007">Figure 7</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g007">7</xref>D). In order to confirm this impression, we quantitated the area of 50 wild-type and 50 mutant rod-like cell bodies (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). This experiment confirmed that the average area of the rod-like somata in <italic>rd7</italic> is approximately 30&#x00025; larger than that of wild-type rod somata (mean area in <italic>rd7</italic> was 9.75 &#x000b1; 1.36 (standard deviation) &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>, compared to wild-type rods, with 7.53 &#x000b1; 0.72 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> ; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 50; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 7.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;16</sup>, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). It is also notable that the standard deviation of the somal area is nearly twice as great in <italic>rd7</italic> than in wild-type, confirming the subjective impression of greater variability in somal size and shape in the mutant compared to the wild-type (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g007">Figure 7</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g007">7</xref>D).</p><p>Lastly, 38&#x00025; (19/50) of the <italic>rd7</italic> photoreceptors selected for somal area quantitation had prominent juxtanuclear mitochondria (red arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g007">Figure 7</xref>H; unpublished data). Such juxtanuclear organelles are only very rarely seen in normal rods (1.5&#x00025;; six out of 399 cells counted), but are common in cones (yellow arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g007">Figure 7</xref>H). In conclusion, it is clear that this second cell population in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina has morphological features of both normal rods and cones consistent with the coexpression of many rod- and cone-specific genes in these cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper we have determined that the primary role of the rod-specific transcription factor, Nr2e3, is to maintain cone genes transcriptionally silent within rods. We have identified two patterns of cone gene derepression in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant retina, in agreement with a previous report by Chen et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;. The first pattern of derepression identified (type I) consists of ectopic expression of cone genes in the vast majority of cells in the ONL. These cells were also shown to coexpress all rod genes tested. Consistent with the hybrid pattern of gene expression in these cells, electron microscopic analysis revealed them to be morphologically intermediate between normal rods and cones.</p><p>Although genes showing type I derepression demonstrated staining in the majority of cells in the ONL, two lines of evidence suggest that these genes are not completely derepressed in these cells when compared to their expression in S-opsin&#x02013;expressing cones. First, close evaluation of the staining pattern of a number of type I genes in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant retina (e.g., see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-st001">Table S1</xref>, genes G9, G19, and G24), reveals that, in addition to the background staining throughout the ONL, there is a more darkly staining subpopulation of cells scattered throughout this layer in a distribution corresponding to that of the supernumerary S-cone opsin-expressing cells. This pattern of staining suggests that these genes are more highly expressed in S-opsin expressing cells than in the hybrid cells of the <italic>rd7</italic> retina.</p><p>The second line of evidence derives from a comparison of the expression pattern of many type I genes in <italic>rd7</italic> and <italic>Nrl</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutant backgrounds. As mentioned above, <italic>Nrl</italic> is a retinal transcription factor that, when mutated, results in en masse conversion of rods into S-opsin&#x02013;expressing cones &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b24">24</xref>&#x0005d;. It can be inferred from this fact that <italic>Nrl</italic> is absolutely required for the normal silencing of cone-specific genes in rods. In the <italic>Nrl</italic> homozygous mutant, there is a stronger and more uniform derepression of many cone-specific genes throughout the ONL than is seen in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina (unpublished data). This finding further suggests that, in addition to its repression of cone gene expression via induction of <italic>Nr2e3</italic> expression, <italic>Nrl</italic> exerts an additional level of negative control over cone genes either directly or via a second, as yet uncharacterized, repressor.</p><p>The second pattern of derepression seen in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina (type II), is represented by a scattered population of cells throughout the ONL that shows derepression of several cone-specific genes, including S-cone opsin. By ultrastructural criteria, these cells appear to be normal cones, albeit with displaced cell bodies. Quantitation of these supernumerary S-cone opsin-positive cells indicates that they are approximately 2-fold more abundant than in normal retina, consistent with previous antibody studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Two recent studies have presented data that are consistent with many of the findings in our study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Both studies showed that cone genes in addition to S-cone opsin are derepressed in the mouse <italic>rd7</italic> mutant. In addition, Peng et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d; found by RT-PCR that the levels of several rod-specific genes, including <italic>rhodopsin,</italic> were modestly reduced in <italic>rd7</italic> at P28. Our in situ hybridization data suggest that rhodopsin expression is markedly reduced at P6, but that it attains levels indistinguishable from wild-type by P14. Since the change in rhodopsin levels identified by Peng et al. were relatively small (an approximately 15&#x00025; reduction), it is not surprising that such a difference was not detected by in situ hybridization. The overall finding of modest reductions in rod-specific gene expression is entirely in keeping with the results of the present study.</p><p>In addition to demonstrating derepression of a range of known cone-specific genes in <italic>rd7</italic> mutants, Chen et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d; showed up-regulation by Northern blot of two additional genes in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant, <italic>Elovl2</italic> and <italic>Fabp7</italic>. These two genes were also found to be up-regulated in <italic>rd7</italic> in the present study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-st001">Table S1</xref>). Although we found <italic>Elovl2</italic> to have a cone-enriched pattern of expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g001">Figure 1</xref>), in situ hybridization analysis of <italic>Fabp7</italic> failed to show a signal in wild-type or mutant retina (unpublished data). Nevertheless, previous studies have suggested that <italic>Fabp7</italic> is expressed in radial glia and immature astrocytes in the brain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b30">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Given the expression pattern elsewhere in the nervous system, it is possible that <italic>Fabp7</italic> is up-regulated in M&#x000fc;ller glia in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina in response to injury in a manner akin to the novel M&#x000fc;ller glial gene identified in this study, RIKEN cDNA 4933409K07 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g001">Figure 1</xref>, gene G47). Indirect support for this idea is provided by the observation that <italic>Fabp7</italic> is up-regulated by microarray analysis in <italic>Nrl</italic> and <italic>Crx</italic> mutant retinas as well (unpublished data), suggesting that this change may represent a generalized response to injury in the retina rather than derepression of a cone-enriched gene.</p><p>The study by Chen et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d; made two further observations worthy of note. First, they identified a zebrafish homolog of <italic>Nr2e3</italic> and showed it to be expressed in photoreceptors. Interestingly, they showed that this homolog appears to have a pan-photoreceptor pattern of expression early in development that later resolves into a rod-specific pattern of expression. This early expression in cones may represent a mechanism whereby the expression of cone-specific gene products is temporarily repressed. It will be important to determine the extent to which the function of <italic>Nr2e3</italic> has been conserved in the retina of such a distantly related organism. Secondly, Chen et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d; used an in vitro oligonucleotide selection protocol to determine the preferred binding site for <italic>Nr2e3</italic>. This information will be very useful for future bioinformatic analyses of <italic>Nr2e3</italic> target genes.</p><p>The gene expression changes identified in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant retina in the present study suggest the scheme of gene regulation in mouse rods depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g008">Figure 8</xref>. As this diagram implies, there appear to be at least two different repressors of cone genes within rods, Nr2e3 and either Nrl itself or an additional unknown transcription factor downstream of Nrl, here termed &#x0201c;transcription factor X.&#x0201d; In fact, it appears that the differences between type I and type II cone genes may simply depend on which repressor&#x02014;Nr2e3 or transcription factor X&#x02014;is primarily responsible for the regulation of the gene in question. In the case of type I genes, Nr2e3 is the primary repressor and transcription factor X is of secondary importance. In the case of type II genes, transcription factor X exerts the major repressive effect on transcription, and Nr2e3 plays a lesser, but still important role.</p><p>In contrast to the marked derepression of the vast majority of cone-specific genes in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant, two genes stand out as being unaffected by the mutation: the gene encoding M-opsin and <italic>Thrb2</italic>. As <italic>Thrb2</italic> is known to be required for the expression of M-opsin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;, the absence of supernumerary M-opsin&#x02013;positive cells may simply be a consequence of the fact that <italic>Thrb2</italic> expression is unchanged in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant. Further support for this idea has been provided by recent work in our lab showing widespread derepression of cone genes in the <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> retina (unpublished data). In contrast to the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant, <italic>Notch1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> retinas show marked derepression of <italic>Thrb2</italic> and a corresponding derepression of the gene that encodes M-opsin. An additional observation suggesting that M-opsin and S-opsin are controlled by different mechanisms comes from in vitro experiments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;. While explanted P3 retinas express S-opsin and M-opsin with normal kinetics, explanted P0 retinas express only S-opsin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;. The factor(s) controlling these differences are unknown, but may be intrinsic, as cocultures of older and younger retinas, conditioned media from older retinas, and addition of a variety of small molecules were unable to promote the expression of M-opsin in the P0-initiated cultures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In contrast to our findings, Peng et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b19">19</xref>&#x0005d; reported that M-opsin expression is mildly increased in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant retina. It is possible that a subtle increase in M-opsin transcript levels does occur in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina, and that this difference could not be detected by in situ hybridization. Since virtually all M-opsin&#x02013;expressing cells are localized at the outer edge of the ONL by P28 in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-sg008">Figure S8</xref>), any increase in M-opsin transcript in the mutant must have occurred in cells in that location.</p><p>A variety of novel cone-specific or cone-enriched genes were characterized in this study. One of these genes, <italic>Pygm,</italic> is involved in glycogen/glucose metabolism, and a second, <italic>Glo1,</italic> is required for detoxification of methylglyoxal, a byproduct of glycolysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b33">33</xref>&#x0005d;. A third gene involved in glucose metabolism, <italic>hexokinase 2</italic><italic>(Hk2),</italic> is also derepressed in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant and shows a pattern of expression in the wild-type retina, suggesting greater expression in cones than in rods (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010011-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-st001">Table S1</xref>). A fourth gene involved in glucose metabolism, <italic>glucokinase regulatory protein (Gckr),</italic> was found to be increased in three out of three microarrays at P21 but was not tested by in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-st004">Table S4</xref>). The increased expression of <italic>Gckr</italic> in <italic>rd7</italic> mutant retina suggests that it too may be a cone-enriched gene. A previous study found that two of these genes, <italic>Pygm</italic> and <italic>Hk2,</italic> have markedly elevated tag levels in an ONL-specific serial analysis of gene expression library consistent with their being highly enriched in wild-type photoreceptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b34">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, prior studies have suggested differences in glycogen and glucose metabolism between primate rods and cones &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b35">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Our findings lend further support to this concept. Interestingly, <italic>Pygm</italic> has been implicated in human disease. Mutations in this gene underlie McArdle's disease (glycogen storage disease type V), the symptoms of which include exercise intolerance, muscle cramps, and myoglobinuria &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;. To our knowledge, no abnormalities of retinal function have been reported.</p><p>One of the most curious findings in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant retina was the occurrence of two different types of changes: an increase in the number of S-opsin&#x02013;expressing cones and a transformation of rods into hybrid photoreceptors. It is known that <italic>Nr2e3</italic> is expressed only in rods, and the transcript is first detectable in postmitotic cells (J. Trimarchi and CLC, unpublished data). Assuming that Nr2e3 acts cell autonomously, we can conclude that the supernumerary S-cone&#x02013;positive cells and the hybrid photoreceptors identified in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina were redirected to these fates from postmitotic cells that were destined to become rods. This conclusion raises this question: Why does loss of a single transcription factor within rod precursors lead to two alternative fates&#x02014;a hybrid cell type on the one hand and apparently normal S-cones on the other? There are at least two possible explanations for these differences.</p><p>First, it is possible that there are two distinct types of rod precursor; loss of <italic>Nr2e3</italic> in one leads to S-cone fate and in the other results in a hybrid cell type. In fact, there is experimental evidence from the rat to support the conclusion that early-born and late-born rods are intrinsically different &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d;. One test of the hypothesis that there are two temporally distinct rod precursor populations would be to carry out birthdating experiments to determine whether the supernumerary S-opsin&#x02013;positive cells in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina derived exclusively from an early- or late-born population. Of course, if this were not the case, this experiment could not rule out the possibility that molecularly distinct populations of rod precursors are present simultaneously in the developing retina.</p><p>An alternative explanation would be that there is only a single, homogeneous population of postmitotic rod precursors in the mouse, and a stochastic event triggers assumption of the S-cone fate in a small subpopulation of these cells in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant. Recent studies in a variety of experiment systems suggest that such a stochastic, all-or-none mechanism of gene activation is commonplace &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b44">44</xref>&#x0005d;. In this scenario, the absence of Nr2e3 would alter the probability that an unknown master control gene is expressed in rod precursors. Once this event takes place, it would initiate an irreversible program of differentiation toward S-cone fate, albeit at a relatively low frequency. In this way, a subset of cells from an initially homogeneous population would select the S-cone fate in an entirely probabilistic manner.</p><p>Human patients with ESCS display three types of abnormality attributable to the retina: (1) an atypical ERG waveform that is preferentially sensitive to short-wavelength light, (2) slowly progressive retinal degeneration, and (3) abnormal retinal lamination with rosette formation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b13">13</xref>&#x0005d;. The <italic>rd7</italic> mutant mice also demonstrate the latter two defects, but have a normal ERG &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b45">45</xref>&#x0005d;. These similarities and differences between the two species help to explain the possible mechanistic basis of the ESCS.</p><p>The fact that the <italic>rd7</italic> mouse has a normal ERG strongly suggests that the aberrant ERG in ESCS is not attributable to the activity of a hybrid photoreceptor identical to that found in this study. Namely, the signal is unlikely to derive from a population of cells coexpressing both rod and cone genes but whose photopigment is rhodopsin and not S-cone opsin. This conclusion is consistent with the evidence from human ESCS patients indicating a markedly reduced rod system and a lack of measurable rhodopsin by reflection densitometry &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b11">11</xref>&#x0005d;. It is also unlikely that we would fail to detect an ESCS-like ERG signal in mice if it were present, as such a signal has been demonstrated in the <italic>Nrl</italic> mutant mouse, which has a near total transformation of all its rods into blue cones &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b24">24</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>These findings, however, do not rule out the possibility that the abnormal human ERG derives from a hybrid photoreceptor cell type that also expresses S-opsin. It is possible that there are gene regulatory differences between mice and humans such that in human <italic>NR2E3</italic> mutants, S-opsin shows a type I pattern of derepression rather than a type II as in seen in the <italic>rd7</italic> mouse, and is therefore expressed in all of the hybrid photoreceptor cells. Alternatively, the ratio of supernumerary S-cones to hybrid photoreceptors produced in the retina of ESCS patients might be such that a higher percentage of the presumptive rods in ESCS patients become S-cones rather than hybrid photoreceptors. As discussed above, this ratio could depend either on the relative percentages of two distinct rod precursor populations or on stochastic effects on regulatory gene expression.</p><p>In contrast to the ERG differences between mouse <italic>rd7</italic> and human <italic>NR2E3</italic> mutants, both species demonstrate slow retinal degeneration. It is possible that this degeneration is attributable to the abnormal function of the hybrid photoreceptor cell type characterized in the present study. The coexpression of both rod and cone genes in the same cell could predispose the cell to apoptosis.</p><p>The final common feature between mouse <italic>rd7</italic> and human <italic>NR2E3</italic> mutants is the presence of an abnormally laminated retina with waviness and rosette formation in the ONL &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;. The cause of this abnormality is not known, but it is possibly related to defects in photoreceptor cell polarity in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant. Rosette formation and abnormally wavy epithelia are common sequelae of defects in pathways controlling cell polarity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b47">47</xref>&#x0005d;. In particular, loss-of-function mutations in the polarity gene <italic>crumbs</italic><italic>(CRB1)</italic> have been shown to cause morphological abnormalities of the ONL in both humans and mice, including rosette formation in mice very similar to that seen in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b49">49</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, Sharon et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b05">5</xref>&#x0005d; have recently pointed out additional features shared by patients with <italic>CRB1</italic> mutations and mutations in <italic>NR2E3,</italic> including hyperopic refractive errors and a distinctive pattern of clumped pigmentation in the retina.</p><p>In the present study we found the mouse <italic>crumbs</italic> ortholog to be up-regulated in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant retina by microarray, consistent with its higher expression level in cones than in rods &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b50">50</xref>&#x0005d;. Although we were unable to confirm this finding by in situ hybridization due to the weakness of the signal, it is possible that the up-regulation of crumbs in the retina is the cause of the lamination defects seen in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant. Overexpression of wild-type <italic>crumbs</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has been shown to cause polarity defects leading to waviness of epithelia and even to misalignment of nuclei within photoreceptors analogous to what is seen in the <italic>rd7</italic> retina &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b51">51</xref>&#x0005d;. Future experiments will address this question by overexpressing full-length <italic>Crb1</italic> in a wild-type background.</p><p>One further point worthy of note is the striking similarity between the hybrid photoreceptor identified in this study and a naturally occurring photoreceptor found in ground squirrels. The &#x0201c;rods&#x0201d; of this species have electrophysiologic, molecular, and ultrastructural features of both rods and cones &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010011-b58">58</xref>&#x0005d;.

The lens was gently removed and the eyecup allowed to fix for 2 h at room temperature. The fixed eye was then placed on dental wax and sectioned in the midline with a fresh razor blade (half of the retinas were sectioned along the D-V axis and half along the nasal-temporal axis). The retinas (and attached retinal pigment epithelium) were carefully dissected away from the sclera, which was discarded.</p><p>The retinas were then rinsed four times for 15 min each with Sorenson's buffer (pH 7.4).

Such images typically contained 35&#x02013;45 cell bodies. In order to quantitate only the area of those cell bodies that were cut as near to the midline of the cell as possible (i.e., in order to obtain the maximal cross-sectional area) the five cells with the largest apparent area in each photograph were chosen by eye and the outline of the cell membranes were traced onto white paper. These tracings were scanned along with the size bar from the electron micrographs, and the areas of the resulting digital images were quantitated using Scion Image software (NIH Image, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image</ext-link>). A total of 50 cells of each genotype were quantitated in this manner. In addition, in order to evaluate the percentage of rods in the wild-type retina that had any juxtanuclear mitochondria, all rods within all ten images were counted as were the number of cells showing juxtanuclear organelles. A total of six out of 399 wild-type rods (1.5&#x00025;) possessed a juxtanuclear organelle.

&#x0201c;Gene Name&#x0201d; is as follows: light blue (G1&#x02013;G15), genes previously reported in the literature to have cone-specific or cone-enriched patterns of expression; yellow (G16&#x02013;G25), novel cone genes identified in an unrelated study (unpublished data); dark green (G26&#x02013;G36), novel cone genes identified in the present study that were up-regulated in <italic>rd7;</italic> light green (G37&#x02013;G46), additional genes found to be up-regulated in <italic>rd7</italic> by microarray in the present study but that had either weak or inapparent cone-specific signal on in situ hybridization; white (G47&#x02013;G53), additional genes up-regulated by microarray at two different timepoints but with either unusual expression patterns or nonconfirmatory in situ hybridizations. The column &#x0201c;ID&#x0201d; contains identifiers used in the present paper to refer to specific genes. &#x0201c;GenBank ID&#x0201d; contains the GenBank accession number of the clone used to make the probe for in situ hybridization. Within this column, &#x0201c;lab clone&#x0201d; indicates that the probe used for in situ hybridization derived from a clone in our laboratory. The region of the gene to which it corresponds is indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010011-st001">Table S1</xref>. Columns &#x0201c;P0&#x0201d; through &#x0201c;P21&#x0201d; contain the results of microarray experiments at the given postnatal dates. P0, P6, and P14 time points represent analyses on cDNA microarrays; the P21 time point represents data from an Affymetrix microarray (mouse genome 432 2.0). A red cell with a single up arrow indicates that the gene in question was up-regulated in three out of three microarrays at that time point (as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Those cells labeled orange with a single up arrow and asterisk indicate that the gene in question was up-regulated in two out of three microarrays at that time point. The column &#x0201c;In Situ&#x0201d; lists the type of derepression seen for the gene in question in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant retina (type I and type II are described in the main text). Genes designated &#x0201c;unclassified&#x0201d; represent patterns of derepression that were difficult to classify as either type I or type II (see main text for more details). &#x0201c;Wild type&#x0201d; in this column indicates that the in situ hybridization pattern in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant retina was not different from the wild-type pattern; and &#x0201c;special&#x0201d; indicates a special pattern of expression discussed more fully in the main text. The column &#x0201c;Expression Pattern&#x0201d; contains a concise description of the wild-type expression pattern of the gene in question. In the case of genes for which no signal was obtained on in situ hybridization in the present study, the specified expression pattern derives from reports in the literature. Within this column, &#x0201c;cone &#x0003e; rod&#x0201d; indicates that the gene is expressed in all photoreceptors, but at higher levels in cones than rods; &#x0201c;cone?&#x0201d; indicates very weak staining in a cone-like distribution.</p><p>BP, bipolar cells; EP, early photoreceptor expression pattern; IS, inner core segment localization; MG, M&#x000fc;ller glia; N/A, not available on the microarray; NS, no signal detected on in situ hybridization; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0010011.g001"/></fig><fig id="pgen-0010011-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Cone and Rod Gene Expression in the <italic>rd7</italic> Mutant at P14</title><p>The upper sets of photomicrographs demonstrate examples of type I and type II cone gene derepression in the <italic>rd7</italic> mutant retina as explained in the main text.
