Although formation of nascent AJs has received much attention, whether shared mechanisms are responsible for the maintenance and remodeling of AJs in dynamic epithelia, particularly in vivo, is not clear. Using clonal analysis in the postmitotic <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> pupal eye epithelium, we demonstrate that Rho1 is required to maintain AJ integrity independent of its role in sustaining apical cell tension. Rho1 depletion in a remodeling postmitotic epithelium disrupts AJs but only when depleted in adjacent cells. Surprisingly, neither of the Rho effectors, Rok or Dia, is necessary downstream of Rho1 to maintain AJs; instead, Rho1 maintains AJs by inhibiting <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial cadherin endocytosis in a Cdc42/Par6-dependent manner. In contrast, depletion of Rho1 in single cells decreases apical tension, and Rok and myosin are necessary, while Dia function also contributes, downstream of Rho1 to sustain apical cell tension.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>A hallmark of epithelia is the presence of intercellular junctions. The two apical-most junctions are tight junctions and adherens junctions (AJs). AJs mediate adhesion between cells and, by coupling to the actomyosin cytoskeleton, provide for tension within epithelial sheets or between cells. The core component of AJs is epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin), and proper localization and function of E-cadherin is critical for the development and morphogenesis of metazoans and maintenance of adult epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gumbiner, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Distinct E-cadherin adhesive functions are required during the formation and stabilization of newly forming or nascent AJs, as opposed to maintenance and remodeling of formed AJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capaldo and Macara, 2007</xref>). The former process has been extensively characterized using cell biological systems such as MDCK epithelial cells, in which the formation of nascent AJs can occur between two single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1998</xref>) or within a monolayer of cells in response to calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gumbiner et al., 1988</xref>), and developmental systems such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryogenesis, in which dorsal closure brings two epithelial sheets together to form nascent AJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacinto et al., 2002</xref>). A less well-understood process, in general, is the maintenance and remodeling of formed AJs as occurs in some adult tissue epithelium or during developmental morphogenesis. Adult, fully differentiated epithelia such as those present in skin and intestine have stem cells that constantly replenish older epithelial cells as they are shed. To do so, these new epithelial cells need to remodel their junctions so as to migrate yet maintain junctions such that the epithelium remains intact and functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hollande et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Niessen, 2007</xref>). Pathologically, misregulation and turnover of mature epithelial AJs are associated with cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Souza-Schorey, 2005</xref>). Thus, determining how AJs in epithelia are maintained and remodeled will have important implications for epithelial morphogenesis during development, adult tissue homeostasis, and disease states.</p><p>Rho GTPases are molecular switches that regulate epithelial cell cytoskeletal dynamics and cell&#x02013;cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braga et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Takaishi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harden et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamada and Nelson, 2007</xref>). To do so, active Rho proteins associate with effector proteins that mediate downstream signaling events to control specific cell responses. The ability of Rho proteins to activate different effectors is believed to be responsible for their functional diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bishop and Hall, 2000</xref>), yet whether certain effectors can be assigned to specific roles and what those roles are, especially in vivo, are still uncertain.</p><p>In mammals, the Rho subfamily of Rho GTPases consists of three members, RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC. All three members are expressed ubiquitously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wennerberg and Der, 2004</xref>), bind similar downstream effectors, including ROCK1/2 and mammalian Dia1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wheeler and Ridley, 2004</xref>), and share similar functions such as promoting stress fiber formation and adhesion maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vega and Ridley, 2007</xref>). However, differences also exist. RhoB may have unique functions in endosome transport, whereas RhoA and RhoC are more involved in generating actomyosin tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wheeler and Ridley, 2004</xref>). Because the common use of dominant mutant proteins likely affects more than one Rho protein, attempts have been made to uncover functional differences between Rho proteins by generating gene-specific mouse knockouts. The mouse knockout of RhoA is embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang and Zheng, 2007</xref>), whereas knockouts of RhoB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2001</xref>) and RhoC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hakem et al., 2005</xref>) develop normally. Thus, the presence of multiple members of Rho in mammals has complicated the precise determination of their functions in vivo. In contrast, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, only one Rho member exists, Rho1, and studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have made significant contributions in determining Rho1's function in the development of several different tissues (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johndrow et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, several of the Rho effectors, including Rok (<italic>Drosophila</italic> ROCK) and Dia, have only one member in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, allowing for a more straightforward analysis of the specific contributions of these effectors to Rho function in vivo.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal eye is a postmitotic monolayer neuroepithelium that has been a useful model system in which to study epithelial morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tepass and Harris, 2007</xref>). It is composed of &#x0223c;800 repeating units called ommatidia. Each ommatidium is composed of four cell types: eight photoreceptors, four glial-like cone cells, three mechanosensory bristles, and eleven pigment epithelial cells (PECs). Between 18 and 41 h after puparium formation (APF), PECs undergo patterning into a hexagonal array that surrounds and optically insulates the neuronal core of each ommatidium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cagan and Ready, 1989</xref>). During this morphogenic/maturation process, PECs remodel their AJs as cells reposition themselves relative to one another to achieve their proper niche and form the tissue architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao and Cagan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larson et al., 2008</xref>). Concurrently, to preserve the integrity of the epithelium, PECs maintain their AJs. The final result is a predictable repeating pattern with high fidelity of mature epithelial cells with distinct cell shapes and AJs. We used the epithelium of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal eye to ask whether and how the in vivo functions of Rho1 and its two main downstream effectors, Rok and Dia, affect remodeling of formed AJs, as opposed to Rho1's role in the formation/stabilization of new AJs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Global depletion of Rho1 in a formed epithelium disrupts AJs</title><p>To determine whether and how Rho1 influences the maintenance of a remodeling epithelium in vivo, we genetically decreased Rho1 throughout the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal eye. Because null alleles of <italic>Rho1</italic> are homozygous lethal before pupal development, we generated GAL4-inducible RNAi transgenic lines targeting <italic>Rho1</italic>. Two RNAi lines, upstream activation sequence (UAS)&#x02013;Rho1-RNAi1 and UAS-Rho1-RNAi2, produced similar phenotypes when expressed in the pupal eye, and UAS-Rho1-RNAi1 (referred to as Rho1-RNAi) was used for the rest of the study as it produced the stronger phenotype.</p><p>By 41 h APF, the PECs of the pupal eye are fully patterned and begin to undergo the final stages of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, a and b</xref>). Expression of Rho1-RNAi throughout the pupal eye beginning at puparium formation (0 h APF), using the eye-specific promoter <italic>glass multimer reporter</italic> (<italic>GMR</italic>)<italic>&#x02013;gal4</italic>, resulted in severe disruptions of AJs, as detected by immunostaining for <italic>Drosophila</italic> E-cadherin (DE-cadherin), Armadillo (<italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b2;-catenin), and &#x003b1;-catenin at 41 h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, c and d</xref>). Interestingly, only AJs between PECs were affected, whereas AJs between a PEC and cone cell or between cone cells were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 d&#x02033;</xref>) despite equivalent expression of Rho1 in PECs and cone cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901029/DC1">Fig. S1 d</ext-link>) and equivalent RNAi depletion in both cell types (Fig. S1, d and e). The ability of Rho1-RNAi to decrease expression of Rho1 was confirmed by immunofluorescence of larval wing discs, Western blotting of pupal eyes at 41 h APF, and immunofluorescence of pupal eyes at 21 and 41 h APF (Fig. S1). To demonstrate phenotypic specificity, coexpression of Rho1 with Rho1-RNAi reverted pupal eyes to wild type (Fig. S1 c), whereas overexpression of closely related Cdc42 or Rac1 did not (not depicted). Finally, Rho1-RNAi phenotypes were enhanced in <italic>Rho1</italic>-null heterozygous backgrounds, with either a deficiency deleting <italic>Rho1</italic> or <italic>Rho1</italic>-null alleles (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901029/DC1">Fig. S2, a&#x02013;f</ext-link>). Because only a residual amount of Rho1 protein remains in pupal eyes expressing Rho1-RNAi (Fig. S1), removing a genomic copy of Rho1 may enhance the phenotype by decreasing the levels of Rho1 below a critical threshold earlier in development.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Rho1 is required to maintain AJs in the pupal eye.</bold> (a and b) Confocal immunofluorescent localization of DE-cadherin (DE-cad) in wild-type pupal eye.

One explanation for these discrepancies may be inherent differences between mammalian tissue culture systems and in vivo <italic>Drosophila</italic> systems and/or between different stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. Alternatively, although Rok and Dia are necessary for the formation of nascent AJs, other formin proteins or a combination of different actin nucleating proteins maintains AJs. Another <italic>Drosophila</italic> formin protein that could function with Rho to regulate the actin cytoskeleton is Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis (Daam; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Habas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matusek et al., 2006</xref>). However, LOF and gain-of-function experiments showed that Daam, like Dia, did not function to maintain/remodel AJs in pupal epithelium (Fig. S3, b and c).</p><p>Our data indicate that Rho affects AJ turnover/remodeling by regulating E-cadherin endocytosis in a Cdc42/Par6-dependent manner. A role for Rho in endocytosis of growth factor receptors in cell lines has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Symons and Rusk, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ridley, 2006</xref>) through its effects on actin dynamics. In the Rho1-null pupal eye epithelial clones, we observed a decrease in AJ-associated F-actin intensity; however, Dia-depleted cells (the major Rho actin effector) had unaffected AJs and F-actin intensity (Table S2). Rok can also regulate actin through LIM kinase&#x02013;Cofilin, but pupal eye Rok-null clones or pupal eyes homozygous for a strong hypomorphic allele of <italic>Drosophila Lim kinase</italic>, <italic>Limk<sup>EY08757</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eaton and Davis, 2005</xref>), have intact AJs with no decrease in F-actin intensity (Table S2; unpublished data). These data suggest the possibility that Rho1 can regulate actin in a Dia- and Rok-independent manner.</p><p>Another possibility is that Rho1 regulates AJ turnover and E-cadherin endocytosis independent of, or in addition to, its effects on actin dynamics. In support of this, we could uncouple disruption of F-actin structures from AJ disruption. Clones with a <italic>chickadee</italic>-null allele (<italic>Drosophila profilin</italic>) have disrupted F-actin and a greater decrease in AJ-associated F-actin than Rho1-null cones (Table S2), yet AJs between Chickadee-null cells are unaffected (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200901029/DC1">Fig. S5 a</ext-link>). Furthermore, an increase in cortical actin in two adjacent cells expressing Dia-CA was not sufficient to affect AJs. Finally, colocalization of Rho1 at DE-cadherin&#x02013; and Rab5-positive endosomes suggests that Rho1 may be directly involved in endocytosis/recycling of DE-cadherin. Although another Rho effector, PKN, has been implicated in vesicular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukai, 2003</xref>), expression of PKN-RNAi in the pupal eye did not disrupt AJs despite disruption of cell patterning in a manner as or more severe than expression of Rho1-RNAi (Fig. S5 b).</p><p>AJs were disrupted after Rho1 depletion only when two adjacent cells were depleted. Although the mechanism behind this is still largely unknown, some insight may be gleaned from the effects of expressing Rab11-DN in the Rho1-null clones, which resulted in disrupted AJs between clonal and nonclonal cells. Perhaps Rab11-recycling endosomes compensate for increased endocytosis of DE-cadherin in the Rho1-depleted cell. If so, this raises the possibility that Rho1 depletion stimulates recycling of Rab11 endosomes. Also, the maintenance of AJs between wild-type and Rho1-null cells is distinct from the loss of AJs between wild-type and DE-cadherin&#x02013;null cells. In the absence of Rho1, newly synthesized DE-cadherin localizes to the membrane, but its regulation via endocytosis and recycling is altered. Between wild-type and Rho1-null cells, binding in trans to DE-cadherin in the wild-type cell could stabilize DE-cadherin delivered to the membrane of the Rho1-null cell and prevent/limit its endocytosis/recycling. In contrast, between two Rho1-null cells, the altered endocytosis/recycling of DE-cadherin in both cells results in loss of AJ maintenance.</p><p>Depletion of Cdc42 or Par6 rescued the AJ defects from Rho1 depletion, suggesting that the effect of Rho1 depletion on AJs involves Cdc42/Par6-dependent regulation of DE-cadherin trafficking. Cdc42 and Par6 have recently been implicated in the regulation of DE-cadherin endocytosis and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Georgiou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harris and Tepass, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leibfried et al., 2008</xref>) but by distinct mechanisms and in different tissues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Georgiou et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leibfried at al. (2008)</xref> both propose a role for Cdc42/Par6 in promoting DE-cadherin endocytosis in pupal notum epithelium, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harris and Tepass (2008)</xref> suggest that Cdc42/Par6 regulates DE-cadherin trafficking indirectly by preventing Crumbs endocytosis in embryonic ventral neuroectoderm. Our data are consistent with the former results based on two points. First, both Cdc42-RNAi and Rab5-DN/Rab5-RNAi rescue the Rho1 AJ phenotype, supporting the notion that Cdc42 functions similar to Rab5 and promotes DE-cadherin endocytosis. Second, between two Rho1-null cells, in which DE-cadherin is disrupted, Crumbs either colocalizes with fragmented DE-cadherin or is undisrupted (Fig. S5 c). In contrast, when DE-cadherin&#x02013;null cells were analyzed, most clones exhibited disrupted Crumbs localization (Fig. S5 d). This suggests that the primary defect from Rho1 depletion is AJ disruption, which likely then affects Crumbs localization, and that the proposed increase in Cdc42 activity resulting from Rho1 depletion is not acting through Crumbs to affect AJs. Although our results are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Georgiou et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leibfried at al. (2008)</xref>, the results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harris and Tepass (2008)</xref> may reflect differences in the nature of the ventral neuroectoderm, which has distinct properties even from the dorsal neuroectoderm. Determining how Rho1 regulates Cdc42 activity to maintain AJs and whether Rho1 maintains AJs through Cdc42 in systems other than the pupal eye are important questions for future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks</title><p>All crosses and staging were performed at 25&#x000b0;C unless otherwise noted. <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> or Canton-S was used as wild type.
