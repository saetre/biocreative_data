This response is orchestrated by the constitutively expressed IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-3 protein, which becomes post-translationally activated. Although the activation events are understood in detail, the negative regulation of this innate response is less well understood. Many viruses, including Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), have evolved defense strategies against this IFN response. Thus, KSHV encodes a viral IRF (vIRF)-2 protein, sharing homology with cellular IRFs and is a known inhibitor of the innate IFN response. Here, we show that vIRF-2 mediates IRF-3 inactivation by a mechanism involving caspase-3, although vIRF-2 itself is not pro-apoptotic. Importantly, we also show that caspase-3 participates in normal IRF-3 turnover in the absence of vIRF-2, during the antiviral response induced by poly(I:C) transfection. These data provide unprecedented insight into negative regulation of IRF-3 following activation of the type I IFN antiviral response and the mechanism by which KSHV vIRF-2 inhibits this innate response.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The earliest response at the cellular level to virus infection is the establishment of the antiviral state that results from induction of type I interferon (IFN)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> expression. The objective of this antiviral state is containment of the virus infection and elimination of the infected cell. It operates in multiple ways, including inhibiting cell growth by blocking proliferation and modulating apoptosis, and augmenting adaptive immunological surveillance and responses (see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Sensing of the virus infection to initiate the antiviral response occurs in different ways, in part depending upon whether the virus enters the cell by endocytosis or by fusion with the plasma membrane. One of the most important components transducing these virus-sensing signals is IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-3. It participates in transcribing genes that contribute to establishing the antiviral state.</p><p>Upon virus infection, IRF-3 is post-translationally modified by C-terminal phosphorylation by a &#x0201c;virus-activated kinase&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) that promotes translocation of the protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. There, it is assimilated into the IFN-&#x003b2; enhancesome, a multiprotein complex that facilitates transcription of IFN and IFN-responsive genes. This enhancesome, whose structure is well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), represents the paradigm for understanding the molecular basis behind regulation of gene transactivation in response to virus infection. The components of virus-activated kinase that phosphorylate IRF-3 include I&#x003ba;B kinase-&#x003f5; and TANK-binding kinase-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Depending on the pathway leading to IRF-3 activation, other kinases may also participate, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>Although post-translational activation of IRF-3 is understood in detail, less is known of its deactivation that negatively regulates the type I IFN response. Until now, only phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination of IRF-3, leading to its proteasomal degradation has been recognized. Hiscott and colleagues showed that C-terminal phosphorylation of IRF-3 is necessary for degradation and is followed by Cullin1 interaction, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>; see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Poly-ubiquitination and concomitant degradation of IRF-3 are regulated by the peptidylprolyl isomerase Pin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Inhibiting the IFN antiviral response is an important component of the biology of many viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Studying the molecular interactions of viruses with the immune system, including their strategies of evasion, has provided deeper understanding of its operation. Recent examples set a precedent in the context of the innate immune system. First, the study of the human immunodeficiency virus Vif protein identified a new innate immune response to retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) mediated by the cellular protein, CEM15 or APOBEC3G, a DNA deaminase, which destroys or mutates the virus genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Second, the recognition through its binding to paramyxovirus V proteins that mda-5 is a central player in the signal transduction cascade leading to IFN-&#x003b2; expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>Through studying modulation of the IFN response by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), we now demonstrate a unique cellular mechanism inhibiting IRF-3 function by a caspase-3-dependent process. KSHV is the etiologic agent of the most common malignancy affecting AIDS patients, Kaposi sarcoma (KS), which is also the most common tumor of men in certain African countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Approximately one quarter of the KSHV genome encodes proteins with either demonstrated or putative immunomodulatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), and one of these viral genes encodes the vIRF-2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), which inhibits the type I IFN response to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Here, using a model system of activation of the antiviral response by transfection of synthetic double-stranded RNA, we have identified a novel caspase-3-dependent turnover of cellular IRF-3 that is involved in the normal negative feedback loop to help terminate the antiviral response. This caspase-3-dependent mechanism is targeted by vIRF-2 to accelerate cellular IRF-3 turnover and thereby down-modulate the antiviral response.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Poly(I:C), MG132, and etoposide were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and Z-VAD-FMK was from Calbiochem.

IRF-3 phosphorylation occurs predominantly within two C-terminal domains, sites 1 and 2, containing serine/threonine-rich tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>lower panel</italic>) and is essential for the activity of the protein. Although some debate continues as to the precise function of phosphorylation of specific residues within these sites (see Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), a detailed understanding of the significance of phosphorylation of sites 1 and 2 <italic>en masse</italic> exists. Thus, IRF-3 autoinhibition is repressed by phosphorylation of the seven serine and threonine residues in these sites that induces a structural change releasing the N terminus and allowing the protein to homodimerize, interact with the transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300, and participate in assembly of the enhancesome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Specifically, phosphorylation within IRF-3 site 2 represses autoinhibition, permitting interaction with CBP/p300, and facilitating phosphorylation within site 1 that then enables homodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Sites 1 and 2 were mutated separately and together, creating two previously described IRF-3 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) 2A and 5A and the double mutant 2A5A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>lower panel</italic>). As expected, the inherent transactivation capacity of the 5A mutant, IRF-3(5A), was reduced by &#x0223c;50% compared with that of IRF-3WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>upper panel</italic>), consistent with its reduced dimerization capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). vIRF-2 reproducibly reduced IRF-3(5A) transactivation of the IFN-&#x003b2; promoter slightly, but not by a statistically significant amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>upper panel</italic>; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05, Student's <italic>t</italic> test). These data suggest vIRF-2 inhibition of IRF-3 transactivation depends on cognate phosphorylation of residues at IRF-3 C-terminal site 2. Neither the 2A mutant, IRF-3(2A), nor the double mutant, IRF-3(2A5A), possess significant transactivation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>upper panel</italic>), consistent with their inability to dimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), and therefore the impact of vIRF-2 on their function is indeterminable.</p><p>Quantifying the temporal amounts of phosphorylated IRF-3 revealed they were reduced in the presence of vIRF-2. Thus, 18 h after activating the antiviral response by poly(I:C) transfection, phosphorylated IRF-3 levels were reduced in the presence of vIRF-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>, <italic>upper panel</italic>, compare the level of phospho-IRF-3 in the presence of vIRF-2, <italic>lanes 9</italic> and <italic>10</italic>, with that in the absence of vIRF-2, <italic>lanes 4</italic> and <italic>5</italic>). Total IRF-3 levels, detected with anti-FLAG antibody, were likewise also reduced to some extent, and this finding was confirmed by non-denaturing gel analyses that revealed vIRF-2 reduced both dimeric (phosphorylated) and monomeric IRF-3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>, <italic>upper panel</italic>). Repeating these studies up to 48 h post-activation of the antiviral response with poly(I:C) transfection provided further evidence that vIRF-2 reduced IRF-3 levels (data not shown). Thus, these data correlate vIRF-2-mediated inhibition of IRF-3 transactivation of the IFN-&#x003b2; promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>) with reduced amounts of phosphorylated IRF-3, following poly(I:C) activation of the antiviral response.</p><p>Given these findings, the physical interaction of vIRF-2 and IRF-3 was investigated. vIRF-2 was immunoprecipitated, and the products were analyzed for the presence of IRF-3 by Western blot. Only IRF-3WT and IRF-3(5A) co-precipitated with vIRF-2 to any demonstrable extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>). Indeed, the amount of IRF-3WT co-precipitating was always less than that of IRF-3(5A). Furthermore, activation of the antiviral response by poly(I:C) transfection consistently reduced the amount of IRF-3WT co-precipitating with vIRF-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>, <italic>top panel</italic>, compare <italic>lanes 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>), whereas the level of co-precipitating IRF-3(5A) was unaffected or even increased following poly(I:C) treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>, <italic>top panel</italic>, compare <italic>lanes 5</italic> and <italic>6</italic>). The faint band appearing in the presence of IRF-3(2A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>, <italic>top panel</italic>, <italic>lane 4</italic>) is a nonspecific protein of lower molecular size than IRF-3.</p><p>Like IRF-3WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>, <italic>upper panel</italic>, <italic>lanes 4</italic> and <italic>5</italic>), IRF-3(5A) gradually accumulated after poly(I:C) transfection in the absence of vIRF-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>E</italic>, <italic>upper panel</italic>, <italic>lanes 1&#x02013;4</italic>), most likely as a consequence of phosphorylation within C-terminal site 1. The absolute levels are lower than for IRF-3WT, because the mutant protein is expressed less efficiently than the wild type (compare &#x0201c;input levels&#x0201d; detected by anti-FLAG antibody in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>, <italic>bottom panel</italic>, <italic>lanes 5</italic> and <italic>6</italic> for IRF-3(5A) and <italic>lanes 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> for IRF3WT). However, this mutant, whose transactivation of the IFN-&#x003b2; promoter is not significantly inhibited by vIRF-2, but which binds this viral protein, is not depleted from the cell in the presence of the viral protein, unlike IRF-3WT. Rather, IRF-3(5A) accumulates in the presence of vIRF-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>E</italic>, <italic>upper panel</italic>, compare the IRF-3(5A) level in the presence of vIRF-2, <italic>lanes 5&#x02013;8</italic>, with that in its absence, <italic>lanes 1&#x02013;4</italic>).</p><p>How might vIRF-2 cause the selective turnover of IRF-3WT? Multiple processes, enzymes, and subcellular components drive cellular protein turnover. They include calpain, autophagy, and the proteasome.

Essentially, the experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic> was repeated, but IFN-&#x003b2; promoter activity was measured. As expected, IFN-&#x003b2; promoter activity was inhibited significantly by the presence of vIRF-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>D</italic>, compare <italic>bars</italic> #<italic>2</italic> and #<italic>4</italic>). However, this inhibition was significantly repressed by caspase-3 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>D</italic>, compare <italic>bars</italic> #<italic>4</italic> and #<italic>5</italic>). Thus, as for IRF-3WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>), inhibition of endogenous IRF-3 transactivation by vIRF-2 was significantly mitigated by down-regulating caspase-3. Mitigation was not complete though, as measured by comparing the level of promoter activity achieved with caspase-3 siRNA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>D</italic>, compare the IFN-&#x003b2; promoter activity in <italic>bars</italic> #<italic>3</italic> and #<italic>5</italic>), suggesting vIRF-2 might also inhibit endogenous IRF-3 activity by a caspase-3-independent mechanism. Furthermore, even in the absence of vIRF-2, there is modest, but significantly increased, IFN-&#x003b2; promoter activity in the presence of caspase-3 siRNA compared with control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>D</italic>, compare <italic>bars</italic> #<italic>2</italic> and #<italic>3</italic>). This pattern is consistent with that seen for ectopic IRF-3WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>), suggesting caspase-3 contributes to the negative regulation of IRF-3 activity even in the absence of vIRF-2.</p><p>Finally, we verified that inhibition of the proteasome does not obviate vIRF-2-mediated inhibition of endogenous IRF-3 transactivation, as suggested from our studies of ectopic IRF-3WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>). Again IRF-3 activity was quantified by functional ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>E</italic>). First, when comparing clone #3&#x02013;9 and EV cells treated with doxycycline, IRF-3 activity was suppressed by &#x0223c;50% in the vIRF-2 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>E</italic>, compare IRF-3 activity at 12 h from EV cells treated with DOX+DMSO with that of clone #3&#x02013;9 cells treated with DOX+DMSO), as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>). This vIRF-2 inhibition of IRF-3 activity was not reversed by MG132 treatment. Rather, inhibition was increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>E</italic>, compare IRF-3 activity at 12 h from clone #3&#x02013;9 cells treated with DOX+DMSO with that of clone #3&#x02013;9 cells treated with DOX+MG132). This effect of MG132 in the presence of vIRF-2 is consistent with the suggestion from the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic> that vIRF-2 might recruit to IRF-3 either a protein or a protein complex responsible for IRF-3 decay that is normally targeted for degradation by the proteasome, but is therefore stabilized by MG132.</p><p>Moreover, treating EV cells with MG132 increased IRF-3 activity significantly, again consistent with the known proteasome involvement in normal IRF-3 turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>E</italic>, compare IRF-3 activity at 12 h from EV cells treated with DOX+DMSO with that of EV cells treated with DOX+MG132).</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The present study of the function of the KSHV vIRF-2 protein, in addition to elucidating the molecular mechanisms of a viral immune modulator, has identified a previously unrecognized cellular mechanism of negative feedback control of the IFN antiviral response. Our data reveal that in a cell in which this response is invoked by transfection of synthetic double-stranded RNA, a proteolytic process that involves caspase-3 activity depletes fully activated IRF-3. The studies with MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) provide conclusive genetic proof for a mechanism of IRF-3 turnover involving caspase-3. This mechanism contributes to IRF-3 destabilization, along with the activity of the proteasome, to negatively regulate the antiviral response.</p><p>KSHV is unique among viruses that infect humans in that it encodes a family of four vIRFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Sequence comparisons indicate they share homology with cellular IRFs, from which they are likely to have been derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The only other virus known to encode vIRFs is the KSHV-related non-human rhesus rhadinovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). However, all four of the KSHV vIRFs function in different ways, and vIRF-2 is not the only KSHV protein capable of suppressing the IFN antiviral response (see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>By accelerating the caspase-3-dependent process of IRF-3 turnover, the KSHV vIRF-2 protein functions as a catalyst in this IRF-3-degradative process, inhibiting IRF-3 transactivation and the concomitant antiviral response. The inhibition of IRF-3WT transactivation by vIRF-2, in MCF-7 cells in the absence of ectopic caspase-3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>) and also in HEK293 cells during siRNA knockdown of caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>), indicates that the viral protein can also repress IRF-3 activity independently of caspase-3; this observation was confirmed for endogenous IRF-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>D</italic>). Confocal microscopy analyses suggest this caspase-3-independent activity may be due to vIRF-2 preventing IRF-3 redistribution to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>C</italic>). Indeed, vIRF-2 is likely multifunctional, as suggested from studies in the Pitha laboratory on the N-terminal exon-encoded protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) that we refer to as vIRF-2&#x000d7;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), to distinguish it from the two-exon-encoded full-length vIRF-2 protein of our present and previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) studies. Transactivation of the IFNA4 promoter upon Newcastle disease virus infection was inhibited by vIRF-2, likely through interacting with IRF-1 and post-translationally activated IRF-3, and/or the p300/CBP transcriptional coactivator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). vIRF-2&#x000d7;1 also physically interacts with double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). This interaction suppresses protein kinase R function, for example, reducing inhibition of eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2&#x003b1; activity by protein kinase R-mediated phosphorylation. Moreover, the interaction of vIRF-2 with IRF-1 identified by Burysek <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) appears to be pleiotropic. Kirchhoff <italic>et al.</italic> identified positive regulatory IRF-1-dependent domains in the promoter of CD95 (Fas) ligand and recognized that vIRF-2 repressed transactivation of this promoter, perhaps through IRF-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B inhibition, in turn reducing activation-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p><p>A mutant of IRF-3, IRF-3(5A), which homodimerizes upon phosphorylation of the serine residues in C-terminal site 1, but lacks phosphorylation targets in site 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>lower panel</italic>), is still depleted in the absence of vIRF-2, but accumulates in its presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>E</italic>). Because IRF-3(2A) and IRF-3(2A5A) are incapable of homodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and do not interact with vIRF-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>), we infer that dimerization is necessary for IRF-3 interaction with the viral protein. However, homodimerization and vIRF-2 interaction are insufficient for vIRF-2-accelerated decay of IRF-3, because IRF-3(5A) remains abundant in the presence of the viral protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref><italic>E</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref><italic>A</italic>). Thus, authentic phosphorylation of IRF-3 at both C-terminal sites is required for IRF-3 turnover involving caspase-3. These data suggest the caspase-3-dependent mechanism only operates on fully phosphorylated and functional IRF-3 that has undergone complete conformational rearrangement and is competent for transcriptional activation of cognate genes; constitutively expressed, non-activated IRF-3 is disregarded.</p><p>Increasingly, the paradigm that caspases function only in a pro-apoptotic manner is being dispelled. Active caspases operate in multiple cellular processes, through both proteolytic and non-proteolytic activities, without activating apoptosis (see Refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). These processes include cell differentiation, proliferation, and activation of inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Caspase-3 has non-apoptotic functions in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), and transcription factors represent a class of non-apoptotic caspase targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), <italic>e.g.</italic> NFATc2 is cleaved by caspase-3 in apoptotic and non-apoptotic T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>).</p><p>The type I IFN-driven antiviral response can inhibit cell growth by blocking proliferation and inducing apoptosis, and it can enhance the adaptive immune response (see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Recent reports suggest IRF-3 itself is pro-apoptotic, providing cell death as a strategy to inhibit persistent virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The mechanism may depend on the induction of expression of the pro-apoptotic protein, Noxa, because IRF-3 transactivates the gene encoding this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Our work has revealed caspase-3 inhibits IRF-3 by contributing to its depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) and concomitant functional inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>) and that vIRF-2 inhibits caspase-3/-7 function, as measured by cleavage of the luminogenic substrate Z-DEVD-aminoluciferin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>C</italic>). These data suggest that vIRF-2 might sequester caspase-3 to augment IRF-3 decay, either directly or through recruitment of a protease that is in turn activated by caspase-3 and then degrades the vIRF-2/caspase-3 complex. This possibility is also supported by the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref><italic>E</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref><italic>A</italic>, in which the decay of incompletely activated IRF-3(5A) is inhibited by the presence of vIRF-2. We interpret this observation as IRF-3 being recruited by vIRF-2 to a caspase-3-containing complex, but the conformation of IRF-3(5A) is not amenable to its turnover by the complex. Certainly, in the context of the KSHV-infected cell, vIRF-2 expression kinetics are consistent with such a role: Krishnan <italic>et al.</italic> described vIRF-2 expression within 2 h of <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>).</p><p>Hence, vIRF-2 catalyzes caspase-3-mediated decay of IRF-3, functioning as a putative platform to recruit IRF-3 and caspase-3 and directing the proteolytic enzyme to initiate IRF-3 degradation. Whether caspase-3 acts either directly on IRF-3 to effect its depletion or, more likely, activates a proteolytic enzyme that then acts on IRF-3 remains to be established. Even if, in the KSHV-infected cell, the augmentation of this IRF-3 decay through sequestration of caspase-3 by vIRF-2 resulted in apoptosis, a panoply of anti-apoptotic KSHV factors, including vIRF-2 itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), would be expected to counteract it and prevent progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Indeed, different KSHV proteins repress other aspects of the type I IFN-driven antiviral response. For example, the KSHV K3 and K5 proteins down-regulate cell surface expression of major histocompatibility class I molecules by augmenting their endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>; see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our work reveals a cellular process for terminating IRF-3 transactivation, not previously appreciated, and a new mechanism of virus evasion of the IFN response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_284_35_23272__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supp_M109.033290_jbc.M109.033290-1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by the Medical Research Council (Grant G0400408) and Cancer Research UK (Grant C7934) (to D.
