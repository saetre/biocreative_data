They are synthesized on the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported by ceramide transfer protein to the Golgi for conversion to sphingomyelin (SM) by SM synthase SMS1. In this study, we report the identification of an SMS1-related (SMSr) enzyme, which catalyses the synthesis of the SM analogue ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) in the ER lumen. Strikingly, SMSr produces only trace amounts of CPE, i.e., 300-fold less than SMS1-derived SM. Nevertheless, blocking its catalytic activity causes a substantial rise in ER ceramide levels and a structural collapse of the early secretory pathway. We find that the latter phenotype is not caused by depletion of CPE but rather a consequence of ceramide accumulation in the ER. Our results establish SMSr as a key regulator of ceramide homeostasis that seems to operate as a sensor rather than a converter of ceramides in the ER.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sphingolipids are vital components of cellular membranes in organisms ranging from mammals to yeast. Besides providing a structural framework for plasma membrane (PM) organization, sphingolipids are dynamic regulators of a wide range of cellular processes. Sphingoid long-chain bases (LCBs), ceramides, and other intermediates of sphingolipid metabolism act as signaling molecules in the regulation of cell growth, death, migration, and membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spiegel and Milstien, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hannun and Obeid, 2008</xref>). Notably, a sensitive balance between phosphorylated LCBs and ceramides, referred to as the LCBP/ceramide rheostat, appears critical for normal cell growth and lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mandala et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kobayashi and Nagiec, 2003</xref>). Moreover, sphingolipids form gradients along the secretory pathway that may affect protein sorting through hydrophobic matching of membrane spans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bretscher and Munro, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holthuis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patterson et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Given their impact on cell organization and survival, the local concentration of sphingolipids and their metabolic intermediates must be tightly controlled. Although the mechanisms that regulate membrane sterol concentrations are well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldstein et al., 2006</xref>), little is known about the mechanisms controlling sphingolipid homeostasis. As ceramides constitute the backbone of all sphingolipids and directly participate in cellular life and death decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morales et al., 2007</xref>), controlling their local concentration is critical. Ceramides can be generated by the breakdown of sphingomyelin (SM) through SMases at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrieu-Abadie and Levade, 2002</xref>) or synthesized de novo by N-acylation of LCBs on the cytosolic surface of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mandon et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirschberg et al., 1993</xref>). The latter reaction is controlled by components of TORC2 (target of rapamycin complex 2) presumably through phosphorylation of the ceramide synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aronova et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cells, the bulk of newly synthesized ceramides is converted to SM in the lumen of the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tafesse et al., 2006</xref>). Efficient delivery of ER-derived ceramides to the site of SM production requires a cytosolic ceramide transfer protein (CERT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hanada et al., 2003</xref>). Besides a START domain that binds ceramide, CERT contains an FFAT motif for interaction with the ER membrane and a pleckstrin homology domain targeting the Golgi. CERT is phosphorylated at a serine repeat motif, which down-regulates its ceramide transport function. Loss of SM and cholesterol from cells causes dephosphorylation of the motif, resulting in CERT activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kumagai et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the local concentration of ceramides in cells is controlled by an intricate network of lipid-metabolizing enzymes, transfer proteins, kinases, and phosphatases.</p><p>SM production is mediated by a phosphatidylcholine (PC)/ceramide cholinephosphotransferase or SM synthase (SMS). Mammalian cells contain two SMS isoforms, SMS1 in the Golgi and SMS2 at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huitema et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, the mammalian genome encodes a third SMS-related (SMSr) protein of unknown function with homologues in nematodes and insects like <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not synthesize SM but produces the SM analogue ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) as a major membrane constituent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rao et al., 2007</xref>). CPE production also occurs in mammals and is catalyzed by a phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)/ceramide ethanolamine phosphotransferase or CPE synthase (CPES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Malgat et al., 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">1987</xref>). The identity of the responsible enzyme is not known. Production of SM and CPE involves a similar reaction chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Malgat et al., 1986</xref>). Because SMS1, SMS2, and SMSr are structurally related and share two highly conserved sequence motifs with putative active site residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huitema et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tafesse et al., 2006</xref>), SMSr is a prime candidate for the elusive CPES.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>SMSr proteins display CPES activity.</bold> (A) Phylogenetic tree of SMS family members from <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (h), <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> (x), <italic>Fugu rubripes</italic> (f), <italic>Drosophila</italic> (d), <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> (a), and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (c).

However, we find that SMSr produces only trace amounts of CPE and that bulk production of CPE in insect cells is mediated by a different enzyme. Unexpectedly, blocking SMSr activity causes a marked increase of ceramide levels in the ER. This is accompanied by a fragmentation of ER exit sites and a structural collapse of the Golgi. These morphological aberrations are not caused by a lack of CPE but rather a consequence of the ceramide accumulation in the ER. We propose that SMSr is a CPES with dual activity as ceramide sensor to control ceramide homeostasis in the ER and that the latter process is critical for the integrity of the early secretory pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>SMSr proteins display CPES activity</title><p>To test whether SMSr proteins catalyze CPE production, human SMSr (hSMSr) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> SMSr (dSMSr) were expressed in budding yeast, an organism lacking endogenous CPES activity. SMSr-expressing cells were lysed and incubated with fluorescent C<sub>6</sub>-NBD&#x02013;ceramide (NBD-Cer). TLC analysis of the reaction mixtures showed the presence of an NBD-labeled product with a retention factor value distinct from that of NBD&#x02013;ceramide phosphoinositol and NBD-SM. The product was missing in reactions performed with control (empty vector) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Liquid chromatography (LC) mass spectrometry (MS)/MS analysis identified the product as NBD-CPE (unpublished data), suggesting that SMSr proteins can synthesize CPE.</p><p>To determine whether SMSr proteins recognize natural ceramides as substrates for CPE production, a yeast strain was used in which the endogenous enzymes for ceramide production were replaced by mouse ceramide synthase CerS5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cerantola et al., 2007</xref>). As the ceramides produced in this strain structurally resemble those found in animal cells, they were expected to be suitable substrates for CPE biosynthesis. LC/MS/MS analyses revealed the presence of several molecular species of CPE in lipid extracts of both hSMSr- and dSMSr-expressing strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). The extracts were devoid of SM. No CPE was detectable in control cells.

Incubation of control cell lysates with NBD-Cer yielded three fluorescent products, corresponding to NBD-glucosylceramide (GlcCer), NBD-SM, and NBD-CPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>, left lane). Although formation of NBD-CPE was stimulated by addition of PE, addition of either PC or CDP-ethanolamine had no effect, suggesting that PE is the headgroup donor in the CPES reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200903152/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>; and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>). Heterologous expression of V5-tagged hSMSr led to a sixfold increase in CPES activity, leaving SMS activity unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and C</xref>). Conversely, CPES activity dropped &#x0003e;50% after depletion of hSMSr by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). This shows that hSMSr represents a major CPES activity in HeLa cells.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Mammalian cells synthesize only trace amounts of CPE despite the ER residency of SMSr.</bold> (A) TLC analysis of reaction products formed when lysates of control (untransfected [untransf]) or hSMSr-V5&#x02013;expressing HeLa cells were incubated with NBD-Cer.

Labeling human colon carcinoma Caco-2, liver carcinoma Hep-G2, or HeLa cells for 48 h with [<sup>14</sup>C]ethanolamine yielded only trace amounts of radiolabeled CPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). The same was true when HeLa or CHO-K1 cells were labeled with [<sup>3</sup>H]sphingosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>). In contrast, labeling <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells with [<sup>14</sup>C]ethanolamine showed that the CPE production level in these cells is much higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>, right). Indeed, MS analyses revealed that although S2 cells contain a substantial amount of CPE (15.3 &#x000b1; 1.1 mol% of total phospholipid; <italic>n</italic> = 3), the CPE levels in HeLa or CHO-K1 cells are exceedingly low (&#x0223c;0.03 mol%, i.e., 300-fold lower than SM; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SMSr produces only trace amounts of CPE</title><p>Although mammalian cells contain a readily detectable CPES activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>), their CPE content is very low. One explanation for this discrepancy could be that SMSr resides in a compartment that is not easily reached by newly synthesized ceramide. To test this, the subcellular distribution of hSMSr-V5 was analyzed in HeLa cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. hSMSr-V5 gave a reticular and nuclear envelope staining pattern and colocalized with the ER marker protein disulfide isomerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200903152/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). The ER localization of hSMSr does not explain why mammalian cells contain only trace amounts of CPE, as the substrates for CPE synthesis, PE, and ceramide are made in the ER.</p><p>We tested whether these substrates have limited access to the enzyme's active site. SMSr and SMS1 share a common transmembrane domain organization with the active site facing the exoplasmic leaflet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huitema et al., 2004</xref>). SMSr-catalyzed CPE production would therefore occur in the ER lumen. As ceramide is synthesized on the cytosolic surface of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mandon et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirschberg et al., 1993</xref>), it could be scavenged by CERT before being able to flip to the site of CPE production. To test this, we used CHO-K1&#x02013;derived LY-A mutant cells, which are defective in CERT-mediated ceramide transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hanada et al., 2003</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>, [<sup>3</sup>H]sphingosine labeling of CHO-K1 and LY-A cells yielded similar levels of <sup>3</sup>H-CPE, indicating that the low CPE content of mammalian cells is unlikely caused by scavenging of ceramides from the site of CPE production.</p><p>Another explanation for the low CPE content could be the presence of an inhibitory factor or environment in the ER. We found that removal of the N-terminal sterile &#x003b1; motif (SAM) domain of hSMSr caused its redistribution from the ER to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref> and Fig. S2 B) but did not affect its enzymatic activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). However, metabolic labeling of HeLa cells expressing hSMSr&#x00394;SAM showed no significant increase in CPE production levels compared with cells expressing the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>). Thus, the ER does not seem to impose an inhibitory environment on SMSr enzymatic activity.</p><p>Last, we investigated whether CPE is readily converted to another product. Although SM production in mammalian cells mainly occurs through SMS1-mediated headgroup transfer from PC to ceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tafesse et al., 2006</xref>), an alternative pathway involves methylation of CPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muehlenberg et al., 1972</xref>). To investigate the relative contribution of the latter pathway to SM production, HeLa cells were metabolically labeled with D<sub>4</sub>-ethanolamine and D<sub>9</sub>-choline simultaneously. MS/MS analysis showed that the D<sub>4</sub>/D<sub>9</sub> ratio of SM after 24-h labeling was &#x0223c;1:100, indicating that headgroup transfer from PC is the major pathway of SM biosynthesis. Moreover, the D<sub>4</sub>-labeled SM pool most likely originated from headgroup transfer of D<sub>4</sub>-labeled PC, as this pool was reduced by depletion of human SMS1 (unpublished data). Finally, pulse-chase experiments with [<sup>14</sup>C]ethanolamine and [<sup>14</sup>C]choline showed that the turnover rate of CPE in HeLa cells was similar to that of SM (unpublished data). Thus, the low CPE content of mammalian cells is unlikely the result of CPE being a short-lived metabolic intermediate.</p><p>Together, these results suggest that SMSr proteins are intrinsically unable to produce bulk amounts of CPE. This is consistent with our finding that CPE levels in SMSr-expressing yeast strains are invariably low (&#x02264;0.5 mol% of total phosphosphingolipid). As bulk amounts of CPE are present in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we next addressed the contribution of dSMSr to CPE production in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Bulk production of CPE in insect cells is independent of SMSr</title><p>We first analyzed the subcellular distribution of dSMSr in S2 cells by using an antibody that specifically cross reacted with dSMSr on immunoblots of S2 cell extracts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>).

The ER residency of dSMSr was confirmed by quantitative immunoelectron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). As observed for hSMSr, removal of its SAM domain caused dSMSr to redistribute from the ER to the Golgi (Fig. S2, C&#x02013;E), which is consistent with a fundamental role of SAM in ER retention of SMSr proteins.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>dSMSr resides in the ER of insect cells.</bold> (A) Confocal sections of <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells were double transfected with native dSMSr and ER marker PEMT-GFP and immunolabeled for dSMSr. (B) Confocal sections of S2 cells were transfected with untagged dSMSr and double labeled for dSMSr and cis-Golgi marker dGMAP.

Together, these findings indicate that SMSr proteins play a critical role in the acquisition of Golgi stack morphology without affecting the functional integrity of the organelle.

To distinguish between these possibilities, ER resident SMS hSMS1Nr was expressed in SMSr-depleted S2 or HeLa cells and analyzed for its ability to rescue Golgi fragmentation. Expression of hSMS1Nr partially restored Golgi integrity in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>), indicating that acquisition of Golgi stack morphology is not strictly dependent on production of CPE. As expression of hSMS1Nr was effective in preventing ceramide accumulation in SMSr-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 G</xref>), we asked whether blocking ceramide production or stimulating ceramide export from the ER would also suppress Golgi fragmentation. Treatment with ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 or overexpression of CERT partially but reproducibly restored Golgi integrity in both SMSr-depleted HeLa and S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>). This indicates that the structural collapse of the early secretory pathway in SMSr-depleted cells is the result of ceramide accumulation in the ER. Thus, these results further support a primary role of SMSr in controlling ceramide homeostasis in the ER.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>SMSr proteins define an unconventional class of sphingolipid synthases</title><p>In this study, we show that SMSr, the most conserved member of the multigenic SMS family, catalyzes production of the SM analogue CPE. SMSr likely accounts for the CPES activity described two decades ago in rat brain and liver microsomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Malgat et al., 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">1987</xref>). Common features between these enzymes include the use of PE as headgroup donor, their ER residency, and a membrane topology in which the active site is facing the ER lumen. Although mammalian cells contain a readily detectable CPES activity, their CPE content is very low (i.e., 300-fold lower than SM). This enigma is neither caused by a limited supply of substrates to the enzyme's active site nor by CPE being a short-lived metabolic intermediate. Instead, we find that SMSr intrinsically lacks the ability to synthesize significant amounts of CPE. This is radically different from closely related SMS1, which catalyses bulk production of SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tafesse et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>What makes SMSr so different from SMS1? SMS1 utilizes a lipid phosphate phosphatase&#x02013;type reaction mechanism, which involves a single lipid-binding site and proceeds via transfer of phosphocholine from PC to a conserved histidine in the enzyme's active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huitema et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tafesse et al., 2006</xref>). When DAG is replaced by ceramide, the phosphocholine headgroup is transferred onto ceramide to form SM. The latter is then released from the active site to allow another round of catalysis. Mutational analysis of putative active site residues indicates that SMSr-mediated CPE production involves a very similar reaction mechanism. However, although SM readily dissociates from SMS1, we propose that CPE remains bound to the active site of SMSr, thus blocking a further round of catalysis. This could be the result of several factors. First, SMSr might have a higher affinity for CPE than for PE. Second, dissociation of SM from SMS1 might be facilitated by its preferential interaction with cholesterol. Contrary to SM, CPE lacks this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Terova et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, in the presence of cholesterol, SM production might be thermodynamically more favorable than CPE production.</p><p>The notion that SMSr is unable to produce significant amounts of CPE is further substantiated by our finding that bulk production of CPE in insects is mediated by a different enzyme. This second CPES uses CDP-ethanolamine instead of PE as headgroup donor, which is analogous to the ethanolamine phosphotransferases of the Kennedy pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vance, 2008</xref>). This implies that, contrary to SM synthesis in mammals, bulk production of CPE occurs in the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane. As insects require CERT for efficient CPE production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rao et al., 2007</xref>), the second enzyme likely resides in the Golgi.</p></sec><sec><title>SMSr qualifies for a ceramide sensor in the ER</title><p>Although SMSr is a poor CPES, we find that the enzyme has a major impact on ceramide levels in the ER. Indeed, SMSr-depleted mammalian cells display a rise in ceramide levels that is one order of magnitude too high to be explained by a reduced ceramide consumption for CPE biosynthesis. SMSr-depleted insect cells and SMSr-null mutants in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> also show a marked increase in ceramide levels (this study; unpublished data). Strikingly, a single point mutation in the active site of SMSr proved sufficient to induce ceramide accumulation. This shows that SMSr must be catalytically active to keep ER ceramide levels low, even if the enzyme lacks the ability to consume significant amounts of ceramide. Together, these results establish SMSr as a novel regulator of ceramide homeostasis in the ER.</p><p>How does SMSr control ceramide levels in the ER? We anticipate that under normal conditions, only small amounts of ceramide will reach the enzyme's active site. This is because ceramides synthesized on the cytosolic surface of the ER are continuously removed by CERT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). Consequently, only a minor fraction of SMSr enzymes will be trapped in a CPE-bound form. Yet when the rate of ceramide production exceeds ceramide removal by CERT, the pool of CPE-bound enzymes will expand. It is possible that CPE-bound SMSr adopts a conformation that relays a signal to inhibit ceramide biosynthesis and/or stimulate ceramide degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). Alternatively, SMSr-derived CPE might directly influence the activity of ceramide-metabolizing enzymes in the ER. Either feedback mechanism would ensure maintenance of ceramide homeostasis in the ER. Distinguishing between these possibilities will require reconstitution experiments with purified enzymes.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Model of how SMSr might control ceramide homeostasis in the ER.</bold> (A) Normally, only small amounts of newly synthesized ceramides can reach the active site of SMSr in the ER lumen as a result of their efficient removal from the cytosolic surface by CERT. (B) When CERT can't cope with the rate of ceramide production, more ceramides will reach the active site of SMSr, resulting in production of CPE. Because of its high affinity for the enzyme's active site, CPE remains bound to SMSr, thus blocking a further round of catalysis. CPE-trapped SMSr adopts a conformation that relays a signal inhibiting ceramide production or stimulating ceramide breakdown in the ER, thereby restoring ceramide homeostasis.

As its active site faces the ER lumen, SMSr would only sense ceramides present in the exoplasmic leaflet, i.e., molecules that escaped CERT-mediated extraction at the cytosolic surface and flipped to the lumenal side. Notably, this arrangement implies cooperativity between SMSr and CERT in keeping ER ceramide levels low. Thus, SMSr serves a biological role that is different from closely related SMS1 but analogous to the ensemble of membrane proteins that monitor sterol concentrations in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldstein et al., 2006</xref>). In this respect, the SMS enzyme family displays an interesting parallel with the nutrient transporter family. Besides conventional transporters, the latter family also harbors transceptors that play a dual role as nutrient sensor because their conformational change during the transport process can trigger downstream signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holsbeeks et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Functional implications of SMSr-controlled ceramide homeostasis</title><p>Concurrent with the accumulation of ceramide in the ER, blocking SMSr activity causes a structural collapse of the early secretory pathway. The disruption of tER&#x02013;Golgi organization completely parallels the rise in ER ceramide levels. Indeed, any condition that normalizes the ceramide concentration in the ER seems to restore Golgi stack morphology; i.e., the presence of enzymatically active SMSr, the consumption of ceramide by ER resident SMS, stimulation of ER export of ceramide by overexpression of CERT, or a block in ceramide production by ceramide synthase inhibitors. Conversely, blocking SM production to accumulate ceramides in the Golgi does not perturb its morphology.</p><p>How can an excess of ceramides in the ER affect Golgi organization? As the biogenesis of the Golgi is tightly linked to that of tER sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bevis et al., 2002</xref>), a disruption of tER sites likely contributes to the structural collapse of the Golgi. tER sites are thought to arise from patches of ER membrane proteins that have weak, cooperative affinity for one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bevis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heinzer et al., 2008</xref>). These patches capture additional tER proteins until they grow large enough to produce COPII vesicles. A rise in ER ceramides may perturb the local physical environment required to stabilize patches of tER proteins. Alternatively, ceramides may affect tER site morphology by altering the membrane turnover of COPII components analogous to the situation in sterol-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Runz et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, ceramides serve as early mediators of apoptosis, an event accompanied by fragmentation of the Golgi complex. Apoptosis-induced Golgi fragmentation requires caspase 3&#x02013;mediated cleavage of golgins, a family of coiled-coil proteins involved in maintenance of Golgi stack morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lane et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, SMSr-depleted HeLa cells display hallmarks of apoptosis, including activation of caspase 3 (unpublished data). Whether blocking caspase activation prevents Golgi fragmentation in SMSr-deficient cells remains to be established.</p><p>A tight regulation of ceramide homeostasis in the ER likely has functional implications beyond sustaining the structural integrity of the early secretory pathway.
