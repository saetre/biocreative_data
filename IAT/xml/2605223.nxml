The recent discovery of cardiac stem cells in the postnatal heart, however, suggests that these cells could participate in the response to stress via their capacity to regenerate cardiac tissues. Using models of cardiac hypertrophy and failure, we demonstrate that components of the Notch pathway are up-regulated in the hypertrophic heart. The Notch pathway is an evolutionarily conserved cell-to-cell communication system, which is crucial in many developmental processes. Notch also plays key roles in the regenerative capacity of self-renewing organs. In the heart, Notch1 signaling takes place in cardiomyocytes and in mesenchymal cardiac precursors and is activated secondary to stimulated Jagged1 expression on the surface of cardiomyocytes. Using mice lacking Notch1 expression specifically in the heart, we show that the Notch1 pathway controls pathophysiological cardiac remodeling. In the absence of Notch1, cardiac hypertrophy is exacerbated, fibrosis develops, function is altered, and the mortality rate increases. Therefore, in cardiomyocytes, Notch controls maturation, limits the extent of the hypertrophic response, and may thereby contribute to cell survival. In cardiac precursors, Notch prevents cardiogenic differentiation, favors proliferation, and may facilitate the expansion of a transient amplifying cell compartment.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: BNP, brain natriuretic peptide; CPC, cardiac precursor cell; Hes, Hairy/enhancer of split; MZB, marginal zone B; Sca, stem cell antigen.</p></fn><fn><p>A.

Moreover, the increasing mean age of the population has altered the spectrum of cardiac diseases toward heart failure. Heart failure is a progressive disorder that is initiated by a loss of cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). The primary event can be either acute, as in the case of myocardial infarction, or gradual, as in the case of hemodynamic overload, for instance in patients suffering from chronic hypertension. In the classical view, the heart contains at birth a predetermined number of cardiomyocytes, the loss of which cannot be compensated for, and the adaptive response of the heart to stress relies exclusively on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Several groups have, however, identified resident cells in the heart with properties of cardiac precursor cells (CPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). The existence of CPCs suggests that cardiac integrity also depends on a balance between cell death and cell production. Therefore, to understand the cellular mechanisms of cardiac adaptation, we need to identify pathways controlling cardiomyocyte growth as well as that regulating the level of the cardiac progenitor pool and its commitment toward the cardiogenic lineage.</p><p>The Notch signaling pathway is crucial in the development of metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). It has also been implicated in the regeneration of adult self-renewing tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In mammals, signaling occurs after the interaction of one of the four Notch receptors (Notch1&#x02013;4) with membrane-bound ligands of the Jagged (Jagged1 and 2) and Delta-like (Delta-like1, 3, and 4) family. Therefore, the Notch pathway is essentially a communication system between two adjacent cells, a signal-sending cell expressing the ligand and a signal-receiving cell expressing the receptor. The Notch protein is synthesized as a single polypeptide that is cleaved by proteases during posttranslational processing. The two portions of the protein, however, remain associated and form a functional heterodimer on the cell surface. Upon activation, the Notch receptor is subjected to two additional cleavages by TACE (TNF-&#x003b1; converting enzyme) and by a multicomponent &#x003b3;-secretase complex, thus releasing the Notch intracellular domain. This fragment enters the nucleus, binds to a transcription factor known as RBP-J in the mouse, recruits coactivators, and up-regulates target gene transcription. Prototypic target genes of Notch are bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) repressors of the <italic>Hairy/enhancer of split</italic> (<italic>Hes</italic>) family. The <italic>Hes</italic> family includes <italic>Hes-1</italic> and <italic>Herp</italic> (Hairy-related transcription factors) also known as <italic>Hey</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>The biological effects of Notch activation are extremely context dependent. In certain situations, Notch restricts cell fate and maintains an undifferentiated state in uncommitted progenitors, whereas in others Notch produces inductive signaling that stimulates cells to adopt a particular fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). For instance, Notch preserves stem cell pools, regulates lateral inhibition, and controls asymmetrical divisions but has also been shown to induce terminal differentiation. Cell fate decisions and differentiation during hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis are controlled by Notch. In hemangioblasts, Notch signaling could specify hematopoietic versus endothelial cell fate. In the adult, Notch regulates T versus B cell lineage decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Furthermore, Notch plays an important role in arteriovenous patterning, in regulating endothelial tip cell and vessel wall formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). The Notch pathway has also been implicated in cardiac morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Notch plays a crucial role in the regulation of endocardial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation in the primary heart tube during septation and formation of the valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Notch1 is the main receptor subtype found in the endocardial layer in the outflow tract of the developing heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Interestingly, Notch1 haploinsufficiency in human results in heart disease characterized by cardiac valve calcification and ventricular septal defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Furthermore, patients suffering from Alagille syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the <italic>Jagged1</italic> gene, demonstrate severe cardiac abnormalities including tetralogy of Fallot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Therefore, the importance of the Notch pathway in cardiac development has been extensively studied but its role in the postnatal heart has not been investigated. In the present study, we demonstrate that cardiac remodeling, which develops secondary to hemodynamic overload or in response to chronic agonist stimulation in the adult heart, is in part regulated by the Notch1 receptor pathway. Importantly, Notch signaling is observed in both cardiomyocytes and mesenchymal CPCs. In cardiomyocytes, Notch represses cardiac gene expression and prevents an excessive and detrimental hypertrophic response. In CPCs, Notch appears to regulate proliferation and differentiation.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>The Notch pathway is activated in cardiac myocyte and nonmyocyte cells</title><p>Agonist-induced cardiac hypertrophy in TG1306/1R transgenic mice with cardiac angiotensin II overproduction leads to a gradual transition from a compensatory state to heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that play a role in maintaining cardiac integrity in the diseased heart, we performed a comparative study of gene expression between normal and stressed hearts using microarray analysis. TG1306/1R transgenics were separated into two phenotypic groups based on morphological parameters (cardiac weight index and histology) and either a moderate or a high up-regulation of markers of hypertrophy and failure (Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081427/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081427/DC1</ext-link>) and compared with age- and sex-matched WT. Microarray data revealed that several genes belonging to pathways important during cardiac morphogenesis were activated in hypertrophic and dilated adult hearts (Tables S2&#x02013;S7). In particular, the activated genes were those encoding the Notch1 receptor, its ligand Jagged1, the transcription factor RBP-J, and the target gene of Notch Hes1. These results were confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). First, both dilated and hypertrophic hearts demonstrated significant up-regulation of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and &#x003b1;-skeletal actin expression, two markers of cardiac stress. BNP and &#x003b1;-skeletal actin were more expressed in the dilated than in the hypertrophic heart as expected. More importantly, there was a 15&#x02013;20-fold increase in cardiac expression of the Notch1 receptor, whereas Jagged1 expression was up-regulated &#x0223c;10-fold. Expression of both the Notch1 receptor and its ligand was higher in the dilated hearts than in the hypertrophic hearts. Accordingly, Hes1 expression was also significantly up-regulated in the stressed adult hearts.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Notch signaling is activated in cardiac myocytes and nonmyocyte cells in the adult heart.</bold> (A) Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of gene expression showing the up-regulation of Notch1, Jagged1, and Hes1 in hypertrophic (H) and dilated (D) hearts of TG1306/1R transgenic mice relative to hearts of WT mice.

In initial experiments, we analyzed Notch activation in cardiac cells expressing the stem cell antigen (Sca) 1 because this marker has been previously used to identify resident CPCs (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081427/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081427/DC1</ext-link>). Clearly, N1IC staining was not limited to the Sca-1&#x02013;positive population in the adult heart in WT mice or in TG1306/1R transgenics. Furthermore, not only nonmyocyte cells but also some cardiomyocytes were positive for N1IC staining. In different experiments, we isolated the mesenchymal fraction from neonatal mouse hearts, which was shown previously to contain Sca-1&#x02013;positive precursor cells. Approximately 35% of cells stained positive for Sca-1 in this fraction. However, very few if any cells expressing Sca-1 demonstrated Notch1 activation (Fig. S1 B). Based on these results, we decided to use a different approach, which consisted of analyzing all cardiac N1IC-positive cells and not a preselected subpopulation. To distinguish between cardiac myocytes and nonmyocyte cells and to identify cellular boundaries, sarcomeric &#x003b1;-actinin and -laminin stainings were simultaneously performed. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> depicts a representative experiment, which demonstrates that N1IC was present in the nuclei of both cardiomyocytes (&#x003b1;-actinin positive, closed arrows) and nonmyocyte cells (&#x003b1;-actinin negative, open arrows). Not all cardiac myocytes demonstrated N1IC staining. Similarly, small N1IC-positive cardiac undifferentiated cells, which clustered in the interstitial mesenchyme between cardiac fibers, were readily detected.</p></sec><sec><title>The Notch pathway regulates the cardiac response to hypertrophic stress in vivo</title><p>To determine whether the Notch pathway plays a functional role during the development of cardiac hypertrophy, TG1306/1R transgenics were administrated with a &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor (LY411,575). This compound was previously shown to block both the proteolytic release of N1IC and the specific activation of Notch target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). The drug was injected into 15-wk-old mice to investigate the role of Notch during the compensatory phase of the cardiac response to stress. To verify effective Notch inhibition, the percentage of marginal zone B (MZB) cells in the spleen (i.e., B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD21<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD23<sup>&#x02212;</sup> splenocytes), which strictly depend on active Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>), was measured by FACS analysis (Fig. S2, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081427/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081427/DC1</ext-link>). Treatment with the &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor resulted in a dramatic decrease in MZB cells, demonstrating successful Notch inhibition. Importantly, the expression of Hes1, Hey1, and Hey2, as well as of Notch1 and Jagged1, was down-regulated in the hearts of transgenics receiving the inhibitor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Treatment resulted in a concomitant stimulation of expression of cardiac makers of hypertrophy in treated hearts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Furthermore, transgenic mice developed more hypertrophy upon Notch blockade than did vehicle-treated transgenics (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>; and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Blood pressure and heart rate remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Finally, echocardiography confirmed the thickening of the left ventricular wall and revealed a significantly increased fraction of shortening in the transgenic mice under &#x003b3;-secretase inhibition. Administration of the &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor had no effects on cardiac structure and function in WT animals despite a demonstrated blockade of the Notch pathway (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of Notch signaling exacerbates cardiac hypertrophy.</bold> (A) Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis of expression of Notch1, Jagged1, and Notch target genes Hes1, Hey1, and Hey2 in the hearts of WT and TG13061/R transgenic mice treated with the &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor Ly411,575 relative to their vehicle-treated counterparts.

Immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify the number of N1IC-positive cells to evaluate the size of the cardiac cell population with an activated Notch pathway (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Approximately 80% of the N1IC-positive cells in the normal adult heart were cardiomyocytes, and this percentage was not strikingly modified under stress. However, hearts from clipped mice showed an increased number of N1IC-positive cells 8 d after surgery. This number decreased to levels observed in sham-operated animals after 20 d. Because the Notch1 receptor was the predominant form expressed in the adult heart, we evaluated the physiological importance of this receptor using conditional Notch1 KOs. Thus, MLC2v-Cre mice with cardiac-specific expression of the Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) were crossed to Notch1<sup>lox/lox</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Mice with cardiac-specific Notch1 deletion (Notch1<sup>lox/lox</sup>; MLC2v-Cre, thereafter cNotch1 KOs) reached adulthood and appeared grossly normal (unpublished data). To evaluate the heart under stress, work overload was induced using the hypertensive 1K1C model. 8 wk after clipping, WT and cNotch1 KOs developed the same level of hypertension with comparable heart rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). Heart weight/body weight ratio was similar in both hypertensive groups. However, echographic analysis revealed several differences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). The left ventricular free wall was thicker in mutant mice. In addition, cNotch1 KOs had a larger left ventricular diameter in systole along with a decreased fractional shortening when compared with controls. This paralleled an increase in the expression of cardiac markers of hypertrophy in the hearts of hypertensive KOs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and C</xref>). Moreover, marked fibrosis was detected in the hypertrophic hearts of mice lacking Notch1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Quantitation of extracellular matrix accumulation demonstrated an &#x0223c;10-fold difference between hearts from hypertensive WT and Notch1-deficient animals (unpublished data). Finally, mice with cardiac-specific Notch1 deletion also showed a higher rate of mortality under conditions of hemodynamic overload than normal littermates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>). To evaluate whether increased fibrosis and decreased cardiac function were caused by accelerated cardiomyocyte loss, we determined the rate of apoptosis using TUNEL assay. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref> shows apoptotic cardiomyocytes in the stressed heart of cNotch1 KOs.

When stained for N1IC, cultured WT cardiomyocytes demonstrated two different distribution patterns. Some cells were characterized by intense nuclear N1IC staining. Diffuse myomesin staining suggested that these cells were poorly differentiated or in the process of dedifferentiation. In contrast, mature differentiated cardiomyocytes with organized sarcomeres showed little or no N1IC staining. Notch1-deficient cardiomyocytes presented a state of maturation that appeared to be even more advanced than that of the WT differentiated population. Furthermore, the expression of cardiac genes in myocytes isolated from mutant animals was strikingly up-regulated as compared with WT cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of the &#x003b1;-MHC gene (a marker of cardiac maturation) was highly stimulated in cardiomyocytes lacking Notch1, whereas &#x003b2;-MHC gene expression (a maker of cardiac hypertrophy) was similar to that measured in WT cells. Finally, we demonstrated that the N1IC staining decreased markedly in phenylephrine-treated WT cardiomyocytes, suggesting that inactivation of Notch1 signaling could also be necessary for the initiation of the hypertrophic response (Fig. S3, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081427/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081427/DC1</ext-link>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Notch1 activation controls maturation and cardiac gene expression in cardiomyocytes.</bold> (A) Analysis of Notch1 activation in cultured cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal mice carrying floxed Notch1 allele (Notch1<sup>lox/lox</sup>) without (Cre<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) or with (Cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) Cre recombinase expression under the control of the MLC2v promoter.

Therefore, the expression of GATA4 and Nkx2.5 on cardiac nonmyocyte cells was examined in TG1306/1R transgenics to evaluate whether mesenchymal Notch signaling cells were committed to the cardiogenic lineage. The vast majority of undifferentiated N1IC-positive cells coexpressed GATA4 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>). In addition, cells with an activated Notch pathway expressed Nkx2.5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). N1IC-negative Nkx2.5-positive cells were also found in the same clusters. Because the Notch pathway has been shown to be involved in sustaining proliferation in other organs systems, we investigated whether N1IC-positive CPCs were actively cycling. First, we demonstrated that CPCs with an activated Notch pathway (N1IC positive) and expressing the cell proliferation marker Ki67 could be readily detected in the adult heart (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). Using laminin staining to identify cell boundaries, we confirmed that small nonmyocyte cells expressed Ki67.

Therefore, we first determined the nature of the cardiac cells expressing Jagged1. Jagged1 expression was readily detected in cardiomyocytes. The staining pattern, in particular the alignment along the muscle fibers, was compatible with the expected surface expression of Jagged1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, A and B</xref>). Jagged1 on the surface of cardiomyocytes could activate both adjacent Notch-expressing myocytes and CPCs. Indeed, &#x003b1;-actinin&#x02013;negative Nkx2.5-positive cells can be observed lying adjacent to Jagged1-expressing fibers (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>, arrows). We then investigated cardiac expression of Jagged1 in the stressed heart using hypertensive 1K1C WT as well as TG1306/1R transgenic mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, C and D</xref>). Sham-operated WT animals in the 1K1C model demonstrated a patchy pattern of Jagged1 expression distributed throughout both cardiac ventricles (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). In hypertensive 1K1C WT mice, no change was noticed during the first 4 d after induction of the hypertrophic response. However, 8 and 12 d after induction, there was a dramatic up-regulation of Jagged1 expression in the myocardium. Similarly, Jagged1 expression was markedly up-regulated in all cardiomyocytes of TG13061R transgenic mice as compared with their WT littermates (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Up-regulation of Jagged1 expression in the stressed heart.</bold> (A) Immunofluorescence analysis of Jagged1 expression in the heart.

Specifically, we demonstrate that: (a) the receptor Notch1 and its ligand Jagged1 are the predominant members of the Notch family expressed in the adult heart; (b) both Notch1 and Jagged1, as well as the Notch target gene Hes1, are up-regulated in the stressed heart; (c) the Notch pathway is activated in the cardiomyocyte as well as in CPCs; (d) the Notch pathway regulates cardiac gene expression in adult cardiomyocytes and controls the extent of the hypertrophic response; (e) the Notch pathway controls proliferation and cardiogenesis in CPCs; and (f) pharmacological and genetic blockade of the Notch pathway in the heart is largely detrimental to the stressed heart. Based on these findings, we propose that Notch exerts a dual role in the adult heart. On the one hand, Notch prevents uncontrolled growth of cardiomyocytes and might contribute to cell survival. On the other hand, Notch blocks cardiac differentiation in the resident precursor population and may therefore allow expansion of a transient amplifying cell compartment. Blockade of the Notch pathway appears to be detrimental to the normal adaptation of the heart. Pharmacological inhibition produces a down-regulation of Notch target genes such as Hes1, Hey1, and Hey2, activates cardiac gene expression, and exacerbates cardiac hypertrophy. Hey genes, Hey2 in particular, were shown to inhibit cardiac gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), to block ventricular expression of atrial genes during cardiac development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) and in the adult heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), and to suppress cardiac hypertrophy via direct interaction with the transcription factor GATA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Experiments performed in embryonic stem cells lacking either Hey-2 or both Hey-1 and Hey-2 also suggest that Hey proteins negatively regulate the transcription of GATA-4 and GATA-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Therefore, Notch appears to limit the extent of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by negatively regulating cardiac gene expression. The reexpression of atrial genes, such as the atrial natriuretic factor, is a hallmark of the hypertrophic heart and likely contributes to alteration of cardiac function. Accordingly, cardiomyocytes lacking Notch1 demonstrate a stimulated cardiac gene program and a more mature (hypertrophic) phenotype. Notch activation may, therefore, represent a protective mechanism enabling cell survival. Indeed, mice lacking Notch1 in the heart demonstrate increased apoptotic cell death during the adaptive response to hemodynamic overload. Consistent with this, a recent study suggests that Notch activates protective signaling in the myocardium; specifically, cross talk between hepatocyte growth factor and its cognate receptor c-Met, the Akt&#x02013;PKB signaling pathway, and Notch regulates survival mechanisms in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>).</p><p>There is a striking difference between the cardiac phenotype that develops in TG1306/1R transgenic mice receiving a &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor (short-term inhibition) and that observed in hypertensive cNotch1 KOs (long-term inhibition). In a chronic model of cardiac hypertrophy and failure (TG1306/1R transgenics), short-term Notch inhibition results in increased cardiac performance, which likely reflects enhanced protein synthesis and sarcomeric assembly in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. In contrast, long-term inhibition in Notch1-deficient mice with renovascular hypertension (1K1C model) leads to maladaptive remodeling characterized by diminished cardiac function. Notch1-deficient hearts demonstrate severe cardiac fibrosis under conditions of hemodynamic overload associated with decreased animal survival. Tissue fibrosis is a sign of a deficient regenerative capacity in normally self-renewing organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). This observation suggests that cardiac dysfunction may result from decreased mobilization of CPCs and inadequate replacement of damaged cardiomyocytes. For instance, zebrafish can regenerate its partially amputated heart via proliferation of immature cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). This process relies in part on an activated Notch pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). In mutant fish lacking this regenerative capacity, the failure to form a new compact myocardium leads to fibrosis and scarring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>).</p><p>Recently, evidence has accumulated suggesting that cardiac myocytes can be continuously replaced in the heart through a process involving CPC replication and differentiation. Our results demonstrate the existence of Notch-activating CPCs that can give rise to functional cardiomyocytes. N1IC-positive cells coexpress GATA4 and/or Nkx2.5 in vivo and during expansion in vitro suggesting that CPCs are committed to the cardiogenic lineage. Interestingly, CPCs with an activated Notch1 pathway did not appear to express Sca-1, a widely used marker of CPCs in the heart. Whether Notch1 signaling and Sca-1&#x02013;positive CPCs represent two distinct steps toward cardiomyocyte differentiation or two separate cardiogenic lineages is still unclear. Furthermore, nonmyocyte cells with an activated Notch pathway express the proliferation marker Ki67 suggesting that these cells are actively cycling. In CPCs, down-regulation of Notch appears to be necessary for achieving terminal cardiac differentiation. By preventing cardiogenesis, Notch signaling may therefore facilitate the expansion of transient amplifying cells. In this context, it is interesting to note that the number of BrdU-positive cells in Notch1-deficient hearts is significantly lower than that observed in WT hearts under both basal and hemodynamic stress, indicating that proliferation of cardiac cells relies on a functional Notch1 pathway. The Notch pathway has been described to promote stem cell maintenance and proliferation in several different self-renewing organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). For instance, expansion of satellite cells in the skeletal muscle is dependent on an activated Notch pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). In cNotch1 KOs, Notch1 deletion is mediated by expression of the Cre recombinase under the control of the Mlc2v promoter. Therefore, the Notch pathway could act primarily in late committed precursors and/or immature cardiomyocytes in which the MLC2v promoter is activated. In isolated cardiomyocytes, Notch1 activation is associated with an immature phenotype characterized by the absence of organized sarcomeres. Sarcomere disassembly is a prerequisite for cardiomyocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>). The activation of the Notch pathway in cardiac myocytes could either preserve the capacity of incompletely differentiated cells to proliferate and/or facilitate the reentry of differentiated cardiomyocytes into the cell cycle in part by inhibiting sarcomeric protein synthesis. Accordingly, Ki67-positive cardiomyocytes with an activated Notch1 pathway are detected in the stressed heart. These cells could be primarily affected by Notch1 inactivation.</p><p>Blocking the Notch pathway promotes the differentiation of CPCs into cardiomyocytes and accelerates the maturation of cardiomyocytes. These findings are supported by several observations. First, CPCs differentiate more readily into cardiomyocytes when the Notch pathway is pharmacologically or genetically inhibited. Second, sarcomeric structures are more elaborate in cardiomyocytes lacking Notch1. Third, inhibition of the Notch pathway results in a striking up-regulation of cardiac gene expression both in vitro and in vivo. These Notch-mediated effects are very similar to those observed in embryonic stem cells, where Notch inhibits mesodermal commitment, cardiac differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), and cardiomyocyte production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). In contrast, forced N1IC expression in mesodermal cardiac progenitor cells expressing Mesp1 during development prevents cardiogenesis and results in cardiac abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). In cNotch1 KOs, the absence of Notch in transient amplifying cells could therefore induce premature differentiation, leading to a gradual exhaustion of the proliferating precursor pool, and affect the adaptive capacity of the heart.</p><p>The activation of the Notch pathway in the heart in response to stress likely depends on Jagged1 expression on the surface of cardiomyocytes. This is indicated by the high level of Jagged1 in the heart of 1K1C hypertensive mice and TG1306/1R transgenic animals. Reciprocal activation of the Notch pathway could then occur between adjacent myocytes. Jagged1 expression is decreased in mice receiving a &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor. This suggests that Notch-mediated inductive signaling may take place between neighboring cells to regulate Jagged1 expression. Indeed, a positive-feedback mechanism has been shown to control Jagged1 expression in the developing heart during the onset of endocardial cushion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Furthermore, Jagged1 on the surface of cardiomyocytes could also convey a signal to Notch1-positive CPCs lying in interstitial spaces. Interestingly, decreasing Jagged1 expression is observed in cultures of differentiating cardiac precursors, resulting in a down-regulation of the Notch pathway.</p><p>In CPCs clusters, some cells appear to activate Notch and some do not. Moreover, in pairs of adjacent cells, Notch is often activated only in one cell. Because down-regulation of the Notch pathway favors cardiac differentiation, it would be interesting to evaluate whether N1IC-positive cells are less advanced in their cardiogenic differentiation than N1IC-negative cells. Furthermore, it has yet to be determined whether cardiogenic differentiation during postnatal cardiogenesis requires asymmetrical CPC division, producing daughter cells preferentially expressing the Notch receptor or its ligand Jagged1. In the skeletal muscle, the maintenance and the proliferation of satellite cells are dependent on an activated Notch pathway. Pools of transient activating cells are amplified in the damaged muscle after expression of the Notch ligand Delta-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). Furthermore, the mechanism for initiating myogenic differentiation in undifferentiated precursors implicates the Notch antagonist Numb, which is asymmetrically distributed into dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Cells that inherit Numb are committed to the myogenic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Interestingly, undifferentiated Numb-positive cells have been found in the adult mouse heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). These cells could have undergone asymmetrical division similar to that seen during the regeneration of the skeletal muscle. Finally, it is noteworthy that the Notch-mediated regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle is gradually lost with age because of a decreased capacity to up-regulate Notch ligand expression and to recruit precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>). It will be important to determine whether a similar regulation exists in the heart as this may provide a mechanism by which cardiac function and the capacity of the left ventricle to adapt to hemodynamic overload decreases with age. If this is true, Notch may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiac diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>The transgenic mouse line TG1306/1R expressing angiotensinogen under control of the &#x003b1;-MHC promoter has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>).
