We report here that eukaryotic RNases H1 have evolved to be processive enzymes by attaching a duplex RNA-binding domain to the RNase H region. Highly conserved amino acids of the duplex RNA-binding domain are required for processivity and nucleic acid binding, which leads to dimerization of the protein. The need for a processive enzyme underscores the importance in eukaryotic cells of processing long hybrids, most of which remain to be identified. However, long RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids formed during immunoglobulin class-switch recombination are potential targets for RNase H1 in the nucleus. In mitochondria, where RNase H1 is essential for DNA formation during embryogenesis, long hybrids may be involved in DNA replication.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ribonucleases H (RNases H) cleave RNA of RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids in a sequence non-specific manner. They have been divided into two classes (type 1/I and 2/II) based on amino acid sequence and biochemical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). At least one type of RNase H is present in all organisms, although they are not essential in most prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>) or in single-cell eukaryotes such as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>) or <italic>Crithidia fasciculata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). However, in more complex organisms, such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>) or mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), RNase H1 is required during development. In mouse, RNase H1 is necessary for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) formation during embryogenesis. We found that <italic>Rnaseh1</italic>-null embryos stop developing shortly after implantation and undergo apoptotic cell death as a result of their failure to produce new mtDNA. RNase H is also a component of the reverse transcriptase (RT) of HIV-1 and other retroviruses, where it is necessary for the production of infectious virus particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The structures of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase HI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>) and the RNase H domain of HIV-1 RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) have been solved and shown to be very similar. Eukaryotic RNases H1 are related by sequence to <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI and HIV-1 RNase H, and presumably fold into a very similar 3D structure, an important consideration when developing drugs to target the retroviral enzyme due to the potential deadly side effects of inhibiting the essential cellular enzyme. Therefore, the characterization of the mammalian RNase H1 is key to the progress in developing effective drugs against the RNase H of HIV-1, as well as advancing our understanding of mtDNA biogenesis.</p><p>Like the HIV-1 RNase H, which is part of a multi-functional protein, eukaryotic RNases H1 are multi-domain enzymes, and more complex than their prokaryotic counterparts. At their N-terminus they have a double-stranded RNA, RNA&#x02013;DNA Hybrid binding domain (dsRHbd), a highly conserved sequence of &#x0223c;50 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). A connection region that varies from species to species in length and amino acid composition joins the dsRHbd to the C-terminal RNase H domain. In higher eukaryotes, we have shown by transient transfection experiments that RNase H1 localizes both to the nucleus and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). There are two in-frame AUG codons to produce two protein isoforms with different subcellular localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Translation from the first AUG includes a mitochondrial localization sequence (MLS), preceding the dsRHbd, which directs the protein to the mitochondria. The second AUG, after the MLS, initiates a protein that localizes exclusively to the nucleus. In our transient transfections we observed an unequal distribution of the two isoforms, with most of the protein present in the nucleus. The full-length form targeted to mitochondria is probably only transiently present <italic>in vivo</italic>, as most N-terminal MLS sequences are cleaved after they traverse the inner membrane to produce the mature protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>The RNase H domain of eukaryotic RNases H1, when expressed alone, is able to hydrolyze RNA of RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids just as the single-domain homologous protein from <italic>E.coli</italic> does, i.e. without the dsRHbd (data presented here and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Similarly, the N-terminal region of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RNase H1 binds well to nucleic acids, when produced without the RNase H domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Together, each domain influences the activity of the other in a magnesium-dependent manner. High Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion concentrations inhibit the dsRHbd while stimulating the RNase H activity of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RNase H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). It is not known how this regulation occurs or how the two regions interact physically, even though the structure of the first dsRHbd of the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RNase H1 has been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), and a rather reasonable model of the RNase H domain is easy to predict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>).</p><p>Employing a variety of experimental approaches, we have studied substrate binding and RNase H activity of mouse RNase H1 to determine what novel properties the dsRHbd bestows on the activity of the enzyme. Using a protein that starts at the second AUG codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), representing most of the enzyme made <italic>in vivo</italic>, and several protein derivatives defective in or devoid of the dsRHbd, we found that the dsRHbd induces dimerization of the protein upon binding to an RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid substrate. Dimerization confers processivity to the RNase H activity of the enzyme, a property that indicates the need to process long RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids in eukaryotic cells. This work constitutes an important advancement in our understanding of the biological roles of this essential class of enzymes and their possible function in mtDNA biogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein expression, purification and mutagenesis</title><p><italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI was expressed and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). The cDNAs for mouse and human RNases H1 starting at M27 were cloned in pET-15b (Novagen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). cDNAs for proteins starting at M135 (mouse) and M136 (human) were cloned in the pET-15b to produce proteins with only the RNase H domain. The cDNA for <italic>S.pombe</italic> RNase H1 starting at M1 was also cloned in pET-15b, as was the cDNA for a protein starting at C120, which was changed to M to make a protein corresponding to the RNase H domain of <italic>S.pombe</italic>. The QuickChange kit (Stratagene) was used to generate all site-directed mutants using custom-designed primers to change W43A (TGG to GCG), K59A (AAG to GCG) and K60A (AAA to GCA). All protein purifications were similar starting from <italic>E.coli</italic> cells induced to express the corresponding protein by addition of solid lactose to a final concentration of 0.4%. About 20 grams of frozen cells were broken by grinding with alumina in a mortar placed on ice. The extract was suspended in 100 ml of 40 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol, 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 &#x003bc;g/ml PMSF (buffer A) and treated with DNase I. Cell debris and ribosomes were removed by centrifugation, and proteins were purified using Talon resin column (Clontech, USA), by elution with buffer A containing 200 mM imidazole. Protein-containing fractions were combined, and after adding EDTA to 5 mM, precipitated with an equal volume of saturated (NH4)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. After centrifugation, the pellet was dissolved in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA (buffer B) and applied to a 7.5 &#x000d7; 75 mm TSK-GEL HPLC column SP-5PW (TosoHaas, Japan). Elution was performed using a linear gradient from buffer B to buffer B containing 1M NaCl. Tubes with the highest RNase H concentrations were combined and applied to a 10 &#x000d7; 1200 Sephacryl S-200 high resolution column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 1 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 10% glycerol, 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 1 mM EDTA. For surface plasman resonance (SPR) experiments, the Sephacryl column was run in STB buffer (10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.005% P20), and the protein was used within a few days and if found necessary concentrated on Microcon YM-10 Centrifugal Filter Device (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The latter resulted in a significant loss of protein. The purity of the proteins was &#x0003e;95% as demonstrated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE analysis with Coomassie blue staining.</p></sec><sec><title>Biosensor analysis</title><p>Experiments were performed in the BIACORE 1000 or BIACORE 2000 instruments at 25&#x000b0;C.

Running buffers were HBS (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.005% P20) or STB as indicated. To generate a sparsely populated surface with low negative charge that would significantly reduce non-specific binding of RNases H, the chip surface was pre-neutralized. Using HBS buffer, amino coupling reagent (NHS/EDC) was employed to activate the surface followed by deactivation with 1 M ethanolamine pH 8.5. NHS/EDC treatment was repeated. Immobilization of low levels of streptavidin (&#x0223c;200 RU) and capture of biotinylated nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) at 2 nM were essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). After nucleic acid capturing on the streptavidin coated chip surface, the surface was washed with 2 M NaCl, mimicking the regeneration step and removing the final traces of non-covalently bound streptavidin.</p><p>Proteins in STB buffer were injected at flow rates indicated in the Supplementary Figure S1 legend.

For <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI the basic protrusion provides some of the contacts to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), while in HIV-1 RT the RNase H primer grip supplies this function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Eukaryotic RNases H1 have a region corresponding to the basic protrusion that could serve as the substrate-binding site for hydrolysis. However, the dsRHbd of the eukaryotic enzymes is also involved in nucleic acid binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). To determine the contribution of the dsRHbd to substrate interactions, we have used SPR to compare the binding of mouse RNase H1 and <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI to various RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids.</p><p>Previously, we had employed SPR to measure binding of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI and HIV-1 RT to 36 bp RNA&#x02013;DNA and observed one mole of RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) and three moles of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) per 36 bp hybrid, consistent with the fact that the <italic>E.coli</italic> enzyme is much smaller, and occupies less space on the substrate. We started this work by using SPR analysis to compare the binding of mouse RNase H1 and <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI to the 36 bp RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid substrate. We observed about six moles of the mouse protein per mole of the hybrid (Supplementary Figure S1a), twice the value we obtained for <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI, an unexpected result because the mouse protein is larger and would be predicted to cover more, not less of the substrate. The binding of multiple proteins to a nucleic acid is a complicated process to study by SPR. To simplify these analyses, we designed a 12 bp hairpin hybrid that was stable in solution, and could be attached to the chip surface. We checked the interaction of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI with the 12 bp hairpin hybrid, and observed saturation at a ratio of one mole of protein per one mole of hybrid, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). For the mouse protein we found two moles of enzyme bound to the 12 bp hairpin hybrid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), again double that of the <italic>E.coli</italic> enzyme and consistent with the data obtained for the 36 bp RNA&#x02013;DNA.</p><p>To test whether the differences in stoichiometry between the two proteins were due to the extra sequences present in the mouse enzyme, we made a construct consisting only of the RNase H domain (RNase H1<sup>HD</sup>) of mouse RNase H1 and examined its binding to the 12 bp hairpin hybrid. Compared with the full-length protein, the binding curve looked very different. At the protein concentrations used in these assays RNase H1<sup>HD</sup> could not reach saturation. Even at the highest concentrations, the protein could only approach a one to one molar ratio to the hybrid substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), more similar to <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI than to the full-length mouse enzyme. These data show a strong influence of the N-terminal region of mouse RNase H1 on the manner in which the full-length protein interacts with hybrid substrates.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding of 2 mol of mouse RNase H1 to 12 mer hybrid substrate requires a functional dsRHbd</title><p>The dsRHbd is highly conserved among eukaryotic RNases H1 and is involved in duplex RNA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). We mutated amino acids important for binding to check their effect in protein-hybrid interactions by SPR.

At the 100 nM concentration RNase H1<sup>WKK</sup> only reached &#x0223c;0.5 mol of protein per mole of RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid, following a saturation pattern very similar to that of the RNase H1<sup>HD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>), and demonstrating a correlation between the presence of an active duplex RNA-binding domain and a two-to-one protein to substrate interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Purified mouse RNase H1 is monomeric</title><p>SPR results indicated different stoichiometric binding of mouse and <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase H1/I to RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids. The <italic>E.coli</italic> enzyme is known to be a monomer in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), but the mouse protein could be a dimer through interactions involving the dsRHbd. We checked the state of association of mouse RNase H1 by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) using both sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium and found that the enzyme was predominantly a monomer in solution, with &#x0003e;95% of the protein in monomeric state (Supplementary Figure S2). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments of mouse RNase H1 in the presence of the 12 bp RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid revealed an average stoichiometry of the protein-hybrid complex of 2.03:1 (data not shown) in good agreement with the SPR data. These results are consistent with the formation of a dimeric enzyme induced by binding to RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids.</p></sec><sec><title>One mole of mouse RNase H1 binds to 12 mer RNA&#x02013;RNA duplexes</title><p>Because the dsRHbd of eukaryotic RNases H1 is capable of binding RNA&#x02013;RNA duplexes as well as RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), we examined the interactions of mouse and <italic>E.coli</italic> RNases H1/I with a 12 bp RNA&#x02013;RNA hairpin by SPR. <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI failed to bind to the RNA&#x02013;RNA duplex demonstrating a strong preference for RNA&#x02013;DNA. In contrast, mouse RNase H1 bound well, although with a molar ratio of one mole of protein per mole of RNA&#x02013;RNA, a clear distinction from the binding to RNA&#x02013;DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), and an indication that the protein interacts in a different way with these two similar duplex RNAs. An interesting feature of the binding of mouse RNase H1 to dsRNA is that it is completely inhibited in the presence of 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), in agreement with previous reports describing the interaction of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RNase H1 and dsRNA by northwestern assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Because RNase H1 cleaves an RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, it is not possible to perform binding assays in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion with the full-length protein and a hybrid substrate.</p></sec><sec><title>GMSAs indicate dimer formation</title><p>Binding of six molecules of mouse RNase H1 to a 36 bp RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids could occur in different ways. We used GMSA to identify the nature of these interactions. Six molecules binding independently would produce six shifted bands, while under cooperative interactions, the binding of the first protein would rapidly attract the rest resulting in a single band of a complex containing six moles of protein per mole of hybrid. A third possibility is dimer formation upon substrate binding, which would generate three shifted bands consisting of one, two or three dimers per 36 bp RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid. The latter result was observed in the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> (upper panel). As the protein concentration increased, the wild-type enzyme shifted the hybrid into three bands (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) indicative of three independent dimers.</p><p>We also checked mouse RNase H1 mutant proteins altered in their dsRHbd and <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI by GMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI and the RNase H1<sup>HD</sup> of mouse did not produce discrete bands, only a smear in the case of the <italic>E.coli</italic> enzyme, and no change of mobility for the mouse H domain protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> middle and lower panel). The triple mouse mutant protein (RNase H1<sup>WKK</sup>) bound the substrate at very high protein concentrations, but instead of distinct bands, it produced aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> upper panel). The single (RNase H1<sup>W</sup>) and the double (RNase H1<sup>KK</sup>) mutant proteins formed bands migrating with the same mobility as the bands observed for the wild-type RNase H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), suggesting that these proteins can also form stable dimers, although they required significantly higher protein concentrations, especially RNase H1<sup>W</sup>. Moreover, while RNase H1 produced three shifted-bands with the 36 bp RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid, RNase H1<sup>KK</sup> formed two, and RNase H1<sup>W</sup> only one. These differences revealed the importance of W43, K59 and K60 in dimer formation. W43 was the most critical, and interestingly is the most highly conserved amino acid of the dsRHbd.</p><p>All of the enzymes were able to cleave the 36 bp RNA&#x02013;DNA (see the next section) but using GMSA some of the proteins interacted only transiently with the substrate and did not form stable complexes or dissociated during the electrophoresis producing a smear rather than discrete bands. Thus, stable complexes were formed only through the dsRHbd domain that is defective or missing in <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI, mouse RNase 1<sup>WKK</sup> and RNase H1<sup>HD</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>RNase H activity of <italic>E.coli</italic> and mouse RNase HI/1</title><p>We also examined the effect of the dsRHbd on the RNase H catalytic activity of the mouse wild-type and mutated RNases H1. We checked the degradation of poly(rA)/poly(dT) by the different proteins in the presence of various concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion. <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI had a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion optimum of &#x0223c;5&#x02013;10 mM, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). However, the mouse wild-type protein had its highest activity at &#x0223c;50 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), an unusually high value, and still retained &#x0223c;30% of its activity at 100 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The dsRHbd seemed to confer resistance to the inhibition of the RNase H activity by high Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration, because the proteins defective in or devoid of the dsRHbd have Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion dependence similar to the <italic>E.coli</italic> enzyme. RNase H1<sup>W</sup> and RNase H1<sup>KK</sup>, both only partially affected in their binding ability by GMSA, had Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion optima &#x0223c;10 mM. RNase H1<sup>WKK</sup> and the RNase H1<sup>HD</sup> had even lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion optima of &#x0223c;5 mM.</p><p>A fully active dsRHbd also enhanced the RNase H activity of the protein. Mouse wild-type RNase H1 had the highest specific activity of all the proteins tested, especially at its optimum of 50 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion. Decreased activity appeared to correlate with decreased functionality of the dsRHbd. Single and double mutant proteins had activities similar to wild type at 5&#x02013;10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, although much lower at 50 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion. The triple mutant protein had an activity similar to <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI, and RNase H1<sup>HD</sup> had the lowest enzymatic activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Similarity in cleavage products between <italic>E.coli</italic> and mouse RNase HI/1</title><p>We checked the influence of the dsRHbd on the degradation pattern of hybrid substrates using several RNA&#x02013;DNA duplexes ranging from 12 to 36 bp. On all of these substrates both mouse and <italic>E.coli</italic> RNases H cleaved at numerous sites but not at every phosphodiester bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and data not shown). In general, wild-type and mutant mouse proteins showed a similar degradation pattern, with only the relative frequencies of the hydrolytic products varying slightly. For the 36 bp RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid, RNA oligonucleotides of 7, 8 and 9 bases in length were prominent products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). For the 18 bp RNA&#x02013;DNA substrate, mouse proteins generated a series of oligomers of 5&#x02013;9 nt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). These same products were also observed when using <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI, but unlike the mouse proteins, the shorter oligonucleotides were only produced after significant levels of degradation had occurred (compare the 3 and 30 min time points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>). It seems that the dsRHbd facilitated cleavage closer to the end of the RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid (e.g. compare the relative amounts seven and nine oligomer products of wild-type RNase H1 and RNase H1<sup>WKK</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The different mutant mouse proteins showed a distribution of hydrolytic product in between the pattern of wild-type and <italic>E.coli</italic> RNases H related to the strength of the dsRHbd. As with other properties the more altered the dsRHbd the more similar the product formation was to the one shown by <italic>E.coli</italic> RNases HI.</p><p>The data reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref> were obtained with blunt end hybrids as substrates. When an additional unpaired T residue is added to the 3&#x02032;-end of the DNA, we observed a new RNA cleavage product one nucleotide shorter than without the extra-unpaired T (marked by arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Interestingly, adding any of several different substituents, which could be useful for cross-linking studies, to the 3&#x02032;-end of the DNA also permitted the formation of the shorter tetrameric RNA oligonucleotide regardless of the enzyme used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). All of the proteins, including <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI were able to cleave at this new site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), suggesting that the enzymes recognized these substrates in a very similar manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Digestion of poly(rA)/poly(dT) is affected by dsRHbd</title><p>Digestion products of short RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids were very similar for <italic>E.coli</italic> and mouse RNase HI/1. However, when we examined products of hydrolysis of longer hybrids by these two enzymes, and the mutant protein derivatives, we found a very different pattern of degradation related to the presence of an active dsRHbd. <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI cleaved poly(rA)/poly(dT) in a distributive manner producing a continuum of oligonucleotides of various length ranging in size from that of the starting substrate to two nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, mouse RNase H1, even at the earliest time points, had very few degradation products of intermediate size, releasing mainly small oligonucleotides indicative of complete digestion of the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Mouse RNase H1<sup>HD</sup> produced oligonucleotides in a broad size range, similar to the <italic>E.coli</italic> enzyme. A difference in digestion pattern between full-length and the RNase H domain protein derivative was also observed for other eukaryotic RNases H1. Human and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> enzymes degraded poly(rA)/poly(dT) similarly to the mouse protein and relied on their dsRHbd to produce mainly final products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p><p>We considered the presence of final products without abundant intermediate product formation as an indication of processive cleavage. To estimate the level of processivity for the different enzymes, we classified products &#x0003c;13 nt in length as &#x02018;final&#x02019; and those falling between 13 and &#x0223c;180 (marked by the vertical line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>) as intermediate products. The ratio of final to intermediate products was calculated from several experiments choosing samples with &#x02265;85% of the starting poly(rA)/poly(dT) still remaining. An &#x0223c;10-fold difference was found when comparing wild-type mouse and <italic>E.coli</italic> RNases H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). RNase H1<sup>HD</sup> and RNase H1<sup>WKK</sup> both gave values even lower than <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI. RNase H1<sup>W</sup> and RNase H1<sup>KK</sup> had ratios higher than <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI but much lower than the wild-type enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), indicating an intermediate level of processivity. From our results, we concluded that eukaryotic RNases H1 were acting processively and that their processivity was dependent on the dsRHbd.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Mouse RNase H1 forms dimers on RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids</title><p>Experiments using two different techniques, SPR and AUC, demonstrated that mouse RNase H1 was a monomer in solution, but formed a two to one complex on a 12 bp hairpin hybrid and about a six to one complex on a 36 bp RNA&#x02013;DNA. GMSA experiments were consistent with the two-to-one complex resulting from dimer formation on the 36 bp RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid rather than sequential binding. We have modeled these interactions by wrapping two molecules of RNase H1 around the RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To generate this model, we first replaced the RNase H of HIV-1 RT, complexed with the polypurine tract (PPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), by the known structure of the <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>). Because the RNase H domain of mouse RNase H1 is similar in sequence and presumably in structure to the <italic>E.coli</italic> and HIV-RT proteins, the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> could also be valid for the RNase H domain of the mouse protein. However, a model of a complex of the full-length protein would have to include the additional N-terminal region of eukaryotic RNase H1 and its interactions with the hybrid substrate. There is little room to accommodate more than one RNase H1 molecule on the &#x0223c;12 bp of the PPT RNA&#x02013;DNA shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> in a manner that would place the catalytic site of a second enzyme in register for cleavage. One way to fit two protein molecules is by placing them on opposite sides of the 12 bp hybrid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref>), either in the same or opposite orientations. With the proteins in opposite orientation, only one molecule would be able to cleave the substrate because of the asymmetric nature of the RNA&#x02013;DNA structure.</p></sec><sec><title>Dimers of mouse RNase H1 are processive nucleases</title><p>Completely encircling the substrate is a common manner for a protein to become processive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). The model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c and d</xref> is consistent with the main conclusion of the paper: eukaryotic RNases H1 are processive enzymes. Processive enzymes usually have large binding surfaces and participate in electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions to generate a complex between the protein and the polymer with relative high affinity, but no sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). In the case of eukaryotic RNases H1, interactions with an RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrid occurred through the dsRHbd and the RNase domain, and from our results it appeared that both regions are important, because missing either binding surface prevented both dimer formation and processive cleavage. RNase H1 bound dsRNA only through the dsRHbd, the RNase H domain did not interact with this polymer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and data not shown), and consequently dimers were not formed on dsRNA. Similarly, proteins deficient in (RNase H1<sup>KK</sup>, RNase H1<sup>W</sup> and RNase H1<sup>WKK</sup>) or lacking the dsRHbd (RNase H1<sup>HD</sup>) exhibit reduced dimerization and processivity levels, depending on the robustness of the binding of the dsRHbd.</p><p>The dsRHbd is a highly conserved amino acid sequence with a central core of hydrophobic residues. The surface residues include a conserved tryptophan (W43) and a few positively charged amino acids, including two highly conserved lysines (K59 and K60) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). For mouse RNase H1 the hydrophobic contacts provided by W43 were more important than the electrostatic interaction of K59 and K60, because RNase H1<sup>W</sup> was more defective in dimerization and processivity than RNase H1<sup>KK</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). The mutant protein lacking electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (RNase H1<sup>WKK</sup>) had a highly impaired dsRHbd and behaved essentially the same as the protein without the dsRHbd (RNase H1<sup>HD</sup>) and <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI; they bound only through the RNase H domain, which supports neither dimerization nor processivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Dimerization and processivity do not affect hydrolysis of short hybrids</title><p>Processivity was most obvious during the degradation of long hybrids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and had little effect on the hydrolysis of shorter substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We observed only small differences in the distribution of degradation products between <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI, and mouse RNase H1 and the different mutant protein derivatives, indicating that the RNase H domain largely dictated the site of hydrolysis. This is in marked contrast to the RNase H of RTs. A protein derived from MuLV RT containing only the RNase H domain retains activity but loses its specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), while in HIV-1 RT the RNase H domain relies on other portions of the protein for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>).</p><p>Although in mouse the dsRHbd had little effect on specificity, it affected both the specific activity and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion optimum of the enzyme. Wild-type RNase H1 had the highest activity, especially at its Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion optimum of 50 mM. The more impaired the dsRHbd, the lower the RNase H activity, and the higher the inhibition by Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion. Of all mutant proteins, RNase H1<sup>KK</sup> was the least defective in the dsRHbd and had the highest activity at 50 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, indicating that the dsRHbd was responsible for the unusually high Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion optimum of mouse RNase H1. The physiological significance of a 50 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion optimum is not clear, but previously we had suggested a model in which the activities of the two domains of the protein were inversely related in a magnesium-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>).</p><p>Several of the properties of mouse RNase H1 reported here are quite different from those reported for the human enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), including Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion optimum and the effect of the dsRHbd on cleavage site preference. The protein we used resembles that found <italic>in vivo</italic> and was produced in a soluble form in <italic>E.coli</italic>. The human RNase H1 protein used by the ISIS Pharmaceuticals group includes the MLS, representing the precursor of the mitochondrial isoform of RNase H1 and requires solublization after expression in <italic>E.coli</italic>. Therefore, we attribute discrepancies to the different modes of protein purification, and to the fact that we have used different protein isoforms, not to the biochemical differences between the human and mouse proteins.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> role of RNase H1</title><p>A requirement for a processive RNase H in eukaryotes may reflect the presence of RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids that are not normally found in bacteria. <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase HI acts in a distributive manner and can readily degrade the short RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids resulting from primer formation for DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Transcription of DNA normally does not produce RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids, but in <italic>E.coli</italic> uncoupling of transcription and translation leads to the generation of substantial amounts of hybrid that are presumably longer than the primers of DNA synthesis, and under some conditions they accumulate to levels that RNase HI cannot overcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, RNA&#x02013;DNA hybrids form when RNA-binding proteins fail to interact with nascent transcripts and can result in the stimulation of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>).
