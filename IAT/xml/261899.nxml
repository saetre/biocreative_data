They have the same chromosome number and genome sizes, and they occupy the same ecological niche. To explore the basis for this striking conservation of structure and function, we have sequenced the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> genome to a high-quality draft stage and compared it to the finished <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> sequence. We predict approximately 19,500 protein-coding genes in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> genome, roughly the same as in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content>. Of these, 12,200 have clear <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> orthologs, a further 6,500 have one or more clearly detectable <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> homologs, and approximately 800 <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> genes have no detectable matches in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content>. Almost all of the noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) known are shared between the two species. The two genomes exhibit extensive colinearity, and the rate of divergence appears to be higher in the chromosomal arms than in the centers. Operons, a distinctive feature of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content>, are highly conserved in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content>, with the arrangement of genes being preserved in 96&#x00025; of cases. The difference in size between the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> (estimated at approximately 104 Mbp) and <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> (100.3 Mbp) genomes is almost entirely due to repetitive sequence, which accounts for 22.4&#x00025; of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> genome in contrast to 16.5&#x00025; of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> genome. Few, if any, repeat families are shared, suggesting that most were acquired after the two species diverged or are undergoing rapid evolution. Coclustering the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> proteins reveals 2,169 protein families of two or more members. Most of these are shared between the two species, but some appear to be expanding or contracting, and there seem to be as many as several hundred novel <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> gene families. The <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> draft sequence will greatly improve the annotation of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> genome. Based on similarity to <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content>, we found strong evidence for 1,300 new <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> genes.

The completion of its genome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Celegans1">C. elegans Sequencing Consortium 1998</xref>) provides a complete description of the genetic information, but decoding the program embedded in the sequence remains a challenge.</p><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis briggsae</named-content> is another soil-dwelling nematode that diverged from <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> approximately 100 million years ago (MYA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Coghlan1">Coghlan and Wolfe 2002</xref>) and, along with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis remanei</named-content>, is one of <italic>C. elegans'</italic> closest known relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Jovelin1">Jovelin et al. 2003</xref>). The two organisms are almost indistinguishable morphologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Nigon1">Nigon and Dougherty 1949</xref>). They follow very similar developmental programs, for example, in sex determination and vulval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Kirouac1">Kirouac and Sternberg 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Stothard1">Stothard and Pilgrim 2003</xref>). There are, however, subtle differences between the two species. One interesting difference is the inability of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> to take up and distribute interfering RNAs (M. Montgomery, personal communication). There are also differences in the nature and timing of key events in the development of the vulva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Kirouac1">Kirouac and Sternberg 2003</xref>), the excretory pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Wang1">Wang and Chamberlin 2002</xref>), and the male tail (Fitch and Emmons 1995; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Fitch1">Fitch 1997</xref>).</p><p>Genomic sequencing of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> actually began in the mid-1990s, when the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University in St. Louis began sequencing large-insert clones from throughout the genome, eventually producing 12 Mbp of finished sequence.

We constructed a physical map for <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> using a high-throughput fingerprinting scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Marra1">Marra et al. 1997</xref>). Our substrates were two large-insert <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> libraries: a 6.5-fold coverage fosmid library (M. A. Marra, unpublished data) and a 10-fold coverage bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library (M. A. Marra and P. deJong, unpublished data).</p><p>After several rounds of automated assembly and manual review, we developed a physical map consisting of 188 fingerprinted contigs (FPCs) with a mean length of approximately 450 kbp containing 17,885 BAC clones and 16,414 fosmid clones. The longest FPC contig spans more than 4 Mbp of genomic sequence. Because there is little genetic mapping information for <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content>, these FPC contigs cannot currently be localized to chromosomal locations.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Shotgun Sequencing, Assembly, and Physical Map Integration</title><p>We performed WGS of small-insert plasmid libraries using the paired-end sequencing strategy introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Edwards1">Edwards et al. (1990</xref>). This was supplemented with end sequencing of clones from the BAC library in order to facilitate integration of the assembled sequence with the physical map. In all, 2.068 million shotgun reads were assembled, giving more than 10-fold coverage of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> genome. A total of 82&#x00025; of the shotgun reads were paired.</p><p>The WGS was then assembled using the Phusion assembler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Mullikin1">Mullikin and Ning 2003</xref>) into a set of 5,341 contigs; these contigs were linked together using the read pair information into a total of 899 gapped &#x0201c;supercontigs&#x0201d; containing 105.6 Mbp of DNA sequence and another 1.9 Mbp of inferred gaps. The N<sub>50 </sub>(the length <italic>x</italic> such that 50&#x00025; of the genome lies in blocks of <italic>x</italic> or longer) of the contigs was 41 kbp. The supercontigs were substantially larger, as reflected in an N<sub>50</sub> of 474 kbp. For reasons discussed below, the actual <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> genome may be slightly smaller than 105.6 Mbp.</p><p>To integrate the sequence assembly with the physical map, we performed a conceptual restriction digest of the 5,341 sequence contigs and incorporated them into the fingerprint map using automated assembly followed by manual review. During this process, misassemblies in both the physical map and the sequence assembly were detected and corrected.</p><p>Lastly, we integrated the sequence from 272 finished fosmid and BAC clones from many different regions of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> genome. We used this finished sequence to fill 264 gaps in the assembly, adding 269 kbp of sequence from 155 finished clones.</p><p>In the final analysis, 463 sequence supercontigs from the WGS assembly were placed in 142 FPC contigs. These 142 supercontigs had an N<sub>50</sub> length of 1,450 kbp and a total sequence length covering 102,431,873 bp, equivalent to 94&#x00025; of the summed length of all supercontigs. A total of 436 sequence supercontigs could not be placed onto the FPC map. These unplaced supercontigs were relatively small (largest, 103 kbp; mean, 13.8 kbp; SD, 16.6 kbp; N<sub>50</sub>, 34 kbp) and covered a total of 6.0 Mbp.</p><p>This version of the draft assembly is referred to as cb25.agp8.

We did this before incorporating the finished sequence into the assembly. The SSAHA algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Ning1">Ning et al. 2001</xref>), a fast search method for large DNA databases, was used to match previously finished contigs to the corresponding regions of the WGS draft. From this, we estimate that the contigs cover 98&#x00025; of the previously finished clone-based sequences and that the scaffolds span 99.3&#x00025; of the clone-based sequence. Thus, we estimate that the draft covers 98&#x00025; of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> genome.</p><p>Some 65,000 of the unassembled reads matched three or more other reads in the set. These represent 2.5&#x00025; of the total reads, suggesting that 2.6 Mbp of additional sequence is represented in these unplaced reads. Among these read clusters are the 5S, ribosomal DNA (rDNA), and mitochondrial sequences. Assembly of these reads yields a 14,420 base mitochondrial sequence, a 7,429&#x02013;7,431 base rDNA repeat unit, and a 697 and a 938&#x02013;940 base 5S repeat unit. Based on the total mitochondrial reads, we estimate on average approximately ten copies of the mitochondrial genome per haploid nuclear genome. Most other clusters appear to contain tandem copies of low complexity sequence of the type found scattered throughout the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> genome. Read pair and assembly information allow both the rDNA and 5S clusters to be placed in the current assembly. The rDNA sequences lie adjacent to telomeric repeats as they do in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content>. The two arrays of the 5S gene lie adjacent to each other.</p><p>To assess overall quality of the assembly and to evaluate the gap size estimate, we again used the comparison of the assembly to the finished clone sequence. We detected no global misassemblies. The 264 gaps that were filled with finished sequence contained a total estimated gap size of 179 kbp before filling. After gap filling, however, the total length of the assembly decreased by 323 kbp. Because of the change in the gap size estimates, we estimate that 3&#x00025; of the bases in the assembly consist of undetected overlaps. Combined with the estimated coverage of 98&#x00025;, this yields an estimate for the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> genome size of 104 Mbp. However, this figure contains substantial uncertainty, in part because the finished sequence is not a random selection of the genome, and this number is certain to be revised as additional finishing is performed.</p><p>We assessed sequence accuracy in two ways. First, we aligned the finished sequence to the final WGS assembly and counted discrepancies. Using this method, the accuracy is 99.98&#x00025;. Second, we examined the consensus quality scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Ewing1">Ewing and Green 1998</xref>; P. Green, unpublished data) across the assembly. These data again suggest a sequencing accuracy of approximately 99.98&#x00025;.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Content of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> Genome</title><p>To characterize the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> genome, we began with the following analyses of the content of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> genome: (1) identification of candidate protein-coding genes and development of a canonical gene set; (2) characterization of the predicted protein-coding gene set by domain analysis; (3) comparative analysis of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> proteomes using the predicted protein-coding gene set; (4) identification and characterization of candidate noncoding genes; and (5) characterization of the repeat family content of the genome.

Hence, four different gene prediction programs may give four strikingly different answers across the same region of the genome. An increasingly common procedure for overcoming this problem is to predict gene structures using several ab initio gene prediction programs, to compare their output in order to find a representative prediction, and then to partially or fully confirm the structures with experimental data from expressed sequence tags (ESTs), sequenced cDNAs, or protein similarity matches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Goff1">Goff et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Rogic1">Rogic et al. 2002</xref>). To find protein-coding genes in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content>, we developed an enhancement of this procedure that uses the concordance of predictions between <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> to predict the most likely gene model.</p><p>We predicted genes in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> genome using the programs Genefinder (version 980506; P.

These programs combine a variety of gene prediction methodologies, including ab initio predictions (Genefinder, FGENESH), EST- and protein-based comparisons (Ensembl), and sequence conservation metrics (TWINSCAN). We called genes in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> genome by combining hand-curated data models from WS77 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Stein1">Stein et al. 2001</xref>) with the ab initio predictions from Genefinder and FGENESH. For technical reasons, we were unable to run TWINSCAN on the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> genome, while the Ensembl methodology of predicting genes based on matches to previously predicted proteins meant that an Ensembl <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> gene set would essentially be a duplicate of the hand-curated WormBase set.</p><p>As expected, the output of the four gene prediction programs was largely concordant with respect to the position of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> exons (80&#x00025; of exons predicted identically by two or more programs, 26&#x00025; predicted identically by all four programs), but discordant with respect to gene predictions (38&#x00025; of genes called identically by two or more programs, just 4&#x00025; called identically by all four programs).

For each <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> region that had multiple overlapping but inconsistent predictions, our selection procedure chose the prediction that had the most extensive similarity to the matching <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> prediction. The extent of similarity was measured by the fraction of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> prediction that aligned to the matching <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> prediction at the protein level.

FGENESH made 2,742 predictions that overlapped a gold-standard gene, of which 1,230 (45&#x00025;) contained all the confirmed data. We also used the gold standard to assess our selection procedure. For <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> genes in the gold-standard set, the selection procedure chose the correct gene model for 92&#x00025; of gold-standard genes, choosing an alternative (incorrect FGENESH or Genefinder) model 8&#x00025; of the time.

Although it is possible for a gene in one species to have multiple orthologs in another species if the gene has duplicated since the two species diverged, for this analysis we used the simpler definition of a pair of genes that have a common ancestor and are in a one-to-one correspondence between the two species.</p><p>We found orthologs by searching for <italic>C. briggsae/C. elegans</italic> gene pairs that were each other's top BLASTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Altschul1">Altschul et al. 1997</xref>) match in the opposite species.

Both pairs of species diverged at roughly comparable times (80&#x02013;110 MYA for <italic>C. briggsae/C. elegans,</italic> 75 MYA for mouse/human) and show similar levels of amino acid identity between orthologs (80&#x00025; for <italic>C. briggsae/C. elegans,</italic> 78.5&#x00025; for mouse/human). Both genome pairs show large amounts of new repetitive elements, balanced presumably by deletions so that genome size between the pairs remains similar. A consequence of this for both pairs is that they share only approximately 50&#x00025; of the nonfunctional sequence from their last common ancestors.</p><p>However, as evidenced by multiple measures, <italic>C. briggsae/C. elegans</italic> are evolving more rapidly than mouse/human. In mouse/human, 80&#x00025; of predicted proteins could be assigned to a 1: 1 ortholog pair, whereas fewer than 65&#x00025; of <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. briggsae</named-content> genes could be assigned an ortholog in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> The flip side of this relationship is that protein families are more dynamic in the two nematodes; as many as several hundred families are either novel or have diverged so far that their common origin cannot be recognized and another 200 have expanded or contracted by more than 2-fold. This contrasts with the mouse/human comparison, in which the great majority of the genes are in identical order and orientation in the two species and in which just 25 instances of gene expansion due to local duplication were found. By a similar token, the number of genes lacking a sequence match in its opposite species (orphans) is 4&#x00025; in <italic>C. briggsae/C. elegans</italic>, but less than 1&#x00025; in mouse/human.</p><p><italic>C. briggsae/C. elegans</italic> are also evolving more rapidly at the nucleotide level, with a rate of synonymous substitution of 1.78 substitutions per synonymous site versus 0.6 substitutions per synonymous site in mouse/human. This is mirrored in a dramatic difference in chromosomal rearrangement rate, which is roughly an order of magnitude higher in the nematodes (4,837 conserved syntenic blocks of mean size 37 kbp) than in mouse/human (342 syntenic blocks of mean size 6.9 Mbp).</p><p>None of this should be too surprising, as evolutionary rate is better measured in generations than in years, and the generation time of the two nematodes is presently an order of magnitude or more faster than the two mammals.

For DNA preparation, culture volumes of 2&#x000d7; YT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Sambrook1">Sambrook et al. 1989</xref>) containing chloramphenicol were inoculated with a single colony from a freshly streaked plate. After culture growth in 96-well blocks, glycerol stocks were prepared and sealed. Bacterial cell cultures were pelleted by centrifugation, excess culture media was removed, and the cells were placed immediately on ice. We prepared DNA using a modified alkaline lysis procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Sambrook1">Sambrook et al. 1989</xref>). The cell pellet was thoroughly resuspended by addition of GET/RNAase, the cells were lysed, and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation. After centrifugation, supernatant-containing DNA was separated from the cell debris and transferred to a filter. The DNA was precipitated and the DNA pellet washed, dried, resuspended, and collected in the bottom of the well.</p><p>Individual restriction digests for BAC and fosmid DNA contained ddH20, <italic>Hind</italic>III, <italic>Pst</italic>I, and the DNA. Components of the digestion cocktail were assembled in plates and digested by incubation in a 96-well thermocycler. After digestion, the DNA was collected in the bottom of the wells by brief centrifugation, and loading dye was added to each well. We prepared and cooled 1&#x00025; agarose gels and then poured them into UV-transparent trays. The comb was inserted until the gel solidified. Gels were placed into electrophoresis units. The restriction enzyme digestion/loading dye mixture was loaded into each well, with standard marker DNA added in the first well and in every fifth well thereafter. Samples were electrophoresed, and buffer was recirculated under constant temperature. The total electrophoresis time was 8 h. After electrophoresis, gels were removed to plastic trays containing SYBR (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, Maryland, United States) or Vistra (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon, United States) Green and imaged using a Molecular Dynamics FluorImager (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsalla, Sweden. The FluorImager was also used to measure DNA yield.</p><p>The restriction fragment bands were identified interactively using IMAGE (D. Platt, F. Wobus, and R. Durbin, Sanger Institute; <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Image/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Image/</ext-link>). Band cell data were collected and loaded into the fingerprint-mapping software FPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Soderlund1">Soderlund et al. 1997</xref>, 2000). Experimentally determined parameters for initial automated &#x0201c;binning&#x0201d; of related clones within FPC were: tolerance &#x0003d; 7, cutoff score &#x0003d; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> (for fosmids) and 10<sup>&#x02212;13</sup> (for BACs), Diff &#x0003d; 0.3, minbands &#x0003d; &#x02212;3, Diffbury &#x0003d; 0.10, MinEnd &#x0003d; 8. The &#x0201c;tolerance&#x0201d; is a window size; for example, if the tolerance is set to 7, then two restriction fragments occurring in different fingerprints must have relative mobilities within 0.7 mm to be considered equivalent fragments. The &#x0201c;cutoff score&#x0201d; is a threshold representing the maximum allowable probability of a chance match between any two clones (the &#x0201c;Sulston score&#x0201c;; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Sulston1">Sulston et al. 1988</xref>). The lower the cutoff score, the lower the probability that a match has arisen by chance and the more extensive the overlap between any two clones. Practical experience with our human fingerprint data has led us to apply a cutoff score of 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>.</p><p>After initial &#x0201c;binning&#x0201d; of related clones into contigs, manual ordering of clones was performed within FPC. Ordering proceeded as follows: (1) a complex clone was chosen to be the initial clone to seed the contig (clone A); (2) the clone exhibiting the best match to the seed clone (by Sulston score) was selected (clone B); (3) if clone B had no unique restriction fragments, it was hidden under clone A; (4) if clone B had unique fragments, we repeated the search against the clones within the contig to find the best match (clone C); (5) the fingerprint of clone C was compared manually against the fingerprints of clones A and B; (6) to incorporate clone C into the contig, we required that the restriction fragments unique to clone B were present in clone C.</p><p>In this repeating, stepwise manner, we proceeded both to the &#x0201c;left&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;right&#x0201d; through the contig from the initial seed clone. After ordering within all contigs, contigs were searched against one another at reduced stringency to find potential joins between contigs.

All traces were then assembled using PHRAP (P. Green, unpublished data). We manually edited the data and selected primers (for improving data quality or for gap closure) using CONSED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000045-Gordon1">Gordon et al. 1998</xref>).

After merging contigs, we had 105.6 Mbp of sequence in 5,341 contigs, with an N<sub>50</sub> contig size of 41 kbp (indicating that half the assembly is represented in contigs larger than 41 kbp).

These simulated clones were compared to the clones in the physical map. We calculated the Sulston score and used it as a measure of possible overlap, thereby positioning the simulated BACs onto the physical map. Additionally, BAC end reads were placed onto the physical map by virtue of their name. This process allowed integration of map information, which could then be sorted by supercontigs across FPC contigs or by FPC contigs across supercontigs. We then evaluated the consistency of this mapping information. A lack of consistency suggested possible breaks in either the sequence assembly or the physical map.
