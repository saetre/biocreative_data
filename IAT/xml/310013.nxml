The A element is essential for muscle-specific transcription of the myosin HC beta gene. Recently, we have identified both muscle-specific and ubiquitous factors (A1 and A2 factors, respectively) that bind to the A element. Since the sequence of the A element is very similar to the GTIIC motif in the SV40 enhancer, we examined the relationship between A-element-binding factors and a GTIIC binding factor TEF-1, recently isolated from HeLa cells. The GTIIC motif was bound by the A1 and A2 factors in muscle nuclear extracts and competed with the A element for DNA-protein complex formation. Antibody against human TEF-1 'supershifted' the ubiquitous A2 factor-DNA complex, but did not alter the mobility of the muscle-specific A1 factor-DNA complex. We isolated a murine cDNA clone (mTEF-1) from a cardiac cDNA library. The clone is highly homologous to Hela cell TEF-1. The in vitro transcription/translation product of mTEF-1 cDNA bound to the A element, and the DNA binding property of mTEF-1 was identical to that of the A2 factor. Transfection of mTEF-1 cDNA into muscle and non-muscle cells confirmed that mTEF-1 corresponds to A2, but not to A1 factors. The mTEF-1 mRNA is expressed abundantly in skeletal and cardiac muscles, kidney and lung, but it is also expressed at lower levels in other tissues. These results suggest that the M-CAT binding factors consist of two different factors; the ubiquitous A2 is encoded by mTEF-1, but the muscle-specific A1 factor is distinct from mTEF-1.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0182-a" xlink:role="4105"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0183-a" xlink:role="4106"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0183-b" xlink:role="4106"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0185-a" xlink:role="4108"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0185-b" xlink:role="4108"/></fig><fig id="F6"><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0185-c" xlink:role="4108"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0180.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4103"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0181.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4104"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0182.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4105"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0183.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4106"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0184.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4107"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0185.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4108"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0186.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4109"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00066-0187.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4110"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
