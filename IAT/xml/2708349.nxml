However, this hypothesis remains untested as it is not possible to selectively remove the acquired aneuploidy in cells that already have altered growth. Using a yeast model bearing <italic>mcm4<sup>Chaos3</sup></italic>, an allele that causes mammary tumors in mice, these technical hurdles in animal cells can be overcome. We show that aneuploidy is not responsible for accelerated proliferation in yeast but mutations in just a few loci are.

An obvious explanation for their emergence is that secondary genetic events must have overcome the growth defects of the minute progenitors. To investigate these secondary genetic events, seven giant colonies with lineages traced to a single founder cell were characterized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000161-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

If aneuploidy were associated with Igp, slow-growing siblings of fast growers would not be aneuploid or would have distinct genetic aberrations. The giant colony G3's minute sibling (S3P) was streaked further to generate G3P because S3P was too unstable for karyotype analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000161-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Remarkably, we found that G3 and G3P share multiple identical genetic aberrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000161-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). These aberrations unlikely arose independently and more likely arose in S3, the slowly proliferating minute progenitor cells of G3 and S3P. Therefore the progenitor cell of S3P must have already acquired the aneuploidy that is associated with improved growth in G3 and G3P, suggesting that aneuploidy is unrelated to Igp. Despite their identical aneuploidy, G3 and G3P have distinctly different viability, cell cycle profiles, and colony sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000161-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000161.s002">Figure S2B</xref>).

To investigate when aneuploidy was acquired, we compared the karyotypes of pairs of fast-proliferating strains each derived from a common minute progenitor. Giant colonies G1-1 and G1-2, both derived from minute colony S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000161-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), shared a common translocation of a segment of the right arm of Chromosome VII to the left arm of Chromosome XVI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000161-g003">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000161.s003">S3A</xref>), suggesting that this particular translocation event may have occurred very early during the clonal expansion of S1.

We estimate that &#x0223c;20 cell divisions are required to form a visible colony of 10<sup>6</sup> cells in a minute colony.

G2-2 on the other hand is recessive for the Igp (unpublished data). The important point here is that we believe that many mutations that cause Igp can be identified.

DNA from the experimental strain was labeled with Cy3 nucleotide, and DNA from wild-type strain was labeled with a Cy5 nucleotide. The two DNA samples were mixed and hybridized to Yeast Whole Genome ChIP-on-chip Microarray from Agilent (290 nt resolution, 4&#x000d7;44 K-slide format, which contains &#x0223c;85&#x00025; of the nonrepetitive portion of the yeast genome catalog number G4493A). Arrays were then washed according to the Agilent SSPE wash protocol, and scanned on an Agilent scanner or Axon 4000B microarray scanner. The image was processed using the default settings with Agilent Feature Extraction software or GenePix Pro 6.0. All data analysis was performed using the resulting log2 ratio data, and filtered for signals that are 2.5-fold above background in at least one channel. Chromosome translocations are confirmed by PCR analysis and pulsed field electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Correlation between Improved Growth and Aneuploidy</title><p>The confidence level of the correlation between improved growth and aneuploidy based on seven randomly selected giant colonies is 1&#x02212;<italic>n</italic><sup>7</sup> where <italic>n</italic> is the probability of chromosome rearrangement occurring in a single cell.
