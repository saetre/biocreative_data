An autoradiograph of the purified protein, separated into polypeptides by denaturing gel electrophoresis, indicated that the largest subunit (RPB1) is modified by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006959-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

These same fractions were enriched for endogenous RNAP-II. Transcriptionally active endogenous RNAP-II also migrated at this position in similar sedimentation velocity measurements (data not shown). Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins captured by polyclonal anti-RPB4 antibody demonstrated the presence of tagged-1/3 &#x003a8;CTD, tagged-2/3 &#x003a8;CTD, or endogenous RPB1 in RNAP-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006959-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

The <italic>T. brucei</italic> RNAP-II uses a non-canonical CTD for cell growth and viability. The growth defect associated with &#x003a8;CTD deletions was likely a direct result of decreased mRNA production. Specifically, when the &#x003a8;CTD is truncated, defective RNAP-II produced less mRNA and SL RNA and increased abortive initiation products.</p><p>A consequence of a non-canonical CTD is the opportunity for RNAP-II to partner with unknown proteins. This contention is best illuminated by the elegant biochemical and structural studies in <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic>. Here, a non-canonical CTD partners with a <italic>Trichomonas</italic>-specific protein, IBP39, to stably assemble RNAP-II at the initiator element of promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006959-Schumacher1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

We speculate that some of these proteins participate in gene expression through specific interaction with &#x003a8;CTD. Indeed, a ten amino acid motif (SSYHLQ-SVAP) is shared among trypanosomes within the serine/proline-rich subdomain of &#x003a8;CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006959-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This motif is within the 2/3 &#x003a8;CTD truncation that rescued cells when wild-type RNAP-II was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006959-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006959-g006">6</xref>). In summary, these observations are consistent with non-canonical CTD having significant roles in organism-specific RNAP-II machineries.</p><p>Modification of canonical CTD by phosphorylation at specific serine residues is required for orchestrating transcriptional activities in better studied eukaryotes. It is known that a S<sub>5</sub> phospho CTD-code dictates that an enzyme leaves a preinitiation complex, and a S<sub>2</sub> phospho CTD-code dictates that an enzyme becomes elongation competent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006959-Phatnani1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>T.brucei</italic>, we found phosphorylated forms of &#x003a8;CTD within RNAP-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006959-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Proteolytic digestion of phospho-&#x003a8;CTD produced what was most likely a heterogeneous set of differentially phosphorylated &#x003a8;CTDs. We note that there are &#x0223c;30 potential phosphorylation sites within the 2/3 &#x003a8;CTD that are absent from the 1/3 &#x003a8;CTD. Thus, we speculate that a phosphorylation-code occurs within the &#x003a8;CTD in <italic>T. brucei</italic> that may account for the two different RNAP-II-dependent reactions, namely, transcription of short, capped SL RNAs and long pre-mRNAs. Such a &#x003a8;CTD code may allow RNAP-II to specifically function at the SL RNA gene promoter, much like the S<sub>7</sub> phosphorylation mark on the mammalian CTD directs polymerase specifically during small nuclear RNA transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006959-Egloff1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The structure of the canonical CTD is divided into three subdomains: the linker region, the central reiterated region that harbors intact and degenerate heptapeptide repeats, and the terminal short acidic peptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006959-Chapman2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The &#x003a8;CTD parallels the CTD in structure; it contains a linker region of size similar to CTD, a central serine/proline-rich region, and a terminal short acidic peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006959-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In the case of 1/3 &#x003a8;CTD, the RNAP-II contained a &#x003a8;CTD having only the linker region plus a small part of the central serine/proline-rich region. This enzyme failed to rescue cell growth when wild-type RNAP-II was depleted. In addition, we did not observe phosphorylation of the 1/3 &#x003a8;CTD. In contrast, 2/3 &#x003a8;CTD of RNAP-II contained the linker region plus half of the central serine/proline-rich region. This enzyme was phosphorylated within the &#x003a8;CTD and allowed cell growth in the absence of wild-type RNAP-II. Taken together, it appears that the central serine/proline-rich region of the &#x003a8;CTD is important for polymerase function.</p><p>Although 2/3 &#x003a8;CTD could sustain cell growth, it generated increased levels of abortive transcripts. Nascent transcription in cells containing the 1/3 &#x003a8;CTD generated even higher levels of abortive transcripts. These transcripts were confirmed to be abortively initiated RNA, as they possessed 5&#x02032; tri-phosphate ends, a signature of transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006959-g007">Figure 7B, C and D</xref>). Studies of the mammalian CTD indicate that an RNAP-II having only 5 heptapeptide repeats can bind a gene promoter but is defective in initiating transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006959-Chapman3">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This mutant CTD is structurally similar to our 1/3 &#x003a8;CTD, because it contains the linker region, a very small part of the central region, and the terminal acidic region. Thus, the central region of both the &#x003a8;CTD and CTD plays a role in the transition from an initiating polymerase, which generates abortive RNAs, to an elongating enzyme, which produces full- length mRNAs.</p><p>An unexpected and interesting observation was made when an RNAP-II with 1/3 &#x003a8;CTD was expressed in cells along with wild-type levels of endogenous RNAP-II. Within 16 hours of 1/3 &#x003a8;CTD expression, cells ceased to move, changed their shape, formed large aggregates, and soon died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006959-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). These dramatic phenotypic changes were not observed when 1/3 &#x003a8;CTD was expressed in cells along with very low levels of endogenous RNAP-II. In this case cells merely stopped dividing by day 2 and slowly died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006959-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

A stress response may account for the observed, abrupt morphological alterations in the cells expressing both the mutant and the endogenous polymerase. An actively transcribing polymerase in cells with abundant wild-type RNAP-II enables cells to respond to the stress imposed by the mutant &#x003a8;CTD. In contrast, cells with limited number of active polymerase could not.

The transgene uses the endogenous procyclin/GPEET promoter and a 3&#x02032;UTR derived from the aldolase mRNA. A blasticidin&#x02013;resistance gene, which follows the transgene, is co-expressed using actin 5&#x02032; SAS and 3&#x02032;UTR regions. pAD74 was derived from pLEW100, minus the luciferase open reading frame and containing a blasticidin-resistance gene in place of the phleomycin-resistance gene and an rRNA promoter in place of the procyclin/GPEET promoter.</p><p>Plasmid RPB3-SBP was generated by joining the RPB3 open reading frame (Tb927.3.550) with the protein A open reading frame and the Streptavidin binding protein (SBP) open reading frame (a gift from Larry Simpson) and cloned into pAD71 downstream from the procyclin/GPEET 5&#x02032;UTR. To establish mutant RNAP-II, we generated epitope tagged versions of RPB1, with varying truncations of &#x003a8;CTD. A Ty1-tag (EVHTNQDPLD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006959-Bastin1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> at the N-terminus allowed us to monitor the expression of mutant RPB1 proteins. Transgenes expressing mutant RNAP-II were designed with a well-characterized 3&#x02032;UTR of aldolase (ALD) mRNA and thus resistant to the RNAi-targeting of endogenous RPB1 mRNA. The C-terminal five conserved amino acids, which contribute to RPB1 stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006959-Chapman3">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, was included in each of the four transgene constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006959-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). For constitutive expression of the transgenes, the tagged and mutant RPB1 ORFs were cloned into pAD71. For inducible expression of the transgenes, they were cloned into pAD74.
