Although the normal heart does not express TNF-&#x003b1;, this cytokine is expressed within the myocardium as well as in the peripheral circulation in patients with heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Latini et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Torre-Amione et al., 1996</xref>). When selectively overexpressed in the mouse heart, TNF-&#x003b1; leads to the development of a dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) that recapitulates the classical transition to failure with progressive left ventricle (LV) dysfunction and remodeling, cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and progressive myocyte loss by apoptosis (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mann, 2003</xref>). Recently, we have shown that TNF-&#x003b1; provokes cardiomyocyte apoptosis and LV wall thinning through activation of both the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways that converge on effector caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haudek et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Active effector caspases cleave several intracellular substrates, including various cytoskeletal components, leading to cytoplasmic budding, nuclear condensation, and formation of apoptotic bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kayalar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caulin et al., 1997</xref>). The reorganization of intermediate filaments (IFs) seems to be a main target during apoptosis because many structurally related IF proteins are specifically cleaved by different members of the caspase family within the L1&#x02013;L2 linker region between two conserved &#x003b1;-helical domains. The first IF proteins identified as caspase substrates were the nuclear lamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lazebnik et al., 1995</xref>) followed by the cytoplasmic IF proteins, cytokeratins 14, 18, and 19, vimentin, and desmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caulin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ku et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). However, the biological significance of this caspase action on IFs is presently unknown.</p><p>In adult cardiomyocytes, desmin, the muscle-specific IF protein, forms a 3D scaffold that links the contractile apparatus to the costameres of plasma membrane, intercalated disks (IDs), the nucleus, and also other membranous cellular organelles (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capetanaki et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2007</xref>). Attempts to determine the function of desmin have increased over recent years, as mutations within its gene have been linked to several human inherited myopathies called desmin-related myopathies (DRMs), which are characterized by desmin-positive amorphous or granular material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schroder et al., 2007</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldfarb et al., 2004</xref>). Desmin, together with other cytoskeletal proteins, forms a continuous network that extends from the nuclear to the extracellular matrix (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Capetanaki et al., 2007</xref>). Human mutations of different components of this network, including desmin, are linked to DCM and heart failure (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seidman and Seidman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Towbin and Bowles, 2002</xref>). Therefore, it has been speculated that in addition to the known DRMs, desmin might be involved indirectly in different cardiomyopathies caused by mutations in other components of the network.</p><p>A milestone in our current understanding of desmin function was the generation of desmin-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Milner et al., 1996</xref>). Desmin-deficient mice develop a progressive and generalized myopathy that mainly affects the myocardium. In desmin-null mice, transient cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is followed by the development of a DCM that is characterized by mitochondrial ultrastructural and other defects, calcified and fibrotic lesions, and extensive cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Milner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thornell et al., 1997</xref>). Desmin has also been implicated in the apoptotic pathway because it is cleaved specifically at the 263 aspartic acid residue (D), by caspase-6 in vitro, as well as in myogenic cells induced to undergo apoptosis after treatment with TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In an effort to investigate the potential involvement of desmin in the cascade of events leading to TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced cardiomyopathy, we examined its intracellular distribution in transgenic mice with cardiac-restricted overexpression of secreted TNF (&#x003b1;&#x02013;myosin heavy chain promoter-driven secretable TNF-&#x003b1; [MHCsTNF] mice). In this study, we demonstrate that in cardiomyocytes from the MHCsTNF hearts, desmin forms aggregates and is absent from IDs. The recently discovered and defined cardiomyocyte junctional structures, termed area composita (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franke et al., 2006</xref>), were also affected in a desmin-dependent fashion. Ultrastructural experiments revealed that the architecture of the IDs is generally affected in MHCsTNF hearts. To assess the importance of desmin's cleavage in vivo, we outcrossed transgenic mice that express only the desmin mutant (D263E), which is resistant to cleavage by caspase-6, with the MHCsTNF mice. These experiments revealed that the TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced cleavage of desmin is an important mechanism for its loss from IDs. The products of the desmin cleavage are detected in ubiquitin-positive aggregates, whereas in the TNF-&#x003b1; myocardium expressing the transgenic D263E desmin, a number of these aggregates were decreased and were not colocalized with desmin. Apart from relocation of the ID proteins, the D263E desmin attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis, prevented LV wall thinning, and improved the function of the MHCsTNF hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>TNF-&#x003b1; overexpression leads to desmin aggregation and disappearance from IDs</title><p>Desmin is normally localized at Z disks and IDs of cardiac muscle. Using confocal microscopy, we investigated the potential effect of TNF-&#x003b1; on desmin localization. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, TNF-&#x003b1; overexpression leads to desmin aggregation and loss from ID structures but not from Z disks. To study the temporal pattern of this alteration, we looked as early as 15 d after birth and found that desmin was already absent from the IDs (Fig. S1, a and b; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710049/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710049/DC1</ext-link>). Aggregate formation and ID abnormalities were confirmed by ultrastructural experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, electron micrographs from 3-mo-old MHCsTNF mice revealed the presence of numerous amorphous aggregates in the sarcoplasm. The aggregates were variable in composition, consisting of differing amounts of granular material, vesicles, membranous whorls, and, occasionally, clumps of electron-dense material (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, TNF3). Mitochondria were also found scattered throughout some aggregates. These aggregates disrupted the normal alignment of myofibrils and frequently exhibited perinuclear localization.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Desmin is absent from IDs and forms cytoplasmic aggregates in MHCsTNF mice.</bold> (A) Representative myocardial cryosections from 3-mo-old WT and MHCsTNF littermates were labeled for desmin and analyzed by confocal microscopy.

Unlike the long, steplike IDs frequently observed in normal myocardium, MHCsTNF IDs were more punctuate and disorganized (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, TNF1). Compared with normal myocardium, IDs were also more sparse and difficult to detect. Z disks displayed abnormalities as well, frequently appearing wavy or bent. Occasionally, material from Z disks adjacent to aggregates appeared to be streaming into the aggregate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, TNF3). Mitochondrial shape changes, swelling, and lysis were also observed, as were apoptotic myonuclei. Our studies confirm some previous observations, which had also revealed abnormalities in myofibril alignment as well as mitochondrial defects in MHCsTNF myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sivasubramanian et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>TNF-&#x003b1; overexpression leads to progressive mislocalization of ID proteins in vivo and in vitro</title><p>To examine whether the TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced malformation of IDs influences the position of the ID proteins, we performed similar immunofluorescent experiments using antibodies against desmoplakin, &#x003b2;-catenin, and connexin 43, which are characteristic proteins of desmosomes, adherent junctions, and gap junctions, respectively. At day 15 after birth, desmoplakin and &#x003b2;-catenin localize almost normally in MHCsTNF mice in contrast to connexin 43, which has already moved from IDs to the lateral side of cardiomyocytes (Fig. S1, c&#x02013;h). However, in the 3-mo-old MHCsTNF mice, all studied proteins were primarily localized at the lateral, nonjunctional side of the cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Desmin is implicated in TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced desmoplakin and &#x003b2;-catenin mislocalization.</bold> Myocardial cryosections from WT (a, e, and i), MHCsTNF (b, f, and j), MHCsTNF des<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (c, g, and k), and D263E MHCsTNF des<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (d, h, and l) mice at 3 mo of age were labeled for &#x003b2;-catenin (e&#x02013;h) and connexin 43 (i&#x02013;l) and were double labeled for &#x003b1;-actinin (green) and desmoplakin (red; a&#x02013;d) followed by confocal microscopy analysis.

We found that desmin aggregates colocalize with HSP25 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). HSP25 exhibits both a cytoplasmic and striated staining pattern in WT longitudinal sections of cardiomyocytes incubated with anti-HSP25 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A, f</xref>).

Immunofluorescent experiments revealed that HSP25 aggregates were considerably decreased and restricted only to perivascular areas (not depicted).

Disruption of the cytoskeleton is a key event in apoptotic pathways. There are several studies attempting to shed light on the role of the cleaved IF products in the execution of apoptosis without having unraveled, until now, the exact mechanism (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oshima, 2002</xref>). The first important finding of this study is the loss of desmin and other junctional proteins from IDs in the heart of MHCsTNF mice. The localization of desmin at Z disks did not seem to be affected dramatically, thus suggesting a different and less dynamic association of desmin at these sites.</p><p>To study the involvement of desmin cleavage in the TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced apoptotic pathways and its possible connection with its disappearance from IDs, we generated transgenic mice that express the caspase cleavage-resistant D263E desmin. In bitransgenic mice that overexpress both TNF-&#x003b1; and the D263E desmin, we observed that the latter remains localized at high levels at the IDs, indicating that desmin cleavage is a major step for its removal from IDs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>). Here, we show for the first time that inhibition of TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced cleavage of an IF rescues the proper maintenance of ID components at their position. Although the biological significance of such cleavage is not clearly known, it is widely accepted that it eliminates different protective mechanisms, thus facilitating cell death. The caspase-mediated proteolysis of the nuclear lamins may facilitate nuclear condensation, whereas cleavage of desmin might facilitate cardiomyocyte degeneration via mitochondrial collapse. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>, although the level of desmin cleavage in response to TNF-&#x003b1; was modest, the cleavage products of desmin were sufficient to cause IF aggregation. The caspase-mediated desmin degradation could act in parallel with other proteolytic enzymes, such as calpains, which are known to be activated by TNF-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bajaj and Sharma, 2006</xref>) and could explain the other desmin fragment observed, specifically in TNF-&#x003b1; specimens (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). This cleavage does not seem to contribute to the majority of the desmin aggregates and aggregate-related ID alterations, ameliorated extensively in D263E MHCsTNF des<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, in which this fragment is still present. However, it could contribute to the remaining problems of these hearts.</p><p>We have shown that desmin cleavage mediates changes in the distribution of other proteins of the area composita such as desmoplakin, &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, d and h</xref>), and plakoglobin (not depicted). Desmin interacts directly through its C-terminal domain with desmoplakin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lapouge et al., 2006</xref>), and deletions or missense mutations in the desmoplakin gene cause the loss of desmin from IDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaplan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). On the other hand, here we demonstrate that desmin is not required for the maintenance of desmoplakin at the IDs. Collectively, the aforementioned data show that desmoplakin is required for the anchorage of desmin to desmosomes; however, they do not explain why the modification of desmin is more crucial than its absence for desmoplakin destabilization. This is the first to report linking TNF-&#x003b1; signaling with the loss of desmin from IDs as well as the interference of desmin cleavage fragments with stabilization of other components of the IDs. However, the mechanism underlying this abnormal positioning of the ID proteins remains elusive.</p><p>TNF-&#x003b1; mediates cell&#x02013;cell dissociation and is associated with the disordered expression of cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin in endometrial epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tabibzadeh et al., 1995</xref>). Another study in primary cultures of human nasal and small airway epithelial cells has demonstrated that TNF-&#x003b1; induces the mislocalization of adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin, and it is involved in morphological change of the cells, with less coherence and rounder shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carayol et al., 2002</xref>). Our in vitro results are in accordance with our in vivo observations and confirm that TNF-&#x003b1; is a direct modulator of mislocalization of the ID proteins in cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). These changes may result in a loss of the organization of IDs to a level that resembles immature ID formation during cardiac development (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perriard et al., 2003</xref>), and it could be related, at least in part, to the cardiomyocyte disarray that predominates in the MHCsTNF myocardium.</p><p>One of the major structural alterations observed at the cardiomyocytes from patients with DCM involves the architecture and composition of the IDs, suggesting that one of the hallmarks of the disease might actually relate to changes in the contact sites between cardiomyocytes (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perriard et al., 2003</xref>). Apart from desmoplakin, we examined the subcellular localization of &#x003b2;-catenin and connexin 43. &#x003b2;-Catenin shares a similar pattern to desmoplakin in the MHCsTNF myocytes because it loses its ID localization over time and is detected at the lateral side of the cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Colocalization experiments of desmoplakin and &#x003b2;-catenin revealed that the area composita of the IDs (as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franke et al., 2006</xref>) in the MHCsTNF myocardium was uniformly affected and relocalizes from the bipolar ends of the rod-shaped cardiomyocytes to the lateral sarcolemma. The observation that the absence of desmin partially delayed the removal of these proteins from IDs and that these proteins largely retained their proper positioning with caspase-resistant D263E desmin suggests that TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced desmin cleavage interferes with maintenance of the ID composition. However, the other ID proteins themselves could also be substrates for caspase cleavage or targets of other TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced modifications because multiple proteolytic events regulate the dismantling of the cell&#x02013;cell junctional complexes during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brancolini et al., 1998</xref>). These data could explain the quick disorganization of IDs in the primary culture of cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Connexin 43, the major ventricular myocyte connexin, seems to retain the mislocalization despite the preservation of the D263E desmin at IDs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 l</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sawaya et al. (2007)</xref> showed that in MHCsTNF mice, connexin 43 is dispersed away from the IDs without causing any decrease in ventricular myocyte conduction velocity or provoking ventricular arrhythmias. This is a very interesting finding considering that the IDs themselves in MHCsTNF cardiomyocytes, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, are pretty disrupted.</p><p>Beyond desmin cleavage, another effect of the overexpression of TNF-&#x003b1; is desmin modification, most likely hyperphosphorylation. We propose that such modification of desmin could be the result of the apoptotic cascade starting by the overexpression of TNF-&#x003b1;. There are some reports correlating the hyperphosphorylation of IFs, including keratins and lamin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ku et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shimizu et al., 1998</xref>), with the collapse of cytoskeletal architecture during apoptosis. This hyperphosphorylation has been characterized as an early marker of apoptosis that has also been linked to cytoplasmic aggregates. However, it does not seem to be crucial for the final disorganization of the IF network but probably acts in a parallel process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caulin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ku et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schutte et al., 2004</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, there is an increase in the number of acidic isoforms of desmin in MHCsTNF hearts that might correspond to the phosphorylated forms of desmin and might represent the nonfilamentous form of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O'Connor et al., 1979</xref>). Phosphorylation-dependent disassembly of desmin filaments may facilitate its cleavage and contribute to sarcomere disarray in cardiomyocytes. The caspase-resistant D263E desmin not only inhibited the withdrawal of desmin and other ID proteins from the IDs of the bitransgenic hearts but also inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 A</xref>). Furthermore, it prevented LV wall thinning, adverse cardiac remodeling, and the decrease in FS that occurs in MHCsTNF mice (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>), strongly suggesting that desmin and potentially many other members of the scaffold it forms are major players in TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Desmin IFs as targets of TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced aggregate formation and myocardial degeneration</title><p>Another important point of this study is the formation of desmin aggregates in MHCsTNF cardiomyocytes. Abnormal accumulation and aggregate formation of desmin within muscle cells was originally described as the morphological characteristic of DRM. Most of these disorders are caused by mutations in desmin or aberrant phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldfarb et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schroder et al., 2007</xref>), whereas another form is associated with mutations in aB-crystallin, a chaperone protein known to associate with IFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vicart et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). These mutations result in the loss of desmin function and accumulation of mutant misfolded desmin into insoluble toxic aggregates that gradually increase in the cytoplasm, attract other cytoskeletal-associated proteins, and eventually destroy the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldfarb et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schroder et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, desmin aggregates may exert toxic effects by sequestering away essential cellular proteins. Whether the accumulation of aggregates is more important to disease progression than the loss of desmin function remains to be resolved. In any case, these aggregates correlate with the IF-containing inclusion bodies of several degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alexander disease, and liver disease (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zatloukal et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Desmin aggregates in the MHCsTNF cardiomyopathy model colocalize with HSP25, which has also been reported in desminopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>). Absence of desmin in the MHCsTNF mouse hearts diminishes the intracellular aggregates of HSP25. Because the principal function of small HSP chaperones is to prevent the unfolding of cellular proteins damaged by stress, the accumulation of such chaperons in IF aggregates could be the result of an impaired chaperone unfolding activity.</p><p>There are contradictory data in the literature regarding the effect of TNF-&#x003b1; on HSP25. An in vitro study with murine L929 cells has reported that elevated levels of HSP25 can provide protection from TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mehlen et al., 1996</xref>). On the other hand, it has been shown that HSP25 phosphorylation upon TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation down-regulates its chaperone capabilities by decreasing its oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rogalla et al., 1999</xref>). Contrary to these in vitro data, in our in vivo model of TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced cardiomyopathy, HSP25 showed an increase in an acidic isoform, which is probably the result of HSP25 phosphorylation by TNF-&#x003b1; as well as an additional, more alkaline isoform. The latter isoform appears to be correlated with desmin aggregation insofar as a previous study described that there is a shift of HSP27 to alkaline pH values in primary human desminopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clemen et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Apart from the extensive desmin-positive aggregates that we found to colocalize with HSP25 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), there were also other aggregates of desmin that were more compact and tended to be restricted to a specific cell compartment that colocalized with ubiquitin in MHCsTNF mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). We demonstrate in this study that the ubiquitin-positive aggregates are primarily caused by specific caspase cleavage of desmin at the 263 amino acid in response to TNF-&#x003b1; stimulus. There are two alternative hypotheses that could explain the accumulation of ubiquitin-positive aggregates. According to the first, above a threshold concentration, misfolded proteins globally impair proteasome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bence et al., 2001</xref>). On the contrary, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al. (2005)</xref> have suggested that the impairment of the proteasomal activity occurs before coalescence of aggregated protein, which supports the hypothesis that sequestration of aggregates into inclusion bodies may be a protective rather than a pathogenic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kopito, 2000</xref>). Our data support the former hypothesis. The ultrastructural observations of this study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) demonstrate that the aggregates also contain cellular components such as vesicles, membranous whorls, and mitochondria that could represent the consequence of impaired proteosomal and/or autophagic activity. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that the aggregates may interfere with the sarcomere contraction and/or relaxation, thereby leading to impairment of cardiac function irrespective of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Indeed, this study demonstrates that myofibrillar alignment is disrupted by the presence of aggregates. Most importantly, particularly in the case of human desmin mutations, aggregate formation results in a loss of function, leading to mitochondrial problems resembling those initially observed in desmin-null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Milner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schroder et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>We have recently shown that in mice overexpressing TNF-&#x003b1; in the heart, there is a dysfunction of the UPS that is caused by decreased activity of the 26S proteasome (unpublished data). The present paper is the first study that interconnects the overexpression of TNF-&#x003b1; with ubiquitin-positive aggregates caused by accumulation of caspase-cleaved products. These aggregates may provoke a UPS dysfunction resulting in a cytoplasmic accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. Importantly, these polyubiquitinated conjugates were decreased in both the MHCsTNF des<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and D263E MHCsTNF des<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> hearts (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>). It has been shown that transgenic expression of a deletion mutant desmin that lacks seven amino acids and has been identified in human patients with DRM forms extended aggregates that do lead to impairment of UPS function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest that like other degenerative diseases, cardiomyopathy may be associated with IF aggregate formation caused not only by a mutation in the corresponding IF gene but by other diverse abnormalities related to TNF-&#x003b1; or other signaling pathways. Importantly, our previous data have shown that overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 improved cardiac function both in the desmin-null and in the TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced model of cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weisleder et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haudek et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, it is suggested that disturbance of the cytoskeleton&#x02013;mitochodrial axis might be a major mechanism of heart failure development as well as other degenerative diseases, regardless of the original cause.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Experimental animals</title><p>The Flag-tagged D263E mutant desmin construct was made as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2003</xref>).
