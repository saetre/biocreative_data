The male X chromosome is targeted by the male-specific lethal complex believed to mediate the 2-fold up-regulation of the X-linked genes, and the highly heterochromatic fourth chromosome is specifically targeted by the Painting of Fourth (POF) protein, which, together with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), modulates the expression level of genes on the fourth chromosome. Here we use chromatin immunoprecipitation and tiling microarray analysis to map POF and HP1 on the fourth chromosome in S2 cells and salivary glands at high resolution. The enrichment profiles were complemented by transcript profiles to examine the link between binding and transcripts. The results show that POF specifically binds to genes, with a strong preference for exons, and the HP1 binding profile is a mirror image of POF, although HP1 displays an additional &#x0201c;peak&#x0201d; in the promoter regions of bound genes. HP1 binding within genes is much higher than the basal HP1 enrichment on Chromosome 4. Our results suggest a balancing mechanism for the regulation of the fourth chromosome where POF and HP1 competitively bind at increasing levels with increased transcriptional activity. In addition, our results contradict transposable elements as a major nucleation site for HP1 on the fourth chromosome.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Species where males and females have a different number of sex chromosomes have to equalize the transcriptional output from the genes located on the X chromosome. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> this mechanism is achieved by a 2-fold up-regulation of the single male X chromosome. Flies also possess an additional chromosome-wide regulatory system that regulates the transcriptional output from genes on the fourth chromosome. In this case the protein Painting of Fourth (POF), together with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) bind to the fourth chromosome and fine tune gene expression. By using a high resolution map of POF and HP1 binding, we can show that they bind to the same sequences on the fourth chromosome. We also demonstrate that POF and HP1 bind to active genes with preferences for exon sequences. In gene regulatory mechanisms, including chromosome-wide gene regulation, a simple on/off switch is often not enough. Our findings support the presence of a balancing mechanism in which the dual recruitment of a repressing and a stimulating factor makes the transcription efficiency more stable and less sensitive to fluctuations.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Johansson AM, Stenberg P, Pettersson F, Larsson J (2007) POF and HP1 Bind Expressed Exons, Suggesting a Balancing Mechanism for Gene Regulation.

The binding of POF to the fourth chromosome has been conserved during evolution. In several species within the genus <italic>Drosophila</italic>, POF is specifically localized to the F-element, which corresponds to the fourth chromosome in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

Indeed, it appears likely that POF binding to the fourth chromosome derives from a dosage compensating system. In the distantly related species <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. busckii</named-content>, POF specifically decorates the male X chromosome and also colocalizes with histone 4 acetylated at lysine 16 (H4K16Ac), a histone modification associated with dosage compensation in flies.

Although binding data suggest that HP1 binds active genes, analysis of gene expression following <italic>HP1</italic> RNA-mediated interference has indicated that the genes on the fourth chromosome are generally up-regulated (on average 12&#x00025;) upon the loss of HP1, thus supporting the suggestion that it is repressive &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>High resolution binding data and complementary information on transcript levels and profiles are essential for elucidating the mechanisms that control the expression of genes on the highly heterochromatic fourth chromosome and ensure that chromosome-specific regulatory systems are correctly targeted. In the study presented here we mapped POF, HP1, and acetylated H3K9 at high resolution on the fourth chromosome in two types of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> cells: Schneider 2 cells and salivary gland cells, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and tiling arrays covering the fourth chromosome in 10-bp intervals. In addition, we analyzed the transcript profiles of the two cell types used. Our data suggest that POF and HP1 interdependently bind to genes with a strong preference for exon sequences. HP1 also exhibits a distinct binding peak in the promoter region of most bound genes. Combining the binding data with the transcript profiles of the two cell types used further demonstrates that the competitive binding of POF and HP1 correlates to levels of transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>POF Binds Exclusively to the Fourth Chromosome in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content></title><p>To determine the precise locations of POF and HP1 along the fourth chromosome in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> we designed tiling arrays (NimbleGen Systems) composed of the complete repeat-masked fourth chromosome with 50-bp oligos at 10-bp intervals (i.e., with a 40-bp overlap between consecutive oligos). Although this will provide higher resolution than generally provided by the ChIP technique because of the fragmentation of chromatin down to 500&#x02013;1,000 bp, it makes it possible to include a sliding window smoothing without affecting resolution. The high oligo density on the array also allows transcript profiling on the identical array platform. A region from Chromosome 2L (12 Mb) with 50-bp intervals and 10,000 random probes was also included on the array. ChIP was used to isolate regions exhibiting abundant POF and HP1 binding. For each experiment we made three biological replicates. The enrichment profiles of the different replicates were very consistent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030209-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), so we chose one biological replicate of each type for further studies. A typical 80-kb region from the fourth chromosome and a control region from Chromosome 2L are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The results show that POF is highly specific to the fourth chromosome and binds to certain regions. In addition, HP1 enrichment follows the enrichment profile of POF (as discussed in detail below). The HP1 binding profile presented here follows and corroborates the binding profile published using DamID on <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kc cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.

We divided all probes with enrichment levels higher than our calculated threshold value (binding probes) into sets with 100 different binding levels from 1 to 100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) and used a stepwise process, by examining the distribution of probes with increasing binding levels, thereby gradually removing enrichment caused by technical spreading as a consequence of ChIP. Any bias towards a specific category was, therefore, detected as an increase in percentage binding with increased binding classes. Comparison of the binding strength of gene regions and intergenic regions showed that POF binds preferentially within genes in both S2 cells and salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Next, comparison of exon with intron regions showed that the preference is also strongly biased towards exon sequences in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Exon densities tend to be higher at the 3&#x02032; ends of genes. To ensure that the observed exon bias is not a consequence of a general bias in POF binding to the 3&#x02032; ends of genes, we recalculated the comparison between exon and introns but removed 25&#x00025; and 50&#x00025; of the 3&#x02032; ends of the genes. If there is a 3&#x02032; bias in binding and this causes the exon preference, removal of increasing amounts of 3&#x02032; parts of the genes should proportionally remove the exon bias. It turns out that in both of these cases the exon bias is similar to when using complete genes (unpublished data). We also compared the coding sequence of each gene to the UTRs. The results suggest that there is also a preference for coding regions, but only in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). It should be noted that this bias is less pronounced and may, to some extent, reflect the fact that UTRs always border intergenic regions whereas coding sequences do not. Given the strong preference towards genes, we decided to calculate relative binding values for POF and HP1 binding for each gene in both cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030209-st001">Table S1</xref>). The relative binding values between the three different replicates for each experiment were very similar, indicating that the quality of our data allows a qualitative assessment of binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030209-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). With the cutoff used, 69&#x00025; of Chromosome 4 genes were bound by POF in S2 cells and 56&#x00025; in salivary glands, compared with 0.88&#x00025; and 0.15&#x00025;, respectively, of genes on Chromosome 2. It should be stressed that all bound genes on the second chromosome have comparable binding levels to the 10&#x00025; weakest bound genes on the fourth chromosome. To determine the distribution of binding of POF along the genes classified as bound, we scaled all genes to the same relative length after removing all introns (since there is a strong exon bias). We then calculated relative binding levels along the genes. A weak bias was seen toward the 3&#x02032; ends of the bound genes in both S2 cells and salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g002">Figure 2</xref>E).</p><fig id="pgen-0030209-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>POF Binds Preferentially within Genes with a Preference for Exons</title><p>(A) The amounts of sequences with binding divided into 100 binding classes.

We wanted to analyze if POF and HP1 colocalize at the gene level, which can be determined at the resolution provided by ChIP-chips. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, POF and HP1 exhibit very similar enrichment profiles within genes. There is, however, an exception to the almost perfect correlation between POF binding and HP1 binding, in the promoter regions. In most bound genes a clear peak in HP1 binding was seen in the promoter region, as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g003">3</xref>C. Plotting all POF binding scores (at the individual probe level) against all HP1 binding scores reveals that, in general, there is a linear correlation between POF binding and HP1 binding. By marking probes within the promoter region of each POF-bound Chromosome 4 gene it was clear that the exceptions to the linear correlation are mainly due to the HP1 peak in the promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g003">Figure 3</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g003">3</xref>E). Using conventional motif-finding algorithms, we were unable to correlate the HP1 promoter peak to a specific motif. The HP1 enrichment is higher in salivary glands than in S2 cells. It should also be stressed that, in salivary glands, HP1 shows a higher basal level of enrichment on Chromosome 4 in intergenic regions than POF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). We conclude that POF and HP1 colocalize within the transcribed region of individual genes with a preference for binding exons, but HP1 also exhibits a peak in the promoter region of most bound genes and a higher basal enrichment on the fourth chromosome.</p><fig id="pgen-0030209-g003" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>POF and HP1 Colocalize within Genes while HP1 Binding Shows an Additional &#x0201c;Promoter Peak&#x0201d;</title><p>(A) POF and HP1 enrichment profiles at the <italic>Thd1 Pur-alpha</italic> gene pair locus.

To examine the relationship between the binding of POF and HP1 to gene expression in more detail, we probed identical arrays using cDNA from the cell types under consideration. We prepared mRNA from two biological replicates of both S2 cells and salivary glands, reverse transcribed it to cDNA, labelled probes, and hybridised them to our designed arrays. In this manner we were able to obtain high quality expression data for each gene as well as a detailed map of the exons that are used and their usage ratios. Since the double-stranded cDNA was generated prior to labelling we were unable to determine which strand a given transcript originated from. The transcript profile data can be used to detect exon usage and, since H3K9ac is usually enriched at the 5&#x02032; region of transcribed genes, the combination of transcript profiling with the H3K9ac binding profile generates predictions of novel genes (exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). From the transcript profile data we calculated a relative transcription value for each gene in each cell type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030209-st001">Table S1</xref>). The calculated transcription values were consistent in the two replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030209-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). The binding of both POF and HP1 correlates highly with transcription. In salivary gland cells the transcription values are typically more variable, while in S2 cells the genes tend to be expressed at either a high or low level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g004">Figure 4</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g004">4</xref>E). Furthermore, the HP1 binding values for each gene correlate well with the relative binding values of POF, further supporting the suggestion that the binding levels of HP1 and POF are interdependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g004">Figure 4</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g004">4</xref>G).

Nevertheless, our data indicate that on the fourth chromosome HP1 is positively correlated with transcription. A large number of transgene insertions on the fourth chromosome have been extensively studied and a large proportion of those have been shown to be partially silenced, as demonstrated by position-effect variegation (PEV). We decided to determine whether the transgenic insertions that display PEV silencing are located in regions with high levels of HP1 and therefore in regions that are transcribed, or whether they are also inserted in genes that are expressed at low levels on Chromosome 4. It should be stressed that we only measured HP1 binding and transcription in salivary glands and S2 cells, and there might be differences in binding and transcription levels of genes between these tissues and the eye discs. Even so, the results strongly suggest that high levels of HP1 can induce silencing of reporter genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g006">Figure 6</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g006">6</xref>D).

Since repetitive elements are masked by the design of our arrays, we were unable to directly score HP1 and POF enrichment within those sequences. However, since the chromatin fragments used in the ChIP experiments are generally 500&#x02013;1,000 bp long, we do expect technical spreading of enrichment to occur. Consequently, if repetitive elements were targets for HP1, we would expect the nearby regions that are not masked on our arrays to also show increased enrichment of HP1. However, in the two cell types analyzed we found no evidence that repetitive elements were enriched more strongly than the basal HP1 binding of the fourth chromosome. Indeed, the enrichment levels close to these masked regions were much lower than the enrichment levels seen in bound genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g007">Figure 7</xref> and unpublished data). We conclude that the high enrichment of HP1 within genes, and probably within inserted transgenes, is not caused by a spread of HP1 from transposable elements such as <italic>1360</italic>. We next calculated whether the distribution of <italic>1360</italic> is random or biased towards bound genes. If the positions of <italic>1360</italic> elements on the fourth chromosome are randomized, the numbers close to or within bound genes is similar to the actual values (unpublished data).

In summary, our tiling data for POF and HP1 show that both these proteins bind within genes, with a strong preference for binding exons. In addition to binding within the transcribed region of the genes, HP1 (but not POF) also exhibits a higher basal level of binding to the fourth chromosome and displays a promoter-specific peak in most bound genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030209-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

We have previously shown that POF stimulates gene expression specifically on the fourth chromosome, while the interdependently bound HP1 represses.

POF targeting depends on Chromosome 4 specific factors and the amount of heterochromatin.

Here, we mapped POF binding to the entire sequenced part of the fourth chromosome using high resolution ChIP-chip. The results show that POF binds within genes. Although some regions lack POF this is associated with a lack of transcription, indicating that we must consider POF binding to be gene specific. We found that POF binding is highly correlated with both expression state and levels of expression in salivary gland and S2 cells. Furthermore, differences in expression levels between the two cell types reflect comparable differences in POF and HP1 binding. We conclude that the binding is connected to both transcription and also levels of the resulting transcripts. Transcription activity precedes POF binding since the loss of <italic>Pof</italic> results only in a slight reduction of transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. POF binds preferentially to genes rather than intergenic regions. In fact, we did not detect convincing POF binding in any region outside a transcribed region. Furthermore, POF binds preferentially to exons rather than introns. We note a slight 3&#x02032; bias in POF binding, however, we cannot dismiss the possibility that this observed 3&#x02032; bias may be due to longer exons tending to be located at the 3&#x02032; end of genes. Notably, the gene binding profile reflects the transcript profile, which also shows a 3&#x02032; bias (unpublished data). Interesting questions are raised by these findings about the nature of the mechanisms responsible for the strong bias towards exons. We propose two possible scenarios. First, spliced RNAs may be used in the targeting mechanism for gene-targeting proteins such as POF. Second, and more likely, there may be crosstalk between POF and the splicing machinery. It has been shown recently that the human SWI/SNF subunit Brm, involved in chromatin remodelling, favours the inclusion of variant exons in the mRNA of several genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. The cited authors suggest that Brm decreases the RNAPII elongation rate and facilitates recruitment of splicing machinery to suboptimal splice sites. POF also binds intronless genes, so splicing per se does not explain the binding. However, some shared mechanistic step may explain the binding profile and provide a link to the POF-mediated facilitation of transcription.</p><p>It is intuitively difficult to envision how sequence determinants for targeting can be present in exons. In this context it should be stressed that we have previously shown that exons on the fourth chromosome as well as exons on the X chromosome differ in sequence composition compared to exons of the other chromosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, sequence based determinants within exons responsible for protein targeting should not be ruled out.</p><p>We believe that transcript profiling is a robust method for determing relative transcript levels of genes since all genes are measured with a large number of oligos and differences in the expression of individual exons is also easily detected. Our transcript profiling provides a tool for refined annotation of the fourth chromosome and prediction of novel exons and genes. H3K9 acetylation is highly enriched in the 5&#x02032; region of most active genes. This means that combining the H3K9ac profile with the transcript profile increases the precision in discriminating between novel genes and additional exons. A similar profile for H3K9 acetylation in yeast has been previously described by Pokholok et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. However, they found that H3K9 acetylation peaks at the transcription start point rather than within the transcribed region of genes. The difference in our results and theirs is probably due to the fact that we measured the amount of H3K9ac per se, while Pokholok et al. measured it relative to the levels of core histone H3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. The lower nucleosome density within the promoter region is probably responsible for this difference in the location of the peak.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>HP1 Targets Genes and also Their Promoters</title><p>We have previously shown that POF and HP1 colocalize at the resolution given by polytene chromosome and that the same set of genes is regulated by these two proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. We show here that POF and HP1 binding colocalize at the gene level, which also provides insights into the modes of action for this regulatory system. The bias in within-gene binding towards exons shown by POF was also observed for HP1. HP1, like POF, preferentially binds exons but, in contrast to POF, HP1 shows a high basal binding to the fourth chromosome and a peak in binding associated with promoters for most targeted genes. The specificity of HP1 to certain promoters at the individual target gene level has previously been reported in mammals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b038">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. According to our data the promoter peak of HP1 is a more general characteristic of HP1-bound genes on the fourth chromosome and is related to transcription. It has been proposed that the presence of H3K9me at promoters is connected to gene repression, but that H3K9me within the genes is associated with gene activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. If our HP1 profile is assumed to be linked to the presence of H3K9me this implies that a combination of these two binding profiles is linked to the transcription of genes on the fourth chromosome.</p><p>The classical view is that HP1 is associated with gene repression. However, a number of recent reports have linked HP1 to gene activation, based on the enrichment of H3K9me and HP1 on active genes. It is well known that HP1 is enriched in pericentric regions and that genes in those regions are, therefore, connected to high HP1 levels. It has been shown that mutation in <italic>HP1</italic> causes a reduction in the expression of a number of heterochromatin-located genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> e.g., <italic>light</italic> and <italic>rolled</italic>, supporting the idea that some genes depend on their heterochromatic surroundings for correct expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b043">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;.

In addition, HP1 has been shown to associate with developmental and heatshock-induced puffs of the polytene chromosome, which is indicative of intense gene activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. It has been shown that H3K9 methylation occurs in the transcribed region of active genes in mammalian chromatin and, in fact, increases during activation of transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. In the cited study case HP1 was found to be associated with the transcribed genes of several mammalian cell lines and also in primary cells. However, it is important to note that, except for the heterochromatin genes <italic>light</italic> and <italic>rolled</italic>, it is not clear whether the binding of HP1 is associated with facilitated transcription. Our results indicate not only that HP1 binds to active genes on the fourth chromosome, but also that the genes on the fourth chromosome are up-regulated upon loss of HP1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, although the genes on the fourth chromosome are bound in response to gene activity, HP1 still causes repression. It may be that, for example, heat-shock induced genes attract HP1 as a modulator that represses uncontrolled gene expression. In contrast to HP1, the loss of POF leads to a general decrease in gene expression from the fourth chromosome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

It should be noted that the correlation between HP1 and POF seems to be linear, suggesting that highly expressed genes have the same POF/HP1 ratio as genes with weak expression, although they bind higher amounts of both proteins. A balancing mechanism may act as a buffering system in which the dual recruitment of a repressing and a stimulating factor makes the transcription efficiency more stable and less sensitive to fluctuations. Balancing mechanisms may be more general. For example, this may explain the proposed binding of HP1 to the male X chromosome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. The facilitated transcription of X chromosomal genes by acetylation of H4K16 may need to be tempered by a repressing factor to reach the expected 2-fold increase. This repressing function might be supported by HP1, Su(var)3&#x02013;7, or other unknown factors not yet linked to dosage compensation.</p><p>The targeting of POF to the fourth chromosome shows similarities to the targeting of the MSL complex to the male X chromosome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b048">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;.

The glands were then washed once in PBS, 1 mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) followed by two washes in TBS, 1 mM PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail. The samples were homogenized in 500 &#x003bc;l lysis buffer (1&#x00025; SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl &#x0005b;pH 8.1&#x0005d;). Approximately 120 &#x003bc;l glass beads were added prior to sonication for 2 &#x000d7; 10 sec at output level 1, 2 &#x000d7; 10 sec at output level 2, 2 &#x000d7; 10 sec at output level 3 and finally 2 &#x000d7; 10 s at output level 4 (Misonix XL2020, microtip). The samples were cleared by centrifuging for 10 min at 16,000 g. For ChIP, 150 &#x003bc;l of cell lysate was diluted by a factor of ten in ChIP Dilution buffer (0.01&#x00025; SDS, 1.1&#x00025; Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl &#x0005b;pH 8.0&#x0005d;, 167 mM NaCl), and protein inhibitors were added. The diluted lysate was precleared by incubation with 30 &#x003bc;l (60 &#x003bc;l for salivary glands) of Dynabeads conjugated to Protein A (Dynal) and preblocked by equilibration in 150 &#x003bc;l ChIP buffer containing 12 &#x003bc;g (24 &#x003bc;g for salivary glands) sonicated herring sperm DNA. The cleared lysates were then incubated with 3 &#x003bc;l anti-POF (rabbit, 4 &#x003bc;l for salivary glands), 3 &#x003bc;l anti-HP1 (291C, Covance, 4 &#x003bc;l for salivary glands), or 4 &#x003bc;l H3K9ac (07&#x02013;352, Upstate) antibodies overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C. The antibody complexes were precipitated by incubation with DNA-blocked Protein A Dynabeads for 1 h at 4 &#x000b0;C. The beads were washed once with low salt buffer (0.1&#x00025; SDS, 1&#x00025; Triton X-100, 2 mM Tris-HCl &#x0005b;pH 8.0&#x0005d;, 150 mM NaCl), once with high salt buffer (0.1&#x00025; SDS, 1&#x00025; Triton X-100, 2 mM Tris-HCl &#x0005b;pH 8.0&#x0005d;, 500 mM NaCl), once with LiCl-containing buffer (250 mM LiCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl &#x0005b;pH 8.0&#x0005d;, 1 mM EDTA, 1&#x00025; NP-40, 1&#x00025; sodium deoxycholate), and twice with TE Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl &#x0005b;pH 8.0&#x0005d;, 1 mM EDTA). The protein/DNA complexes were eluted from the antibodies by incubating them for 2 &#x000d7; 15 min at room temperature in 250 &#x003bc;l Elution buffer (1&#x00025; SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) with rotation. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 200 mM, and protein/DNA crosslinks were reversed by heating at 65 &#x000b0;C for 4 h. A total of 10 &#x003bc;l of 0.5 M EDTA, 20 &#x003bc;l of 1M Tris-HCl &#x0005b;pH 6.5&#x0005d;, and 1 &#x003bc;l of 20 mg/ml proteinase K were added before an additional incubation at 45 &#x000b0;C for 1 h. The DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The immunoprecipitated DNA was then dissolved in 20 &#x003bc;l water.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Ligation-mediated PCR.</title><p>The immunoprecipitated DNA and corresponding amounts of input DNA were amplified using ligation-mediated PCR. The linkers used and the ligation procedure were as described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. The amplification mainly followed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;, except that we ligated and amplified all immunoprecipitated DNA (to retain as much sample complexity as possible) from each sample. We used an Advantage cDNA PCR kit (BD Biosciences) for a 26-cycle PCR amplification. The DNA was purified using illustra DNA and a Gel band purification kit (GE Healthcare) prior to labeling. To verify that no amplification bias affected the enrichment profiles, we analyzed the ChIP DNA/input DNA ratio before and after the ligation-mediated PCR, using real-time PCR as described previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Tiling array analysis.</title><p>Tiling arrays containing the complete sequenced part of the fourth chromosome at a resolution of 10 bp and of region 1&#x02013;12,000 kb from Chromosome 2L at a resolution of 50 bp were designed on the basis of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> genomic release 4. Repeated regions were removed from the design using a repeat masker. Three pseudogenes (<italic>CR32011</italic>, <italic>CR32010</italic>, and <italic>CR32009</italic>) are present on the fourth chromosome. Because of high sequence identity between these three genes they were not included in further analysis. Thus, 89 genes on the fourth chromosome were included in the analysis. The array production, probe labeling, and hybridization were conducted by Nimblegen Systems Inc. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nimblegen.com">http://www.nimblegen.com</ext-link>). In total, 15 ChIP experiments and four cDNA samples for transcript profiling were hybridized. The complete dataset is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>. The raw enrichment data (ChIP/input) were very consistent between the three ChIP replicates and between consecutive probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030209-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). We therefore applied a mild smoothing algorithm to process the ChIP-chip data and remove noise but retain as much information as possible. The smoothing was conducted using a seven-probe sliding window approach, in which the median score of the seven probes was assigned to the middle position. The smoothing was undertaken to keep the borders between masked and unmasked regions intact. A five-probe sliding window was used for Chromosome 2L. For HP1 and POF enrichments, cutoff values for binding were calculated as follows. Region 10,600 kb&#x02013;11,600 kb from 2L was used as a control region to calculate the mean enrichment and standard deviation for each experiment. This region was chosen since it reflects only the background enrichments of POF and HP1. This was also verified for HP1 by the data presented in Greil et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. All probes (after smoothing) below the mean enrichment &#x0002b; 2 standard deviations level were set to zero. Within each experiment the replicate with the lowest standard deviation (in the control region) was selected for further analysis. All subsequent calculations and evaluations were based on these datasets. Relative binding levels of POF and HP1 for each gene in S2 cells and salivary glands were calculated as the mean enrichment of the half of the probes that were most strongly bound within annotated exons (release 4.3). Genes for which more than half of the respective probes were unbound (as defined above) within exons were deemed to be unbound and their binding levels were set to zero. To verify that our conclusions would not change as a result of the replicate used, we calculated relative gene binding levels for all replicates; pairs of replicates were then compared (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030209-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>For transcript profile analysis, raw data for each probe were returned from Nimblegen. To remove the background signal a cutoff was calculated as the mean &#x0002b; one standard deviation hybridization signal from the 10,000 random probes present on the arrays (GC content 50&#x00025;). All values below these cutoffs were set to zero. A relative gene transcription level was set as the mean enrichment of the 50&#x00025; highest probes within exons of each gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030209-st001">Table S1</xref>). To calculate binding and transcription differences between S2 cells and salivary glands the transcription and binding levels were adjusted so that the total binding and transcription, respectively, were equal in the S2 cells and salivary gland preparations. Details of all algorithms and software used are available upon request.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Transcript profiling.</title><p>For transcript profiling experiments, poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>RNA was isolated using DynabeadsOligo (dT)<sub>25</sub> (Dynal). Two biological replicates were used of both salivary glands (300 pairs per replicate) and S2 cells. The cells or tissue were frozen at &#x02212;70 &#x000b0;C and homogenized in 0.1 M TRIS-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 M LiCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1&#x00025; SDS, and 5 mM DTT. Dynal's recommendations were then followed. The poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>RNA was converted to cDNA using an ImPromII first strand synthesis kit (Promega) according to the supplier's recommendations. The cDNA was then used as a template for forming double-stranded cDNA using a Superscript double stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The double-stranded cDNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by passage through S200HR columns (GE Healthcare), and 4 &#x003bc;g of the double-stranded cDNA from each sample was sent to Nimblegen for labeling and hybridization using the same array design as for the ChIP-chip.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Expression and HP1 binding surrounding transgene insertions.</title><p>To determine expression (transcript levels) and HP1 enrichment close to <italic>P</italic> element insertions on the fourth chromosome, we used the data from Sun et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030209-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d; and their classification as variegated (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 17) or nonvariegated (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 6).
