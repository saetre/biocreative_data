This high-level proliferative ability is attributed to an unusual type of cell cycle. The Signaling pathways that regulate the proliferation of ES cells are of great interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In this study, we show that murine ES cells specifically express brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and its signaling is essential for ES cell proliferation. We found that BNP and its receptor (NPR-A, natriuretic peptide receptor-A) were highly expressed in self-renewing murine ES cells, whereas the levels were markedly reduced after ES cell differentiation by the withdrawal of LIF. Targeting of BNP with short interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in the inhibition of ES cell proliferation, as indicated by a marked reduction in the cell number and colony size, a significant reduction in DNA synthesis, and decreased numbers of cells in S phase. BNP knockdown in ES cells led to the up-regulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor A (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) genes, and activation of phosphorylated histone (&#x003b3;-H2AX), which negatively affects ES cell proliferation. In addition, knockdown of BNP increased the rate of apoptosis and reduced the expression of the transcription factor Ets-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Appropriate BNP expression is essential for the maintenance of ES cell propagation.

These results establish definitively that BNP and NPR-A are specifically expressed in self-renewing ES cells. During development, Oct-4 expression is required to maintain the pluripotent cell population of the inner cell mass (ICM) and epiblast. In addition, Oct-4 is highly expressed in ES cells, and without this factor, these cells differentiate along the trophoblast lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005341-Nichols1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.These findings suggest that BNP may exert regulatory functions prior to embryo implantation and in undifferentiated ES cells. Therefore, we investigated this possibility by examining the effect of BNP knockdown in ES cells, which significantly suppressed ES cell proliferation by decreasing the percentage of cells in S phase (DNA synthesis phase) and accumulation of cells in G1 and G2/M phases. The mechanism underlying the accumulation of cells in G2/M cell cycle phases is unknown, which suggest that BNP may has a role in regulating G2/M cell cycle transition, as well as G1/S in ES cells.

These findings agree with our results, which showed that BNP knockdown in ES cells led to a marked decrease in intracellular cGMP level and a significant reduction in mRNA level of NPR-B. It is possible that the reduced cGMP level in ES cells is a reflection of the reduced NPR-B mRNA level. This hypothesis represents the signaling pathway through NPR-B as a possible regulator for ES cell proliferation. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the role of NPR-B in ES cell proliferation.

Furthermore, in the current study NPR-B expression was detected in Oct-4-positive cells of the pre-implantation embryos, suggesting a role of NPR-B in early stages of development.
