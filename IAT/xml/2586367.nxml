Although little is known about lipid droplet formation and regulation, it is clear that members of the PAT (perilipin, adipocyte differentiation related protein, tail interacting protein of 47 kDa) protein family coat the droplet surface and mediate interactions with lipases that remobilize the stored lipids. We identified key <italic>Drosophila</italic> candidate genes for lipid droplet regulation by RNA interference (RNAi) screening with an image segmentation-based optical read-out system, and show that these regulatory functions are conserved in the mouse. Those include the vesicle-mediated Coat Protein Complex I (COPI) transport complex, which is required for limiting lipid storage. We found that COPI components regulate the PAT protein composition at the lipid droplet surface, and promote the association of adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL) with the lipid droplet surface to mediate lipolysis. Two compounds known to inhibit COPI function, Exo1 and Brefeldin A, phenocopy COPI knockdowns. Furthermore, RNAi inhibition of ATGL and simultaneous drug treatment indicate that COPI and ATGL function in the same pathway. These data indicate that the COPI complex is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of lipid homeostasis, and highlight an interaction between vesicle transport systems and lipid droplets.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Fat cells, and cells in general, convert fatty acids into triglycerides that are stored in droplets for future use.

Non-esterified free fatty acid (NEFA) is used for energy generation in beta-oxidation, membrane phospholipid synthesis, signaling, and in regulation of transcription factors such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Essentially all cells take up excess NEFA and convert it to energy-rich neutral lipids in the form of triglycerides (TG). TG is packaged into specialized organelles called lipid droplets. NEFA is regenerated from lipid droplet stores to meet metabolic and energy needs, and lipid droplets protect cells against lipotoxicity by sequestering excess NEFA. Lipid droplets are the main energy storage organelles and are thus central to our understanding of energy homeostasis. Despite their importance, we know very little about the ontogeny and regulation of these organelles.</p><p>Lipid droplets are believed to form in the ER membrane by incorporating a growing TG core between the leaflets of the bilayer, and ultimately are released surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer. Cytosolic lipid droplets possess a protein coat and grow by synthesis of TG at the lipid droplet surface &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d; and by fusion with other lipid droplets &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Formation of nascent droplets and aggregation of existing droplets is likely to require a dynamic exchange of lipids and proteins from and to the droplet. Indeed, the range of proteins identified in lipid droplet proteomic studies suggests extensive trafficking between lipid droplets and other cellular compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, lipid droplet-associated proteins translocate between the cytosol and lipid droplets &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. For example, tail interacting protein of 47 kDa (TIP47) associates with small, putative nascent, lipid droplets &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, but is not found on larger droplets, which are coated by other members of the perilipin, adipocyte differentiation related protein (ADRP), TIP47 (PAT) protein family. Intriguingly, TIP47 mediates mannose 6-phosphate receptor trafficking between the lysosome and Golgi &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, raising the possibility that trafficking is involved in lipid droplet ontogeny or fate. However, unlike the well-studied Golgi trafficking system, the routes to and from the lipid droplet are unknown.</p><p>Once lipid droplets are formed, stored TG is mobilized in a regulated manner. Triglyceride, diglyceride (DG), and monoglyceride lipases convert TG back into NEFA. Most of our knowledge concerning lipolysis is based on extensively studied adipocytes in which at least two lipolytic enzymes have been identified: adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d; and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Due to the hydrophobic properties of the lipid droplet TG core, lipases are likely to act at the surface of lipid droplets &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, where members of the PAT protein family regulate lipase access to the TG core. Mammalian genomes encode at least five PAT-proteins. Whereas perilipin is the dominant PAT protein in adipocytes, ADRP is the dominant PAT protein in nonadipose tissues in which it is tightly associated with the lipid droplet surface &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. PAT members appear to have a hierarchical affinity for the lipid droplet surface. In nonmammalian genomes, there are fewer PAT proteins. For example, two PAT proteins termed lipid storage droplet 1 and 2 (LSD-1 and LSD-2) are found in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The crucial role of PAT proteins is evolutionary conserved as the absence of perilipin in mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, or LSD-2 in flies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; results in lean animals. Overexpression of LSD-2 results in obese flies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. These data indicate the conserved PAT proteins at the lipid droplet surface are important regulators of energy storage.</p><p>It seems likely that PAT proteins protect lipid from lipolysis, but the role of PAT proteins may not be limited to passive steric hindrance of lipase access to the TG core, as illustrated by perilipin. Unphosphorylated perilipin protects the lipid droplet from lipase activity. Following stimulation by protein kinase A (PKA), however, phospho-perilipin acts as a docking site for HSL &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, which translocates from the cytosol to the droplet surface &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Whereas phospho-perilipin promotes massive NEFA release from the droplet, this is not mediated exclusively by HSL, as mice lacking HSL function show a relatively mild phenotype marked by the accumulation of DG, thus demonstrating that HSL acts as a DG lipase in vivo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. The TG lipase functioning in HSL null mice is ATGL. In the current view of adipocyte lipolysis, ATGL is responsible for the first step in TG hydrolysis, liberating DG and NEFA, whereas HSL acts as a DG lipase. We know very little about how ATGL is targeted to the lipid droplet.</p><p>In contrast to the lean phenotype in animals lacking perilipin (mouse) or LSD-2 (fly), both mice and flies lacking ATGL are obese. In mice, the absence of ATGL results in excessive TG accumulation in liver and muscle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, human patients suffering from neutral lipid storage disease carry mutations resulting in truncated ATGL isoforms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. ATGL function is evolutionary conserved, as flies lacking the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ATGL ortholog, Brummer, accumulate copious amounts of body fat &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. The lipid droplet-associated protein Comparative Gene Identification-58 (CGI-58) acts as an ATGL colipase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Mutations in the <italic>CGI-58</italic> gene result in ectopic fat accumulation in patients suffering from Chanarin Dorfman Syndrome (CDS, &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;), supporting the idea that both ATGL and CGI-58 are required for mobilizing lipid stores in nonadipose tissue. Interestingly, CGI-58 physically interacts with perilipin as demonstrated by both coimmunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, there are other lipases and probably many more cofactors encoded in the genome. Understanding which ones act at the lipid droplet surface and how their localization is regulated will be important.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> is a powerful model for pathway discovery due to well-developed genetics. Additionally, greater than 60&#x00025; of the genes associated with human disease have clear orthologs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Drosophila</italic> is highly relevant to lipid droplet study, as lipid droplets in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals are associated with many of the same proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b032">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally, the emerging model of lipid storage and endocrine regulation are similar in humans and <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that <italic>Drosophila</italic> will be a good genetic model for lipid storage and lipid storage diseases in humans. We therefore utilized genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screening in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue culture cells to identify and characterize novel regulators of lipid storage. We then tested for the function of these regulators in mouse lipid droplet regulation by directed RNAi studies. We identified 318 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes required to limit lipid storage and 208 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes required to promote lipid storage. These genes encode known regulators of lipid storage as well as genes not previously associated with lipid storage regulation.</p><p>Because the protein composition of the lipid droplet surface is so critical for lipid droplet function, and because very little is known about how lipid droplet decoration is regulated, we focused on the exciting finding that the retrograde vesicle-trafficking machinery, utilizing the Coat Protein Complex I (COPI) and COPI regulators, was required to utilize lipid stores. COPI subunit knockdown by RNAi, as well as COPI inhibition with compounds, resulted in increased lipid storage both in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse tissue culture cells, demonstrating evolutionary conservation of our findings.</p><p>COPI and COPII vesicles are essential components of the trafficking machinery cycling between the ER and Golgi (reviewed in, e.g., &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;). COPI vesicles mediate cargo transport from the Golgi back to the ER, including escaped ER-resident proteins. The anterograde counterpart, COPII, mediates transport of proteins and lipids from the ER to the Golgi. Whereas interference with either COPI or COPII complexes disrupts Golgi function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, only COPI was required for lipid droplet utilization, clearly demonstrating that COPI and not general Golgi function is required for TG utilization. Although we certainly do not rule out communication between the Golgi and lipid droplet, we suggest that there is a novel ER/lipid droplet trafficking system using a subset of the ER/Golgi transport machinery.</p><p>We found that the basis for lipid overstorage following COPI knockdown was a decreased lipolytic rate. Using our existing knowledge of the PAT family members and lipases in the regulation of lipolysis, we examined changes in protein composition at the lipid droplet surface. Interestingly, we found that interfering with the COPI pathway results in ectopic accumulation of TIP47 at the lipid droplet surface. Furthermore, ATGL at the lipid droplet surface was greatly reduced. Combining the effects of ATGL knockdown and compounds affecting COPI function did not elicit a stronger decrease in lipolysis, indicating that ATGL and COPI are both part of the same lipolytic pathway. Thus, our studies provide a functional link between COPI retrograde trafficking and the proteins at the lipid droplet surface. More generally, these results indicate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi screening is suited to detect uncharted pathways affecting NEFA regulation and to achieve a deeper understanding of cellular lipid droplet regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Genome-Wide RNAi to Identify Regulators of Lipid Storage in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>Lipid droplets are well studied in mammalian cells, but <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells have not been extensively used in lipid droplet studies.

More importantly, the GO term networks were quite similar and suggest that key pathways have been identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060292-g003">Figure 3</xref>). For example, both screens show that interfering with translation factors and ribosomes result in lipid storage defects (GO:0022613, GO:0006412). Additionally, genes resulting in lipid storage defects are enriched for transcriptional regulators in both screens (GO:0010467) and trafficking (GO:0006911, GO:0006890). The only major differences between the screens were that genes involved in pre-mRNA processing were enriched in our Kc<sub>167</sub> cell screen and genes involved in proteasome function were enriched in the S2 cell screen. However, five genes required for lipid storage in our study (<italic>suppressor of deltex</italic>, <italic>ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 2</italic>, <italic>ubiquitin activating enzyme 1</italic>, <italic>Roc1a</italic>, and <italic>Roc1b</italic>) are involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis at the proteasome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;.

We found that lipid storage increased after treatment with dsRNAs targeting genes encoding lipid droplet-associated proteins (GO:0005811).

This suggests that many of the genes revealed by our RNAi experiments encode direct regulators of lipid storage. Gene functions involved in mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, which utilize NEFA as a substrate, as well as genes involved in protein synthesis, were also enriched. Indeed, knockdown of 12&#x00025; of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes encoding translation-related functions (GO:0006412), including 32&#x00025; of the genes encoding ribosomal subunits (GO:0033279), resulted in lipid overstorage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060292-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060292-st005">Table S5</xref>).

To dissect the role of COPI in lipolysis, we used a combination of siRNAs targeting different genes in the lipolytic pathway, and Exo1 or BFA treatment, to mimic genetic epistasis experiments (a proven tool for dissecting functional relationships between members of the same or different pathways &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b071">71</xref>&#x0005d;). Combining siRNA-mediated knockdown of COPI members and BFA or Exo1 treatment did not enhance the decreased lipolysis phenotype (Figure10B), indicating that the observed effects following drug treatment are only COPI mediated. Additionally, these data suggest that there are no serious compound-based side effects vis-a-vis lipid droplets, even for the broad-spectrum inhibitor BFA (also note that other BFA-sensitive GEFs, Big1 and Big2, did not result in a lipid storage phenotype on knockdown). Decreased lipolysis could be due to decreased lipase activity at the lipid droplet. To determine whether that lipase was ATGL, we combined siRNAs targeting ATGL transcripts and BFA or Exo1 drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060292-g010">Figure 10</xref>B). If ATGL were responsible, then ATGL knockdown would have no effect on BFA- or Exo1-treated cells. Indeed, the lipolysis rate was not further decreased, suggesting that COPI-mediated lipolysis effects are mediated by ATGL. This conclusion is further supported by experiments in which we treated cells with siRNAs targeting ADRP and TIP47 transcripts in combination with either BFA or Exo1.

In order to distinguish localization to the region of the lipid droplet from true localization to the lipid droplet surface, we treated cells with BFA after oleic acid feeding, and isolated lipid droplets by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. This treatment separates the lipid droplets from cytosol and other membrane fractions. To determine what proteins were on the lipid droplets, western blots were probed with antibodies detecting ADRP, TIP47, and ATGL, as well as the ATGL cofactor CGI-58. Whereas ADRP and CGI-58 remained quantitatively unchanged after BFA treatment, TIP47 protein levels in the lipid droplet fraction increased nearly 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060292-g012">Figure 12</xref>C). There was no change in TIP47 in the cytosolic fraction (unpublished). The cell-staining experiments showed a more dramatic increase in TIP47 at the ADRP-positive lipid droplets than we observed in the western blots, but importantly, both cell staining and western blotting show increased TIP47 on COPI inhibition. Strikingly, ATGL levels decreased to near or below the detection limit, suggesting that BFA treatment drives ATGL off the lipid droplet surface, or prevents ATGL association with the lipid droplet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060292-g012">Figure 12</xref>C). Thus, both cell staining and analysis of isolated droplets indicate that wild-type COPI limits abundance of TIP47 at the lipid droplet surface and is required for ATGL localization to the droplet surface. Taken together with the epistasis results demonstrating that COPI and ATGL function in the same pathway, these results indicate that COPI-mediated targeting of ATGL to the lipid droplet is required for lipolysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Positive regulation of lipolysis by the COPI retrograde-vesicle trafficking pathway was the most striking and unexpected result of our screen.

Taken together, these results indicate that six out of the seven wild-type COPI subunits mediate lipid storage by positively regulating lipolysis.</p><p>COPI could have a direct or indirect effect on lipid storage. The indirect mechanism is poorly defined, but if the Golgi is a &#x0201c;sink&#x0201d; for phospholipids derived from TG stores, then decreased Golgi function could simply decrease demand for TG substrate. If NEFA (from the media in fed cells, and from biosynthesis in unfed cells) conversion to TG continues, then increased lipid droplet volume would occur. It is also possible that canonical COPI function transporting lipids and proteins from the Golgi to the ER is ultimately responsible for lipid droplet utilization and protein composition at the lipid droplet surface. For example, COPI might be required for the particular phospholipid composition in hemimembranes formed on nascent droplets, which secondarily alter TIP47 and ATGL localization in mature lipid droplets.</p><p>However, evidence that Golgi function per se is not linked to lipid storage phenotypes, as well as direct association of COPI members and regulators with the lipid droplet or PAT proteins supports a more direct model. The COPI and COPII pathways have established roles as constitutive vesicle transport systems that cycle proteins as well as lipid from the Golgi to the ER (COPI), or vice versa (COPII) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

The lipid overstorage phenotype was only seen in the case of interference with COPI trafficking. This indicates that the lipid overstorage phenotype is not a simple consequence of ER and Golgi function. Finally, in an indirect model in which COPI shuttles only between the Golgi and the ER, COPI should not be lipid droplet associated. However, COPI subunits are directly associated with the lipid droplet surface as shown by proteomics &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

Perhaps COPI is a destination-specific transporter returning lipid droplet surface hemimembrane and Golgi membrane to the ER. The transport system that brings nascent lipid droplets from the ER to the lipid droplet has not been elucidated, but it is intriguing that the transport/PAT protein TIP47 is found preferentially on small lipid droplets. Small lipid droplets derived from the ER are thought to help build larger droplets by fusion. TIP47-coated droplets might form in the ER, and then COPI could return TIP47 to the ER after the lipid cargo is deposited. In this model, TIP47 becomes trapped at the lipid droplet surface in the absence of COPI.</p><fig id="pbio-0060292-g013" position="float"><label>Figure 13</label><caption><title>COPI Trafficking and Lipid Droplet Model</title><p>COPI and COPII trafficking systems shuttle proteins and lipids between ER and Golgi. Small TIP47-coated lipid droplets are born at the ER and reside in the cytosol. The bigger lipid droplets are coated by ADRP, and TIP47 is returned to the ER. ATGL can translocate between the cytosol and the lipid droplet surface, where it begins the conversion of TG to DG and eventually NEFA. Other TG lipases may also be present (indicated by the second arrow liberating TG from the hydrophobic lipid droplet core). Wild-type Golgi&#x02013;ER transport function of COPI might be necessary for proper lipid droplet biogenesis at the ER. COPI could directly function at the lipid droplet surface, mediating a similar ER-targeted transport function as reported for the Golgi&#x02013;ER COPI transport. COPI is a positive regulator of ATGL with a unresolved mechanism (indicated by the question mark) and a negative regulator of TIP47 lipid droplet localization.

We have shown that COPI directly or indirectly removes TIP47 from the lipid droplet surface and promotes ATGL localization to the droplet surface, where lipolysis occurs. ATGL has a key role in lipid droplet utilization, and ATGL association with the droplet is reduced by ADRP and Tip47 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060292-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;. Our epistasis experiments combining siRNA-mediated ATGL knockdown and BFA or Exo1 compound treatment demonstrated that the decrease in lipolysis rate is due to loss of ATGL activity. COPI activity specifically alters lipid droplet surface composition by increasing the amount of TIP47 and reducing the amount of ATGL at ADRP-coated lipid droplets. We suggest that COPI negatively regulates localization of TIP47. TIP47 in turn prevents ATGL localization. The rescue of the double-knockdown phenotype of TIP47 and ADRP by BFA or Exo1 suggests that COPI has an independent feed-forward effect on ATGL levels at the lipid droplet surface.</p><p>Although we have focused our attention here on COPI, our systematic and genome-wide exploration of gene functions required for lipid storage in <italic>Drosophila</italic> significantly increases experimental access to the complex molecular processes regulating lipid storage and utilization.

The lipid droplets and nuclei area measurements of the two images per well were used to calculate an averaged lipid area per nuclei area value per well. Additionally to the primary images, a number of wells required reimaging based on visual inspection (size of the complete dataset: <italic>N</italic> &#x0003d; 48,241 wells). To identify and extract images with bad quality, the values for lipid droplet (LD) area and count measurements as well as for the corresponding nuclei measurements of the two images per well were plotted against each other to look for variation within wells. In addition, the corresponding &#x0201c;LD area per nuclei area&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;LD count per nuclei count&#x0201d; ratios were plotted against each other per well. These plots showed 95 prominent outliers (segmentation artifacts/&#x0201c;bad&#x0201d; wells), which were removed (resulting <italic>N</italic> &#x0003d; 48,146 wells). The data values of reimaged wells were averaged.</p><p>The screen dataset was platewise normalized for within-plate and between-plate differences by four different algorithms.
