Both <sc>d</sc>-serine and its metabolizing enzymes are implicated in <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor hypofunction thought to occur in schizophrenia. We studied <sc>d</sc>-amino acid oxidase and serine racemase immunohistochemically in several brain regions and compared their immunoreactivity and their mRNA levels in the cerebellum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia. <sc>d</sc>-Amino acid oxidase immunoreactivity was abundant in glia, especially Bergmann glia, of the cerebellum, whereas in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and substantia nigra, it was predominantly neuronal. Serine racemase was principally glial in all regions examined and demonstrated prominent white matter staining. In schizophrenia, <sc>d</sc>-amino acid oxidase mRNA was increased in the cerebellum, and as a trend for protein. Serine racemase was increased in schizophrenia in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex but not in cerebellum, while serine racemase mRNA was unchanged in both regions. Administration of haloperidol to rats did not significantly affect serine racemase or <sc>d</sc>-amino acid oxidase levels. These findings establish the major cell types wherein serine racemase and <sc>d</sc>-amino acid oxidase are expressed in human brain and provide some support for aberrant <sc>d</sc>-serine metabolism in schizophrenia. However, they raise further questions as to the roles of <sc>d</sc>-amino acid oxidase and serine racemase in both physiological and pathophysiological processes in the brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DAAO</kwd><kwd>DAO</kwd><kwd><sc>d</sc>-serine</kwd><kwd>mRNA</kwd><kwd>SRR</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is activated by binding of the neurotransmitter glutamate and an obligatory co-agonist, glycine or <sc>d</sc>-serine. <sc>d</sc>-Serine is proposed as the predominant co-agonist, at least in the telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Schell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">1997</xref>), consistent with evidence that it modulates cortical and hippocampal NMDAR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Thiels <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Mothet <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Ito &#x00026; Hicks, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Shleper <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p><p>NMDAR hypofunction is considered central to schizophrenia pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Olney &#x00026; Farber, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Coyle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Moghaddam, 2003</xref>), and perhaps to its genetic predisposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Harrison &#x00026; Owen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Harrison &#x00026; Weinberger, 2005</xref>).

DAO has been shown to reduce NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Mothet <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>) and thus increased DAO in schizophrenia might contribute, via <sc>d</sc>-serine decrements, to NMDAR dysfunction. Recent studies provide some support for this notion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Kapoor <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bendikov <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Serine racemase (SRR) synthesizes <sc>d</sc>-serine from <sc>l</sc>-serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Wolosker <italic>et al</italic>., 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">b</xref>), and thus alterations in SRR activity could enhance or counteract the postulated role of DAO in schizophrenia.

Our second objective was to extend the current data regarding altered expression of DAO and SRR in schizophrenia. For these studies we used real-time PCR and Western blotting as more robust methods to determine mRNA and protein abundance, respectively, and focused on the DPFC and cerebellum, given the reported preferential localizations of SRR and DAO in these regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects studied</title><p>Brain tissue was collected at autopsy with consent at two centres, Oxford and London.

Immediately before electrophoresis samples were mixed 4 : 1 with 5&#x000d7; loading buffer [final concentration 0.1 <sc>m</sc> Tris-chloride, 2% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 10% glycerol, 1%&#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% Bromophenol blue] and boiled for 10 min. Clontech protein medleys were diluted in 1&#x000d7; loading buffer (as above, but containing 50 m<sc>m</sc> DTT instead of &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min prior to electrophoresis. Equal protein concentrations and a molecular weight marker rainbow ladder (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK or Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK) were fractionated in duplicate by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS/polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinyl difluoride membrane. Membranes were immersed in blocking buffer (2% non-fat milk, 0.1% Tween<sup>20</sup> in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) for 1 h followed by an overnight incubation at 4 &#x000b0;C with primary antibody [SRR 1 : 500; BD Biosciences; DAO (0.25&#x02013;0.75 &#x000b5;g/mL); anti-flag M2 1 : 15000; Sigma] in the same buffer. For quantitative measurements, membranes were simultaneously incubated with a commercially available antibody to cyclophilin (1 : 100 000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), which detects a band of 20 kDa to serve as a loading control. For Western blots with Clontech protein medleys, blots were stripped of the primary anti-DAO antibody (Re-Blot Plus Western blot recycling kit, Chemicon, Hampshire, UK) and re-probed with anti-actin as a loading control (1 : 10000; Chemicon). Membranes were washed three times in blocking buffer, incubated for 1 h with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody in blocking buffer (anti-mouse immunoglobulin 1 : 1000, DAKO, Cambridgeshire, UK, for SRR, flag-M2 and &#x003b2;-actin, and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin 1 : 5000, Chemicon, for DAO and cyclophilin) followed by washing three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween<sup>20</sup>. Immunoreactive bands were visualized on X-ray film using the &#x02018;ECL Plus&#x02019; kit (GE Healthcare) on Kodak BioMax X-Omat AR film (Sigma). Bands were analysed by densitometry and optical density values for the target immunoreactive bands normalized to those of the housekeeping gene signals.

It also examined whether the expression of these enzymes was altered in the DPFC or cerebellum in schizophrenia, a disorder in which both enzymes have been implicated as part of a broader abnormality in NMDA receptor-mediated signalling. Our main findings are that: (1) DAO and SRR are expressed widely in adult human brain, in discrete but overlapping cell populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). DAO localized to glia in the cerebellum, but in the cerebral cortex was predominantly neuronal. In all regions examined, SRR immnuoreactivity was principally glial, and was more abundant in white matter. (2) In schizophrenia, DAO mRNA was increased in the cerebellum, and SRR increased in the DPFC. These findings have implications for our understanding of the cellular basis of <sc>d</sc>-serine metabolism and for the roles of DAO and SRR in the normal brain, as well as for their involvement in schizophrenia.</p><table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><label>T<sc>able</sc> 3</label><caption><p>Cellular profile of DAO and SRR immunoreactivity in the human brain</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">DAO</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SRR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Cerebellum</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Purkinje cells</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+/&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Molecular layer cells<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf3-1">*</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Granule cells</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Golgi cells</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Bergmann glia</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+++</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+++</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Other glia</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+++</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Molecular layer neuropil</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Granule cell layer neuropil</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+/&#x02013;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+/&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;White matter neuropil</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+/&#x02013;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">DPFC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Pyramidal neurons</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+++</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Grey matter glia</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;White matter glia</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+++</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Grey matter neuropil</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+/&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;White matter neuropil</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+++</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Hippocampus</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Dentate gyrus granule cells</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+/&#x02013;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Pyramidal neurons</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+++</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Glia</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+/&#x02013;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">++</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Grey matter neuropil</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+/&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;White matter neuropil</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+++</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Substantia nigra pars compacta</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Dopamine neurons</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+++</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Glia</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">+/&#x02013;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Neuropil</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n.d.</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Immunoreactivity: 0, absent;

Cerebellar DAO expression, both mRNA and immunoreactivity, was primarily localized to Bergmann glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2H</xref>). Immunoreactivity also localized to other small round cells scattered in the molecular, granule cell and white matter layers that we assume are glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2I</xref>). These observations are consistent with previous immunocytochemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Moreno <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>) and histochemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Horiike <italic>et al</italic>., 1987</xref>) findings in the rat brain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Moreno <italic>et al</italic>. (1999</xref>) also reported DAO immunoreactivity in Golgi and Purkinje cells, which we did not observe in the human cerebellum. This may be due to a species difference in DAO expression, as is seen for other aspects of DAO biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Pollegioni <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, the discrepancy may be attributable to the antibody used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Moreno <italic>et al</italic>. (1999</xref>), which subsequent data suggest may cross-react with <sc>d</sc>-aspartate oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Shleper <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), itself abundantly expressed in Golgi and Purkinje cells of the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b87">Zaar <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The situation regarding DAO in the forebrain has been less clear. Our data confirm that DAO is unequivocally expressed, both as mRNA and as protein, in the human cerebral cortex (DPFC and hippocampus), and also show that this is mainly neuronal with a small glial contribution, consistent with the immunocytochemical findings of the rat study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Moreno <italic>et al</italic>. (1999</xref>), but unlike the situation in cerebellum. These findings raise three issues worthy of mention. First, our antibody did not reliably detect DAO protein by Western blotting in DPFC (or in hippocampus), even though it did in cerebellum, but worked reliably for immunohistochemistry in all areas. Its specificity for DAO is not questioned by this failure, given the experimental controls and corroboration of the immunohistochemical data in DPFC by our <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization findings, but it does require explanation. Most likely, there is a regional difference in the antigenicity of DAO, possibly consequent to differences in post-translational modification or conformation, which is differentially affected by Western blotting and immunohistochemical protocols. Whether this is related to the fact that cerebellum and cerebral cortex predominantly express DAO in different cell types (glia vs. neurons), or the fact that cerebellum contains a DAO transcript variant not detectable in cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Kapoor <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), is unknown. Of note, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bendikov <italic>et al</italic>. (2007</xref>) did robustly detect DAO by Western blotting in the human parietal cortex, using an antibody raised against purified hog DAO, whereas ours was generated against a specific peptide sequence. Potentially, their antibody may have been less susceptible to any inter-regional differences in DAO sequence, conformation or structure.</p><p>The second issue relates to the fact that cortical DAO immunoreactivity was mainly neuronal, whereas it was largely, if not exclusively, glial in the cerebellum. The basis for, and significance of this is unclear. In the DPFC, it implies that much <sc>d</sc>-serine catabolism is neuronal rather than glial, consistent with the recent observations that the major <sc>d</sc>-serine transporter, Asc-1, is also predominantly neuronal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Helboe <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Matsuo <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Rutter <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Together with the localization of SRR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), the findings suggest that, in the cortex, <sc>d</sc>-serine is synthesized mainly in glia, but degraded in neurons.</p><p>The third question concerns why cortical DAO expression is robust, but cortical DAO activity is virtually undetectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Katagiri <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Horiike <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Schell <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Wang &#x00026; Zhu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Kapoor <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). One possibility is that cortical DAO is inactive, perhaps a remnant from an earlier, developmental function, although its robust prolonged expression argues against this. Or, perhaps cortical DAO has a substrate other than <sc>d</sc>-serine, and catalyses a reaction not detected by the commonly used functional assay. However, if this were the case, it would raise the alternative question of how <sc>d</sc>-serine is degraded in the cortex.</p><p>DAO immunoreactivity was strong in putative dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, consistent with an observation in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Moreno <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). This finding is of clinical significance given the demonstration that DAO can oxidize <sc>d</sc>-DOPA in an alternative pathway for dopamine synthesis, and the suggestion that <sc>d</sc>- and <sc>l</sc>-DOPA may be combined therapeutically for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Brannan <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Moses <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Kawazoe <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). However, the presence of endogenous <sc>d</sc>-DOPA or other <sc>d</sc>-isomers of catecholamine precursors in mammals is, to our knowledge, unknown. Nevertheless, the presence of DAO in these neurons suggests that it may play a role in dopaminergic function and, speculatively, the involvement of dopamine or dopamine&#x02013;glutamate interactions in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Laruelle <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SRR expression in human brain</title><p>SRR expression was detected in the DPFC and hippocampus, consistent with previous studies in rodent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">Wolosker <italic>et al</italic>., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Wang &#x00026; Zhu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b83">Yoshikawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Kartvelishvily <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), primate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">Xia <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Steffek <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bendikov <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Within these regions, SRR immunoreactivity was localized to glia of both the grey and the white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B and C</xref>). Previous reports show that SRR immunolabelled glia are astroctyes, based on colocalization with glial fibrillary acidic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">Wolosker <italic>et al</italic>., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">Xia <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Kartvelishvily <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). However, we cannot rule out a microglial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">Wu &#x00026; Barger, 2004</xref>) or oligodendrocytic contribution to SRR expression, as a detailed analysis of glial subtype was beyond the scope of this study.

However, other studies have robustly detected SRR mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b83">Yoshikawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2004a</xref>) and <sc>d</sc>-serine immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Williams <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) in adult rodent cerebellum. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular administration of <sc>l</sc>-serine increases cerebellar <sc>d</sc>-serine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Hashimoto, 2002</xref>), implying that SRR is present (and active) in the adult cerebellum. Our data indicate that there is a significant and sustained expression of SRR in adult human cerebellum. It remains to be explained therefore why the majority of studies cited above suggest cerebellar <sc>d</sc>-serine levels are negligible. Possibilities include the SRR being inactive, or that it is catalysing conversion of a substrate other than <sc>l</sc>-serine, although the implications of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Hashimoto (2002</xref>) study would not support this. Another possibility is that SRR is acting as an eliminase enzyme, breaking down <sc>d</sc>-serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Foltyn <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Alternatively, the low <sc>d</sc>-serine levels seen in cerebellar homogenates may be misleading. The rapid degradation of <sc>d</sc>-serine by DAO in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Morikawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>) may in fact show the importance of tight regulation of cerebellar <sc>d</sc>-serine levels. Moreover, significant <sc>d</sc>-serine concentrations may occur at localized sites, such as the Bergmann glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Williams <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), where there is robust SRR expression, and thereby impact on NMDAR-mediated transmission in the vicinity.</p><p>A final aspect of SRR distribution that has remained unclear is whether SRR is expressed by neurons. It has been suggested to be exclusively or principally glial, based on studies in the adult primate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">Xia <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) and developing rat brain and rat neuronal and glial primary cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">Wolosker <italic>et al</italic>., 1999a</xref>). However, others demonstrate SRR expression in mouse neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84">Yoshikawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) as well as in cortical neurons of both the developing and the adult rat brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Kartvelishvily <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). We did not identify any unequivocally SRR-immunoreactive neurons in the DPFC or hippocampus. This negative result may reflect a species difference, or could reflect a lack of sensitivity of our SRR antibody under the fixation and processing conditions pertaining in the post-mortem tissue. On the other hand, we did find moderate SRR immunostaining of some cerebellar Purkinje neurons, consistent with a minor neuronal contribution to SRR expression in human brain.</p></sec><sec><title>DAO and SRR expression in schizophrenia</title><p>If DAO contributes to NMDAR hypofunction in schizophrenia, then presumably it does so via enhancement (rather than impairment) of DAO function, as this will promote <sc>d</sc>-serine degradation and thence decreased <sc>d</sc>-serine occupancy of NMDARs. Our finding of increased DAO mRNA in the cerebellum, without any change in SRR expression, may offer support to this hypothesis, and extends a preliminary study that also found increased cerebellar DAO mRNA in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Kapoor <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The findings also support the emerging view that the cerebellum is an integral part of the circuitry affected in schizophrenia (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Eastwood <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>&#x02013; for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Katsetos <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Andreasen <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Konarski <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). However, our data are subject to the caveat that although DAO mRNA was significantly increased, DAO immunoreactivity showed only a trend increase (<italic>P =</italic> 0.062). Moreover, we did not determine whether DAO activity is elevated. However, it is noteworthy that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Kapoor <italic>et al</italic>. (2006</xref>) did find enhanced cerebellar DAO activity in schizophrenia to accompany the mRNA elevation. In this regard, were DAO function increased in schizophrenia the consequences would be difficult to predict, given the uncertain status and function of <sc>d</sc>-serine in the cerebellum outlined above. One possibility, given our demonstration of DAO and SRR in Bergmann glia and unchanged cerebellar SRR in schizophrenia, is that a putative increased DAO could impact Bergmann glia <sc>d</sc>-serine levels and thence, speculatively, their regulation of synaptic input to Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Cid &#x00026; Ortega, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Brockhaus &#x00026; Deitmer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Huang &#x00026; Bordey, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Increased cerebellar DAO in schizophrenia may arise for one of several reasons. The fact that DAO mRNA is increased indicates that the mechanism is likely to involve transcriptional regulation of DAO expression. This perhaps relates to DAO's candidacy as a putative schizophrenia susceptibility gene, as the associated polymorphisms are all non-coding and so the mechanism of association is probably through an effect on gene expression, as for other risk genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Harrison &#x00026; Weinberger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Law <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Our sample size was too small to investigate whether any of the schizophrenia-associated DAO polymorphisms contributed to the elevated DAO expression seen here in the disorder. Regardless, as DAO risk alleles are carried by only a minority of cases and by some control subjects as well, this seems unlikely to explain a diagnostic difference in DAO expression. Moreover, as DAO was not increased in the DPFC (present data and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bendikov <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>) in schizophrenia, one would have to postulate a region-specific effect of genotype which, although not unprecedented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Law <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), is not parsimonious. Also, DAO genotype does not predict <sc>d</sc>-serine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">Yamada <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Instead, increased cerebellar DAO in schizophrenia may arise as part of the broader pathophysiological processes, e.g. downstream of other genetic, developmental or environmental influences. One example in the last category is anti-psychotic medication. Although there was no significant effect of haloperidol administration in rats on cerebellar DAO expression (<italic>P =</italic> 0.428), the means were &#x0223c;24% higher in the treated animals, and so it is possible that medication could have contributed to the elevation seen in patients. An early study reported that the antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine inhibits DAO activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">Yagi <italic>et al</italic>., 1956</xref>), but to our knowledge there have been no subsequent investigations of the effects of antipsychotics on DAO expression or activity. Future human post-mortem studies of DAO expression in larger samples with more accurate and extensive medication histories will help to clarify this issue.</p><p>SRR immunoreactivity was increased in schizophrenia, but unlike DAO, this occurred in the DPFC not the cerebellum, and was not accompanied by elevated SRR mRNA. The increase was not hypothesized &#x02013; in that it would suggest increased rather than decreased <sc>d</sc>-serine levels &#x02013; and its explanation remains unclear. It may be consequent to other pathophysiological changes; for example, it may reflect an attempted compensatory response to possible disease-associated reductions in cortical <sc>d</sc>-serine, or that cortical SRR is acting as an eliminase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Foltyn <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), as noted above. This latter explanation has the attraction of thereby explaining how <sc>d</sc>-serine is metabolized in the cortex despite absent DAO activity; however, it remains controversial as to whether the eliminase reaction occurs under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Strisovsky <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Mechanistically, the fact that SRR was elevated but not SRR mRNA suggests regulation at the translational or post-translational level. One possibility is decreased protein degradation, as SRR protein levels are regulated by ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation, a mechanism modulated by the SRR binding partner Golga3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Dumin <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Whether Golga3 is altered in schizophrenia is unknown.</p><p>Speculation as to the significance and the cause of increased DPFC SRR in schizophrenia should in any event be limited, as variable findings have emerged from two other recent studies. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Steffek <italic>et al</italic>. (2006</xref>) reported no change in SRR in prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia, although they did find increased SRR in the hippocampus; the different demographics of the subjects studied (theirs were considerably older) may account for the anatomical discrepancy. In contrast, in a third brain series, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bendikov <italic>et al</italic>. (2007</xref>) found reduced SRR in frontal cortex (area 10) and hippocampus. Unlike the other studies, these authors also directly measured <sc>d</sc>-serine concentrations, overcoming some of the interpretational uncertainty. They replicated the prior reports of reduced cerebrospinal fluid and blood <sc>d</sc>-serine in schizophrenia, but did not find a reduction in parietal cortex. Overall, therefore, no consensus has yet emerged from the data regarding SRR expression, nor <sc>d</sc>-serine itself, in the cerebral cortex in schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Some measures of DAO expression differed between the two cohorts of brains studied here (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), even though the basic demographics are similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The reasons are unknown. However, because the effect of origin of brains had been seen previously we conducted our primary data analyses on <italic>Z</italic>-scored data, allowing the two series to be combined, generating a larger data set and thence more robust results. Nevertheless, this variability does raise the issue of the general applicability of the findings; inspection of the raw data shows that the increased cerebellar DAO immunoreactivity and mRNA in schizophrenia, whilst seen in both the London and Oxford series, was more apparent in the former (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, expression of G72 (DAOA) in schizophrenia has also shown a cohort effect with a larger change in schizophrenia in one series than the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Korostishevsky <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). It is plausible that expression of DAO, and other genes in its regulatory pathway, are particularly susceptible to unknown factors (ranging from genetic variation to peri-mortem confounders) that differ between brain series. The other main limitation of the present study is that <sc>d</sc>-serine itself was not measured, even though most of the functional implications of altering DAO and SRR expression are implicitly or explicitly the result of their effect upon <sc>d</sc>-serine levels. In our case, tissue availability precluded measurement of <sc>d</sc>-serine, and given some reported confounding factors of <sc>d</sc>-serine measurement in post-mortem tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Kumashiro <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>), other studies may also have to use the activity and/or expression of genes involved in <sc>d</sc>-serine metabolism, or its concentration in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hashimoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2005</xref>) as proxy measures.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides the first detailed description of the regional and cellular expression of DAO and SRR in the human brain. The findings suggest that <sc>d</sc>-serine synthesis is primarily glial and occurs in the cerebellum as well as the cerebral cortex. DAO expression and thence <sc>d</sc>-serine catabolism is also glial in the cerebellum, and given the cellular expression of SRR, may regulate <sc>d</sc>-serine levels at localized sites such as the Bergmann glia. However, in the cortex DAO is neuronal, suggesting a different catabolic route, although the lack of cortical DAO activity, despite robust expression, remains a paradox.</p><p>This study demonstrated increased expression in schizophrenia of SRR in the DPFC, and of DAO in the cerebellum. The results provide some support for theories of aberrant <sc>d</sc>-serine metabolism and NMDAR dysfunction in the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Olney &#x00026; Farber, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Coyle, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Tsai <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hashimoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Moghaddam, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Heresco-Levy <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).
