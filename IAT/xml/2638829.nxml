The Q129 mouse line was unexpectedly obtained by <italic>en masse</italic> expansion based on the somatic instability of 76 CAG repeats <italic>in vivo</italic>. The mRNA expression levels of both Q76 and Q129 transgenes were each 80% of that of the endogenous mouse gene, whereas only the Q129 mice exhibited devastating progressive neurological phenotypes similar to those of juvenile-onset DRPLA patients. Electrophysiological studies of the Q129 mice demonstrated age-dependent and region-specific presynaptic dysfunction in the globus pallidus and cerebellum. Progressive shrinkage of distal dendrites of Purkinje cells and decreased currents through &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid and &#x003b3;-aminobutyrate type A receptors in CA1 neurons were also observed. Neuropathological studies of the Q129 mice revealed progressive brain atrophy, but no obvious neuronal loss, associated with massive neuronal intranuclear accumulation (NIA) of mutant proteins with expanded polyglutamine stretches starting on postnatal day 4, whereas NIA in the Q76 mice appeared later with regional specificity to the vulnerable regions of DRPLA. Expression profile analyses demonstrated age-dependent down-regulation of genes, including those relevant to synaptic functions and CREB-dependent genes. These results suggest that neuronal dysfunction without neuronal death is the essential pathophysiologic process and that the age-dependent NIA is associated with nuclear dysfunction including transcriptional dysregulations. Thus, our Q129 mice should be highly valuable for investigating the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Dentatorubral&#x02013;pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA; MIM 125370) is a devastating, autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive dementia, cerebellar ataxia, choreoathetosis, myoclonus and epilepsy in various combinations depending on the age at onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C1">1</xref>). As indicated by the name, autopsied brains show a selective neuronal loss associated with astrocytosis in the dentatorubral and pallidoluysian (DRPL) systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C2">2</xref>). In 1994, we and another group, focusing on genes containing CAG repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C3">3</xref>), found that DRPLA is caused by an unstable expansion of CAG repeats coding for polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches in exon 5 of the <italic>DRPLA</italic> gene on chromosome 12p13.31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C5">5</xref>). To date, polyQ expansions have been identified as the pathogenic mutations in nine neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington&#x02019;s disease (HD), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, DRPLA and various forms of dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C6">6</xref>).</p><p>The discovery of neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs) not only in brains of transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C7">7</xref>) but also in autopsied brains with polyQ diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C9">9</xref>) provided new insight into neuronal nuclei as a potentially important site of pathogenic mechanisms. More importantly, we demonstrated that a diffuse accumulation of a mutant DRPLA protein (atrophin-1) in the neuronal nuclei of autopsied brains, rather than the formation of NIIs, is the predominant pathologic condition involving a wide range of central nervous system (CNS) regions far beyond the vulnerable DRPL systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C10">10</xref>). To further emphasize the involvement of nuclear dysfunction in polyQ diseases, we have demonstrated that expanded polyQ stretches bind to TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factors (TAF<sub>II</sub>130) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), which are components of transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C12">12</xref>). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that essential pathogenetic processes occur in neuronal nuclei. The molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration, however, remain to be elucidated.</p><p>To investigate these molecular mechanisms, studies on animal models precisely replicating all the processes in the human brain would be indispensable. For high-quality animal models, the expression of a full-length mutant gene under the control of its own promoter is preferable to those expressing truncated mutant proteins or under the control of potent heterologous promoters. To meet these requirements, we have generated transgenic mice harboring a single copy of the full-length human mutant <italic>DRPLA</italic> gene containing 76 CAG repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C13">13</xref>). These Q76 mice did not exhibit obvious neurological phenotypes. During intensive breeding of Q76 mice, however, we unexpectedly found a mosaic mouse harboring largely expanded CAG repeats (Q129), in addition to the 76 repeats from progenitor mice, which bred transgenic offspring carrying 129 CAG repeats exhibiting distinct behavioral abnormalities. The Q129 mice showed severe neurological phenotypes with progressive brain atrophy and premature death. Some neuropathological findings of the Q129 mice at 14 weeks of age focusing on morphometric analysis have recently been reported, which demonstrate atrophy of the perikarya and dendrites, and a decrease in the number and size of the spines without any obvious neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C14">14</xref>). We herein report a thorough characterization of the phenotypes of Q129 mice, including electrophysiological abnormalities, neuropathological findings focusing on age-dependent neuronal intranuclear accumulation (NIA) of mutant DRPLA proteins and nuclear dysfunction assessed by expression profiling. As shown here, Q129 mice harboring a single copy of the full-length <italic>DRPLA</italic> gene have many advantages over the previous Q76 mice, and should serve as excellent models for exploring the molecular mechanisms of CAG repeat instability, disease pathogenesis and, furthermore, therapeutic intervention for polyQ diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>En masse</italic> expansion of CAG repeats occurred via somatic instability in a Q76 mouse</title><p>We previously established three transgenic lines, which were generated by the transfer of a cosmid genomic clone containing the full-length human mutant <italic>DRPLA</italic> gene with 78 CAG repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C13">13</xref>). Although the mice showed intergenerational instabilities of CAG repeats similar to those observed in DRPLA patients, no obvious abnormal phenotypes were detected. To investigate intergenerational instabilities, we continued our extensive breeding of the Drm21 line carrying the 76 CAG repeats (Q76 mice). During the process, we unexpectedly noticed one male mouse (EF121) carrying both 76 and 129 CAG repeats among over 2000 hemizygous mice [Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F1">1</xref>A, Mosaic (Q129-76)]. After the birth of the EF121 mouse, the male parent of the EF121 mouse bred only Q76 or non-transgenic (non-TG) mice (<italic>n</italic> = 66 and 54, respectively). On the other hand, the highly expanded 129 CAG repeats, of which sequence was uninterrupted (unpublished data), were transmitted from the EF121 mouse to certain offspring exhibiting behavioral abnormalities (Q129 mice). These results suggest that the EF121 mouse is a mosaic with respect to the length of CAG repeats of the transgene and that the 129 CAG repeats were presumably generated by the <italic>en masse</italic> expansion of the 76 CAG repeats at the early embryonic stage.</p><fig id="DDN403F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Generation of Q129 transgenic mice and disease phenotypes. (<bold>A</bold>) PCR analysis of tail DNA revealed two hemizygous mosaic mice (Q129-76 and Q76-65), a hemizygous mouse (Q76) and the offspring of the Q129-76 mosaic mouse showing three genotypes (Q129, Q76 and non-TG). The lane for the Q129-76 mosaic mouse showed a faint extra band of a much larger size than the band corresponding to 76 CAG repeats. The large changes in the size of CAG repeats resulted in not only expansion (Q129-76), but also contraction (Q76-65).

The percentages of transgenic offspring of Q129, Q76 and non-TG mice bred from the EF121 mosaic mouse were 19% (<italic>n</italic> = 98), 32% (<italic>n</italic> = 170) and 49% (<italic>n</italic> = 260), respectively. Because one-half of the offspring were non-TG mice, the EF121 mosaic mouse was considered to be a hemizygote. Furthermore, the segregation ratios of 19 and 32% suggested that the <italic>en masse</italic> expansion of the CAG repeats had occurred either at the two-cell or four-cell stage. The Q129 mice were established by <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization because of their decreased fertility. The fertilizing ability of spermatozoa from the Q129 mice was comparable to that of the wild-type mice, suggesting that the reduced fertility is due to behavioral abnormalities.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Phenotypes of Q129 mice are similar to those of juvenile-onset DRPLA patients</title><p>The onset of symptoms was as early as 3 weeks of age, at which the Q129 mice began to show myoclonic movements and mild ataxia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F1">1</xref>C). When held by the tail, the myoclonic movements were more evident with limbs outstretched. The clasping of hindlimbs was hardly observed. The myoclonic movements and ataxia rapidly progressed, and epilepsy was observed at around 11 weeks. Initially, epilepsy was induced by tactile stimuli and at the later stage, it occurred spontaneously, even in their home cages. The rapid progression of the disease phenotype was followed by premature death, and all the Q129 mice died by 16 weeks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F1">1</xref>B and C; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddn403/DC1">Supplementary Material, Videos S1 and S2</ext-link>, ataxia and epilepsy, respectively). The severe neurological phenotypes observed in the Q129 mice, namely myoclonus and epilepsy, were quite similar to those observed in juvenile-onset DRPLA patients with onset before the age of 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C15">15</xref>). These phenotypes are in striking contrast to those of the Q76 mice that do not show any obvious neurological phenotypes.</p><p>The brain weight was less than that of the Q76 or non-TG mice at 4 weeks of age, even at a time when body weight did not change. Along with the disease progression, the brain weight of the Q129 mice further decreased after 6 weeks of age prior to the decrease in body weight (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F1">1</xref>D; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddn403/DC1">Supplementary Material, Tables S1 and S2</ext-link>). The examination of brain cross-sections further demonstrated the age-dependent decrease in the brain size of the Q129 mice at 4, 6 and 14 weeks of age (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F1">1</xref>E). In addition, the Q129 mice became polyuric around 5 weeks of age, a phenomenon that was not observed in the Q76 mice. Detailed analyses of water balance were conducted at 8 weeks of age. The Q129 mice showed increased urine volume, water intake and serum osmolality, and reduced urine osmolality (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F1">1</xref>F). Furthermore, we found a drastic reduction in the plasma vasopressin (anti-diuretic hormone) level, confirming that the Q129 mice suffered from central diabetes insipidus.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Dysfunction of pallidal and cerebellar neurons correlates with disease manifestations and progression</title><p>We first conducted electrophysiological studies of the globus pallidus (GP) and cerebellum, because these structures are highly associated with neuropathological changes in DRPLA. Using the Q129 and non-TG mice at 4&#x02013;5 weeks of age, we performed whole-cell recordings from pallidal neurons. Excitatory (EPSCs) and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were evoked by activating the sub-thalamopallidal and striatopallidal pathways, respectively. We did not detect any significant differences in input&#x02013;output (I&#x02013;O) relationships (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F2">2</xref>Aa). In addition, current&#x02013;voltage (<italic>I</italic>&#x02013;<italic>V</italic>) relationships and the amplitudes of both <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) and &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) components of EPSCs were not significantly different (unpublished data). In contrast, the paired pulse facilitation (PPF) of EPSCs and IPSCs was clearly converted to paired pulse depression (PPD) in the Q129 mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F2">2</xref>Ab and Ac), suggesting presynaptic dysfunction in GP of the Q129 mice at 4&#x02013;5 weeks of age.</p><fig id="DDN403F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2.</label><caption><p>Age-dependent abnormalities of synaptic transmission in GP and cerebellum.

EPSCs and IPSCs were evoked by stimulating the sub-thalamopallidal and striatopallidal pathways, respectively, at 0.1 Hz with a bipolar tungsten electrode (100&#x02013;500 &#x000b5;s, 100&#x02013;800 &#x000b5;A).

For focal stimulation in the cerebellar slices, we used a bipolar tungsten electrode (for PC axons) and glass pipettes (5&#x02013;10-&#x003bc;m tip diameter) filled with standard saline (for CFs and PFs), and applied square pulses (duration, 100 &#x000b5;s; amplitude, 0&#x02013;90 V) at 0.5 Hz. Bundles of putative PC axons were stimulated in the white matter 100&#x02013;200 &#x000b5;m away from the FN. CFs were stimulated in the granule cell layer 50&#x02013;100 &#x000b5;m away from the PC soma. PFs were stimulated in the middle of the molecular layer. Each value indicates mean &#x000b1; S.E.M.

IPSCs evoked by stimulating putative Purkinje cell (PC) axons displayed PPD in both non-TG and Q129 mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F2">2</xref>B). There was no significant difference in the extent of PPD. Thus, on postnatal days 8&#x02013;13 before the manifestation of ataxia, transmission from PCs to neurons in FN (one of the deep cerebellar nuclei) in the Q129 mice was apparently normal. Further studies of neurons in the GP and FN at later stages could not be performed because of the limited time window suitable for such electrophysiological analyses.</p><p>To investigate age-dependent changes in the cerebellum, we next compared the electrophysiological properties of PCs at 4 and 12 weeks of age. The passive membrane properties of PCs were calculated by recording membrane currents in response to hyperpolarizing voltage steps, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C16">16</xref>). We found that the C2 of the Q129 mice, representing the lumped membrane capacitance of the PC&#x02019;s dendritic tree, was significantly smaller than that of the non-TG mice at 12 weeks of age (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), whereas no significant changes were observed at 4 weeks of age (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="DDN403TB1">1</xref>). In addition, R3 of the Q129 mice, representing the lumped resistance of the PC&#x02019;s dendritic tree, tended to be greater than that of the non-TG mice at 12 weeks of age. These results suggest that the PC&#x02019;s dendritic trees of the Q129 mice markedly shrank in a time-dependent manner.</p><table-wrap id="DDN403TB1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Electrophysiological parameters of PCs</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non-TG</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Q129</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Postnatal 4 weeks</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Passive membrane properties<sup>a</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic> = 6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic> = 11</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C1 (pF)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.4 &#x000b1; 8.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.8 &#x000b1; 10.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C2 (pF)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">617.3 &#x000b1; 58.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">571.2 &#x000b1; 46.8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R1 (M&#x003a9;)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.8 &#x000b1; 3.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.2 &#x000b1; 1.2</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R2 (M&#x003a9;)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.3 &#x000b1; 5.1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.4 &#x000b1; 2.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R3 (M&#x003a9;)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">308.1 &#x000b1; 68.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">211.0 &#x000b1; 29.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">CF-EPSC</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic> = 15</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic> = 18</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10&#x02013;90% rise time (ms)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4 &#x000b1; 0.01</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4 &#x000b1; 0.01</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Decay time constant (ms)<sup>b</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.7 &#x000b1; 0.3**</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.6 &#x000b1; 0.3**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amplitude at &#x02212;10 mV (pA)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1114.1 &#x000b1; 111.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1126.2 &#x000b1; 139.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amplitude at +50 mV (pA)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">768.1 &#x000b1; 179.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">812.2 &#x000b1; 241.8</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Postnatal 12 weeks</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Passive membrane properties<sup>a</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic> = 14</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic> = 19</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C1 (pF)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">95.5 &#x000b1; 13.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">80.8 &#x000b1; 11.1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">C2 (pF)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">629.9 &#x000b1; 63.5**</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">332.6 &#x000b1; 18.9**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R1 (M&#x003a9;)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.1 &#x000b1; 0.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.4 &#x000b1; 1.1</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R2 (M&#x003a9;)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.8 &#x000b1; 3.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.7 &#x000b1; 1.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">R3 (M&#x003a9;)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">241.2 &#x000b1; 47.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">405.3 &#x000b1; 76.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">CF-EPSC</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic>=23</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>n</italic> = 26</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10&#x02013;90% rise time (ms)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4 &#x000b1; 0.03</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4 &#x000b1; 0.01</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Decay time constant (ms)<sup>b</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.9 &#x000b1; 0.3**</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.9 &#x000b1; 0.3**</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amplitude at &#x02212;10 mV (pA)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1150.9 &#x000b1; 98.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1312.0 &#x000b1; 140.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amplitude at +50 mV (pA)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1085.2 &#x000b1; 182.9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1771.3 &#x000b1; 297.7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>a</sup> Parameters for passive membrane properties are calculated according to the model described by Llano <italic>et al</italic>.

At this dilution, no background immunoreactivities were detected in the brain of the non-TG mice, confirming that 1C2 immunoreactivity is specific to the expanded polyQ stretches of mutant proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F4">4</xref>A, right panels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C10">10</xref>).

The nuclear labeling, namely NIA, was strong and extended to most of the CNS regions including the brainstem, spinal cord and the regions evaluated for the above-mentioned electrophysiological properties. It should be noted that NIA, which was observed at 4 weeks of age in the Q129 mice, occurred much earlier than the appearance of NIIs after approximately 9 weeks of age. To determine when NIA becomes apparent, we further analyzed the Q129 mice on embryonic and postnatal days. NIA was not observed in the brain of Q129 mice on postnatal day 1 (P1), but became detectable on P4, confirming age-dependent NIA of mutant DRPLA proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F4">4</xref>B).</p><p>Interestingly, NIA was also observed in the Q76 mouse brain despite the Q76 mice not showing any obvious neurological phenotypes.

The regional distribution of NIA in the Q76 mice was analyzed semiquantitatively (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="DDN403TB2">2</xref>). NIA was first detectable at 4 weeks of age in limited CNS regions, such as the cerebellar nuclei, red nucleus, GP, subthalamic nucleus and a few other regions including the cerebral cortex of the Q76 mice.

The lane for human control brain carrying 13 and 9 CAG repeats (lane 1) showed a weak band corresponding to the full-length human DRPLA protein.

In the total homogenates of the mouse brain, two bands corresponding to the full-length mouse endogenous DRPLA protein (200 kDa) and transgene-derived DRPLA proteins (210 and 220 kDa in Q76 and Q129, respectively) were detected using C580, whereas only the lower band corresponding to the full-length mouse DRPLA protein was observed for the non-TG mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F5">5</xref>B).

The intensities of the bands of the full-length DRPLA proteins of Q129 were much weaker than those corresponding to the mouse endogenous DRPLA proteins or those of Q76, which may reflect the highly aggregatable nature of mutant DRPLA proteins with highly expanded polyQ stretches that may be resistant to extraction or solubilization procedures.

A massive amount of smear migrating between the stacking gel and the band corresponding to the full-length mutant protein was observed for the Q129 mice, in addition to human full-length and truncated bands as well as the mouse endogenous band (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F5">5</xref>C). The truncated proteins were also recognized by 1C2 (unpublished data) and thus specific for mutant DRPLA proteins as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C20">20</xref>). The smear was far more intense for the Q129 mice than for the Q76 mice, confirming the polyQ-length-dependent nuclear accumulation of the mutant proteins with expanded polyQ stretches. The smearing pattern was also observed in AT-FL-65Q-150 mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F5">5</xref>C; lane 1) as previously described. AT-FL-65Q-150 mice are transgenic mice carrying full-length DRPLA cDNA under the control of the prion promoter and expressing higher levels of the transgene than the Q129 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C20">20</xref>). Although the intensities of the truncated bands and the smears were considerably different between Q129 and AT-FL-65Q-150, this may reflect the higher expression levels of mutant DRPLA proteins in AT-FL-65Q-150 and regional differences in expression depending on the promoter driving the transgenes (Q129: own promoter of <italic>DRPLA</italic> gene; ATFL-65Q: prion promoter). The difference in the western blotting patterns detected by AP142 and C580 raises many possibilities, including that a fraction of accumulated mutant DRPLA proteins in the nucleus are truncated at the carboxy terminus.

Thus, we analyzed expression profiles (&#x0223c;11 000 genes) in the brains of the Q129 and non-TG littermates at 4 and 12 weeks of age using GeneChip Mu11K oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). To determine how gene expressions are affected as a function of disease duration, we selected dysregulated genes at each age using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with error-weighting. On the basis of our criteria described in Materials and Methods, we detected 54 and 92 down-regulated probe sets, as well as 38 and 20 up-regulated sets at 4 and 12 weeks of age, respectively. The number of down-regulated genes tended to increase with age. We next searched for genes showing age-dependent changes in the levels of expression determined by the two-way ANOVA. We found 46 down-regulated genes (corresponding to 48 probe sets on the microarrays) and 26 up-regulated genes. Interestingly, many of the down-regulated genes were categorized mainly into specific functional molecules, such as neuropeptides, transcriptional factors and signaling molecules (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F6">6</xref>). Although all of the down-regulated genes showed further decreases in expression level with age, the degrees of decrease were different and a limited number of the genes, mainly categorized into neuropeptides, showed a marked decrease (fold change &#x0003c;&#x02212;1.5) at 4 weeks of age.

We previously showed age-dependent changes in expanded CAG repeats in somatic tissues as well as intergenerational instabilities of expanded CAG repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C13">13</xref>). The mechanism of instability has been assumed to be cumulative accumulation of short repeat changes with age, typically one-repeat additions or subtractions. In contrast, <italic>en masse</italic> expansion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F1">1</xref>A, lane 1) or contraction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F1">1</xref>A, lane 2) is quite different in terms of the frequency and length of repeat changes. The large intergenerational increase in the CAG repeats to expanded alleles from the intermediate alleles has been observed in a small number of HD or SCA7 patients, and is called the <italic>de novo</italic> expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C25">25</xref>). This phenomenon may be similar to the <italic>en masse</italic> expansion observed in this study. Based on these observations, there seem to be two discrete mechanisms of CAG repeat instability: cumulative accumulation of short repeat changes with age and <italic>en masse</italic> changes occurring spontaneously, but infrequently. Because the mosaic mice were hemizygous, inter-allelic recombination mechanisms are unlikely to be involved. We previously reported a patient with <italic>en masse</italic> expansion of impure CAG repeats in the TBP gene. In this case, inter-allelic recombination events were excluded on the basis of haplotype analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C26">26</xref>). These intriguing observations suggest that simple intra-allelic rearrangements are involved in the CAG repeat instabilities associated with <italic>en masse</italic> expansions or contractions, which have also been suggested to be involved in somatic instability of minisatellites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C27">27</xref>). Taking advantage of the instability of the 129 CAG repeats, we have recently obtained transgenic models carrying 113 or 96 CAG repeats with moderately severe neurological phenotypes (unpublished observation). Thus, transgenic models carrying single copy genes within a full-length genomic context may serve to produce those with variable lengths of expanded CAG repeats.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Q129 mice as an excellent model to understand disease pathogenesis of DRPLA</title><p>The Q129 and Q76 mice should be highly valuable for investigating expanded-polyQ-length-dependent effects, because the only difference between the Q129 and Q76 mice is the length of expanded CAG repeats within an identical integration site. The severe neurological phenotypes of the Q129 mice are quite similar to those observed in juvenile-onset DRPLA patients. It should be noted, however, that the phenotypes of Q129 mice were distinct from previously generated mouse models of polyQ diseases. The Q129 mice showed myoclonus, epilepsy and progressive brain atrophy, which are the predominant clinical presentations in DRPLA patients. In contrast, feet clasping observed in R6/2 mice, SCA1 knock-in mice and DRPLA cDNA mice of AT-FL-65Q-150 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C28">28</xref>) was absent in the Q129 mice.

In contrast to the Q76 mice, a massive NIA of mutant DRPLA proteins occurred throughout the Q129 mouse brain. It is noteworthy that NIA was not present on P1 even in the Q129 mice, but was the earliest change among any other abnormalities including neurological phenotypes and electrophysiological abnormalities. It should also be mentioned that the distribution of NIA far exceeded the DRPL systems. This may provide an explanation as to the controversial issue that the neuronal loss involving DRPL systems alone cannot account for the broad clinical manifestations of DRPLA. In particular, massive NIA observed in the cerebral cortex may account for the development of dementia, myoclonus and epilepsy. Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that NIA plays essential roles in the pathogenesis of DRPLA.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying the regional specificity of NIA of mutant DRPLA proteins, however, remain to be elucidated.

We demonstrated presynaptic dysfunction (altered PPRs) in PCs and pallidal neurons, and postsynaptic dysfunction (shrinkage of distal dendrites of PCs and decreased currents through AMPA and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in CA1 neurons). These observations strongly argue for the concept of &#x02018;neuronal dysfunction without neuronal death&#x02019;.

Supporting this concept, juvenile-onset DRPLA patients initially do not show markedly atrophic changes in the cerebellum in magnetic resonance imaging, in contrast to markedly atrophic changes observed in late-adult-onset DRPLA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C36">36</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Transcriptional dysregulations and neuronal dysfunction</title><p>In this study, we have identified genes that are down-regulated in an age-dependent manner, including those coding for neuropeptides, transcriptional factors and signaling molecules.

Although clinically apparent endocrinological dysfunction has not been described in DRPLA patients, detailed investigations should be carried out on DRPLA patients, particularly on those with juvenile-onset DRPLA and highly expanded CAG repeats. Given the behavioral abnormalities observed in mice with their neuropeptides knocked out, including somatostatin (MGI:98326, impairment in motor learning) and neuropeptide Y (MGI:97374, seizure), the down-regulation of these neuropeptides may also contribute in part to the behavioral abnormalities of the Q129 mice. Dbp (MGI:2183196), Fos (MGI:95574) or excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (Slc1a2, MGI:101931) knock-out mice show seizures, suggesting that the down-regulation of these genes may also contribute to the neurological phenotypes of Q129 mice.</p><p>As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN403F6">6</xref>, 46% of down-regulated and 61% of strongly down-regulated genes (fold change &#x0003c;&#x02212;1.5) have CRE sites. These observations support our previous finding that CREB-dependent transcriptional activation is strongly suppressed by expanded polyQ stretches in cellular models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C40">40</xref>). A role for CREB-mediated signaling in neurodegeneration has been provided by Mantamadiotis <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C41">41</xref>), as determined using conditional CREB knock-out mice. They described that mice lacking both CREB and cAMP response element modulator protein (CREM) in the postnatal forebrain showed progressive neurodegeneration of the striatum and hippocampus after 1.5 months, and a neurological phenotype after 6 months, supporting the hypothesis that disruption of CREB-dependent transcription plays an essential role in neurodegeneration in polyQ diseases through transcriptional dysregulations. Although we focused on CREB-dependent transcription, it has recently been reported that expanded polyQ stretches disrupt the structures of TAF<sub>II</sub>D and TAF<sub>II</sub>F of the basal transcriptional apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C42">42</xref>). Thus, the down-regulation of genes may involve multiple mechanisms in addition to the down-regulation of CREB target genes; further investigations on the mechanisms underlying transcriptional dysregulations caused by expanded polyQ stretches should be carried out.</p><p>We should emphasize the concept of neuronal dysfunction without neuronal death as the essential pathophysiologic mechanism underlying polyQ diseases, which are associated with transcriptional dysregulations. This concept is further supported by a previous study that demonstrated the reversible recovery of phenotypic presentations in an HD mouse model after the shut-off of the expression of truncated mutant <italic>huntingtin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C43">43</xref>). A recent report of deficits in experience-dependent cortical plasticity in presymptomatic HD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C44">44</xref>) further strengthens this concept. This concept strongly emphasizes a wider time interval for therapeutic interventions. Because our Q129 mice closely replicate pathophysiologic processes in the human brain, as supported by the insertion of a single copy gene with its own promoter, the Q129 mice should be an ideal model for exploring possibilities for therapeutic interventions aimed at polyQ diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation and background of Q129 mice</title><p>Q76 transgenic mice were previously established in N1 progenies (Drm21 line) with agouti coat color that were generated from a CCE ES clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN403C13">13</xref>).
