For this serious disease, primary prevention, that is tobacco eviction, remains the best goal.

The activity of a putative promoter RAR-beta1' was assessed experimentally. Reference values for RRs mRNAs were measured in Normal Human Bronchial Epithelial cells (NHBE) with qRT-PCR Syber Green assays and a triplex of Taqman probes. Conceived to save invaluable bronchial mucosa samples, the reliability of this last qRT-PCR tool was extensively validated. Hence, it was used to measure the relative RRs mRNAs levels in lung tumors and cell lines. Finally, contrary to commercial antibodies, our pan-RAR&#x003b2; antibody immunoprecipitated a single band of protein in nuclear extracts of BEAS-2B and NHBE cells. Its molecular weight and further amino acid sequencing demonstrated that it corresponds to the RAR&#x003b2;2 protein isoform. Rigorous samples processing, like extensive biocomputing analysis were the key factors for the realization of this study.

The remaining scratched mucosa was dissected out from the bronchi and cut into small explants to give rise to "Cultured undifferentiated Human Bronchial Epithelial cells" (CHBE) in LH9 medium (Cambrex Bio Sciences, Emerainville, France). Cells were grown for two weeks with regular medium change as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. A week later, explants were detached from dishes and cultured again twice. At confluence, CHBE were scrapped and processed like NHBE for RNA purification. Histological examination revealed mostly undifferentiated basal bronchial cells. The smooth muscle sheaths from the back of the trachea were obtained by dissection and were cut frozen as 20 &#x003bc;m sections. Skin samples were collected from three different female patients undergoing fat reduction and were cut also as 20 &#x003bc;m frozen sections parallel to the basal membrane.

For western-blot analysis, nuclear extracts were prepared from BEAS-2B and NHBE cells as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. They were fractionated by SDS (1%) poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%) and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose filters. After blocking with PBS containing 3% non-fat powdered milk, the filters were immunoprobed with our polyclonal RAR&#x003b2; antibody (dilution 1:500) for 2 h, extensively washed in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated antibody (dilution 1:40,000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PE, USA). Specific complexes were revealed by chemiluminescence detection (Super Signal West Dura, Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For immunoprecipitation analysis, NHBE nuclear extracts (1 mg) were incubated with immobilized Protein A cross-linked to the antibody, using the Seize X Protein A Immunoprecipitation Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Then in humans, the RAR&#x003b2;2 protein [Swiss-Prot:<ext-link ext-link-type="sprot" xlink:href="P10826-2">P10826-2</ext-link>], encoded by a CpG island and RARE containing RAR-beta2 promoter region, was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The RAR&#x003b2;4 protein isoform [Swiss-Prot:<ext-link ext-link-type="sprot" xlink:href="P10826-3">P10826-3</ext-link>], generated from the alternate splicing of the <italic>RAR&#x003b2;2 </italic>mRNA at the exon 3, was further described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. A human foetal protein isoform, RAR&#x003b2;1 [Swiss-Prot:<ext-link ext-link-type="sprot" xlink:href="P10826-1">P10826-1</ext-link>], also expressed in small cell lung cancers has been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, neither the corresponding mouse RAR-beta1-like promoter nor the <italic>RAR&#x003b2;1 </italic>and <italic>RAR&#x003b2;3 </italic>transcripts have been fully characterized in human cells. Another protein isoform, RAR&#x003b2;5, has been characterized in both normal and malignant human breast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. It is supposed to contribute to the resistance of the cancerous cells to retinoids. This isoform is encoded by a cryptic distinct RAR-beta3 promoter, located in the first intron of the <italic>RAR&#x003b2;2 </italic>transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Finally, a <italic>RAR&#x003b2;1' </italic>transcript isoform, with a specific first exon, has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, the corresponding protein sequence is not described.

These two transcripts were detected in all the samples tested when using our "RAR&#x003b2;" and "RAR&#x003b2;2" qRT-PCR primers (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

These results were especially surprising for [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ083391">DQ083391</ext-link>], as the primers we designed are located in the exons 1/2 junction of the transcript and overlap with those previously used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] to amplify <italic>RAR&#x003b2;1'</italic>.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>RAR&#x003b2; and RAR&#x003b2;2 relative expression ratios</bold>. <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>x-fold ratios (R) were computed by Rest-RG<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, based on 2-log of absolute gene regulation, with their associated standard errors.

No canonical promoter features (TATA box, ...) were found, but two degenerate DR5 RARE motifs were identified within the upstream sequences of [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="U52076">U52076</ext-link>] and [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DQ083391">DQ083391</ext-link>], near their respective specific first exons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Additionally, a CpG island was found in the upstream sequence of [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="U52076">U52076</ext-link>]. This last region (indicated as P1" on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) was previously explored by Petty <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and it was therefore not reinvestigated experimentally in this study. However, we searched for other possible alternate RAR-beta promoters. <italic>In silico </italic>comparative genomics indicated an orthologous conservation between the mouse RAR-beta1 promoter region and the upstream sequence of [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="DC376623">DC376623</ext-link>].

This conserved region (indicated as P1' on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) was further investigated experimentally but no promoter-like activity was demonstrated in reporter assays. This might be a feature of weak nuclear receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Relative expressions of RRs mRNAs</title><p>Reference values for RRs mRNAs expressions were first determined in normal lung tissues (NHBE), then the relative levels of RRs mRNAs were measured in several cell lines, comparing the results obtained with the two qRT-PCR methodologies: Syber Green and a triplex of Taqman probes.

In addition, when demonstrating the stability of the selected genes, the quality of each sample was also systematically assessed by Bestkeeper<sup>&#x000a9; </sup>as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. SD values &#x0003c; 1 demonstrates the overall inter-sample expression stability for <italic>&#x003b2;-Actin </italic>(0.56), <italic>RAR&#x003b1; </italic>(0.60 with Sybr Green and 0.67 with the Taqman probe) and <italic>RXR&#x003b2; </italic>(0.75 with Sybr Green and 0.60 with the Taqman probe). SD value &#x0003e; 1 sustained gene expression variability across samples and therefore exclusion from the computation of the Bestkeeper<sup>&#x000a9; </sup>index. Using only the three stable genes, their combinations were tested to obtain the most reliable Bestkeeper<sup>&#x000a9; </sup>index parameters. Although <italic>RAR&#x003b1; </italic>correlated well with the Bestkeeper<sup>&#x000a9; </sup>index, its inter-sample wide variation did not match with those of <italic>&#x003b2;-Actin </italic>and <italic>RXR&#x003b2; </italic>(r &#x0003c; 0.5, p &#x0003e; 0.05). <italic>RAR&#x003b1; </italic>was therefore not considered as a relevant reference gene in this case. In Syber Green assays, the optimal Bestkeeper<sup>&#x000a9; </sup>index parameters were found for the combination of <italic>&#x003b2;-Actin </italic>and <italic>RXR&#x003b2; </italic>as reference genes. Indeed, their expressions correlated well together (r = 0.76, p = 0.006) and a good correlation for each <italic>&#x003b2;-Actin </italic>(r = 0.96, p = 0.001) and <italic>RXR&#x003b2; </italic>(r = 0.92, p = 0.001) was observed with the computed BestKeeper<sup>&#x000a9; </sup>index, which exhibited a moderate SD variation of 0.64. This combination of reference genes was thus further used in each sample for the normalization of RRs expression data obtained from the Syber Green assays.</p><p>As a matter of fact, it is not possible to design a multiplex of Taqman including the housekeeping gene, <italic>&#x003b2;-Actin</italic>, and the RRs genes together because the gap of expression between them is so wide that the amplification of <italic>&#x003b2;-Actin </italic>will be inhibited when RRs become detectable for the same qPCR cDNA inputs. Since the SD values associated to the <italic>RAR&#x003b1; </italic>and <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>Taqman probes were &#x0003e; 1 (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), they could not be used for the normalization of the data obtained with the triplex of probes. Therefore, a combination of <italic>&#x003b2;-Actin </italic>(Syber Green external reference gene) and <italic>RXR&#x003b2; </italic>(Taqman internal reference gene) was tested. The related Bestkeeper<sup>&#x000a9; </sup>index showed a SD variation of 0.59 (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). The values of the selected reference genes correlated well together (r = 0.61, p = 0.046) and also with the corresponding Bestkeeper<sup>&#x000a9; </sup>index (r = 0.94, p = 0.001 for <italic>&#x003b2;-Actin </italic>and r = 0.84, p = 0.001 for <italic>RXR&#x003b2;</italic>). This combination of reference genes was thus used in each sample for the normalization of the data generated from Taqman assays. It also allowed to perform an accurate comparison between the significant relative expression ratios obtained with both qRT-PCR methodologies.</p><p>For each sample, the RRs mRNAs expression ratios relative to NHBE were next computed by the Rest-RG<sup>&#x000a9; </sup>software, with a simultaneous normalization of the data by both reference genes: <italic>&#x003b2;-Actin </italic>and <italic>RXR&#x003b2; </italic>(Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). The sample-wide relative levels of "RAR&#x003b2;" and "RAR&#x003b2;2" amplicons are represented on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Statistical significance was determined using a Pair Wise Fixed Reallocation Randomisation Test<sup>&#x000a9; </sup>(p-value &#x0003c; 0.05). We chose the method reported by Pfaffl <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] to determine the relative expressions of RRs mRNAs because it allows a reliable normalization of the raw qRT-PCR data with an index of stable reference genes. In this method, the computation of each expression ratio is based upon the crossing point deviation (&#x00394;CP or &#x00394;mTOP) for each sample <italic>vs </italic>the control sample (NHBE). Furthermore, corrections for exact qRT-PCR efficiencies (E or mAE) are taken into account, which is not the case when computing relative expressions using the standard curve or the &#x00394;&#x00394;CP methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Such normalizations are indeed very important, especially when the expressions of several genes have to be compared across numerous samples.</p><p>In Syber Green assays, the levels of "RAR&#x003b2;" amplicons varied as follows: H69(0.32) &#x0003e; A549(0.16) &#x0003e; skin*(-2.20) &#x0003e; CHBE*(-2.27) &#x0003e; SMC*(-2.48) &#x0003e; H2087*(-3.63) &#x0003e; H2342*(-4.06) &#x0003e; BEAS-2B*(-4.54) &#x0003e; H513*(-4.68) &#x0003e; H1648*(-5.63), while the levels of "RAR&#x003b2;2" amplicons were ranked as follows: A549(-0.24) &#x0003e; H69(-0.23) &#x0003e; SMC*(-3.03) &#x0003e; skin*(-3.29) &#x0003e; CHBE*(-3.35) &#x0003e; BEAS-2B*(-5.63) &#x0003e; H513*(-5.64) &#x0003e; H2342*(-6.57) &#x0003e; H1648*(-8.33). In H2087, the level of "RAR&#x003b2;2" amplicons was so weak that it was not detected. In all the samples, the relative amounts of "RAR&#x003b2;" amplicons were always higher than those observed for "RAR&#x003b2;2" (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that the "RAR&#x003b2;" primers target the common part of all the <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>transcripts generated from RAR-beta2, whereas the "RAR&#x003b2;2" primers are specific for the sole <italic>RAR&#x003b2;2 </italic>transcript isoform. When compared to "<italic>in vivo</italic>" differentiated NHBE, the relative levels of both "RAR&#x003b2;" and "RAR&#x003b2;2" amplicons were always found at lower levels in the samples tested. This, especially for the "<italic>in vitro</italic>" undifferentiated CHBE cells, indicating that <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>is indeed very important in lung cells and that an increase in <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>expression signs the normal differentiation of the human bronchial epithelial tissue. In addition, the levels of "RAR&#x003b2;" and "RAR&#x003b2;2" amplicons observed in skin and SMC were very similar to CHBE and their respective amounts were also significantly lower than in NHBE. Concomitant and significant low levels of "RAR&#x003b2;" and "RAR&#x003b2;2" amplicons were observed in H1648, H2087, and H2342 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), confirming the importance of <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>in NSCLCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. That was not the case in both H69 and A549 cell lines whose "RAR&#x003b2;" and "RAR&#x003b2;2" amplicons levels corresponded to those observed in NHBE.</p><p>The results obtained with the <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>Taqman probe varied as follows: A549(0.24) &#x0003e; H69(-0.40) &#x0003e; SMC*(-2.06) &#x0003e; skin*(-2.21) &#x0003e; CHBE*(-2.87) &#x0003e; BEAS-2B*(-3.8). In H1648, H2087, H2342 and H513, <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>was found highly down-expressed and still detected by the Syber Green assays but not by the Taqman assays (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In order to compare the data obtained with the RAR&#x003b2; Taqman probe <italic>vs </italic>the corresponding Syber Green data, a tissue specific variation rate (VR) was computed when <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>amplicons were detected in both kinds of qPCR assays and when the computed expression ratios were both significant. All the resulting VR values are &#x0003c; 25% (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). This confirmed that, when detected, the <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>expression ratios generated by the two qRT-PCR methodologies were consistent. The triple Taqman assay was initially developed to save rare and invaluable mRNA samples by simultaneously performing the detection of three RR genes. Since there is twice as much cDNA in Syber Green assays for a single RR amplification as there is in the Taqman probes assays to amplify three RRs, the sensitivity of the Taqman assay is therefore at least twice that of the Syber Green assay.</p><p>As <italic>RAR&#x003b1;</italic>, <italic>RAR&#x003b3; </italic>and <italic>RXR&#x003b1; </italic>gave results with high SE values for all the samples (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>), their expressions were not considered significantly different from those found for NHBE.

Furthermore, <italic>RXR&#x003b2;</italic>, was demonstrated as stably expressed across all the samples, and with both qRT-PCR methodologies. In this context, it was therefore considered as a relevant reference gene.</p><p>12 dissected SqCLC tumor samples were also analyzed using <italic>&#x003b2;-Actin </italic>in Syber Green and the triplex of Taqman probes. The resulting raw qRT-PCR data are recapitulated in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>. <italic>&#x003b2;-Actin </italic>amplicons were detected in all the samples tested with Syber Green as well as <italic>RAR&#x003b1; </italic>amplicons with the triplex of Taqman probes. Corresponding qRT-PCR data were analyzed with Bestkeeper<sup>&#x000a9; </sup>to check the expression stability of the genes across samples. The results are indicated in Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>. SD values &#x0003c; 1 demonstrated the overall expression stability for both <italic>&#x003b2;-Actin </italic>(0.89) and <italic>RAR&#x003b1; </italic>(0.86) across tumoral samples. The related Bestkeeper<sup>&#x000a9; </sup>index showed a SD variation of 0.85. The values of the selected reference genes correlated well together (r = 0.78, p = 0.003) and with the corresponding Bestkeeper<sup>&#x000a9; </sup>index (r = 0.96, p = 0.001 for <italic>&#x003b2;-Actin </italic>and r = 0.92, p = 0.001 for <italic>RAR&#x003b1;</italic>). As previously, the quality of each tumor sample was also confirmed by the software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Interestingly, although <italic>RAR&#x003b1; </italic>amplicons were detected for each tumor sample analyzed with the triplex of Taqman probes, no amplicons could be detected for both <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>and <italic>RXR&#x003b2; </italic>(Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). This suggests the deep concomitant down-expressions of these two RRs genes in epidermoid lung tumors.</p></sec><sec><title>Western-Blot and Immunoprecipitation of RAR&#x003b2;</title><p>Commercial antibodies against RAR&#x003b2; gave in our hands conflicting results in western-blots, with several protein bands that are either attributed to phosphorylation or degradation. Therefore, we validated extensively a new pan-RAR&#x003b2; antibody directed toward a specific peptidic sequence common to all the RAR&#x003b2; protein isoforms described (F2 region). Using nuclear extracts of BEAS-2B and NHBE cells, the antibody recognized a single band of about 52 kDa in both western-blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, panel A) and immunoprecipitation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, panel B) experiments. The amino acid sequencing gave the following sequence: SSADHRVRLDLG (exon 5 of [<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_000965">NM_000965</ext-link>]) also common to all the RAR&#x003b2; proteins described, attesting for the specificity of the antibody. The results obtained correspond to the molecular weight expected for the RAR&#x003b2;2 protein, which is reported as a nuclear isoform of RAR&#x003b2; in databanks. The RAR&#x003b2;4 protein, whose molecular weight was previously reported at about 37 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] is reported as a cytoplasmic isoform of RAR&#x003b2; in normal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and it was accordingly not detected by our antibody in BEAS-2B and NHBE nuclear extracts. The RAR&#x003b2;1' protein isoform was previously characterized using whole cell extracts of BEAS-2B and it was reported with a molecular weight of about 47 KDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. This isoform was also not detected by our antibody in the nuclear extracts analyzed. These results suggest that, if it is actually expressed in BEAS-2B and NHBE cells, the RAR&#x003b2;1' protein is another short cytoplasmic isoform of RAR&#x003b2;. That is particularly interesting as truncated isoforms of RAR&#x003b2; with "tumorogenic activity" were previously reported over-expressed in malignant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Indeed, these truncated isoforms are thought to compete with RAR&#x003b2;2 in the nuclei of cancer cells; inhibiting its cellular functions, enhancing the proliferation process and contributing to the resistance of the cells to retinoids.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Pan-RAR&#x003b2; antibody validation</bold>.

In these differentiated lung cells, the <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>transcripts were found at their highest levels of expression, indicating that an increase in <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>mRNAs signs the normal differentiation of the human bronchial epithelium. In all the samples analyzed, <italic>RAR&#x003b2;2 </italic>was the major transcript isoform that was detected. In addition, the levels of <italic>RAR&#x003b2;2 </italic>varied concomitantly with the whole levels of <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>mRNAs measured in each sample. To evince the existence of additional <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>isoforms, we recapitulated the informations available <italic>in silico </italic>for the human <italic>RAR&#x003b2;</italic>. Then, we investigated for the presence of unvalidated <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>transcripts and for the activity of a putative RAR-beta1' promoter region. However, such transcripts were not detected in the samples tested and no activity was found for RAR-beta1'. This allowed to demonstrate that the whole level of <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>mRNAs observed in each sample is represented by the transcripts isoforms generated from the RAR-beta2 promoter. <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>transcripts were found highly down-expressed in NSCLC cell lines and SqCLC tumors, which is a reported event in the process of lung carcinogenesis. <italic>&#x003b2;-Actin </italic>and <italic>RAR&#x003b1; </italic>expressions were found stable across samples. As for <italic>RXR&#x003b2;</italic>, although its expression was found stable in normal lung cells and cancer lines, a concomitant down-regulation was observed with <italic>RAR&#x003b2; </italic>in SqCLC samples. This suggests a possible role for this RR as an heterodimerization partner for RAR&#x003b2; in the bronchial mucosa. Finally, RAR&#x003b2;2 was the only protein isoform detected by our pan-RAR&#x003b2; antibody in NHBE and BEAS-2B nuclear extracts, indicating that short protein isoforms of RAR&#x003b2; were not present within the nuclei of these cells. In our view, the research for specific human micro-RNAs targeting each of the RRs, as well as RNA interference experiments, and the over-expressions of full or truncated versions of RRs, would be of great interest in order to complete our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the process of lung carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>AE: Amplification Efficiency; CHBE: Cultured Human Bronchial Epithelial cells; CP: Crossing Point; DR: Direct Repeat; mAE: mean Amplification Efficiency; mTOP: mean Take-Off Point; NHBE: Normal Human Bronchial Epithelial cells; NSCLC: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer; qRT-PCR: quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; RA: Retinoic Acid; RAR: Retinoic Acid Receptor; RARE: Retinoic Acid Response Element; RR: Retinoids Receptors; RXR: Retinoid X Receptor; RXRE: Retinoid X Response Element; SCLC: Small Cell Lung Cancer; SqCLC: Squamous Cell Lung Cancer; SMC: Smooth Muscle Cell; TOP: Take-Off Point.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JMV and SL were responsible for lung samples collection and preparation.
