Here we investigate the roles of specific endodermal structures in regulating craniofacial development. We have isolated an <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutant in zebrafish that has region-specific losses of facial cartilages derived from hyoid neural crest cells. In addition, the cranial muscles that normally attach to the affected cartilage region and their associated nerve are secondarily reduced in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> animals. Earlier in development, <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants also have specific defects in the formation of the first pouch, an outpocketing of the pharyngeal endoderm. By fate mapping, we show that the cartilage regions that are lost in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants develop from neural crest cells directly adjacent to the first pouch in wild-type animals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Integrin&#x003b1;5 functions in the endoderm to control pouch formation and cartilage development. Time-lapse recordings suggest that the first pouch promotes region-specific cartilage development by regulating the local compaction and survival of skeletogenic neural crest cells. Thus, our results reveal a hierarchy of tissue interactions, at the top of which is the first endodermal pouch, which locally coordinates the development of multiple tissues in a specific region of the vertebrate face. Lastly, we discuss the implications of a mosaic assembly of the facial skeleton for the evolution of ray-finned fish.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A developmental mutant of the zebrafish is helping to uncover the processes by which the facial skeleton is patterned in vertebrates</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The skeletal elements that form and support the vertebrate jaw and gills are derived from a specialized population of ectomesenchyme cells, the cranial neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Platt1">Platt 1893</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Le1">Le Douarin 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Schilling1">Schilling and Kimmel 1994</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Weston1">Weston et al. 2004</xref>). In the larval zebrafish, crest cells of the first, or mandibular, arch give rise to Meckel's and palatoquadrate cartilages that constitute the lower and upper jaws, respectively. Several cartilages are derived from the second, or hyoid, arch, including the ceratohyal (CH) and hyosymplectic (HS) cartilages that support the jaw. In particular, the HS cartilage serves to connect the upper jaw to the skull by means of a hyomandibula (HM) plate and a symplectic (SY) anterior rod-like extension. In addition, the HM plate supports the overlying opercular apparatus that helps to ventilate the gills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Hughes1">Hughes and Shelton 1958</xref>). The tetrapod stapes is homologous to HM.</p><p>During vertebrate development, cranial neural crest cells delaminate from near the dorsal neural primordium and migrate to ventrolateral positions where they populate a series of pharyngeal arches (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Le1">Le Douarin 1982</xref>). Once the pharyngeal arches are established, skeletal elements develop from cylinders of neural crest whose mesodermal cores undergo stereotypic divisions to form the cranial muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Edgeworth2">Edgeworth 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Schilling2">Schilling and Kimmel 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Kimmel2">Kimmel et al. 2001</xref>). The segmentally organized pharyngeal arches are separated from one another by reiterative outpocketings of the pharyngeal endoderm called pouches. Recent work in chicken has demonstrated an important role for endoderm in patterning cartilages of all the pharyngeal arches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Couly1">Couly et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Ruhin1">Ruhin et al. 2003</xref>). Using grafting and ablation experiments, these researchers divided the pharyngeal endoderm into anterior-posterior (A-P) and mediolateral domains that are required for and have the ability to induce segment-specific pharyngeal cartilages. In zebrafish, experiments have demonstrated a genetic requirement for endoderm in pharyngeal cartilage development. <italic>casanova</italic> mutant embryos make no endoderm and pharyngeal cartilages fail to form, and transplantation experiments show that wild-type endoderm is sufficient to rescue cartilage development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Alexander1">Alexander et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-David1">David et al. 2002</xref>). In addition, a role for pharyngeal pouches in segmentation and survival of cranial neural crest has been shown. In zebrafish <italic>tbx1 (vgo)</italic> mutant embryos, most pouches fail to develop and posterior pharyngeal cartilages are reduced and fused together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Piotrowski1">Piotrowski and Nusslein-Volhard 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Piotrowski2">Piotrowski et al. 2003</xref>). However, though endoderm is clearly critical for pharyngeal cartilage development, it is not well understood how interactions between neural crest&#x02013;derived cells and endoderm produce segment-specific patterns of cartilage.</p><p>In this work, we isolate and characterize a zebrafish <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> loss-of-function mutant. Integrins are a family of heterodimeric receptors, composed of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits, that bind to ligands in the extracellular matrix such as fibronectin and laminin. Integrins have structural roles in adhesion that promote tissue integrity and cell migration, and signaling functions important for cell differentiation and survival (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Bokel1">Bokel and Brown 2002</xref>). Various studies in mouse and chick have shown a role for integrins and their ligands in neural crest migration. Integrins &#x003b1;4, &#x003b1;1, and &#x003b1;V are expressed early in neural crest development, and function-blocking antibodies against these integrins perturb crest migration in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Delannet1">Delannet et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Desban1">Desban and Duband 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Kil1">Kil et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Testaz1">Testaz and Duband 2001</xref>). The in vivo roles of specific integrins in neural crest development are less clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Yang2">Yang et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Gardner1">Gardner et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Bader1">Bader et al. 1998</xref>). Mice lacking Integrin&#x003b1;5, which in complex with primarily &#x003b2;1 forms the major fibronectin receptor, die early during embryogenesis because of mesodermal defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Yang1">Yang et al. 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Yang3">1999</xref>). Analysis of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mouse embryos showed that Integrin&#x003b1;5 is required for the survival of a subset of hyoid crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Goh1">Goh et al. 1997</xref>). However, it was not known where Integrin&#x003b1;5 functions to control hyoid crest development.</p><p>Here we report that, in zebrafish, Integrin&#x003b1;5 functions in the pharyngeal endoderm to control hyoid crest development. In <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos, the first pharyngeal pouch fails to develop, and the lack of a first pouch correlates with reductions in specific regions of the HS cartilage. <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants also have defects in a subset of dorsal first and second arch muscles and facial motor nerve VII, suggesting that Integrin&#x003b1;5 is required for region-specific development of multiple pharyngeal tissues. However, both expression and penetrance data suggest that the muscle and nerve defects are likely secondary to the cartilage and pouch defects. <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> is expressed in pharyngeal endoderm during pouch formation and is required in endoderm for both first pouch and hyoid cartilage development. In order to understand the remarkable specificity of the <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> cartilage phenotype, we fate mapped regions of the HS cartilage in the hyoid arch. We found that the regions of the HS cartilage that are lost in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants develop from anterior crest&#x02013;derived cells immediately adjacent to the first pouch. Analysis of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants suggests that the first endodermal pouch specifies a portion of the hyoid cartilage pattern by locally stabilizing hyoid crest. Lastly, we present a model in which new local interactions of endodermal structures with hyoid crest underlie the elaboration of the jaw support apparatus during the evolution of ray-finned fish.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation of a Mutation in Zebrafish <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic></title><p>In a genetic screen for zebrafish with altered pharyngeal cartilages, we isolated a single recessive mutant allele, <italic>b926,</italic> with specific defects in the hyoid cartilage pattern.

The most frequent phenotype seen in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> animals was a specific loss of the anterior half of the HM plate (anterior HM &#x0005b;aHM&#x0005d;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).

Loss of the first pouch was apparent as early as 24 hours post fertilization (hpf), and similar first pouch reductions were seen in animals injected with <italic>itga5</italic>-MO (data not shown; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020244-t001">Table 1</xref>). Although the majority of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos showed defects restricted to the first pouch, a few <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos had graded reductions of more posterior pouches as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>J; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020244-t001">Table 1</xref>). In order to examine whether the reduced first pouches in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos retained pouch identity, we examined expression of the pharyngeal pouch marker <italic>pea3,</italic> a downstream effector of Fgf signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Roehl1">Roehl and Nusslein-Volhard 2001</xref>). We found that the reduced first pouches of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants still expressed <italic>pea3</italic> at 36 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>L).</p><p>As both the pouch and cartilage phenotypes were incompletely penetrant in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants, often with one side of an embryo showing defects and the other side not, we examined how tightly coupled the phenotypes were in individual sides. In order to visualize early pharyngeal arch structure in live animals, we made use of a <italic>fli1&#x02013;</italic>green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Lawson1">Lawson and Weinstein 2002</xref>). <italic>fli1</italic>-GFP expression initiates in neural crest cells of the pharyngeal arches shortly after crest migration (ca. 18 hpf) and persists as pharyngeal cartilages and bones develop. Pouches are evident as nonexpressing regions between the GFP-labeled crest-derived cells of the arches. We sorted live <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> animals for first pouch defects at 36 hpf and then grew these animals to 4 d to analyze pharyngeal cartilages. Strikingly, we found a strong correlation between reductions of the first pouch and later hyoid cartilage defects in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants. <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> sides that lacked the first pouch early had hyoid cartilage defects 93&#x00025; of the time (<italic>n =</italic> 116), whereas only 7&#x00025; of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> sides with a normal first pouch early developed hyoid cartilage defects (<italic>n =</italic> 108). The correlation was highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).</p><p>We next asked whether Integrin&#x003b1;5 was required for the development of cranial muscles. By 4 d of development, the mesoderm of the first pharyngeal arch has undergone stereotypic subdivisions to form, ventrally, intermandibularis anterior and intermandibularis posterior; medially, adductor mandibulae; and, dorsally, levator arcus palatini and dilatator operculi (do) cranial muscles. Second arch mesoderm gives rise to interhyal and hyohyal muscles, ventrally, and adductor hyomandibulae (ah), adductor operculi (ao), and levator operculi (lo) muscles, dorsally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Edgeworth2">Edgeworth 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Schilling2">Schilling et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>M). In a few <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants, the dorsal first and second arch muscles, do and ah, were selectively reduced, whereas levator arcus palatini, ao, and lo were present but appeared closer together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>N; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020244-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Facial motor neurons send a ventral-directed nerve (VII) that innervates dorsal second arch muscles ah and ao, passes through the foramen of HM, and subsequently branches to innervate ventral muscles interhyal and hyohyal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Higashijima1">Higashijima et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>O). In a small fraction of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants, facial nerve VII failed to branch and/or was hypotrophic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>P). Both nerve and muscle defects were only seen in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants that also displayed cartilage defects. Moreover, the lower penetrance of nerve and muscle defects suggests that they are secondary to endodermal and/or crest defects. In conclusion, we have found a requirement for Integrin&#x003b1;5 in the development of multiple pharyngeal tissues in the vicinity of the first pouch and aHM cartilage region.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title><italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> Is Expressed Dynamically in Pharyngeal Endoderm and Cranial Neural Crest</title><p>In order to understand where Integrin&#x003b1;5 might be acting to control pharyngeal arch development, we examined the expression of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mRNA by in situ hybridization.

Finally, <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> expression was not affected by the <italic>b926</italic> mutation (examined at 12-s; data not shown). In conclusion, <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> expression in the pharyngeal endoderm is in a pattern that both spatially and temporally corresponds to regions of pouch formation, and expression of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> in the crest begins during premigratory stages and later becomes refined to patches of crest derivatives within the pharyngeal arches.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Integrin&#x003b1;5 Is Required in Endoderm but Not Crest for First Pouch and Hyoid Cartilage Development</title><p>As <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> expression was observed in both pharyngeal endoderm and neural crest, we used transplantation experiments to determine in which tissues Integrin&#x003b1;5 was required for first pouch and hyoid cartilage development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Since it is difficult to transplant large amounts of endoderm from normal zebrafish embryos, we used forced expression of the activated Taram-A receptor (TAR&#x0002a;) to generate donor embryos consisting almost entirely of endoderm (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-David1">David et al. &#x0005b;2002&#x0005d;</xref> for details). This method allows the specific and unilateral introduction of large amounts of endoderm into mutant hosts. Transplants were performed at 40&#x00025; epiboly (late blastula; ca. 4 hpf), and the first pouch was scored at 38 hpf in live animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). In wild-type to wild-type control transplants, 8&#x00025; of recipient sides developed first pouch defects, suggesting a low level of toxicity of the TAR&#x0002a; construct. We then transplanted wild-type TAR&#x0002a; endoderm into <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup>; fli1</italic>-GFP hosts. Control mutant sides that did not receive donor endoderm had first pouch defects in 83&#x00025; of cases.

In wild-type to wild-type control transplants, the mutant cartilage index was 0.46, consistent with TAR&#x0002a; causing a low level of defects on its own. The control nonrecipient sides of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup>; fli1</italic>-GFP animals had an index of 2.5.

In contrast, cells contributing to pHM were on average 16 &#x003bc;m, or three cell diameters, away from the first pouch.

Furthermore, transplantation experiments show that wild-type endoderm, but not crest, rescues first pouch and hyoid cartilage development in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants. We infer that Integrin&#x003b1;5 functions in the pharyngeal endoderm for the formation of the first pouch, and that the first pouch, in turn, interacts with postmigratory neural crest to promote cartilage development in a region of the hyoid arch. A role for the first endodermal pouch in promoting regional hyoid cartilage development is consistent with work in chicken showing that domains of pharyngeal endoderm specify region-specific cartilage shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Couly1">Couly et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Ruhin1">Ruhin et al. 2003</xref>). Our data extend these findings, arguing that the formation of the first pouch is a critical step in allowing pharyngeal endoderm to interact with hyoid crest and promote the development of specific cartilage regions, aHM and SY. It will be interesting to see the extent to which the ability of different pharyngeal endoderm domains to induce cartilage elements of specific shapes depends on their ability to form discrete morphological structures such as the first pouch.</p><p>How might the first pouch control development of specific cartilage regions within the hyoid arch? The first pouch forms at a time when hyoid crest cells are migrating to ventrolateral positions to form the hyoid arch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Veitch1">Veitch et al. 1999</xref>; J.G.C. and C.B.K., unpublished data). Upon reaching the developing arch, crest cells become less motile and form tightly packed masses adjacent to the first pouch. Our wild-type fate map shows that the hyoid cartilage regions that are lost in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants, aHM and SY, develop from crest cells immediately adjacent to the first pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). Our time-lapse recordings of wild-type cartilage development show that crest cells that will form aHM remain a tightly packed mass as the aHM region chondrifies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">Figure 8</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">8</xref>C). In contrast, in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants, dorsal anterior hyoid crest cells are aberrantly motile and do not contribute to cartilage, whereas more posterior dorsal hyoid crest cells contribute normally to pHM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">Figure 8</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">8</xref>F). In addition, we observe increased apoptosis in the dorsal, anterior domain of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> hyoid arches from 25 to 35 hpf. Importantly, increased death of postmigratory hyoid crest cells was seen only when the first pouch was reduced.

In contrast to <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, in which an increase in cell death was seen earlier during crest migration, we found no evidence for increased death of migratory crest in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> zebrafish. However, our analysis cannot rule out that increased crest death during migratory stages may contribute to the infrequent, most severe cartilage phenotypes seen in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos. Indeed, given the strong expression of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> in migratory hyoid crest, future studies that further reduce Integrin&#x003b1;5 activity, for example by removing its maternal component, may uncover crest-autonomous functions of zebrafish Integrin&#x003b1;5 in the survival and/or migration of hyoid crest cells.</p><p>Our data show that the first pouch is required for the stabilization and survival of crest cells that will become aHM and SY. Interactions between the first pouch and adjacent hyoid crest could involve direct adhesion and/or diffusible signaling molecules. aHM and SY cartilage regions develop from crest-derived cells immediately adjacent to the first pouch at 24 hpf, whereas the pHM region develops from crest three cell diameters away. The remarkable specificity of the <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> cartilage phenotype suggests that pouch-derived signals act very locally, perhaps through cell&#x02013;cell contract, to promote development of aHM and SY regions. In support of this, explant studies in the newt show that physical contact between pharyngeal endoderm and neural crest cells is necessary to promote the compaction and differentiation of crest into cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Epperlein1">Epperlein and Lehmann 1975</xref>). On the other hand, a signaling role for pharyngeal endoderm in crest survival also has been shown. In zebrafish, Fgf3 produced from the pharyngeal pouches acts as a secreted survival factor for neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-David1">David et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Nissen1">Nissen et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>In addition to promoting stabilization and survival, might endoderm also control local gene expression in hyoid crest? In a small fraction of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos, <italic>gsc</italic> expression domains in the hyoid arches were present but disorganized. However, it is possible that the aberrant <italic>gsc</italic> expression reflects a disorganization of the hyoid arch and not ectopic gene expression.

In addition, <italic>hoxA2</italic> expression was unaffected in the hyoid arches of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos. Thus, although additional markers of hyoid crest need to be examined in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos, we have found no strong evidence for the first pouch controlling gene expression in neighboring crest.

The formation of an iterative series of outpocketings, or pouches, from the pharyngeal endoderm can be thought of as analogous to branching morphogenesis. Integrins have well-documented roles in cell migration that could promote the outgrowth of branches (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Bokel1">Bokel and Brown 2002</xref>). From our unpublished observations in zebrafish, we know that pouches form by the directed lateral migration of pharyngeal endodermal cells (unpublished data). In this work, we find that <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> is expressed transiently in pouch-forming regions of pharyngeal endoderm and is required in endoderm for pouch formation. One possibility is that Integrin&#x003b1;5 adhesion promotes the lateral migration of endodermal cells to form pouches. Alternatively, Integrin&#x003b1;5 may be required for the specification or survival of pharyngeal endoderm that forms pouches. Future time-lapse imaging studies, in which pharyngeal endoderm morphogenesis is analyzed directly in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos, will help to clarify the role of Integrin&#x003b1;5 in pouch formation.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>A Hierarchy of Tissue Interactions Control Regional Development in the Pharyngeal Arches</title><p>The exquisite functionality of the vertebrate jaw and pharynx requires the precise developmental coordination of their component parts. Arch-specific patterns of muscle connect with pharyngeal skeletal elements and are innervated by motor neurons of appropriate axial levels to orchestrate behaviors such as feeding and gill pumping. In <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants, we see specific defects not only in the endodermal pouches and crest-derived cartilages, but also in cranial muscles and their associated motor nerves (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g002">Figure 2</xref>R). Both a dorsal mandibular (do) and a dorsal hyoid (ah) muscle are reduced in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants, and facial nerve VII, which innervates ah and other hyoid muscles, is reduced and/or fails to make a characteristic branch into two main fascicles. However, it is likely that muscle and nerve defects in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants are secondary to pouch and cartilage defects. Whereas <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> is expressed in endoderm and crest during pharyngeal morphogenesis, we were unable to detect <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> expression in cranial mesoderm or hindbrain neurons during axon outgrowth. In addition, muscle and nerve defects in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants were of significantly lower penetrance than the first pouch and hyoid cartilage defects. The low penetrance of the muscle and nerve defects might be explained by the variably expressive loss, in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants, of the pouch- and/or crest-derived signals on which muscle and nerve development depend. Unfortunately, due to the low penetrance of both muscle and nerve defects in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants, we were unable to directly test the tissue autonomy of these defects.</p><p>Our analysis of the <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutant does not distinguish between roles for endoderm and crest in patterning cranial muscle and nerves. The mesodermal cores that give rise to do and ah, the muscles affected in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> animals, lie close to and on opposite sides of the first pouch during pharyngeal arch development. The first endodermal pouch could have an early organizing role for cranial mesoderm. However, increasing evidence suggests that crest has a major role in patterning cranial mesoderm. Analysis of the <italic>chinless</italic> mutation in zebrafish has shown that <italic>chinless</italic> functions nonautonomously within the crest to promote muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Schilling3">Schilling et al. 1996</xref>). In classic experiments in chicken, grafting of mandibular crest into more posterior arches can reprogram both skeletal and muscular fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Noden1">Noden 1983</xref>), though recent work suggests this effect is mediated by an isthmus-organizing activity included in the grafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Trainor1">Trainor et al. 2002</xref>). In the larval zebrafish, do and ah are found in close association with the aHM region that is lost in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants. It is possible that loss of dorsal anterior hyoid crest in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants results in reductions not only of the aHM cartilage region but also of crest-derived signals that support development of do and ah muscles. As has been proposed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Noden1">Noden 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Kontges1">Kontges and Lumsden 1996</xref>), the development of cranial muscles may depend less on their arch origin and more on the crest-derived structures, such as the aHM cartilage region and associated connective tissue, onto which they attach. Likewise, the reduction of facial nerve VII in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants could be due to either reductions in hyoid muscles and their associated survival signals or reductions in nerve outgrowth&#x02013;promoting cues normally produced by the crest and/or endoderm. In conclusion, we see evidence for a local hierarchy of interactions that control the development of a specific region of the head encompassing dorsal hyoid and mandibular elements. At the top of the hierarchy is the endoderm-derived first pouch that promotes the development of a subset of hyoid crest into cartilage; in turn, this subset of hyoid crest may control development of neighboring muscles and, directly or indirectly, their associated nerve.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Mosaic Assembly of Hyoid Cartilage: Implications for Evolution</title><p>The shape of the dorsal hyoid cartilage element has undergone extensive modification during actinopterygian evolution. In sharks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">Figure 8</xref>G) and basal ray-finned fishes such as the bichir, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Polypterus senegalus</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">Figure 8</xref>H), HM is a rod and SY is absent or not well elongated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-De1">De Beer 1937</xref>). In teleosts, highly derived ray-finned fish, the dorsal hyoid cartilage consists of a wider HM plate and a long SY extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020244-g008">Figure 8</xref>I). The elaboration of HM and SY regions before teleosts emerged may have served to more efficiently support the jaw and increase gill pumping. The origin of the HM plate has long been a subject of debate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Allis1">Allis (1915)</xref> proposed that the teleost HM plate consists of two regions that become fused together, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Edgeworth1">Edgeworth (1926)</xref>, based on his staging series of the bowfin <italic>Amia,</italic> a relative of teleosts, concluded that the HM plate develops from a single anterior region that undergoes posterior growth to form a plate. There is ample precedence for differential growth as a mechanism of morphological change. For example, beautiful interspecies mosaic experiments have shown that the difference in beak length between ducks and quails is due to an autonomous growth potential of mandibular crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Schneider1">Schneider and Helms 2003</xref>). However, our data support the composite two-region HM theory of Allis. We see a clear genetic dissociation between the development of aHM and pHM. Whereas aHM is absent in the majority of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants, pHM and the connecting opercle bone are still present even in the most severe class of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mutants. In addition, our fate mapping data show that, although aHM and pHM form a seamless HM plate in the larva, their progenitor cells occupy distinct, albeit contiguous, domains within the hyoid arch at 24 hpf, a result inconsistent with the posterior growth hypothesis of Edgeworth. Thus, aHM and pHM regions develop from spatially distinct domains of crest that depend on different sources of inductive signals.</p><p>Our data show that the first endodermal pouch is required for the development of aHM, yet in mutants that lack all pharyngeal endoderm, such as <italic>casanova,</italic> both aHM and pHM are lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-David1">David et al. 2002</xref>). Thus, other structures of the pharyngeal endoderm besides the first pouch may be required for the development of pHM. One attractive possibility is that, whereas the first pouch induces aHM in the anterior part of the hyoid arch, the second pouch induces pHM in the posterior part of the arch. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Allis1">Allis (1915)</xref> concluded, based on relationships to morphological landmarks, that the rod-shaped HM cartilage in <italic>Polypterus</italic> represents the anterior portion of the teleost HM plate (i.e., aHM). Although more embryological studies of <italic>Polypterus</italic> need to be done, the evolution of the HM plate in ray-finned fishes such as teleosts appears to have involved a new induction event that led to a new region, pHM, being added to an older region, aHM. We propose that the de novo addition of regions to the skeletal pattern represents another mechanism, in addition to differential growth, of generating skeletal diversity during evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Zebrafish strains and mutant screen.</title><p>Zebrafish <italic>(Danio rerio)</italic> raised at 28.5 &#x000b0;C were staged as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Kimmel1">Kimmel et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020244-Westerfield1">Westerfield 1995</xref>).

LG23. Using polymorphism mapping, we placed <italic>b926</italic> between the markers Z5141 (2/362 recombinants/meioses) and Z20494 (3/362 recombinants/meioses). Databases of the partial zebrafish genomic sequence revealed that a homolog of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> mapped to this region.</p><p>(B) Zebrafish Integrin&#x003b1;5 protein is predicted to have seven extracellular beta-propeller repeats (stippled), a transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular cytoplasmic tail. Integrin&#x003b1;5 forms heterodimeric complexes with Integrin &#x003b2; chains, primarily &#x003b2;1, and binds extracellular matrix ligands containing the RGD motif. Sequencing of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;</italic>5 in <italic>b926</italic> revealed a T to A nucleotide substitution at position 952 of the cDNA that converts a tyrosine to an asparagine at amino acid 218, a residue within the third beta-propeller repeat.</p><p>(C) Alignment of the third beta-propeller repeat of the Integrin&#x003b1;5 proteins of zebrafish, human, mouse, <italic>Xenopus,</italic> and <italic>Fugu</italic>. Y218 is absolutely conserved among all five species and is mutated to N in <italic>b926</italic>.</p><p>(D) The genomic locus of <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> consists of 30 exons (not drawn to scale). The <italic>integrin&#x003b1;</italic>5 morpholino, <italic>itga5</italic>-MO, was designed against the exon13-intron splice site (arrow).</p><p>(E) The primers GC145 and GC147 were used to amplify a 497-bp fragment from wild-type cDNA. PCR amplification was then performed using cDNA from 24-hpf embryos that had been injected with 10 ng of <italic>itga5</italic>-MO at the one-cell stage, the same concentration of morpholino used for our phenotypic analysis. The resultant product was 587 bp long, and sequencing confirmed that the increased length was due to the failure to splice out the intron between exons 13 and 14. The left lane of the agarose gel contains standard size markers in basepairs.</p><p>(F) A schematic of the wild-type Integrin&#x003b1;5 protein shows seven extracellular repeats and the transmembrane (TM) domain. Inhibition of splicing by <italic>itga5</italic>-MO would be predicted to result in a nonfunctional protein that is truncated in the seventh repeat of the extracellular domain.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0020244.g001"/></fig><fig id="pbio-0020244-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Region-Specific Pharyngeal Defects in <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5</italic> Mutants</title><p>(A&#x02013;E) Flat mount dissections of hyoid and mandibular cartilages from fixed, 4-d-old wild-type (A), <italic>integrin&#x003b1;5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> (B&#x02013;D), and <italic>itga5</italic>-MO (E) animals.

At the beginning of the recordings (A, G, and M), the mandibular (1) and hyoid (2) arches are numbered and an arrow denotes the first pouch (p1). At the end of the recordings (F, L, and R), the cartilage regions are clearly visible as large cells with thick matrix (pseudocolored blue). The outline of the HS cartilage, a composite of SY and HM regions, is shown in (F) and (L). As a reference, the opercle bone and ao/lo hyoid muscle mass are pseudocolored purple and red, respectively, and the eye and ear are labeled. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sv001">Video S1</xref> (A&#x02013;F), red arrowheads denote a cluster of cells adjacent to the first pouch that undergo cellular rearrangements and form the long, anterior SY extension in wild-type animals.

In wild-type development, hyoid crest cells adjacent to the first pouch remain a tightly packed mass as aHM chondrifies (e.g., cells denoted by red arrowheads in G&#x02032;&#x02013;L&#x02032;).

Hyoid cartilage defects are divided into categories based on the morphology of the HS element: HS rod-shaped with SY extension (&#x0201c;aHM lost&#x0201d;), HS rod-shaped without SY extension (&#x0201c;aHM and SY lost&#x0201d;), and HS rod-shaped and fused to CH (&#x0201c;losses and fusion to CH&#x0201d;).
