AP-1 proteins are composed principally of homodimers of Jun family members (c-Jun, JunB, JunD) or heterodimers of the Jun family members with the Fos family members (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These homodimers or heterodimers bind to specific DNA sequences, known as 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response elements (TRE), in the promoter regions of target genes and activate transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Among them, c-Jun is the major component of the AP-1 complex and c-Fos is its best-known partner. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies have demonstrated that Fos/Jun heterodimers are more stable and efficient in driving transcriptional activation than a Jun/Jun homodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>c-Jun is frequently overexpressed in human cancers. Increased c-Jun transcriptional activity and AP-1 mediated gene expression are correlated with ras-transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Since tumor formation and TPA-induced invasion of malignant epidermal cell lines could be blocked in mice expressing a dominant negative transactivation mutant of c-Jun (TAM67), the role of c-Jun in carcinogenesis has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In liver tumors, c-Jun antagonizes p53 by protecting tumor liver cells from apoptosis. It was further demonstrated that c-Jun deletion led to the accumulation of p53, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and retinoblastoma (Rb), and apoptosis in experimentally induced c-Jun-/- liver tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The role of c-Jun on angiogenesis in rodents was also described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>c-Jun/AP-1 has been linked to invasive properties of aggressive breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

The cells expressing dominant-negative c-Jun fail to invade in response to EGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, the association of c-Jun overexpression with tumor metastasis <italic>in vivo </italic>has not been demonstrated.</p><p>The process of invasion and metastasis depends on the co-ordinate expression and function of a number of gene products conferring the ability of tumor cells to successfully complete a series of events that include breaking away from the primary tumor, invading through basement membrane barriers and the extracellular matrix (ECM) to colonize distant sites in the organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

A clear external image of multiple metastatic lesions of livers was observed in the mice injected with MCF-7/c-Jun cells by gross examination, but no visible metastatic nodules in the livers of mice injected with MCF-7 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The livers from each group were removed and processed for histological examination. Microscopic examination of liver tissue sections revealed a massive infiltration of the liver by MCF-7/c-Jun derived tumor cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), but no liver infiltration by parental cells was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). The tumor morphology was comparable to that observed in sections from subcutaneous tumors. Tumor cells in metastatic foci included a heterogeneous population of cells consisting of tumor epithelial cells, as well as associated endothelial cells and stroma cells. Large metastases showed central necrosis. Lung metastasis was not observed either by gross or by microscopic examination.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of c-Jun overexpression on potential of MCF-7 tumor liver metastases in nude mice</bold>.

A critical role for c-Jun in the migration and invasion characteristics of human breast cancer cell line in <italic>in vitro </italic>experiment has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The contribution of c-Jun to metastatic phenotype in breast cancer cells has also been studied in <italic>in vitro </italic>studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, the role of c-Jun in metastasis of human breast cancer <italic>in vivo </italic>is currently unknown. In the present study, by utilizing MCF-7 cell line as a cell model the effects of c-Jun overexpression were studied in both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments to further investigate the direct involvement of c-Jun in tumorigenesis and metastasis.</p><p>c-Jun acts as a positive regulator of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Our data indicated that ectopic overexpression of c-Jun promoted the growth of MCF-7 cells and led to a significant increase in the percentage of cells in S phase. It is possible that uncontrolled cell proliferation is an important first step in tumorigenesis. Overexpression of c-Jun in transfected MCF-7 cells results in increased motility and invasiveness. Interestingly, introduction of c-Jun gene alone into weakly invasive MCF-7 cells led to the transfected cells capable of metastasizing to the nude mouse liver following tail vein injection. For many years it had been reported that many malignant human tumors did not metastasize in the nude mouse. The production of metastasis mostly depends on the intrinsic tumor cell properties. Our data confirms that overexpression of c-Jun contributes to a more invasive phenotype in MCF-7 cells. This study is the first reported example of c-Jun overexpression inducing liver metastasis of MCF-7 cells in nude mice.</p><p>Progression of breast cancer is often accompanied by changes of gene expression pattern and requires an accumulation of metastasis supporting genetic modifications. AP-1 is thought to play a central role in reprogramming of the gene expression pattern and regulating the expression of genes directly necessary for cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Several AP-1-responsive genes with roles in facilitating the invasion of malignant cells have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The critical target genes activated by c-Jun/AP-1 in metastasis of MCF-7/c-Jun cells remain to be defined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the present study demonstrates an interesting relationship between c-Jun expression and increased property of adhesion, migration and liver metastasis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The results provide further evidence that c-Jun alone affects many aspects of the breast cancer phenotype and is involved in the metastasis of breast cancer. This finding also opens an opportunity for development of anti-c-Jun strategies in breast-cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YZ constructed the expression plasmid, carried out immunohistochemical study, performed statistical analysis and participated in writing the manuscript.
