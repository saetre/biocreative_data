However, despite the complete resection of the primary lesion, and the success of treatments such as the intravesical instillation with bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], 30-50% of patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer experience recurrence within the first year after resection and 15% of these patients manifest worsening of tumor grade and stage. For those reasons, bladder cancers are becoming a serious public health problem and a social and economic burden.</p><p>The oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids are often decorated by sialic acids, a family of nine carbon sugars derived from neuraminic acid. In humans, sialylation of glycoconjugates is mediated by different sialyltransferase enzymes which, depending on their nature, may establish different types of linkages [linkage through an &#x003b1;2-3- or an &#x003b1;2-6-bond to galactose (Gal); through an &#x003b1;2-6-bond to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc); or through an &#x003b1;2-8-bond to another sialic acid, forming polysialic acid] (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). During neoplastic transformation, the activity of sialyltransferases may be altered and, as a consequence, cancer cells express more heavily sialylated glycans at the surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This aberrant sialylation may mediate key pathophysiological events during the various steps of tumor progression, including invasion and metastasis formation. This is due to the fact that sialylated structures can prevent cell-cell interactions through non-specific charge repulsion, but they can be specifically bound by cell adhesion molecules, such as selectins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. On the other hand, the addition of sialic acids may mask the underlying sugar structure, thus avoiding recognition by other specific glycan binding molecules, such as galectins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, specific sialylated structures, aberrantly expressed in carcinomas, have been used as targets for cancer immunotherapy in preclinical and clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The T antigen, or Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen, is a simple glycan, formed by the dissacharide, galactose (Gal) &#x003b2;1-3-linked to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), O-glycosidicaly-linked to serine or threonine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The addition of sialic acid to this core 1 structure, forming the sialyl-T antigen, inhibits any further chain extension (with the exception of the possible addition of another sialic acid to GalNAc). These antigens are largely increased in some types of cancers (colon, prostate, cervix, ovary, breast) and, according to the above mentioned role of sialylation, the sialylated form (sialyl-T) has been associated with worse prognosis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). According to the known specificities, three sialyltransferases, namely ST3Gal.I, ST3Gal.II and ST3Gal.IV can mediate the sialylation of the T antigen and the increase in the expression of these sialyltransferases has been shown to be one of the major mechanisms responsible for the sialylation of T antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. There is growing evidence that these molecules can act as good markers in cancer. In fact, in breast cancer, ST3Gal.I has been found increased compared with normal tissue and its expression is related to the grade of the tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Altered mRNA expressions of these sialyltransferases were also shown to be of importance in malignant epithelial ovarian cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and in colon carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The relevance of sugar structures related with the T antigen in the control of bladder cell proliferation is indicated by the fact that the antiproliferative factor (AFP), a sialoglycopeptide comprised of the sialyl-T trisaccharide linked to a peptide derived from a membrane receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], which is secreted by bladder cells of interstial cystitis patients, exerts a strong inhibitory effect on bladder cell proliferation, both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Nevertheless, in spite of the few studies dealing with the expression of T and sialyl-T antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] or other types of sialylated structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] in bladder cancer and there are no published data about the expression of related sialyltransferases.</p><p>In this study, we attempted to investigate the relevance of the sialyltransferases ST3Gal.I, ST3Gal.II or ST3Gal.IV expression in bladder cancer progression, by comparing their expression in neoplastic tissue, from different grade bladder tumors, with those of normal urothelium. We found that the mRNA levels of <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>were significantly higher in malignant bladder tumors. The analysis of four bladder cancer cell lines showed that this sialyltransferase gives the most relevant contribution for the sialylation of T antigens in bladder cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient and tissue specimens</title><p>This study involves 54 patients [mean age of 65.3 years (range 45 to 80)], who underwent bladder surgery, between July 2005 and July 2007, due to various indications. Matched pairs of histologically verified bladder tumors and normal appearing mucosa remote from the tumor were collected from patients with diagnosed nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (Group I, n = 43) or invasive bladder cancer (Group II, n = 6). Patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) and cancers with low risk for progression and recurrence (primary TaG1 bladder cancers) were excluded from this study. To serve as control, 4 patients with benign tumors (papilloma) were included (Group III). Within the group of patients with nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer, further subgroup was studied: Group IA-patients with no recurrence or progression in a minimum period of 12 months (n = 29) and Group IB-patients with subsequent recurrence or progression in less than 12 months (n = 14). Both subgroups received the same treatment: transurethral resection of the bladder tumors (TURBT) followed by the same dose and schedule of BCG instillations (TICE<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>BCG).

These enzymes are considered as prognostic factors in some cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and recent data has revealed that they are important targets for therapeutic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Investigating the relevance of sialyltransferases in cancer is however a complex task, due the diversity expressed by human cells and for presenting some overlapping substrate specificities, tissue-restricted patterns of expression and individual variations.</p><p>Our aim was to investigate, in bladder cancers, the expression of the sialyltransferases, ST3Gal.I, ST3Gal.II and ST3Gal.IV, which are proposed to have a decisive role in the T antigen sialylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our study with different groups of patients with bladder tumors, demonstrate markedly that the <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>mRNA levels increases during the malignant transformation of urothelium. In fact, malignant bladder tumors show increased <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>mRNA levels when compared with non malignant tumors. Particularly, tumors from patients with nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancers show significant increased <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>mRNA levels compared to normal urothelium and, in patients where cancer penetrates the muscle layer (muscle-invasive), the increased <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>mRNA is also observed in the apparent normal mucosa. This unexpected observation can be explained by at least two non mutually exclusive mechanisms. First, it can be hypothesized that the tumor exerts a kind of "field effect" which through the release of soluble mediators or by other means alters the basic sialyltransferases expression level in normal tissues. Interestingly, this effect is positively related with malignancy, since the level of <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>in urothelium is the lowest in patients bearing non malignant tumors, intermediate in the group with nonmuscle-invasive cancer and highest in patients with invasive cancer. Second (but less likely), it is possible that individuals with a high basic level of <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>in urothelium, are more prone to the development of invasive bladder cancers.</p><p>Interestingly, when further analysing specimens from patients with nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer, subgrouped according to the development of recurrence, we found that tumors of patients who experienced subsequent recurrence showed higher increased expression of <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>and decreased expression of <italic>ST3Gal.II </italic>(Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Therefore, our findings suggest that alterations in <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>and <italic>ST3Gal.II </italic>transcript levels may anticipate recurrence propensity. Nevertheless, since we could not obtain higher number of patients within the defined inclusion criteria, the relevance of these data should be further substantiated. Even so, to our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that, likewise to other cancers types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the bladder cancer tissue also presents a deregulated expression of sialyltransferases.</p><p>Through the study of different bladder cancer cell lines it was possible to establish a functional correlation between ST3Gal.I and the manifestation of sialyl-T antigens at cell surface. Nevertheless, in patient specimens, it was not possible to confirm this correlation. Surprisingly, bladder tumor tissues, independently of their malignancy or grade, show higher PNA reactivity than the corresponding urothelium, suggesting the expression of higher content of non sialylated T antigens. One hypothesis to explain this discrepancy between <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>expression and PNA reactivity is the fact that, in bladder cancer tissue, the ST3Gal.I is acting specifically on a limited number of molecules and any resulting increased content of sialyl-T containing glycans, due to its activity, is not perceptible by the adopted methodology, the dot blot analysis. Another possibility is that in cancer tissues there is a strong expression of T antigen molecules which cannot be fully sialylated neither in the presence of increased ST3Gal.I activity. Thirdly, there may exist translational regulation mechanisms of ST3Gal.I or the competition with other glycosyltransferase, such as core 2 &#x003b2;1-6 GlcNAc transferases, which compete with ST3Gal.I for core 1, generating the core 2 structures instead of sialyl-T antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>For this study, we selected the staining with PNA lectin which recognizes non sialylated T antigens and the expression of sialyl-T antigens is inferred after desialylating the tissue homogenates with neuraminidase treatment. This staining method is largely used for the detection of T and sialyl-T antigens in human normal and malignant tissues because it requires little amount of samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The reactivity of PNA lectin with bladder cancer specimens has been already studied by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], but the conclusions were controversial: while some [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] only observed PNA reactivity after neuraminidase treatment of bladder tumors, others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] observed positive reactivity of PNA lectin in tumors without neuraminidase treatment, which was roughly consistent with the results here presented.</p><p>Interestingly, in a great part of other cancers, where a deregulated sialyltransferase expression is observed, the enzyme/product relationship is not direct (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). Also, the use of cell line experimental models to correlate the overexpression of a given sialyltransferase and cancer-associated phenotypes provide results sometimes conflicting, mostly because of the differences between the glycosidic acceptors of each tumor type and each cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p><italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>gene is known to code for two transcript variants encoding the same protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It was suggested that a longer <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>transcript could play an important role in the translational control of the expression of ST3Gal.I, since its longest 5' untranslated region contains multiple upstream ATG codons and open reading frames ("minicistrons") which could repress translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In this study, we observed that both transcripts were expressed in the majority of all the analyzed samples, both in healthy urothelium and tumor tissue, suggesting that the differential expression of these transcripts is not dictated by the malignant transformation of the cells. Apparently, the two transcripts were expressed in bladder cancer cells expressing different levels of <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>mRNA and having different levels of ST3Gal.I activities. Albeit further functional investigations should be addressed, we suggest that, in bladder cancer, both transcripts have a redundant role and none of them have a particular role in the translational control of the expression of ST3Gal.I.</p><p>While we revised the characteristics of <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>transcripts, two interesting features were observed: 1) the fact that the shorter <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>transcript lacks a sequence within exon 1, at the 5' untranslated region, and 2) the identification of a pseudogene with high homology with <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>cDNA. Similar chromosome insertion of "cDNA" was not found in any other sialyltransferase member and its origin is not explicable by the present genomic paradigms. Probably, some gene transcripts were processed by internal or external reverse transcriptases and inserted in genome during evolution. Nevertheless, it remains to clarify whether this sequence plays any role in regulating <italic>ST3Gal.I </italic>expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Collectively, the data presented in this paper supports the hypothesis that aberrant expression of the sialyltransferases is part of initial oncogenic transformation of bladder. ST3Gal.I plays the major role in the T antigen sialylation, and its expression is associated with bladder cancer malignancy and recurrence. However, further work is required to identify the involved molecular events and assess the ST3Gal.I role, aiming the identification of potential immunotherapeutic targets. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that the sialyltransferase mRNA levels, in patient's bladder tissue, are parameters to be considered when predicting progression and recurrence of cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations used</title><p>FITC: Fluorescein isothiocyanate; Gal: galactose; GalNAc: N-acetylgalactosamine; PNA: peanut agglutinin; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PAV and FD designed the study, interpreted the results and wrote the manuscript.
