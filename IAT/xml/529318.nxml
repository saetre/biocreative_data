In two<italic>-</italic>allele models, alleles conferring mating discrimination spread if they become genetically correlated with alleles reducing hybrid fitness. However, the evolution of such a correlation is opposed by recombination because alleles conferring discrimination in a given species do not confer discrimination in the other species. Consequently, two<italic>-</italic>allele models require either very strong selection, or tight linkage (e.g., physical or via chromosomal rearrangements) between alleles conferring mating discrimination and alleles reducing hybrid fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Kirkpatrick1">Kirkpatrick and Ravign&#x000e9; 2002</xref>). In contrast, one-allele models are not opposed by recombination because alleles conferring mating discrimination reduce hybridization in the genetic background of both species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Kelly1">Kelly and Noor 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Servedio1">Servedio 2000</xref>) and so may be more conducive to reinforcement. Unfortunately, empirical data concerning these two models of speciation are lacking (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-OrtizBarrientos1">Ort&#x000ed;z-Barrientos et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Servedio3">Servedio and Noor 2003</xref>).</p><p>In addition to providing fundamental information for theoretical models, discerning the genetics of reinforcement will also develop our understanding of both the physiological basis of and forces governing changes in female preference. Furthermore, because the strengthening of female preference is driven by natural selection, the genetics of reinforcement will provide unique insights into the genetics of adaptation, another unsettled issue in evolutionary biology. Finally, high-resolution genetic studies of reinforcement can identify candidate speciation genes with effects on mating discrimination, information almost nonexistent in speciation studies (but see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Ritchie1">Ritchie and Noor 2004</xref>). Here, we address these many fundamental issues in speciation by examining a case of reinforcement in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and present for the first time a high-resolution genetic study of variation within species in female mating discrimination, including a set of candidate reinforcement genes and a discussion of the evolutionary implications of our findings.</p><p>The North American fruitflies <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila pseudoobscura</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> hybridize in nature and produce sterile male hybrids. While <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> occurs alone in non-coastal western United States and Central America, the two species co-occur in California and the Pacific Northwest. Males court females from both species indiscriminately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Noor2">Noor 1996</xref>), but females mate preferentially with individuals from the same species. The strength of this discrimination is not homogeneous across the species' geographic range: in a previous study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Noor1">Noor (1995)</xref> showed that <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> females derived from populations where <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> was absent exhibited weak mating discrimination (hereafter, &#x0201c;basal mating discrimination&#x0201d;) while females derived from populations where <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> is present exhibited strong mating discrimination (hereafter &#x0201c;reinforced mating discrimination&#x0201d;). This difference in mating discrimination is likely the evolutionary consequence of maladaptive hybridization where the two species coexist: reinforcement has strengthened mating discrimination in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> populations co-occurring with <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content>. These observations and the recent completion of the genome sequence of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> (BCM-HGSC 2004) make these species an ideal system to genetically dissect the enhancement of mating discrimination in sympatry.</p><p>Although the genetics of reinforcement has not been studied in <italic>D. pseudoobscura,</italic> or in any system, the genetic basis of other traits contributing to the species' reproductive isolation (i.e., hybrid sterility and basal mating discrimination) is known in detail. All traits contributing to reproductive isolation between <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> and <italic>D. persimilis,</italic> including traits for basal discrimination, map primarily or exclusively to regions bearing fixed chromosomal inversion differences between the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Noor5">Noor et al. 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Noor6">2001b</xref>). This result is consistent with a two<italic>-</italic>allele model of speciation in which the reduction in recombination between alleles for hybrid unfitness (i.e., hybrid sterility) and mating discrimination creates the necessary genetic correlations to advance divergence in the presence of gene flow. However, we do not know whether the genetic basis of reinforced mating discrimination corresponds to this picture, and specifically, whether chromosomal inversions are fundamental to this process. Comparing these genetic architectures will provide the most comprehensive view yet on the genetics of mating discrimination contributing to the formation of new species in the face of interspecies gene flow.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Female Discrimination Is Dominant and Reinforced in Sympatry</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020416-t001">Table 1</xref> shows that <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> females derived from sympatry (with <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content>) exhibited stronger mating discrimination against <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> males than did <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> females derived from allopatry.

Finally, we investigated the mode of inheritance of the phenotype and observed that F<sub>1</sub> females from crosses between sympatric and allopatric flies discriminated as strongly as their sympatric parent, suggesting that reinforced female mating discrimination is inherited as a dominant trait in both inbred and outbred lines (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020416-t001">Table 1</xref>). This F<sub>1</sub> female mating discrimination is restricted to pairings with <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> males, as F<sub>1</sub> females mate readily with conspecifics (data not shown).

In contrast, the second chromosome shows the opposite relationship between the two backcrosses. The third chromosome shows marked effects on reinforced mating discrimination in both backcrosses, although at this level of resolution, it is impossible to tell whether this chromosome carries the same alleles in both sympatric populations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020416-g002">Figure 2</xref>C shows the genome composition of backcross females between Flagstaff, Arizona (allopatric), and Mather, California (sympatric), and their respective frequency of matings with <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> males.

Our initial single-marker analyses revealed significant associations between reinforced mating discrimination and three regions defined by markers located on the right and left arms of the X chromosome (XR and XL, respectively) (XR marker X021, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 1,129; XL marker X002, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 1,293) and the fourth chromosome (4034 marker, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001, <italic>n =</italic> 1,434). We were not able to detect an effect of any single region on the third chromosome even though nine markers were surveyed. Effects identified on XR and Chromosome 4 reinforced mating discrimination when the sympatric allele was present (positive), while the effect from XL was negative. After our initial scan, we used composite interval mapping (CIM) to account for any inflated estimates in the absence of background correction. In addition, several markers were genotyped around the X021 and 4034 regions with the goal of refining the segments containing the quantitative trait loci (QTLs). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020416-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows the major results from CIM, and confirms our previous observations: one major QTL was identified on XR around X021, and a suggestive one close to the telomere of XL. In addition, one major QTL was found on the fourth chromosome. These results validate our previous findings using male-parent backcross females and provide a high-resolution definition of regions contributing to reinforced mating discrimination.</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>X chromosome: Candidate genes <italic>Coy-1</italic> and<italic>Coy-3</italic></title><p>A more careful examination of the X021 region showed that the QTL location (CIM LOD score &#x0003d; 5. 16), hereafter referred to as <italic>Coy-1,</italic> is estimated to lie between two additional markers, X021-A1 and X021-A4 (these markers are physically separated by 390 kb and by a recombination fraction of 4.5 centi-Morgans &#x0005b;cM&#x0005d;). According to the recently obtained genome sequence of <italic>D. pseudoobscura,</italic> there are seven genes between these two markers, one of which, <italic>bru-3,</italic> accounts for one-third of the sequence length of this region. In addition, CIM also identified another QTL, hereafter referred to as <italic>Coy-3,</italic> located between markers X021 and X021-B2, although with a weaker effect (CIM LOD score &#x0003d; 2. 84). There are approximately 200 kb and 30 genes between these markers and a recombination fraction of 3.5 cM. Finally, a third QTL was found near the XL telomere and, in contrast to the X021 region, showed a negative and weak additive effect (CIM LOD score &#x0003d; 2. 45). We tested this model for the X chromosome using multiple interval mapping and found that the strongest support is for <italic>Coy-1,</italic> followed by <italic>Coy-3.</italic> We were unable to recover any support for the QTL on XL. No epistatic interactions were detected among any QTLs.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Chromosome 4: Candidate genes<italic>Coy-2</italic> and<italic>Coy4</italic></title><p>Dissection of the 4034 region using CIM split the effect into two QTLs for reinforced mating discrimination; we refer to them as <italic>Coy-2</italic> and <italic>Coy-4,</italic> respectively. These QTLs show the strongest effects (CIM LOD scores of 7.7 and 7, respectively). As with <italic>Coy-1</italic> and <italic>Coy-3,</italic> these QTL are additive and contribute positively to the degree of mating discrimination of F<sub>2</sub> females. <italic>Coy-2</italic> is located next to marker 4034-A8. This marker is within a 300-kb region homologous to a <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> region containing a p-element insertion disrupting normal olfactory behavior (see Discussion for details) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Anholt1">Anholt et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Anholt2">2003</xref>). The <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> region contains 30 genes of which at least ten have known or predicted olfactory functions. The primary candidate gene for the disrupted olfactory behavior in the p-element mutant is <italic>CG13982</italic>.

CIM places the QTL between 4003 and 4034, an approximately 200-kb region containing only nine genes. Five of these nine genes are a conglomerate of UDP-glycosyltransferases, genes preferentially expressed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> antenna and coding for biotransformation enzymes involved in detoxification and olfaction (Wang et al. 2003). However, a more careful examination of the genes shows that their sequence overlap results from the inability of BLAST homology searches to distinguish the members of this gene family, suggesting that there may be only one or few UDP-glycosyltransferase genes here. Consequently, the number of candidate genes in the region may be reduced from nine to five genes, at least one of which is involved in olfaction. As before, we tested this model using multiple interval mapping and recovered significant support for <italic>Coy-2</italic> under stringent conditions and no evidence of significant epistasis among previously identified QTLs.</p><p>Based on these results and those for the X chromosome, we suggest that the strongest evidence for QTLs contributing to reinforced discrimination in sympatry lies with <italic>Coy-1</italic> and <italic>Coy-2,</italic> and that <italic>Coy-3</italic> and <italic>Coy-4</italic> are suggestive QTLs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have provided the first genetic dissection of an adaptive female preference involved in speciation by developing a QTL map for discrimination variation in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila pseudoobscura</named-content>. The resolution of our approach is novel to genetic studies of behavioral discrimination in that we have surveyed the genome with 70 microsatellite markers for chromosomal regions contributing to increased mating discrimination and have narrowed some of these regions to intervals containing as few as five genes. The role of these genes in reinforcing mating discrimination is supported by indirect evidence from <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> mutants: two of the major QTLs identified in our mapping experiments bear genes identified in smell impairment screenings of p-element mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Anholt2">Anholt et al. 2003</xref>).

Furthermore, we have shown that the chromosomal contributions to reinforced mating discrimination vary among strains of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content>.

This result suggests that the regions we localized as contributing to reinforced mating discrimination (on XR and Chromosome 4) are distinct from those previously identified as contributing to basal discrimination. Hence, chromosomal inversions may have been crucial in allowing these species to persist in sympatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Noor5">Noor et al. 2001a</xref>), but the rearranged regions might not have contributed directly to the subsequent reinforcement of mating discrimination. This idea is consistent with data showing that a region <italic>(DPS4003)</italic> just 400 kb away from the QTL identified on the fourth chromosome seems to have introgressed recently between <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Machado1">Machado et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>This result supports either a one-allele mechanism, perhaps controlling the genetics of variation within species for female mating discrimination if there was not strong assortative mating before sympatry, or possibly a two-allele mechanism, if reinforcement took place after sympatry and strong assortment had already evolved. The definitive test will be to determine whether introgressing the different <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> alleles into <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> affects female discrimination in the same manner.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Female Mating Discrimination Is a Composite Trait</title><p>These &#x0201c;layers&#x0201d; of female discrimination (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020416-g004">Figure 4</xref>) are intimately related to the genetic differences being evaluated. Genes localized within fixed chromosomal regions inverted between <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> are responsible for the first layer, basal discrimination. In contrast, the second layer, reinforced mating discrimination, is caused by genes localized outside those inverted regions. Basal discrimination appears to stem mostly from female responses to acoustic &#x0201c;courtship song&#x0201d; signal differences between <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content>. This is suggested by both a strong correlation in mating success of backcross hybrids with song parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Williams1">Williams et al. 2001</xref>) and in playback experiments with wingless flies (M. Lineham, M. A. F. Noor, and M. Ritchie, unpublished data). Even though we cannot discard fine-tuning of the acoustic receiver signaling system in sympatric females, the nature of the candidate genes we identified suggests that olfactory responses might play a major role in the second layer of female preference. Non-auditory cues conferring reinforced discrimination are also suggested by behavioral data collected by Mark Lineham and Michael Ritchie (personal communication) showing that the rejection exercised by <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> females towards <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> male song is the same in lines derived from sympatry and allopatry, even though females from the two regions clearly show differences in mating discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Noor1">Noor 1995</xref>; this study). Finding different genetic architectures for traits involved in speciation is expected under models based on selection on many traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Rice1">Rice and Hostert 1993</xref>). These traits may be a composite response of behavioral traits, as exemplified in this study, or ecology and behavior, as evidenced by Timema walking sticks, in which traits conferring ecological adaptation and traits contributing to mating discrimination act in conjunction to increase the overall level of sexual isolation between hybridizing populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Nosil1">Nosil et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest, albeit not conclusively, that reinforced mating discrimination is related to differences in response to olfactory cues. We have shown here that candidate regions on the fourth chromosome bear an unusual excess of olfactory genes, and some of these have been associated with specific olfactory responses in other <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Further, the fact that we mapped reinforced discrimination to two interacting gene regions involved in olfaction (bearing <italic>bru-</italic>3 and <italic>CG13982</italic>) was striking in this regard, supporting a potential role of olfactory response in reinforcement in these species.</p><p>We also observed differences among strains in the genetic architecture of reinforced mating discrimination. Such variation in genetic control may be common when populations exchanging genes differ in phenotype because of selection. Multiple alleles from different loci may have increased in frequency because of selection for discrimination, and these alleles sometimes spread into allopatry or are replaced by the allopatric alleles in sympatry. When sampling from single lines, we capture only a fraction of the genetic variation in mating discrimination, and sometimes a high-discrimination allele is even sampled from allopatry (as we observed in the QTL on XL). This observation should be typical in many QTL mapping studies that utilize strains within species with extensive gene flow among populations, as in the many studies of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> variation.</p><p>In brief, these results show that basal and reinforced discrimination are different, species discrimination in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> is a composite trait, and there is genetic variation within species in reinforced mating discrimination.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Reinforced Mating Discrimination Is Inherited As a Dominant Trait</title><p>Recessive adaptive mutations are often lost before selection can screen their effects on the phenotype. Conversely, adaptive mutations that are visible to selection in a heterozygous state will be available for selection even at very low frequencies. Therefore, we expect that most adaptive mutations reaching high frequencies in a population are dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Haldane1">Haldane 1924</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Orr1">Orr and Betancourt 2001</xref>). This process is commonly referred to as Haldane's sieve and predicts that alleles for mating discrimination that increase in frequency in response to selection should be dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Orr1">Orr and Betancourt 2001</xref>). Our study shows that F<sub>1</sub> female offspring of crosses between allopatric and sympatric populations of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> are as reluctant to mate with <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> males as are <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> females from sympatric populations. This result implies that high discrimination can be expressed in heterozygous individuals, suggesting a dominant basis for the phenotype. In contrast, &#x0201c;basal&#x0201d; female mating discrimination seems to be a recessive trait (F<sub>1</sub> female hybrids from crosses between allopatric <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> individuals and <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> do not discriminate against <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> males &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Noor5">Noor et al. 2001a</xref>&#x0005d;). Taken together, these results are consistent with genetic differences between basal and reinforced female mating discrimination and with general predictions from Haldane's sieve theory.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first study to provide a detailed description of the genetic basis of speciation by reinforcement. We conclude that, in <italic>D. pseudoobscura,</italic> (1) high discrimination in sympatry is inherited in a dominant fashion, (2) there is within-species variability for high female mating discrimination as evidenced by the different genetic architectures recovered in the male-parent backcross experiments, (3) there are multiple genes, possibly involved in olfaction, contributing to enhanced female mating discrimination, (4) some candidate genes for reinforcement identified here have been previously identified in p-element mutant screenings for smell impairment in <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> (5) the genetic architecture of basal female mating discrimination is different from that of reinforced mating discrimination, and (6) inversions seem to play no direct role in creating or maintaining the genetic differences directly responsible for increased female mating discrimination in sympatry. However, these inversions seem to play a crucial role, as evidenced by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Noor5">Noor et al. 2001a</xref>), in maintaining the identity of hybridizing species and thus providing time for selection to reinforce their sexual isolation. These results have broad evolutionary implications, as discussed above, and open exciting new avenues of research to understand the genetics of an adaptive behavioral trait involved in speciation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><p>Our approach is based on measuring in one species the effects of substituting chromosomal segments from a highly discriminant genome into a less discriminant genome.

St. Helena, California. <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> flies were collected from Mather, California (1997), Mt. St. Helena, California (1997), Flagstaff, Arizona (1993 and 1997), and Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado (2001). Isofemale lines were established by rearing the offspring of individual females previously mated in the wild. All lines were maintained under a constant regime of temperature (20 &#x000b0;C) and humidity (85&#x00025;) in diurnal/nocturnal cycles of 12 h and reared on a mixture of agar, dextrose, and yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>Reinforced mating discrimination in sympatry</title><p>Pairs of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> isofemale lines from each of two populations were crossed: Mather (1997) 52 &#x000d7; 10 (California, sympatric with <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content>) and Flagstaff (1997) 16 &#x000d7; 17 (Arizona, allopatric to <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content>), respectively. Virgin F<sub>1</sub> females from these crosses as well as <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> males were routinely collected during afternoons and confined for 8 d. On the morning of the eighth day, individual females were confined with individual <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> males. The rationale of this no-choice design is based on behavioral observations suggesting that females tend to copulate more often in the presence of single males than when multiple males approach them (Noor, unpublished data). Therefore, no-choice experiments should provide a more conducive setting for mating. The flies were observed for 10 min. If the male attempted fewer than three copulations, the pair was not scored, and the data were discarded. Otherwise, the pair was scored for successful copulation versus not (the male must have been on the back of the female for at least 1 min&#x02014;the average copulation duration in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> is 3 min). These protocols are the same used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020416-Noor5">Noor et al. (2001a)</xref>.

Comparisons between allopatric and sympatric populations were performed both for outbred lines and inbred lines and only between lines that were tested for the phenotype at the same time, thus controlling for environmental error. Our comparisons between the two allopatric lines and between the two sympatric lines were not temporally controlled, and therefore may have been subject to some environmental heterogeneity. We used pairs of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> inbred lines that significantly differed in their degree of female mating discrimination against <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> in our mapping experiments (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s4a3"><title>The heritable basis of increased mating discrimination in sympatry</title><p>We measured the frequency of matings with <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. persimilis</named-content> males of F<sub>1</sub> females resulting from crosses between sympatric and allopatric <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. pseudoobscura</named-content> lines. If F<sub>1</sub> females discriminated as strongly as the parent derived from sympatry, then we concluded that higher (reinforced) mating discrimination was inherited as a dominant trait.
