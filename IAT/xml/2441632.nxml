Interestingly, DmTAF3 can also interact with human p53, and mammalian TAF3 can bind to both Dmp53 and human p53. This evolutionarily conserved interaction is functionally significant, since elevated TAF3 expression severely and selectively inhibits transcription activation by p53 in human cell lines, and it decreases the level of the p53 protein as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We identified TAF3 as an evolutionarily conserved negative regulator of p53 transcription activation function.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The p53 tumour suppressor protein orchestrates cellular response to genotoxic stress such as DNA damage, activated oncogenes and other metabolic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In unstressed cells, p53 is kept at a low level through the action of various ubiquitin ligases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], while cellular stress results in the stabilization of p53 and its activation as a transcription factor. Although activated p53 is able to induce cell death via transcription-independent ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], importantly, it influences the transcription of a large number of genes, that in turn promote cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The multiple mechanisms that stabilize and activate p53 include post-translational modifications and interactions with different co-factors. For example, upon DNA damage resulting from ionizing radiation p53 is phosphorylated by ATM/ATR and Chk1/Chk2 kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Activation of p53 upon UV radiation is less well understood, among other mechanisms, it may involve p33ING2 that increases the transcriptional-transactivation activity of p53 by enhancing its acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Interestingly, p33ING2 is a plant homeodomain (PHD) containing protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In vertebrates, the p53 gene has two other homologs, p63 and p73. Both of them express several isoforms through alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing, thereby generating a multitude of p53-related proteins that participate in the regulation of p53 transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The only <italic>Drosophila </italic>homolog of p53, Dmp53, shares limited conservation with mammalian p53 at the sequence level, yet the two proteins are similar in domain structure and their residues critical for DNA binding are well preserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Importantly, Dmp53 is able to bind to human p53 recognition sites and activate transcription through these sites. <italic>Dmp53 </italic>null mutant flies are viable under normal circumstances, however, they show genomic instability and sensitivity to ionizing and UV radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Overexpression of wild type p53 or Dmp53 in flies induces cell death, while expression of dominant negative Dmp53 inhibits apoptosis induced by genotoxic stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In response to DNA damage, Dmp53 induces DNA repair or programmed cell death by activating the expression of its target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Activation of Dmp53 apparently does not involve stabilization of the protein, but similarly to its human counterpart, Dmp53 is phosphorylated by Chk2 and this modification is necessary for the induction of Dmp53 dependent apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Activation domains of various transcription factors are able to interact directly with TATA binding protein (TBP) associated factors (TAFs), thus TAFs are thought to serve as bridging factors between sequence-specific transcription factors and the basal transcriptional machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The p53 protein has also been found to interact with several components of the TFIID complex. The N-terminal transcriptional activation domain of p53 binds to TAF1, TAF6 and TAF9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. While binding of TAF9 results in stabilization and activation of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], TAF1 phosphorylates p53 and promotes its degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. These interactions are evolutionarily conserved, since <italic>Drosophila </italic>TAFs and TBP can functionally interact with human p53 in heterolog systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>DmTAF3/BIP2 (Bric-&#x000e0;-brac Interacting Protein 2) was first identified in a yeast two hybrid screen as an interacting partner of BAB1 and BAB2 (Bric &#x000e0; brac 1 and 2) <italic>Drosophila </italic>transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Also, both <italic>Drosophila </italic>and mammalian TAF3 were found to be subunits of the respective TFIID complexes and dimerization partners for TAF10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Interestingly, TAF3 is also a PHD containing protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Developmental regulation of TAF3 expression has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and it has been recently shown that differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes involves the replacement of a canonical TFIID complex by a TRF3(TBP2)-TAF3 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This previously unrecognized switching of the core promoter recognition complexes during differentiation may allow cells to selectively turn on a cell type-specific transcription program.</p><p>In search for interacting partners of Dmp53, we identified <italic>Drosophila </italic>BIP2/DmTAF3. Unlike the previously identified p53-interacting TAFs, DmTAF3 interacts with the C terminus of Dmp53. The interaction is evolutionarily conserved, since we show that mammalian TAF3 can bind to both Dmp53 and human p53. Overexpression of TAF3 severely inhibits transcription activation by p53 in human cell lines and TAF3 decreases the level of the p53 protein as well. Thus, we identified TAF3 as an evolutionarily conserved novel regulator of p53 transcription activation function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Dmp53 interacts with BIP2/DmTAF3</title><p>In order to identify Dmp53-interacting partners, we screened <italic>Drosophila </italic>embryonic cDNA library with the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) method using Dmp53 fused to lexA DNA binding domain (DBD) as bait. Since Dmp53 contains a transcription activation domain at its N terminus, to avoid false activation, we used an N-terminally truncated version of Dmp53. Two of the identified positive clones contained partial cDNAs of the <italic>Bric-&#x000e0;-Brac interacting protein </italic>gene (<italic>bip2</italic>/CG2009), that encodes for a TBP-associated factor also called DmTAF3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A 1236 bp long clone (clone 5) encodes amino acids 514 to 924, while an 972 bp long clone (clone11) encodes amino acids 738 to 1061 of DmTAF3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) indicating that amino acids 738&#x02013;924 are responsible for the interaction with Dmp53.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Dmp53 interacts with DmTAF3</bold>.

Interacting proteins result in complementation of His-auxotrophy and induction of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity, which was detected by filter assay. Negative control was DBD-ADA2A with the same DmTAF3 clone. Positive control was DBD-rpb4 with AD-rpb7. The p53&#x00394;N-DmTAF3 interaction was examined on a separate filter with the same positive and negative controls, and the image was fitted into the figure.

Glutathione-agarose bead bound proteins were eluted, electrophoretically separated and detected by autoradiography (lane3 and 4).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-9-57-1"/></fig><p>To determine which region of Dmp53 is necessary for the binding to DmTAF3, we tested various segments of Dmp53 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) for interaction with one of the identified DmTAF3 clones (clone 5, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) in Y2H experiments. The DNA binding domain of Dmp53 showed weak interaction, and the C terminal part of Dmp53 showed strong interaction with DmTAF3 in the Y2H assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In contrast, no interaction was observed between DmTAF3 and <italic>Drosophila </italic>ADA2A, a transcriptional co-activator/adaptor, indicating that the interaction between Dmp53 and DmTAF3 is specific. We tried to delineate the C-terminal binding region of Dmp53, and we found that the oligomerization domain alone interacted strongly, and also the basic regulatory domain alone interacted weakly with DmTAF3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). These data suggest that DmTAF3 interacts with Dmp53 at multiple binding sites.</p><p>To test whether the interaction between DmTAF3 and Dmp53 is direct, we performed an <italic>in vitro </italic>binding assay. We produced the polypeptide corresponding to amino acids 514 to 924 of DmTAF3 using rabbit reticulocyte <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription-translation system and bacterially expressed and purified GST-tagged Dmp53C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> lane 2). The identified portion of DmTAF3 bound to GST-Dmp53C, but not to GST (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that the interaction is specific and direct.</p></sec><sec><title>The interaction between TAF3 and p53 is evolutionarily conserved</title><p>Despite the low sequence similarity between Dmp53 and human p53, human p53 has been observed before to interact with <italic>Drosophila </italic>TBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and other <italic>Drosophila </italic>proteins that are also binding partners of Dmp53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Therefore, we were interested in whether DmTAF3 is able to interact with human p53. Since human p53 also contains transcription activation domain at its N-terminal region, to avoid false positives, we used N-terminally deleted p53 in Y2H assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We detected strong interaction between DmTAF3 and human p53 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). This result suggests that the amino acids responsible for interaction with DmTAF3 are conserved in human p53.</p><p>Next we tested whether the mammalian homolog of DmTAF3 would interact <italic>in vitro </italic>with p53 as well. To this end we expressed full length murine TAF3 (mTAF3) in Sf9 insect cells and produced GST, GST-Dmp53C or GST-p53 in bacteria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In these GST-pull-down assays mTAF3 bound to GST-Dmp53C and GST-p53 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> lanes 3&#x02013;6). Note however, that mTAF3 showed a weak binding to GST alone under 200 mM salt washing conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> lane 1), but it bound specifically to GST-Dmp53C and GST-p53 at higher salt concentration (400 mM) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> lanes 4, 6) where it did not bind to the GST control any more (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> lane 2). These data indicate that mTAF3 specifically interacts with p53, and also, although less strongly, with Dmp53 suggesting that the TAF3-p53 interaction is evolutionarily conserved.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>binding of mTAF3 to Dmp53 and p53</bold>.

In another control experiment, where we added p53 and luciferase proteins together to the cell extract containing overexpressed mTAF3, anti-TAF3 antibody co-immunoprecipitated p53 but not luciferase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> lane 4). Furthermore, when we added p53 to cell extract containing no mTAF3, p53 did not precipitate with the anti-TAF3 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> lanes 6 and 8). These data confirm a specific interaction between p53 and mTAF3.</p><p>Next we investigated, whether the p53-TAF3 interaction occurs in human cells as well. To this end, we co-transfected plasmids expressing mTAF3 and p53 into 293T cells, then we immunoprecipitated TAF3-containing complexes with an anti-TAF3 antibody, and detected p53 by Western blotting. Under these conditions, a small amount of the overexpressed p53 co-precipitated with mTAF3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> lane 3). In the control experiment, when we co-transfected p53 with an empty vector, no p53 precipitated with the anti-TAF3 antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref> lane 4), indicating the specificity of the TAF3 antibody. These data together demonstrate that p53 protein can interact with TAF3 in cells.</p></sec><sec><title>TAF3 inhibits the transcription activation function of p53</title><p>To determine the functional significance of the binding of TAF3 to p53, we studied the effect of TAF3 overexpression on the transactivation activity of p53. When we transfected U2OS cells, which express wild type level of p53, with a luciferase reporter construct containing the p53-responsive element from the human <italic>mdm2 </italic>gene, we detected high luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, bar 0). When we co-transfected increasing amounts of a plasmid overexpressing mTAF3, we observed a dramatic (up to 100 fold) reduction in luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), indicating that TAF3 severely inhibits transcription activation by p53. To exclude that this phenomenon is cell type specific, we co-transfected HeLa cells with the same luciferase reporter as before together with a plasmid overexpressing p53 (since HeLa cells contain only very limited amount of p53) and a plasmid overexpressing mTAF3. Overexpression of TAF3 inhibited transactivation by overexpressed p53 in HeLa cells as well (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Note however, that the effects observed by using overexpressed p53 were less dramatic, as we saw only a 45% reduction in reporter activity (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). We wanted to further determine if the effect of TAF3 on transcription is specific to p53 or if it is a general inhibition of transcription. When we co-transfected a luciferase reporter driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter with increasing amounts of mTAF3, we found that TAF3 had no effect on promoter activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

We cloned the human TAF3 lacking the PHD domain (designated hTAF3&#x00394;C) from HeLa cDNA library. In co-transfection experiments, hTAF3&#x00394;C inhibited transactivation by p53 in HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The degree of inhibition using hTAF3&#x00394;C or full length mTAF3 was comparable (40% inhibition of transcription using 1 microgram of hTAF3&#x00394;C versus 30% inhibition using 1 microgram of full length mTAF3, compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that the PHD domain of TAF3 is not essential for its role as a negative regulator of p53 transcriptional activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of TAF3 decreases the p53 protein level but has no effect on the p53 mRNA level</title><p>To further investigate the mechanism of inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity, we wanted to determine if TAF3 has an effect on the level of p53 protein. Transfection of increasing amounts of TAF3 into U2OS cells resulted in reduced level of endogenous p53, but no change in the level of endogenous &#x003b2;-actin was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). To exclude the cell type specificity of this phenomenon, we co-transfected p53 and GFP with or without TAF3 into HeLa cells. Here too, we saw down-regulation of p53, but not GFP, protein levels upon overexpression of TAF3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), indicating that TAF3 decreases the p53 protein level. In HeLa cells the decrease in the level of p53 was comparable to the inhibition in the transcriptional activity of p53, however, in U2OS cells the reduction in the level of the p53 protein was not as dramatic as the reduction in the transcriptional activity of p53 (compare Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) suggesting that down-regulation of p53 protein level may not solely be responsible for decreased transcriptional activity of p53.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of TAF3 decreases the level of p53 protein but not p53 mRNA</bold>.

We found no effect of TAF3 overexpression on the level of p53 mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) suggesting that TAF3 does not influence the mRNA expression of p53, but rather affects the protein expression or turnover of p53. Thus, we conclude that TAF3 may inhibit transcription activation function of p53 partly by reducing the level of p53 protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>BIP2/DmTAF3 was first identified in a yeast two hybrid screen as an interacting partner of BAB1 and BAB2 (Bric &#x000e0; brac 1 and 2) developmentally regulated transcription factors, which are involved in pattern formation and morphogenesis in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The BTB/POZ domains of BAB1 and BAB2 were shown to mediate the direct interaction with BIP2/TAF3, and amino acids 859 to 1091 in the middle part of BIP2/DmTAF3 were responsible for the binding to BAB1/2. Whether the interaction between BAB1/2 and BIP2/DmTAF3 mediates transcriptional activation or repression has not been determined.</p><p>BIP2/DmTAF3 was also identified as TAF<sub>II</sub>155, the <italic>Drosophila </italic>homolog of yeast TAF3, formerly called yTAF<sub>II</sub>47 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. DmTAF3 was shown to heterodimerize with DmTAF10 and to be a component of the general transcription factor TFIID. DmTAF3 localizes to puffs and interbands on polytene chromosomes, which correspond to transcriptionally active chromatin. The mammalian homolog of DmTAF3 was designated TAF<sub>II</sub>140 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and later called TAF3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Human TAF3 was also shown to bind to TAF10 through its histone fold domain and to be a component of both TFIID and TFTC. TAF10 relies on TAF3, among other TAFs, for its nuclear import [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>TAF3 expression is developmentally regulated, as it is strongly expressed in early spermatocytes, but it is downregulated in haploid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes involves the disruption of a "normal" TFIID complex and its replacement by a not yet well characterized TRF3(TBP2)-TAF3 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The switching of core promoter recognition complexes during differentiation provides cells to selectively turn on one transcription program, while silencing many others, and thus it may represent a general mechanism for regulating cell type-specific terminal differentiation.</p><p>Here we identified TAF3 (<italic>Drosophila </italic>and mammalian) as an interacting partner of p53. The central region, amino acids 738 to 924 of DmTAF3 mediates the interaction with p53 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), a region distinct from the proposed A/T hook domain (amino acids 574&#x02013;586). Interestingly, several researchers have recently identified the same central region of DmTAF3 to interact with various transcription factors, such as GAGA factor (amino acids 612&#x02013;1073) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], Antennapedia (amino acids 853&#x02013;1088) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and BAB1/2 (amino acids 859 to 1091) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Although this central region of DmTAF3 shows low degree of similarity to the corresponding core region of mammalian TAF3 (amino acids 497 to 608 of murine TAF3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], we propose that it may serve as a transcription factor-binding domain responsible for interaction with other, yet unidentified transcription factors as well. We think that the TAF3-p53 interaction is direct and does not involve previously characterized p53 interacting components of TFIID, since we detected <italic>in vitro </italic>binding between bacterially expressed Dmp53 and <italic>in vitro </italic>translated portion of DmTAF3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The interaction is evolutionarily conserved, since DmTAF3 can also interact with human p53 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), as well as mammalian TAF3 can bind to both Dmp53 and human p53 in heterologous systems (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Importantly, unlike previously identified TAFs that interact with the N terminal transcription activation domain of p53 and mediate transcription activation, TAF3 interacts with the C terminal oligomerization and regulatory domain of p53 and represses p53 activity.</p><p>Elevated TAF3 expression strongly inhibits transcription activation by p53 in at least two human cell lines containing either endogenous or overexpressed p53 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This effect of TAF3 is specific to p53, since we found no effect of TAF3 on transcription regulated by the CMV promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) indicating that it does not inhibit the transcriptional activity of the factors that bind to these elements. Furthermore, in other studies TAF3 had no inhibitory effect on ATF7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and it even acted as a coactivator for WDR5-dependent genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The PHD finger is a specialized form of zinc finger that is classically characterized by C4HC3 arrangement of cysteine and histidine residues involved in Zn coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The PHD finger was shown to be essential for the coactivator activity of TAF3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], in contrast, we found that the PHD finger was not required for the inhibitory activity of TAF3 on p53. Although most PHD finger containing proteins were implicated in mediating interaction with chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], other reports described E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of PHD containing viral and cellular proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Since we found that overexpression of TAF3 reduces p53 protein level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), we examined the possibility that TAF3 may act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53. However, in our preliminary experiments we could not detect any ubiquitin ligase activity of TAF3 towards p53 in either <italic>in vitro </italic>or <italic>in vivo </italic>ubuiquitination assays (data not shown). Because TAF3 is a subunit of TFIID, and interacts with several additional proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], it is conceivable that TAF3 recruits a ubiquitin ligase to p53 to increase its turnover. In HeLa cells the reduction in the level of p53 was comparable to the reduction seen in the transcriptional activity of p53, while in U2OS cells the decrease in the level of the p53 protein was not as dramatic as the reduction seen in the transcriptional activity of p53 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This latter observation suggests that down-regulation of p53 protein level by TAF3 may not solely be responsible for reduced transcriptional activity of p53, but additionally, TAF3 may directly inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53. We speculate that the additional mechanisms TAF3 employs to inhibit p53 transcriptional activity may include posttranslational modifications, such as sumoylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], but the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we identify TAF3 as an evolutionarily conserved negative regulator of p53 transcription activation function. We show physical interaction between the C terminus of Dmp53 and the central region of TAF3 both in yeast two hybrid assays and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The interaction is evolutionarily conserved, since DmTAF3 can also interact with human p53, and mammalian TAF3 can bind to both Dmp53 and human p53. Elevated TAF3 expression results in severe specific inhibition of transcription activation by p53 in human cell lines, which may be partly due to a decrease in the level of the p53 protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>Bait plasmids pBTM116-Dmp53&#x00394;N (amino acids 47&#x02013;385), pBTM116-Dmp53&#x00394;N&#x00394;C (amino acids 47&#x02013;294) pBTM116-Dmp53C (amino acids 277&#x02013;385), pBTM116-Dmp53C1 (amino acids 277&#x02013;351), pBTM116-Dmp53C2 (amino acids 349&#x02013;385), pBTM116-p53&#x00394;N, pGEX4T1-Dmp53C and pXJ41-mTAF3 were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].
