In general, it is accepted that 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonists increase anxiety behaviours and induce hypophagia. However, pharmacological analysis of the roles of these receptors is hampered by the lack of selective ligands and the complex regulation of receptor isoforms and expression levels. Therefore, the exact role of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors in mood disorders remain controversial, some suggesting agonists and others suggesting antagonists may be efficacious antidepressants, while there is general agreement that antagonists are beneficial anxiolytics. In order to test the hypothesis that increased 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor expression, and thus increased 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor signalling, is causative in mood disorders, we have undertaken a transgenic approach, directly altering the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor number in the forebrain and evaluating the consequences on behaviour. Transgenic mice overexpressing 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors under the control of the CaMKII&#x003b1; promoter (C2CR mice) have elevated 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor mRNA levels in cerebral cortex and limbic areas (including the hippocampus and amygdala), but normal levels in the hypothalamus, resulting in &#x0003e; 100% increase in the number of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> ligand binding sites in the forebrain. The C2CR mice show increased anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus-maze, decreased wheel-running behaviour and reduced activity in a novel environment. These behaviours were observed in the C2CR mice without stimulation by exogenous ligands. Our findings support a role for 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor signalling in anxiety disorders. The C2CR mouse model offers a novel and effective approach for studying disorders associated with 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>behaviour</kwd><kwd>transgenic mice</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Central serotonergic systems modulate many behavioural and physiological functions, and thus 5-HT receptors have attracted much attention as therapeutic targets for various disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Barnes &#x00026; Sharp, 1999</xref>). The 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor is one of the 14 members of the 5-HT receptor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Martin &#x00026; Humphrey, 1994</xref>), and its expression level is particularly high in the limbic system and hypothalamus where its activity is implicated in anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, locomotor activity and feeding behaviour as well as modulation of pituitary release of ACTH and prolactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Millan, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, mice which lack 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors are reported to be hyperphagic (they develop obesity in later life) and hyperactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Tecott <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), and to demonstrate less anxiety-like behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Heisler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007b</xref>).</p><p>Studies of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor function and its pathophysiological role(s) have been difficult, largely due to a lack of selective pharmacological agents together with the complex regulation of receptor density and activity. A nonselective 5-HT receptor agonist, 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-piperazine (mCPP), which shows preferential affinity at 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, has been used for inferring the role of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors. In rodents, mCPP induces anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Cornelio &#x00026; Nunes-de-Souza, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hackler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), inhibits locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Stiedl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) and reduces food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Kennett &#x00026; Curzon, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Hewitt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). However, careful analyses are required for such effects as mCPP also activates other 5-HT receptor subtypes to regulate activity and food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Nonogaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Dalton <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In addition, more recently available 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonists, such as RO 60-0175, have been shown to exert a degree of action on other 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Higgins <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Damjanoska <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Coupled with the lack of selective ligands, there is disagreement in the literature over whether it is the activation or inhibition of the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors that causes anxiety or depressive behaviour, and hence whether it is the agonists or antagonists that could be effective antidepressants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Millan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Dunlop <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Cremers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Further complexity is introduced by RNA editing of the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor transcript, which potently modulates both the degree of constitutive activity of the encoded receptor and its sensitivity to ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Burns <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Moreover, the extent of editing is altered in different mouse strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Englander <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), following early-life stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bhansali <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), following modulation of serotonergic neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Gurevich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002a</xref>), or in post-mortem brains from suicide victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Gurevich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002b</xref>).</p><p>Here we have tested the hypothesis that elevated 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor density in forebrain alters behaviour. In order to circumvent the problems associated with poor selectivity of pharmacological agents, we have undertaken a transgenic approach: we have overexpressed 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors in mouse forebrain and examined the resulting phenotype. The CaMKII&#x003b1;&#x02013;5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor transgene promoting overexpression only expresses the unedited isoform of the receptor; consequently, the balance of the edited isoforms in our transgenic mice will be modified considerably compared with wild-type mice.

All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Transgenic mice were generated by pronuclear injection of the 11-kb CaMKII&#x003b1;&#x02013;HA-2CR minigene construct into C57BL/6J &#x000d7; CBA embryos. Four founder mice (designated C2CR) were obtained, all of which transmitted the transgene. Two C2CR lines (C2CR.10 and C2CR.33), which demonstrated similar traits, were selected for further characterisation. Mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6 and they were genotyped by PCR using primers corresponding to the HA tag (forward: 5&#x02032;-ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCT-3&#x02032;) and complementary to the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor cDNA (reverse: 5&#x02032;-CAGAGGTGCATGGACGC-3&#x02032;), giving a product of 420 bp. In some experiments, genotypes were confirmed by Southern blot analysis of the <italic>EcoRV</italic> digested genomic DNA from C2CR mice, probed with a <sup>32</sup>P-labelled DNA fragment comprising the 2.7-kb <italic>BamH1</italic> fragment of the transgene. Southern blotting was also used to confirm a single integration site of the transgene in C2CR.10 and C2CR.33 mice, consistent with the observed &#x0223c;50% transmission rate for the transgene.

In brief, brain sections (15 &#x003bc;m) were thaw-mounted on silane-coated slides and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in a 0.1 <sc>m</sc> phosphate buffer followed by three washes in PBS, then dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol.

A male C2CR or control mouse was placed in the centre of the plus-maze, where all the arms met, and its behaviour was monitored and recorded immediately thereafter for 5 min using a computer tracking system (Limelight). The number of open-arm entries, time spent in the open arms and distance travelled within the open arms were analysed.

SB242084, at doses previously shown to antagonise ligand-activated 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Stiedl <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), failed to affect the wheel-running behaviour in both control and C2CR mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).

Administration of SB206553 was expected to antagonise the constitutive activity of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors and hence increase locomotion, particularly in the C2CR mice. However, SB206553 at higher doses (5 mg/kg, i.p.) paradoxically decreased locomotion in both control and C2CR mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).

This demonstrates that in mouse, contrary to rat, SB206553 inhibits locomotion through a mechanism distinct from the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor signalling.

There were no differences in the body weight or basal and stress-induced plasma corticosterone levels between the C2CR mice and their littermate controls. These results are consistent with the lack of transgene expression of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors in the hypothalamic areas, which is involved in regulation of feeding or indeed regulation of corticotropin-releasing factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Heisler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Lam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>) and, hence, involved in corticosterone production.

Indeed, preliminary evidence of altered dopamine signalling in C2CR transgenic mice was obtained from an increased ratio of DA : DA metabolite content in the cerebral cortex (P.L. Stevenson and M.C. Holmes, unpublished data). Taken together, the hypoactivity observed in the C2CR mice is consistent with increased 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor signalling in the frontal cortex, resulting in inhibition of dopamine release.</p><p>The role of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors in locomotor behaviour was further investigated using pharmacological agents. 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonists, mCPP and RO 60-0175, decreased activity of mice in both the novel environment of the open field and the voluntary wheel running. Intriguingly, the level of agonist-induced inhibition of activity did not dramatically differ between the genotypes regardless of the distinct receptor expression levels. Only the submaximal dose of RO 60-0175 distinguished between the genotypes; the hypoactivity induced by RO 60-0175 in the C2CR mice was greater than in the controls, the effect reflecting the higher 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor number in the C2CR mice.</p><p>Interestingly, the vehicle injection alone caused hypoactivity in all mice in both the open-field and wheel-running tests. This was independent of the acclimatisation period as mice in wheel-running cages showed highly reproducible running behaviour over 1 or 2 weeks in the cages yet, as soon as they were removed from the cage for injection, the stress inhibited activity patterns following this intervention. In some cases the transgenic mice responded to this stress of the saline injection so severely that no further inhibition of activity could be observed with the agonist (presumably a floor effect due to maximal 5-HT activation of receptors in response to stress). However, overall there was not a statistically significant difference between the response of the transgenic mice and the control mice. The acute nature of these effects (within 30 min) suggests that the effect was not mediated by increased corticosterone effects (which would require genomic action, and &#x0003e; 40 min delay), but was a direct effect on 5-HT release, or indeed other neurotransmitter pathways, in response to the stress. The failure of the selective 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor antagonist, SB242084, to elevate activity levels in doses previously shown to be inhibitory <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Kennett <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Hayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Nonogaki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) suggests that the hypoactivity was due not to ligand activation of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors (ie. there is a low level of endogenous 5-HT release under basal conditions) but to constitutive activity of the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors in the C2CR mice. However, administration of SB206553, a drug previously shown to be an inverse agonist at 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors (SB206553) in rat <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">De Deurwaerdere <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Berg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and on human 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors in cell culture, did not restore hypoactivity; it instead decreased activity of mice in both wheel-running and open-field tests. This effect was presumed to be independent of the drug action on 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors as similar effects, to the same degree, were also observed in 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor-deficient mice (M. C. Holmes, P.L. Stevenson and R. N. Carter, unpublished data). Hence, at present we are unable to determine pharmacologically whether the overt behavioural phenotype observed in the C2CR mice is as a result of increased constitutive activity or enhanced sensitivity to the endogenous ligand of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors. However, it is likely that the answer is a combination of the two as the transgene only expresses the unedited form of the receptor, which has been shown to be both constitutively active and more sensitive to ligand than the edited forms <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Niswender <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Interestingly, a mouse model expressing only the unedited (INI) isoform, but at normal levels, has recently been produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Kawahara <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Such mice have no overt metabolic phenotype which would be indicative of increased signalling through this receptor, but the consequences of this genetic manipulation on anxiety and depressive-like behaviours has yet to be determined.</p><p>In conclusion, our animal model of unedited 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor overexpression in forebrain provides the first evidence that an overexpression of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors <italic>in vivo</italic> elicits a phenotype of elevated anxiety-like behaviour and hypolocomotion, consistent with an increased 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor signalling. This model offers an alternative method to studying 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors using solely pharmacological agents, which at present lack selective ligands. It now becomes important to determine the molecular and cellular consequences of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor overexpression and altered profile of editing, which will aid our further understanding of the function of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors and their role in mood disorders.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by a Wellcome Trust project grant to MCH and KEC.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alves</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Pinheiro</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Motta</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Landeira-Fernandez</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Cruz</surname><given-names>AP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anxiogenic effects in the rat elevated plus-maze of 5-HT(2C) agonists into ventral but not dorsal hippocampus</article-title><source>Behav.
