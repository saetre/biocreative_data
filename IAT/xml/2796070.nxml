The results of various epidemiological studies report a prevalence rate of 8-12%. This disease is one of the representative childhood and adolescent mental disorders occurring most commonly in children aged 4-11 years old,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref> and tends to develop before the age of 7. About 85% of patients continue to experience symptoms to adolescence,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref> along with a drop in academic performance and difficulty in social adaptation. Since this disorder may develop into various behavioral problems and secondary emotional disturbances, such as a decline in selfesteem, psychologically shriveling, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorder or mood disorder, it is essential to detect ADHD and introduce proper treatment early.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></p><p>The meta-analytic results of 1) a multi-ethnicity population-targeted family study, 2) a twin study, and 3) an adoption study indicate that ADHD showed about 76% heritability, and the implication is that hereditary factors play an important role in pathogenesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref> Recently, genes that may be correlated with ADHD's neurobiological base have been revealed through candidate gene studies. Dopamine D4 receptor Gene (DRD4), located in the chromosome 11 (11p15.5), among them, is a specific area of attention. The 7-repeat allele of the exon III variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism of the DRD4 gene resulted in a blunted response toward dopamine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref> In a study of correlation between ADHD and DRD4 gene, the meta-analytic results of case-control studies and family-based studies demonstrated significant pooled odds ratios of 1.9 (95% confidence interval of 1.4-2.2) and 1.4 (95% confidence interval of 1.1-1.6), respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref> A group of Korean children of alcoholics were significantly more likely to carry the 4-repeat allele and the 4/4 genotype of DRD4 than control subjects, indicating the possibility of genetic vulnerability toward alcoholrelated disorders along with high morbidity to ADHD and the possibility of unfavorable therapeutic responses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref> In a study targeting adolescent girls in Korea, the most common type of DRD4 polymorphism was shown to be the 4-repeat allele. Unlike European or Caucasian subjects, Asians such as Koreans, Japanese and Chinese are known to rarely exhibit the 7-repeat allele of DRD4 exon III 48-bp VNTR polymorphism in exon III of the DRD4 gene.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref> Accordingly, this study examines the distribution of DRD4 gene polymorphism and correlation with treatment responce in ADHD children in Korea.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subject group in this study included 72 male children with aged 6 to 15 years old, who visited the Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Kwandong University College of Medicine Myongji Hospital. The subjects had been diagnosed as having ADHD by a psychiatrist specialized in children and adolescents. Diagnosis of ADHD was based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria. The subjects were in drug-na&#x000ef;ve state. The consent for the study was obtained from children's parents or representatives. Exclusion criteria of subjects were 1) current cases with a convulsive disorder and other neurologic defect including brain damage, 2) schizophrenia and cases with a history of psychosis, 3) cases with developmental problems such as autism and learning disability, and 4) those who did not provide consent to participate in this study. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).</p></sec><sec><title>Diagnostic and evaluation tools</title><sec><title>Korean Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version</title><p>Korean Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version is a semi-structured clinical interview designed to assess the present, life-time morbidity state and severity of ADHD of 32 psychiatric diseases of children and adolescence, based on the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref> In Korea, translated by Kim et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref> the reliability and validity of ADHD, tic disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, depressive disorder and anxiety disorder were studied.

CPT, among them, may be used to assess inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity quantitatively and is largely used for ADHD diagnosis and its therapeutic assessment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref></p><p>The CPT presents stimuli-target and non-target in a mixture at regular intervals. The CPT is a tool to test task vigilance and distractibility by allowing the subject to react in the presence of a prescribed specific target. Various types of stimuli, such as letters, shapes, numbers and sounds are used. The CPT types are diverse depending on the form of stimuli.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref></p><p>The form of CPT used in this study is a Korean language version developed and standardized by Shin et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref> It is a clinical version of the ADHD diagnostic system (ADS). With a computerized CPT program, attention may be assessed by visual and auditory stimuli, and all results are automatically scored. Subjects are asked to practice before undertaking this test. In this study, visual stimuli incorporating shapes were given. The test duration of children 1) age 6-7 years old was ten minutes, and 2) children at an age of seven years would require fifteen minutes.</p><p>In this study, in the presence of a target stimulus, four indices were as follows:</p><p>1) Number of cases where a response is missed-namely, omission error, as an indicator of inattention; 2) Number of cases where a response occurs in the presence of non-target-these are commission errors, an indicator of hyperactivity or impulsivity; 3) Mean reaction time that measures the speed of process handling as a hit response time toward target stimuli; and 4) Standard deviation of reaction time that measures vigilance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref></p><p>The results were converted into values of assessments on the basis of standard computation from the normal group of the same age.

The 5-repeat allele and 6-repeat allele showed distributions of 2.1%, 2.8% each. The 7-repeat allele was not shown.

Subjects having greater instance of the 4-repeat allele showed a significantly lower mean score for commission errors (F=4.268, df=2, p=0.018) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of the present study identified a significant association between homozygosity for the 4-repeat allele at the DRD4 gene and lower scores of commission errors and standard deviation of reaction time in CPT. These findings suggest that the 4-repeat allele of DRD4 gene plays a protective role against inattention and impulsivity of ADHD symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref> This is consistent with previous work<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref> in which higher scores of commission errors in CPT had been measured in ADHD children with 7-repeat allele of DRD4, while lower omission errors and commission errors had been measured in patients with homozygosity of the 4-repeat allele of DRD4 genes. Barr et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref> found, using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) that the results of dominant transmission of 7-repeat allele and non-transmission of 4-repeat allele were significant. They also mentioned the possibility of a protective role of 4-repeat allele against ADHD development. In line with the results of that investigation, a study of correlation between the VNTR polymorphism in exon III of DRD4 gene and the therapeutic results of methylphenidate conducted in Korean ADHD children reported that the group with a good treatment response of 50% or more symptomatic improvement had significantly higher values of 4/4 genotype of DRD4 than did the group with a poor treatment response of less than 50% symptomatic improvement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref> Previous work targeting on Asian population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref> reported that almost no incidence of 7-repeat allele was found in VNTR polymorphism in exon III of DRD4. This study also found a high distribution of the 2-repeat allele (14.6%), which was lower in frequency than the 4-repeat allele, and the 2/4 genotype was verified in 13 out of 72 (18.1%) subjects. A recent study targeting Chinese ADHD children reported that the frequency of the 2-repeat allele patient group was higher than that of the normal control group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref> This investigation also made a comparative analysis of CPT measured values of 4/4 genotype and 2/4 genotype in order to verify the differences of inattention, hyperactivities and impulsivity between 4-repeat allele and 2-repeat allele. The measured value of commission errors (t=-2.309, df=15.946, p=0.035), the standard deviation of mean reaction time (t=-2.365, df=12.660, p=0.035) of the group with 2/4 genotype was higher than that with 4/4 genotype. Therefore, it would be meaningful in the future study of ADHD and 2-repeat allele to inquire into differences in the endophenotype in accordance with polymorphism of 2-repeat allele by securing a target group with a larger number of subjects.</p><p>The limitations of this study are as follows: First, the number of subjects was relatively small. This study involved target patients visiting the outpatient clinic of a university hospital in a specific area and may thus offer limited generalization of the conclusions. Second, comorbidity and psychosocial variables that may affect CPT results have not been controlled. In this study, 28 out of 72 subjects (38.9%) were verified as having comorbid disorders. ADHD has a high frequency of comorbidity of approximately 50% or more, and other psychiatric disorders such as anxiety disorder and mood disorder may also include the symptom of "inattention." Comorbid tic disorder seen concurrently in 40-60% of ADHD cases may largely affect the characteristics of the target group. Hence, future studies should be conducted controlling such an element. Lastly, it is not clear whether or not the CPT used in this study is a sensitive test that to detect inattention of ADHD, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Taken together, previous work demonstrates more commission errors and omission errors as well as differences in the standard deviation of reaction time, sensitivity and reaction time in CPT with ADHD patients as opposed to normal children.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref> Nevertheless, the inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity seen in ADHD are complex phenomena arising in various areas of the brain. On the contrary, visual stimulus incorporated in CPT has been simplified and results from older or highly intelligent subjects suggest some issues of low discrimination.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref> Despite debates on usefulness of CPT in ADHD, CPT shows somewhat consistent results as compared with other objective neuropsychological test tools. CPT is widely used in the diagnosis, treatment and research of ADHD owing to facts corroborative of reliability and validity through standardization.</p><p>However, as mentioned above, with low difficulty of CPT comes to the likelihood that results can vary depending on age and intelligence. In such cases, auditory stimuli may have a higher degree of difficulty as opposed to visual stimuli. It has been reported that, in cases with an old age or with high intelligence, auditory stimulus-incorporated CPT may be more useful in ADHD diagnosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref> Thus, in the future, a study design using CPT, and targets such as visual, auditory or both stimuli would be necessary.</p><p>Notwithstanding such limitations, this investigation offers comparative analysis of CPT measured values depending on the existence of homozygosity of 4-repeat allele of DRD4 targeting on an Asian population, and provides an analysis of correlation of genetic polymorphism and CPT measured values in accordance with number of 4-repeat alleles.</p><p>In future studies, more samples from various Asian ethnic groups should be collected. Comorbidity and other psychosocial elements that might affect ADHD should be maximally controlled.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation
