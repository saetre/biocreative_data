We determined the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 after treatment of morphine and H37Ra infection. Treatment of morphine with R37Ra infection significantly decreased the levels of Bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009205-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) and increased the levels of Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009205-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) in the lung from wild type mice. However, morphine with H37Ra did not alter the levels of Bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009205-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>) and Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009205-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) in the lung from TLR9 KO mice.

The CFU count in the lungs was determined by plating the lung homogenates on 7H11 agar plates. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009205-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, significantly greater CFU count was observed in the lung tissues when wild type mice were treated with both morphine and H37Ra than they were treated with either morphine or H37Ra alone. Notably, morphine and H37Ra-indcued increase in CFU count was significantly inhibited in the lung tissues from the TLR9 KO mice, suggesting that this additive effect requires TLR9. Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009205-Singh1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> have suggested that morphine exerts a dose-dependent effect in murine tuberculosis.

Moreover, as discussed above, in several cases individual immune deficiencies appeared to be linked to TLR9. For example, morphine and H37Ra-induced TNF, IL-1, and IL-6 production appears to be controlled by TLR9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009205-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The findings of this study have several implications for the investigation of the role of TLRs in susceptibility of humans to drug abuse and mycobacterial infections. The involvement of these receptors has been suggested from genetic studies correlating single nucleotide polymorphisms within the TLR9 gene, with disease susceptibility to infection in populations exposed to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009205-Ogus1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.
