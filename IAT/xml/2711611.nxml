The Srs2 &#x0201c;anti-recombinase&#x0201d; restricts HR by disassembling the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament, an intermediate preceding the exchange of homologous DNA strands. Here, we cytologically characterize Srs2 function in vivo and describe a novel mechanism for regulating the initiation of HR. We find that Srs2 is recruited separately to replication and repair centers and identify the genetic requirements for recruitment. In the absence of Srs2 activity, Rad51 foci accumulate, and surprisingly, can form in the absence of Rad52 mediation. However, these Rad51 foci do not represent repair-proficient filaments, as determined by recombination assays. Antagonistic roles for Rad52 and Srs2 in Rad51 filament formation are also observed in vitro. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Srs2 removes Rad51 indiscriminately from DNA, while the Rad52 protein coordinates appropriate filament reformation. This constant breakdown and rebuilding of filaments may act as a stringent quality control mechanism during HR.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Homologous recombination (HR) is a high-fidelity repair process that is critical for genome maintenance. Disruption or misregulation of HR functions can lead to loss of heterozygosity (LOH), chromosome loss, genome rearrangements, or other deleterious events that can ultimately lead to carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoeijmakers, 2001</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agarwal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wyman and Kanaar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reliene et al., 2007</xref>). Proper regulation of recombination processes is therefore as important for the maintenance of genome integrity as the repair process itself. HR is stimulated by double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), which can occur spontaneously through normal DNA metabolism, or occur in a programmed fashion during processes such as mating-type switching (in yeast), immunoglobin gene rearrangements (in vertebrates), and meiotic recombination. In addition, HR also processes DSBs from exogenous insults such as ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic drugs. The current model of DSB repair is largely based on studies from the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krogh and Symington, 2004</xref>). In this model, the DSB end is processed by nucleases to create 3&#x02032; single-stranded DNA tails, which are immediately coated by replication protein A (RPA), the eukaryotic single-strand DNA binding protein. A critical step of the HR mechanism involves formation of the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament on this ssDNA. However, formation of Rad51 filaments is inhibited by the presence of RPA and needs to be mediated by Rad52 protein, which through direct physical interaction nucleates Rad51 on RPA-coated ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sung, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">New et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sugiyama and Kowalczykowski, 2002</xref>). The filament can be also mediated or stabilized by the Rad55/57 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sung, 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fortin and Symington, 2002</xref>). Once the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament is formed, it can invade a homologous donor sequence to form a displacement loop (D-loop) structure between the donor double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and the invading single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). After D-loop formation, new DNA synthesis can occur using the invading strand as a primer. The Swi/Snf-like protein Rad54 directly interacts with Rad51 and is thought to function in multiple steps of HR. Rad54 stimulates DNA strand exchange by Rad51 and extension of the heteroduplex DNA formed by strand invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Petukhova et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Solinger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mazina and Mazin, 2004</xref>). It also has an ability to translocate along dsDNA, an activity important for its reported roles in disassembling Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments, remodeling chromatin, and migrating branched recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van Komen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Solinger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alexeev et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jaskelioff et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The ordered recruitment of recombination factors can be visualized cytologically, as recombination and checkpoint proteins relocalize to discrete foci at DSB sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lisby et al., 2001</xref>). Recombination protein foci exhibit genetic dependencies that are consistent with reported protein&#x02013;protein interactions; for instance, Rad54 focus formation requires Rad51, whereas formation of Rad51 foci requires Rad52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lisby et al., 2004</xref>). HR foci form in response to induction of DSBs generated by exogenous factors, as well as spontaneously during S phase in the absence of such damage. This suggests that HR factors are recruited to replication forks for recombination-mediated repair and restart when fork progression is impaired due to spontaneous damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Michel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Limoli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sogo et al., 2002</xref>). Recent work also suggests that ssDNA structures can contribute to spontaneous HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fabre et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lettier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mozlin et al., 2008</xref>). However, at present, the nature of DNA lesions that lead to spontaneous HR foci is unknown and it remains possible that a majority of short-lived spontaneous foci are assembled in error and subsequently removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lisby et al., 2003</xref>). This disassembly may allow more appropriate repair pathways to act, such as the post-replicative repair pathways, also referred to as DNA damage tolerance pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eppink et al., 2006</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andersen et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, a logical point for the regulation of HR is the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament before its commitment to strand invasion.</p><p>A prominent protein that destabilizes the Rad51 filament is Srs2, a 3&#x02032;-to-5&#x02032; helicase with functional similarities to bacterial UvrD, Rep, and PcrA and to mammalian Fbh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aboussekhra et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krejci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Veaute et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiolo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kohzaki et al., 2007</xref>). Deletion of <italic>SRS2</italic> causes increased levels of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aguilera and Klein, 1988</xref>) and synthetic interactions with deletions of genes involved in genetic recombination including <italic>RAD54</italic> and the RecQ helicase homologue <italic>SGS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 1999</xref>). These lethalities can be suppressed by inhibiting early recombination steps, indicating that the loss of viability stems from the accumulation of toxic recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gangloff et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klein, 2001</xref>). Between these genetic interactions and the in vitro observation that Srs2 can disrupt Rad51 recombinase filaments, Srs2 has earned the epithet &#x0201c;anti-recombinase.&#x0201d;</p><p>The <italic>SRS2</italic> gene was also identified as a suppressor of the sensitivity of <italic>rad6&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>rad18&#x00394;</italic> post-replicative repair mutants to DNA damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lawrence and Christensen, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aboussekhra et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedl et al., 2001</xref>). These and other genetic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klein, 2001</xref>), as well as the anti-recombinase activity of Srs2, led to the hypothesis that Srs2 contributes to the channeling of lesions from HR to other repair pathways, such as post-replicative repair, which depends on <italic>RAD5</italic> or <italic>RAD6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aboussekhra et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schiestl et al., 1990</xref>). This regulatory role of Srs2 has been further elucidated through novel interactions between Srs2 and replication proteins, such as the Pol&#x02202; subunit Pol32, and importantly, its interaction with the processivity clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Papouli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pfander et al., 2005</xref>). Yeast PCNA, a homotrimer encoded by the <italic>POL30</italic> gene, is a substrate for both mono- and polyubiquitination after DNA damage. These two modifications have been proposed to act as a switch between different branches of post-replicative repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoege et al., 2002</xref>). PCNA is also sumoylated, but specifically in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoege et al., 2002</xref>), and Srs2 has been shown to interact preferentially with sumoylated PCNA. Importantly, strains with mutant PCNA that cannot be sumoylated behave similarly to <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Papouli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pfander et al., 2005</xref>). Currently, it is thought that Srs2 is recruited to replication forks by PCNA<sup>SUMO</sup> to inhibit recombination during replication.</p><p>In this study, we examine Srs2 activity in vivo using the cell biological and genetic tools available in yeast to further understand the cellular role of Srs2 at replication forks and in the global regulation of HR. We describe the localization of Srs2 to replication foci and to HR foci, and find that recruitment to these two cellular processes occurs independently. Although the absence of Srs2 increases the recruitment of HR factors to forks during S phase, stalled replication forks are not a major substrate for HR focus formation in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic>, whereas collapsed forks are. We also describe a decrease in the requirement for Rad52 during Rad51 focus formation in the absence of Srs2. However, these Rad51 foci do not represent structures that are active for HR. Finally, we show data supporting the hypothesis that the role of Srs2 is to remove Rad51 filaments, regardless of whether they are appropriate or inappropriate for HR, and that Rad52 directs the reformation of appropriate filaments, effectively eliminating potentially toxic HR intermediates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Srs2 localizes to recombination and replication foci in vivo</title><p>One of the functions of Srs2 is thought to be restricting recombination to specific times and to particular cellular locations. To investigate the anti-recombinase function of Srs2 during unperturbed cell growth, we monitored the localization of Srs2 foci by simultaneously analyzing the location of these foci relative to a DSB repair protein (Rad52-RFP) and a replication protein (CFP-Pol30: yeast PCNA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kitamura et al., 2006</xref>). We find that YFP-Srs2 localizes to a subset of spontaneous Rad52 foci that likely mark sites of ongoing recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In cells with small buds, which correspond to S phase of the cell cycle, Srs2 forms multiple small foci in the nucleus that do not colocalize with Rad52 recombination foci; however, they do colocalize with Pol30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, bottom left cell), suggesting that Srs2 foci are localized to the site of replication forks.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Srs2 localizes to recombination foci and replication foci with different genetic requirements.</bold> (A) Srs2 foci colocalize with Rad52 recombination foci and with Pol30 (PCNA) replication foci.

We asked whether YFP-Srs2 forms foci at the replication fork in a nonsumoylated PCNA mutant (<italic>pol30-RR</italic>). Indeed, we did not detect the multiple S phase Srs2 foci in the <italic>pol30-RR</italic> mutant, or in the absence of the SUMO E3 ligase responsible for PCNA sumoylation, Siz1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pfander et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810055/DC1">Fig. S1 B</ext-link>). In addition, Srs2 S phase foci were not detectable in a YFP-tagged Srs2 mutant that lacks the consensus SUMO-interaction motif (<italic>srs2-&#x00394;SIM</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ulrich, 2007</xref>), which is defective in its PCNA interaction (Fig. S1, B&#x02013;D). In contrast, although the formation of S phase Srs2 foci is drastically decreased in the <italic>pol30-RR</italic> mutant, the frequency of Srs2 at recombination foci is unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, bottom; Fig. S1 B). Importantly, these results indicate that recruitment of Srs2 to DNA replication forks or DNA repair centers occurs independently of one another, consistent with recently described separation-of-function <italic>srs2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Le Breton et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, the inability of Srs2 to localize to replication forks in the <italic>pol30-RR</italic> mutant results in an increased number of HR foci that themselves can nonetheless recruit Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>; Fig. S1 B and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810055/DC1">Fig. S2 B</ext-link>).</p><p>To our surprise, Srs2 still localizes to HR foci in the absence of Rad51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>; Fig. S1 B), suggesting the interaction of Srs2 with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krejci et al., 2003</xref>) is not the only requirement for recruitment to foci. There is, however, a partial requirement for the E3 SUMO ligase Siz1 in Srs2 recruitment to HR foci (Fig. S1 B), but it does not require Rad52 and Rad59, two recombination proteins that are known to be sumoylated (unpublished data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sacher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>). To test whether Srs2 interaction with sumoylated proteins was required for recruitment to HR foci, we determined the localization of the srs2-&#x00394;SIM mutant, which lacks the SUMO interaction motif. This mutant localizes as wild-type to recombination foci (Fig. S1 B), showing that Srs2 interactions with sumoylated proteins are dispensable for recruitment to recombination foci. Altogether, these results show that Srs2 localizes to recombination and replication foci independently during normal cell growth, and that different sumoylation events may modulate its recruitment or retention.</p></sec><sec><title>Recombination foci accumulate in the absence of Srs2 activity</title><p>Although Srs2 localizes to HR foci, the absence of this protein results in increased recombination and stabilization of Rad51 filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboussekhra et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fung et al., 2006</xref>). To examine this relationship in vivo, we visualized spontaneous recombination foci by using YFP- and CFP-tagged versions of the Rad51 and Rad54 proteins in the absence of Srs2. Compared with wild-type cells, <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> strains show a three- to fourfold increase in the number of budded cells that contain a Rad51 or Rad54 focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A&#x02013;C</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810055/DC1">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>). The increased incidence of Rad51 and Rad54 foci in the S/G2/M population can be reversed to wild-type levels by expression of <italic>SRS2</italic> on a plasmid (unpublished data). These data support the notion of an in vivo anti-recombinase activity for Srs2 that mirrors the in vitro activities and fits with its hyper-recombination phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aguilera and Klein, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krejci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Veaute et al., 2003</xref>). For further study, Rad54 was used as an indicator of Rad51 localization because the Rad54-YFP fusion protein is fully functional, unlike the partially functional Rad51 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lisby et al., 2004</xref>), and because Rad54 foci mirror Rad51 foci. Particularly, Rad51 and Rad54 increase similarly in the absence of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>), Rad54 colocalizes with Rad51 over 95% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>; Fig. S2, A and B), and Rad51 is required for Rad54 focus formation, whether Srs2 is present or absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>; Fig. S2 B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lisby et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the percentage of Rad51 and Rad54 colocalization is similar in the presence or absence of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>), indicating that even in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> cells, Rad54 foci closely mimic Rad51 foci.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Srs2 suppresses formation of spontaneous recombination foci.</bold> (A) Rad51 and Rad54 foci increase similarly in the absence of Srs2.

These observations imply that the defective protein is not just incapable of removing Rad51 filaments, as shown in the in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krejci et al., 2004</xref>), but that srs2-K41A mutant protein may actively block another repair pathway, or create a poisonous complex resulting in further accumulation of HR intermediates. Surprisingly, the srs2-K41A protein forms fewer replication and recombination foci than wild-type Srs2 protein (unpublished data), suggesting that the process blocked by this mutant protein occurs either before Srs2 focus formation or, alternatively, that the residence time of this protein is shorter in the absence of ATP binding and hydrolysis. Collectively, these results show that Srs2 helicase activity is necessary to suppress the accumulation of recombination foci.</p><p>To determine whether the elevated levels of HR foci observed in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> are due to an increase in the duration or incidence of HR foci, time-lapse microscopy was used to follow the formation of Rad54 foci during unperturbed cell growth.

On the other hand, wild-type cells form Rad54 foci in &#x0223c;30% of S phases, whereas in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> cells, Rad54 foci formed in 75% of S phases, indicating that HR foci form more frequently in the absence of Srs2.</p></sec><sec><title>Spontaneous recombination foci in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> are not solely due to unscheduled recombination at the replication fork</title><p>Due to the substantial increase in spontaneous HR foci in <italic>srs2&#x00394;,</italic> we expected that, in the absence of Srs2, recombination factors could accumulate at the replication fork. To further probe the nature of these supernumerary HR foci in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic>, we determined the percentage of Rad54 foci that colocalized with a replication fork&#x02013;associated protein, Rfa1, the large subunit of the single-strand binding protein RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brill and Stillman, 1991</xref>). In S phase, Rfa1 localizes to small speckled foci that associate with replication centers and colocalize with PCNA (Fig. S3 B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dimitrova et al., 1999</xref>). RPA also binds to ssDNA that may be engaged in recombinational repair processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alani et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barlow et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, Rfa1 foci colocalize with HR foci and are required for Rad52 focus formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lisby et al., 2004</xref>). However, it is important to note that although most HR foci show an associated Rfa1 signal, the converse is not true; that is, the majority of Rfa1 foci are not associated with HR proteins, and appear as S phase replication foci (Fig. S3 B). In fact, Rfa1 foci engaged in HR appear different from the small speckled Rfa1 replication foci; rather, they appear more similar to HR foci, as larger single foci, and are more often found in G2/M cells. To differentiate between these two types of Rfa1 foci, we use bud size (S phase indicated by small- to medium-sized buds, G2/M indicated by large buds) and Rfa1 focus morphology (speckled vs. single). This distinction allows us to use Rfa1 as a dual HR and replication marker.</p><p>In the absence of Srs2, Rad54 still appears as large single foci, but significantly more of these Rad54 foci colocalize with small speckled S phase RPA foci (twofold over wild-type, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>), suggesting that some of the increased HR foci represent recruitment to replication forks in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic>. A twofold increase in Rad54 localization to replication forks in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> is also seen when Mcm2 is used as a replication marker. Because Mcm2 disappears from the nucleus during S phase, this analysis was restricted to early S phase cells while Mcm2 foci were still visible (Fig. S3, C and D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yan et al., 1993</xref>). In G2 and M phases, when RPA foci reflect ssDNA regions undergoing repair, RPA-colocalizing Rad54 foci occur six times more frequently in the <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> than in wild-type strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). However, in both S phase and G2/M <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> cells, a significant percentage of the total Rad54 foci were present at sites with no detectable RPA localization (20&#x02013;30%). Perhaps, in the absence of Srs2 activity, some HR foci reflect events where recombination proteins are inappropriately recruited to dsDNA sites or represent sites where all RPA was evicted upon formation of a Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament. Nevertheless, the Rad54 foci that do colocalize with RPA S phase foci in the absence of Srs2 may indicate an inability to control HR at replication forks.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Supernumerary recombination foci in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> only partially reflect accumulation at stalled replication forks or sites containing ssDNA.</bold> (A) Percentage of Rad54 foci that colocalize with Rfa1 increases in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> cells.

Replication fork stalling occurs when a fork encounters a damaged template or one that is difficult to traverse. Alternatively, stalling can be artificially induced by depleting dNTP pools through addition of the drug hydroxyurea (HU). Exposing wild-type cells to HU does not induce the formation of Rad52 foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lisby et al., 2004</xref>). Likewise, the frequency of Rad54 foci in S phase does not increase after HU treatment, either in wild-type cells or in an <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Therefore, although a larger fraction of replication forks spontaneously recruit the recombination machinery in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>), it is not the stalling of replication forks, per se, that recruits HR factors in the absence of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of checkpoint proteins, such as the Mec1 kinase, stalling replication forks can lead to disengagement of the replisome, resulting in fork collapse along with the formation of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lopes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tercero and Diffley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sogo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pellicioli and Foiani, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Trenz et al., 2006</xref>).

Collectively, these results suggest that, in the absence of Srs2, HR foci form more frequently at multiple sites within the genome, including replication forks but also potentially at dsDNA sites. In addition, during replication fork stalling, Srs2 is not the only obstacle restricting the recruitment of the HR machinery, and large-scale recruitment of recombination factors in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> is inhibited as long as replication fork integrity is maintained.</p></sec><sec><title>Decreased requirement for Rad52 in Rad51 focus formation in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic></title><p>Because the induction of Rad51 and Rad54 recombination foci after DNA damage requires Rad52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lisby et al., 2004</xref>), we asked about the role of Srs2 in this dependency.

Unfortunately, we could not easily monitor Rad54 foci after DNA damage in these strains because Rad54-YFP protein levels are dramatically elevated in <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic> mutants (Fig. S2 C). Although Rad54 foci can be detected and analyzed in unperturbed <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>srs2&#x00394; rad52&#x00394;</italic> cells, DNA damage treatment renders Rad54 foci indiscernible in <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic> or <italic>srs2&#x00394; rad52&#x00394;</italic> double mutants. Unlike Rad54, Rad51 levels are not elevated in <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic>, so foci can be clearly observed after induction of &#x0223c;2 DSBs/cell with gamma irradiation. Wild-type and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; cells exhibit a similar rapid assembly of Rad51 foci after irradiation, followed by a disassembly phase in wild-type cells.

Intriguingly, we observed a slow but steady induction of Rad51 foci after IR in the <italic>srs2&#x00394; rad52&#x00394;</italic> double mutant, indicating that Rad51 is recruited to DSBs, albeit more slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). These results suggest that Srs2 antagonizes Rad52 in Rad51 focus formation after DNA damage.</p></sec><sec><title>Rad52 antagonizes Srs2 in Rad51 filament formation in vitro</title><p>We next examined the known recombination mediators, Rad52 and Rad55&#x02013;Rad57, for their ability to overcome the inhibitory effect of Srs2 on Rad51-mediated DNA strand exchange in vitro. These mediators were incorporated either singly or in combination into DNA strand exchange reactions with or without Srs2 at the time of RPA addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krejci et al., 2002</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, the addition of Rad52 is sufficient to overcome the Srs2 inhibition, probably by facilitating reassembly of Rad51 filament on an RPA-coated ssDNA template. On the other hand, the Rad55/57 heterodimer does not significantly increase Rad51-mediated strand exchange in the presence of Srs2, when used alone or together with Rad52 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Interestingly, when wild-type Rad52 protein is replaced by a <italic>rad52</italic> mutant that is defective in Rad51 interaction (<italic>rad52&#x00394;409-412</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krejci et al., 2002</xref>), Srs2 can still inhibit the strand exchange reaction (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810055/DC1">Fig. S4 A</ext-link>), underscoring the need for Rad52&#x02013;Rad51 interactions in overcoming Srs2 inhibition.

Because the Rad51 foci formed in the absence of Rad52 are not recombination proficient, and Srs2 inhibits spontaneous Rad51 and Rad54 focus formation at many structures throughout the genome, we have suggested the following notion: Srs2 removes Rad51 filaments indiscriminately from ssDNA, while Rad52 acts to reform filaments where and when they are appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanaar et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Srs2 inhibits Rad54 focus formation both at DSBs and elsewhere</title><p>To test the possibility that Srs2 inhibits Rad51 and Rad54 focus formation indiscriminately, we compared the formation of Rad54 foci throughout the cell and at a defined fluorescently tagged DSB site in the presence of increasing amounts of Srs2.

Although many aspects of its function have been described in vitro<italic>,</italic> we undertook a cell biological approach to examine its intracellular organization and the consequences of disturbing its function in vivo. Using a fluorescently tagged Srs2, we visualized its localization to recombination foci and to replication forks in logarithmically growing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). The localization of Srs2 to recombination foci, surprisingly, does not require the presence of Rad51, the very protein it is known to dislodge from DNA and with which it interacts physically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krejci et al., 2003</xref>). Perhaps Srs2 senses the Rad51 filament indirectly through interactions with other members of the recombination machinery, through interactions with single-stranded DNA, or Srs2 is recruited specifically by modified forms of recombination proteins. In fact, we find that Siz1 is partially required for Srs2 recruitment to HR foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>), suggesting that sumoylation plays a role in this recruitment. However, in the absence of sumoylated Rad52 and Rad59, Srs2 recruitment is not impaired (unpublished data). Because the <italic>srs2</italic> mutant lacking the SUMO-interaction domain does not show a measurable defect in localization to HR foci (<italic>srs2-&#x00394;SIM</italic>, Fig. S1 B), sumoylation of Srs2 itself may be one of the modifications important for its recruitment to HR foci. Possibly multiple proteins, both sumoylated and unsumoylated, may recruit Srs2 to HR foci. During S phase (cells with small- to mid-size buds), Srs2 appears as multiple small foci colocalizing with PCNA. Formation of these foci requires interaction with sumoylated PCNA because we observe no S phase Srs2 foci in mutants defective in PCNA sumoylation (<italic>pol30-RR</italic>, <italic>siz1&#x00394;</italic>), or by mutating the Srs2 SIM domain (Fig. S1). These results support previous observations that Srs2 interacts preferentially with sumoylated PCNA and there is PCNA<sup>SUMO</sup>-dependent enrichment of Srs2 at replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Papouli et al., 2005</xref>). This cited report also showed that recombination proteins are increasingly recruited to replication forks in the absence of Srs2, and to a lesser extent, in the absence of PCNA<sup>SUMO</sup>. Likewise, we observe an increase in spontaneous HR foci in the <italic>pol30-RR</italic> mutant, but find that Srs2 recruitment to HR foci is not impaired in this mutant (Figs. S1 and S2). This result suggests that when Srs2 is unable to be recruited to the replication fork directly, HR proteins can assemble there and can later recruit Srs2.</p><p>Although there is an increase in the number of spontaneous HR foci in the <italic>pol30-RR</italic> mutant, there is an even larger accumulation of foci in the complete absence of Srs2. This accumulation is partially due to increased recruitment of HR proteins to replication forks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>; Fig. S3 A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). However, because there is no further induction of HR foci in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> after HU addition, cells must retain some mechanism to inhibit HR at stalled replication forks even in the absence of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). These observations suggest that there is still some restriction on recruitment of recombination proteins to forks other than Srs2, as long as replisome integrity is maintained. However, stalling replication forks in the absence of the Mec1 checkpoint kinase results in collapsed replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tercero and Diffley, 2001</xref>), which then leads to strong induction of HR foci, both in the presence of Srs2 and even more so in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Together, these data imply that the recruitment of HR factors to intact replication forks is disfavored even in the absence of Srs2. Perhaps there are active mechanisms still in place under these conditions that restrict inappropriate HR. Alternatively, these differences may simply be due to the lower accumulation of ssDNA in the presence of stalled versus collapsed replication forks. In any case, these observations argue only a minor role for Srs2 in reversing HR intermediates at stalled forks.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that Srs2 restricts inappropriate HR at multiple sites throughout the genome, and that unscheduled HR at the replication fork is probably not the only cause of the increased Rad51 and Rad54 focus levels in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic>. First, colocalization data show that there are a number of Rad54 foci that are neither located at replication forks nor at sites of ssDNA in an <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> (as determined by Rfa1 colocalization, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Second, levels of Rad54 foci in the <italic>pol30</italic> SUMO mutant (<italic>pol30-RR</italic>), which fails to recruit Srs2 specifically to replication forks, are not as high as in an <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> (Fig. S3 A). Third, although <italic>srs2&#x00394; rad54</italic>&#x00394; double mutants are inviable, <italic>pol30-RR rad54&#x00394;</italic> are viable (unpublished data), implying that the general role of Srs2 in recombination is the cause of lethality in <italic>rad54&#x00394;</italic>. Thus, we suggest that Srs2 acts throughout the genome to restrict HR and that only a subset of its function is at replication forks.</p><p>An indication that HR foci form inappropriately in the absence of Srs2 comes from the observation that Rad51 and Rad54 foci can form in the absence of Rad52 if Srs2 is also absent. Furthermore, Rad51 and Rad54 colocalize to a similar extent in <italic>srs2&#x00394; rad52&#x00394;</italic> double mutant as they do in wild-type cells, again indicating that these foci reflect similar structures (unpublished data). These foci are likely nonfunctional Rad51 filaments because <italic>srs2&#x00394; rad52&#x00394;</italic> cells are as DNA damage sensitive as the <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>), reflecting the crucial role for Rad52 in additional steps of HR. It is possible that some of these foci may be formed at structures that do not require HR, suggesting that in the absence of negative regulation by Srs2, Rad51 and Rad54 nucleate on sites that are not relevant to HR. Although it is not known whether Rad51 forms foci at dsDNA sites in vivo, Rad51 binds both single- and double-stranded DNA in vitro, with a slightly higher affinity for dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shinohara et al., 1992</xref>). It is of note that Srs2 dsDNA unwinding activity described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dupaigne et al. (2008)</xref> could act not only to displace Rad51 that is bound to dsDNA in legitimate HR structures, such as D-loops, but also to displace it from illegitimate dsDNA-Rad51 structures.We observe Rad51 foci at a low level in <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic> cells but, unlike the foci formed in <italic>srs2&#x00394; rad52&#x00394;</italic> double mutants, these aberrant foci are not inducible by gamma irradiation. Perhaps these foci form an aggregate or storage structure, as has been observed for RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Renzette et al., 2005</xref>), or they are the result of binding to a DNA structure that is not formed by IR, such as dsDNA.</p><p>Rad54 stabilizes Rad51 bound to ssDNA, but also removes Rad51 from dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kiianitsa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Solinger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mazin et al., 2003</xref>), so it is conceivable that some of the increased Rad54 foci in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> cells may indicate increased Rad54 dsDNA translocase activity in the absence of Srs2. However, the majority of detectable Rad54 foci are associated with Rad51 and ssDNA (96% of Rad54 foci colocalize with Rad51 in wild-type, and nearly 80% of Rad54 foci have detectable RPA association). Therefore, the majority of Rad54 foci are likely the result of binding to Rad51, most often on ssDNA.</p><p>The decreased requirement for Rad52 during Rad51 focus formation in <italic>srs2&#x00394;</italic> suggests that Srs2 and Rad52 act antagonistically in the formation of Rad51 filaments. Indeed, addition of Srs2 to the in vitro Rad51-mediated strand exchange reaction inhibits formation of Rad51 filaments, whereas Rad52 protein allows their formation even in the presence of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Unlike Rad52, the Rad55/57 heterodimer does not strongly promote in vitro filament formation in the presence of Srs2, suggesting that Rad55/57 has a different or less potent mediator function than Rad52 in driving Rad51 filament formation. Indeed, Rad51 focus formation in the <italic>srs2&#x00394; rad52&#x00394;</italic> double mutant is greatly delayed, suggesting that additional impediments to Rad51 nucleation remain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). An obvious candidate is the ssDNA binding protein RPA, which competes for Rad51 binding sites. This competition is relieved by Rad52, which mediates the efficient replacement of RPA by Rad51. However, in an <italic>srs2&#x00394; rad52&#x00394;</italic> double mutant, Rad51 foci can eventually assemble, at the time when the foci in wild-type cells start to disappear. This observation suggests that in the absence of Srs2 activity, Rad51 filaments can be assembled even without Rad52. Despite the fact that Rad51 foci are able to form under these conditions, these foci do not represent recombination-proficient filaments.</p><p>Likewise, partially defective <italic>rad52</italic> alleles can be suppressed by overexpression of Rad51 or deletion of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Milne and Weaver, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaytor et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schild, 1995</xref>), suggesting that the role of Rad52 in filament formation may be separable from its other recombination functions. Furthermore, in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, the HR defects and damage sensitivity of deletion of <italic>rad22</italic>, its <italic>RAD52</italic> homologue, is completely suppressed by deletion of an Srs2 orthologue, <italic>fbh1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Osman et al., 2005</xref>). All of these observations lead to the conclusion that defects in Rad52 mediator functions can be overcome by making Rad51 nucleation more favorable.</p><p>It is well accepted that Srs2 reverses toxic recombination intermediates, but our results show that expression of Srs2 also results in the disassembly of Rad51&#x02013;Rad54 complexes from an appropriate site for HR, i.e., an I-SceI&#x02013;induced DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). Because we are not directly visualizing Rad51, it remained possible that the decrease in Rad54 foci at the DSB was due to decreased recruitment of Rad54 to Rad51 foci caused by Srs2 expression. However, this is not the case because Rad54&#x02013;Rad51 colocalization is similar both in the presence and absence of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Furthermore, because a large percentage of Rad51 foci colocalize with Rad54 foci, it is very likely that we are detecting the dismantling of Rad51 foci by proxy. In fact, even if only the subset of Rad51 foci that are represented by Rad54 foci were showing this dramatic threefold decrease at DSB sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>), it still supports the conclusion that Srs2 can dismantle HR complexes at appropriate sites.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>, disruption of HR complexes &#x0201c;elsewhere&#x0201d; is nearly maximal at basal Srs2 expression levels, whereas the DSB-localized complexes require increased expression. We also find that Rad52 is preferentially enriched at the DSB-localized Rad54 foci. These data suggest that more Srs2 protein is required to shift the equilibrium to dismantle Rad54 foci at a DSB, due to the Rad52-mediated forward reaction. Although the nature of the foci outside of the I-SceI break site (i.e., &#x0201c;elsewhere&#x0201d;) is not precisely known, a portion of these foci are likely spontaneous lesions that are also appropriate sites for HR. However, because Srs2 is well established to reverse toxic HR complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gangloff et al., 2000</xref>), in all likelihood a high percentage of these foci are inappropriate.</p><p>How does the cell distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate sites for reformation of HR complexes? Given the central role for Rad52 in HR and the wide variety of interactions that it displays, we propose that Rad52 is involved in this decision-making process. Accordingly, Rad52 localizes most frequently to the marked DSB and these Rad52 foci are largely unaffected by expression of Srs2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, B and C</xref>). These studies have led us to a new model to explain how Srs2 affects the regulation of recombination in vivo. Srs2 removes Rad51 from DNA indiscriminately, dissociating inappropriate Rad51 filaments, as well as those at appropriate sites. Rad52 guides Rad51 filaments to reform at appropriate locations, effectively channeling the HR machinery into bona fide substrates. In mammalian cells, BRCA2 may serve this same function, as orthologous mediator activities have been ascribed to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">San Filippo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shivji et al., 2006</xref>) and BRCA2 is thought to target hRad51 to sites of damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Venkitaraman, 2002</xref>). We suggest that this mechanism serves as a recombination quality control point through the wanton destruction of recombination complexes followed by directed rebuilding of suitable recombination intermediates. In addition, Srs2 interactions with sumoylated proteins, e.g., PCNA at replication forks, may target its anti-recombinase activity to critical genomic locations, thus ensuring the presence of this quality control mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>Standard procedures for yeast mating, sporulation, dissection, transformation, and preparation of growth media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sherman et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sherman, 1991</xref>) were used to obtain strains for this study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810055/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Live-cell epifluorescence microscopy and analysis</title><p>Cells for microscopic analysis were grown to early- to mid-log phase overnight at 23&#x000b0;C in synthetic complete medium plus 100 mg/L additional adenine.
