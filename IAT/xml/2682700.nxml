Collectively, these experiments have demonstrated that the physical inferiority appears to result from two defects: a) a decrease in total muscle mass that reflects impaired growth, rather than aberrant differentiation of myofibers, as well as a diminished abundance of contractile proteins; and b) a reduced content of ATP and phosphocreatine, two readily available energy sources. The abundance of three mitochondrial proteins has been shown to diminish in the knockin mouse. However, the apparent energy deficiency in this genotype does not result from a lower mitochondrial mass or compromised activity of enzymes of the oxidative phosphorylation, nor does it reflect a decline in insulin-dependent glucose uptake, or diminution in storage of glycogen or triacylglycerol (TG) in the muscle.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>This study establishes rpS6 phosphorylation as a determinant of muscle strength through its role in regulation of myofiber growth and energy content.

Hence, we set out to examine the possibility that the apparent diminished muscle strength in the knockin mice might reflect a decrease in total muscle mass. Indeed, monitoring the total soleus weight in 2 to 3.5 month-old mice has demonstrated that the relative soleus weight is reduced by about 25&#x00025; in rpS6<sup>P&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in comparison to that of rpS6<sup>P&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005618-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Likewise, the weight of gastrocnemious muscles in 2-mo-old rpS6<sup>P&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> male mice (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10) is 76&#x00025; of that of their wild-type counterparts (74.5&#x000b1;3.6 &#x0005b;n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10&#x0005d; and 98.3&#x000b1;4.2 &#x0005b;n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9&#x0005d; mg, respectively). The optimal force of a muscle is largely determined by its physiological cross-sectional area (CSA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005618-Huijing1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. This latter variable reflects, among others, the CSA and/or number of individual fibers. Morphometrically, soleus fibers from rpS6<sup>P&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and rpS6<sup>P&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice contain a similar number of myonuclei, testifying for the fusion of a similar number of myoblasts during fiber differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005618-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Moreover, soleus muscles from both genotypes consist of a similar number of fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005618-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). However, soleus muscle fibers of rpS6<sup>P&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> show a 25&#x00025; decrease in their CSA compared to that of rpS6<sup>P&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005618-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), quite similarly to findings in S6K-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005618-Ohanna1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

Histological analyses suggest that the diminution in the myofibers CSA results from fusion of smaller size myoblasts, rather than a reduced number of fusing myoblasts during myotube differentiation. Interestingly, the association between the muscle weakness on the one hand, and the decrease in both the CSA of individual muscle fiber, as well as total muscle mass, is reminiscent of the phenotype of a mouse model for distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV), a human congenital disease, also known as hereditary inclusion body myopathy (hIBM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005618-Malicdan1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is tempting, therefore, to assume that it is the failure to phosphorylate rpS6 that can account for these symptoms in both genotypes. However, the small size of S6K1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> myotubes is apparent, even though their rpS6 is still phosphorylated, most probably by S6K2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005618-Ohanna1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, several lines of evidence presented in this report suggest that, unlike S6K1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> muscle, the mechanism underlying the growth defect in rpS6<sup>P&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> muscle does not involve AMPK activation, despite the reduced ATP content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005618-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>): a) Phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase by AMPK lowers its activity and thereby the synthesis of its product, malonyl-CoA, thus relieving the inhibition of fatty acids uptake into mitochondria and thereby enabling their oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005618-Merrill1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

Taken together, our results indicate that rpS6<sup>P&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> deficiency evokes a defect in muscular growth through a mechanism that deviates from that proposed for S6K1 deficient mice.</p><p>The distinction between the mechanisms operated by these two related deficiencies suggests that S6K1 regulates cell size predominantly through one or more of its multiple substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005618-Ruvinsky1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, rather than rpS6. Indeed, SKAR, another S6K1 substrate, has been implicated in regulation of cell growth, as knockdown of its expression reduced the cell size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005618-Richardson1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, inhibition of both S6K1 and S6K2 by the mTOR-specific inhibitor, rapamycin, is not sufficient to achieve a complete dephosphorylation of rpS6, as it is still phosphorylated at two of its five phosphorylatable serine residues by RSK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005618-Roux1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, rpS6<sup>P&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> recapitulates a combined deficiency of both S6Ks and RSKs, or simultaneous inhibition of the mTOR-S6K and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-RSK pathways. Conceivably, a different mechanism is predominately operative under such extreme conditions.</p><p>Finally, this study evokes an intriguing question regarding the mechanism(s) underlying the role of rpS6 phosphorylation in regulating processes as diverse as cell growth and ATP/PCr production, particularly in the face of the fact that rpS6 is primarily a structural protein of the ribosome. Several explanations can be proposed to account for these unique physiological functions of rpS6 phosphorylation: (a) The phosphorylation of rpS6 within, or outside, the ribosome affects the translation efficiency of specific mRNAs, as likely to be the case for the 20 soleus proteins identified here (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005618-t001">Table 1</xref>). (b) rpS6 might be one of the many bifunctional ribosomal proteins, that can carry out extraribosomal tasks often unrelated to the mechanics of protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005618-Wool1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. (c) Phosphorylated rpS6 might not affect protein synthesis, but instead interacts with cellular protein(s), which consequently becomes active or inactive, and thus affects the cell physiology. Indeed several extraribosomal proteins have been reported to be coimmunoprecipitated with rpS6, suggesting an <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction, either directly or indirectly with these proteins. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005618-Kim1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005618-Schumacher1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>rpS6<sup>P&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, previously generated by homologous recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005618-Ruvinsky2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, were genotyped as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005618-Ruvinsky2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> and kept, similarly to their wild-type counterparts in a hybrid background derived from the 129Sv and ICR mouse strains.

(b) Wire maneuver - Mice were held above a horizontal wire (1.5 mm diameter) by tail suspension and lowered to allow the forelimbs to grip the wire. Grip strength was assessed by measuring the time it took a mouse to raise its hind limbs and grip the wire. (c) Rota-rod test is designed to assess the mouse sensorimotor coordination and defects in motor function. Mice were placed on a 3 cm-diameter cylinder of an accelerating rota-rod (Rota-rod Treadmill 7650, Ugo Basile, Middlesex, UK) apparatus. This cylinder was gradually accelerated from an initial speed of 4 rpm to a maximum of 40 rpm, and the duration of time during which the mouse is able to remain on the rotating rod was recorded. The fourth test was based on treadmill performance for assessment of physical endurance. Mice were initially familiarized with the exercise protocol by walking or running on a rodent treadmill (built in the workshop of Technion-Israel Institute of Technology) on consecutive days, during which they performed 20 min of exercise with 0&#x00025; grade.
