The repetitive cloned fraction was derived from denatured genomic DNA by reassociation to a Cot value at which repetitive, but not unique, sequences have reannealed followed by exhaustive S1 nuclease treatment to degrade single stranded DNA. Initial characterizations of this library by colony filter hybridizations have led to the identification of a previously undetected M. musculus minor satellite as well as to clones containing M. musculus major satellite sequences. This new satellite is repeated 10-20 times less than the major satellite in the M. musculus genome. It has a repeat length of 130 nucleotides compared with the M. musculus major satellite with a repeat length of 234 nucleotides. Sequence analysis of the minor satellite has shown that it has a 29 base pair region with extensive homology to one of the major satellite repeating subunits. We also show by in situ hybridization that this minor satellite sequence is located at the centromeres and possibly the arms of at least half the M musculus chromosomes. Sequences related to the minor satellite have been found in the DNA of a related Mus species, Mus spretus, and may represent the major satellite of that species.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0059-a" xlink:role="6972"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0061-a" xlink:role="6974"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0062-a" xlink:role="6975"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0063-a" xlink:role="6976"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0065-a" xlink:role="6978"/></fig><fig id="F6"><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0067-a" xlink:role="6980"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0052.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6965"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0053.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6966"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0054.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6967"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0055.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6968"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0056.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6969"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0057.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6970"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0058.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6971"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0059.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6972"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0060.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6973"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0061.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6974"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0062.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6975"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0063.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6976"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0064.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6977"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0065.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6978"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0066.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6979"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0067.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6980"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0068.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6981"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0069.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6982"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00365-0070.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6983"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
