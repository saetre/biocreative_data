In mammalian and plant cells that physiologically become polyploid, <italic>cdc6</italic> is transcriptionally and post-translationally regulated. We have recently reported that Cdc6 levels are maintained in megakaryoblastic HEL cells, but severely downregulated by ectopic expression of transcriptional repressor <italic>Drosophila melanogaster escargot</italic>. Here, we show that <italic>cdc6</italic> promoter activity is upregulated during megakaryocytic differentiation of HEL endoreplicating cells, and that <italic>Escargot</italic> interferes with such activation. Transactivation experiments showed that a 1.7 kb region located at 2800 upstream <italic>cdc6</italic> transcription initiation site behaved as a potent enhancer in endoreplicating cells only. This activity was mainly dependent on a novel <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element composed by an E2 box overlapping a GATA motif. Ectopic <italic>Escargot</italic> could bind this regulatory element <italic>in vitro</italic> and endogenous GATA-1 and E2A formed specific complexes in megakaryoblastic cells as well as in primary megakaryocytes. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that both transcription factors were occupying the E2 box&#x0002f;GATA site <italic>in vivo</italic>. Altogether, these data suggest that cdc6 expression could be actively maintained during megakaryocytic differentiation through transcriptional mechanisms involving specific <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory elements.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Several terminally differentiated cell lineages, from plants to mammals, repeatedly enter S phase without completing mitosis in order to become polyploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c2">2</xref>). Among them, platelet precursors, megakaryocytes, undergo endoreplication in a process traditionally known as endomitosis. Megakaryocytic polyploidization is believed to be essential for full platelet production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c3">3</xref>). As in other endoreplicating cells, megakaryocytic endomitosis is accompanied by a specific control of G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S transition cell cycle machinery, which enables the establishment of such truncated cell cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c7">7</xref>). We have also recently shown that transcriptional repressor <italic>Snail</italic> (<italic>Sna</italic>) and <italic>Escargot</italic> (<italic>Esg</italic>) interfere with the regulation of the G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S transition of endomitotic cycles and therefore with polyploidization of megakaryoblastic HEL cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c8">8</xref>). These proteins also inhibit the entrance into endocycles of embryo and larval <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c9">9</xref>), as well as of mouse trophoblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c10">10</xref>). However, little is known about the putative targets of these transcriptional repressors and how they are affecting the establishment of endomitosis.</p><p>We have recently described that Cdc6 is differentially regulated during megakaryocytic polyploidization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c11">11</xref>). Cdc6 is one of the essential factors involved in assembling and licensing origins of replication during the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the mitotic cell cycle [for a review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c12">12</xref>)]. Its expression and ability to load MCM complex onto the origin of replication are tightly regulated in the majority of somatic cells to ensure that DNA is replicated only once per cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c13">13</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>cdc6</italic> expression seems to be stabilized not only in megakaryoblastic cells that undergo endoreplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c11">11</xref>) but also in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> endoreplicating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c15">15</xref>). As also reported in plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c15">15</xref>), what we previously found was that the maintenance of <italic>cdc6</italic> expression during megakaryocytic differentiation could be achieved through post-translational stabilization in cyclin E overexpressing cells, and also through transcriptional regulation of <italic>cdc6</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c11">11</xref>).</p><p>Cdc6 expression peaks during G<sub>1</sub> and is transcriptionally regulated in an E2F-, cell cycle-related manner, not only in mammalian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c18">18</xref>) but also in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c19">19</xref>) and plant cells, as is the case of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c20">20</xref>). In mammalian cells, this control is mediated through E2F-2 and E2F-3 binding to specific sites proximal to the gene transcription initiation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c22">22</xref>). In fact, the essential regulatory region is contained within &#x0223c;300 bp of the 5&#x02032; flanking region, where the E2F-binding sites are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c18">18</xref>), and no further proliferation-mediated transcriptional activity is obtained by using additional upstream sequences up to &#x02212;9000 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c17">17</xref>).</p><p>In order to investigate the transcriptional regulation of <italic>cdc6</italic> during megakaryoblastic cells endoreplication, we took advantage of the fact that differentiated <italic>Esg</italic>-expressing HEL cells lose their ability to endoreplicate and to express Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c11">11</xref>). We have identified potential <italic>Esg</italic>-binding sites (E2 boxes) in <italic>cdc6</italic> upstream region that could be involved in maintaining Cdc6 expression during endoreplication and inhibited by the presence of <italic>Esg</italic> in HEL cells. We have found in the &#x02212;4537 to &#x02212;2800 region upstream <italic>cdc6</italic> transcription initiation site three E2 boxes, one of which overlaps a GATA element. This E2 box&#x0002f;GATA site is the most prominent binding site, not only for <italic>Esg</italic> but also for endogenous proteins. GATA-1 and E2A &#x02018;<italic>in vitro</italic>&#x02019; and &#x02018;<italic>in vivo</italic>&#x02019; occupy this site in endoreplicating cells. Transactivation data indicate that this particular sequence may act as an enhancer involved in transcriptional activation of <italic>cdc6</italic> promoter only when megakaryocytic differentiation is stimulated. The results presented here suggest that specific transcriptional mechanisms could be involved in the maintenance of Cdc6 expression that occurs during megakaryocytic endoreplication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Cells were cultured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c11">11</xref>).

In order to assess whether <italic>cdc6</italic> RNA levels increase in TPA-treated HEL cells was due to gene transcription maintained or to RNA stabilization, a similar experiment was performed in the presence of transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (ActD). As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f1">1</xref>B, as early as 4 h after ActD treatment, <italic>cdc6</italic> RNA levels decreased in untreated HEL and HEL(Esg&#x0002b;) cells. Interestingly, in differentiated HEL cells, the increase obtained after TPA treatment was not observed for a long period in the presence of ActD, thus indicating that <italic>cdc6</italic> transcription is indeed active during HEL megakaryocytic differentiation. Other possibilities that could account for the different <italic>cdc6</italic> RNA levels, i.e. a different proliferation state of parental HEL and Esg-expressing cells, was discarded, as both cell lines stopped proliferating after TPA treatment [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c8">8</xref>) and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f1">1</xref>C], but only parental HEL cells maintain <italic>cdc6</italic> expression at RNA (as shown above) and protein [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c11">11</xref>) and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f1">1</xref>D) level.</p><p>These results also indicate that ectopic expression of <italic>Esg</italic> is able to interfere with the mechanisms that determine the maintenance of <italic>cdc6</italic> expression during megakaryocytic polyploidization.</p></sec><sec><title>A 1.7 kb <italic>cdc6</italic> 5&#x02032;-upstream region containing putative Esg-binding E2 box motifs is responsible for the reduced <italic>cdc6</italic> promoter activation in HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) cells</title><p><italic>Esg</italic> belongs to the <italic>snail</italic> family of zinc finger transcriptional repressors, which function appears to involve binding to E boxes recognized by a variety of basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix (bHLH) transcriptional activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c24">24</xref>). We thus searched a 4537 bp regulatory <italic>cdc6</italic> region for putative sites that could be recognized by ectopic <italic>Esg</italic>. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f2">2</xref>A, we found three E2 boxes with perfect match to the described Esg consensus-binding site A&#x0002f;GCAGGTG, located at &#x02212;4501 to &#x02212;4495 (ACAGGTG), &#x02212;3535 to &#x02212;3529 (GCAGGTG) and &#x02212;2995 to &#x02212;2989 (GCAGGTG) (referred to as Boxes A, B and C, as indicated). Two other E2 boxes corresponding to much less specific Esg binding sites (C&#x0002f;TCAGGTG or G&#x0002f;ACAGNTG) were detected, at &#x02212;1567 to &#x02212;1561 (CCAGGTG) and at &#x02212;2675 to &#x02212;2679 (ACAGATG).</p><p>Transactivation assays were performed by transfecting HEL and HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) cells with a construct containing firefly luciferase gene under the control of &#x02212;4537 to &#x0002b;98 region of <italic>cdc6</italic> upstream region [pHsCdc6&#x02013;luc(&#x02212;4537), as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c17">17</xref>)]. As expected, the &#x02212;4537 to &#x0002b;98 region was able to drive luciferase expression in exponentially growing cells. However, after TPA treatment, luciferase activity was significantly increased in parental HEL but not in differentiated HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) cells. Such activation was only seen after megakaryocytic differentiation, as the addition of hemin resulted in erythroid differentiation of both HEL and HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;). This did not result in the induction of luciferase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f2">2</xref>B). These results suggest that <italic>cdc6</italic> transcriptional activity is induced in endoreplicating HEL cells and that <italic>Esg</italic> may be modulating <italic>cdc6</italic> expression by repressing its promoter activity.</p><p>We have previously found that <italic>cdc6</italic> RNA levels are also downregulated in megakaryoblastic K562 cells.

In order to investigate whether increase in <italic>cdc6</italic> promoter activity was restricted to endomitotic differentiation, pHsCdc6&#x02013;luc(&#x02212;4537) construct was transfected in K562 cells and luciferase activity was determined before and after TPA or hemin treatment.

Luciferase activity was then measured in undifferentiated, TPA- and hemin- treated cell extracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f2">2</xref>C). While hemin treatment did not result in any induction of luciferase activity, the transcriptional activity of this promoter region was increased at a same extent in all three lines after TPA treatment although no relationship with the ability of the cell to undergo endoreplication could be drawn. Similar results were obtained with pHsCdc6&#x02013;luc(&#x02212;1600), a deletion construct containing the E2F-binding elements responsible for cell-cycle-dependent <italic>cdc6</italic> expression regulation and lacking the E2 boxes corresponding to much less specific Esg binding sites at &#x02212;1567 to &#x02212;1561 and at &#x02212;2675 to &#x02212;2679 (data not shown).</p><p>These results suggest that the &#x02212;4537 to &#x02212;2800 region containing the <italic>Esg</italic>-specific E2 boxes could be responsible for endoreplication-driven stimulation of <italic>cdc6</italic> promoter activity and that <italic>Esg</italic> could be responsible for its inhibition when overexpressed in HEL cells.</p><p>In order to explore this hypothesis, a 1.7 kb fragment containing &#x02212;4537 to &#x02212;2800 of <italic>cdc6</italic> 5&#x02032; upstream region (only containing <italic>Esg</italic>-specific E2 boxes A, B and C), was inserted into a luciferase reporter vector under the control of the SV40 promoter [pHscdc6 (&#x02212;4537&#x0002f;&#x02212;2800)]. This fragment was then transfected into HEL, HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) and K562 cells.

Interestingly, the degree of transcriptional activation was much higher in endoreplicating HEL than in non-endoreplicating HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) and K562 cells. Additionally, transcriptional activity of this 1.7 kb fragment was associated with megakaryocytic differentiation only, since no relevant luciferase activity could be detected in HEL, HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) or K562 cells that underwent erythrocytic differentiation in the presence of hemin.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that <italic>cdc6</italic> promoter activity is induced in endoreplicating HEL cells and that <italic>Esg</italic>-specific E2 boxes located at &#x02212;4537 to &#x02212;2800 may be critical for such a transcriptional regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Escargot preferentially binds one of three E2 boxes located in the 5&#x02032; upstream region of <italic>cdc6</italic> gene</title><p>We hypothesized whether <italic>Esg</italic> would bind E2 boxes A, B and C present in &#x02212;4537 to &#x02212;2800 enhancer region &#x02018;<italic>in vitro</italic>&#x02019;. HEL and HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) cells were cultured in the presence or the absence of TPA and collected 48 h later to isolate nuclear extracts. At this time of differentiation, HEL cells were actively undergoing endoreplication cycles, which takes place up to 4 days (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f3">3</xref>A) and even up to 1 week (data not shown). Nuclear extracts were then analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing E2 boxes A, B or C, and 9&#x02013;11 surrounding nucleotides (Box A, Box B and Box C, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f3">3</xref>B). An oligonucleotide containing the consensus ACAGGTG binding site for <italic>Esg</italic> (hereafter referred to as the Esg Binding Element, EBE) was also included as a positive control. As already described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c8">8</xref>), <italic>Esg</italic> present in HEL(Esg<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) nuclear extracts results in a specific pattern of two main, specific shifted bands when complexed with EBE (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f3">3</xref>B, lanes 1 and 2). When HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) nuclear extracts were incubated with Box A, Box B and Box C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f3">3</xref>B, lanes 3&#x02013;8), <italic>Esg</italic> complexes were prominently observed with Box B but barely detected with Boxes A and C. The pattern of shifted proteins was very similar in control and TPA differentiated HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;). Thus, it appears that <italic>Esg</italic> is able to bind, at least &#x02018;<italic>in vitro</italic>&#x02019;, to one out of three putative binding sites in <italic>cdc6</italic> 5&#x02032; upstream region. In addition, two main extra bands (complexes I and II) were detected to bind Box B, but not EBE, suggesting the existence of endogenous nuclear factors that would also bind Box B. To test this, EMSA was then performed with nuclear extracts from parental TPA-untreated and -treated HEL cells. As observed in the <italic>Esg</italic>-expressing cells, binding to Box B was most prominent than to Boxes A and C, and indeed EBE. More interestingly, complexes I and II were also detected to bind Box B while as expected, no <italic>Esg</italic> complexes were present (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f3">3</xref>D). Thus, it appears that HEL cells contain endogenous factors that also recognize this site.</p></sec><sec><title>Endogenous nuclear factors specifically bind the E2 box and an overlapping GATA site at &#x02212;3535&#x0002f;&#x02212;3529 of <italic>cdc6</italic> promoter</title><p>As Box B seemed to contain the most preferred DNA binding site for ectopic <italic>Esg</italic>, as well as for the putative endogenous nuclear factors, we wanted to confirm their binding specificity through competition experiments with unlabeled Box B, using extracts from HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) cells. Examination of Box B sequence revealed the existence of a GATA motif overlapping the described E2 box, which prompted us to perform binding assays on Box B in the presence of unlabeled BEbox<sup>M</sup> or BGATA<sup>M</sup> mutated oligonucleotides, as well as with an unrelated oligo containing four E2 boxes in tandem (E2 box tandem) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f4">4</xref>A). First, competition with an excess of unlabeled Box B indicated that not only <italic>Esg</italic> but also the endogenous complexes I and II were specific (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f4">4</xref>B). Second, competition with an excess of unlabeled BEbox<sup>M</sup>, BGATA<sup>M</sup> or E2 box tandem revealed that: (i) <italic>Esg</italic> binds through the E2 box, since it was only competed with the oligos containing a wild-type E2 box (BGATA<sup>M</sup> and E2 box tandem), but not with the BEbox<sup>M</sup>; (ii) complex II binds through the GATA motif and does not require the E2 box, as it only competes with the oligo that contains wild-type GATA binding site (BEbox<sup>M</sup>); (iii) complex I binds through the E2 box, but also requires the surrounding intact GATA motif, since it competes with oligos containing intact E2 boxes (E2 box tandem), but not with the oligos containing either a mutated E2 box (BEbox<sup>M</sup>) or the mutated GATA motif (BGATA<sup>M</sup>).</p><p>In order to further characterize the complexes binding requirements, in particular that of complex I, we performed EMSA analysis to determine the binding pattern to mutated oligos BEbox<sup>M</sup> and BGATA<sup>M</sup> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f4">4</xref>C and D, respectively). As can be observed, only complex II could bind the oligo containing the mutated E2 box (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f4">4</xref>C).

One obvious candidate was GATA-1, since this protein is expressed in megakaryoblastic cells and affects megakaryocytic development. On the other hand, an independent one-hybrid experiment aimed to look for putative endogenous factors that would bind the EBE element allowed us to identify E2A (both E12 and E47) and E2-2 bHLH proteins as endogenous factors recognizing the G&#x0002f;ACAGGTG E2 box (N. V. and C. C., unpublished data). Thus, EMSA analysis was performed using HEL nuclear extracts in the presence or absence of specific antibodies against these proteins. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f5">5</xref>A, complex II faced severe competition in the presence of anti GATA-1 antibody, whereas no effect was detected with an equivalent amount of non-immune serum, or a GATA-2 antibody.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were then performed by isolating cross-linked chromatin from HEL nuclear extracts. Both anti-GATA-1 and anti-E2A antibodies, as well as the corresponding non-immune Ig controls, were used to immunoprecipitate the fragmented chromatin and after reversal of the cross-link, PCR was performed to detect the presence of the E2 box&#x0002f;GATA site of <italic>cdc6</italic> upstream region. As can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f5">5</xref>D, in both anti-GATA-1 and anti-E2A immunoprecipitated fractions, a 249 bp band corresponding to the expected amplimer for this site could be detected, whereas no amplification was obtained in the non-immune Ig-precipitated fractions. A similar specific presence of site B could be detected with two independent anti-GATA-1 antibodies. Anti-GATA-1, unlike anti-E2A, antibodies were also able to immunoprecipitate a fragment corresponding to a region of gamma-globin promoter, already shown to bind GATA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c25">25</xref>). No amplified DNA was obtained when PCR was performed using primers located approximately &#x02212;2000 upstream <italic>cdc6</italic> promoter. Both GATA-1 and E2A binding to B site could also be detected when ChIP was performed in HEL cells treated with TPA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f5">5</xref>E), indicating that both proteins are bound to the endogenous regulatory site in differentiated cells.

The resulting plasmids (BEbox<sup>M</sup> and BGATA<sup>M</sup>) as well as the wild-type construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f6">6</xref>A) were transfected in HEL, HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) and K562 cells and luciferase activation was determined in TPA-treated and -untreated cells. As already observed, TPA treatment of cells transfected with the wild-type construct resulted in upregulation of its reporter activity in all three lines and the degree of transcriptional activation was highest in the endoreplicating HEL (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f6">6</xref>B). However, the introduction of mutations in the E2 box or the GATA motifs provoked significant changes in the TPA-promoted reporter activity. Thus, the construct containing the E2 box mutation led to a 50% decrease in TPA-promoted inducibility of the 1.7 kb fragment in HEL cells. Interestingly, when BGATA<sup>M</sup> construct was transfected, a strong loss of activity was obtained (&#x0003e;80%). It seems therefore that an intact E2 box-GATA motif is required for optimal enhancer activity in endoreplicating HEL cells.</p><p>As expected from our above findings suggesting that <italic>Esg</italic> might be interfering with the transcriptional activation through the E2 box, transfection of BEbox<sup>M</sup> construct in HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) cells resulted in higher TPA induction of reported activity than the observed with the wild-type version. In fact, the transcriptional activation was almost identical to that obtained in HEL cells transfected with the same BEbox<sup>M</sup> construct. Similar to that observed in HEL cells, transfection of BGATA<sup>M</sup> construct in HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) cells caused a severe decrease in TPA promoted inducibility when compared to the wild-type fragment. Interestingly, comparison of BGATA<sup>M</sup> reporter activity in HEL and HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) cells showed the inhibitory effect of <italic>Esg</italic>, in accordance with the fact that <italic>Esg</italic> does not bind through the GATA binding site.

We first investigated whether extracts from these cells would bind this motif, as observed for HEL and if so, whether they would present differences in the pattern of proteins able to bind the E2 box&#x0002f;GATA site of <italic>cdc6</italic> upstream region when differentiated with TPA treatment. EMSA was then performed on nuclear extracts from K562 cells and, as observed in HEL cells, binding to Box B was most prominent than to Boxes A and C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f7">7</xref>A). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f7">7</xref>B, nuclear extracts from K562 cells treated with TPA for 48 h, showed differences when compared with TPA-treated HEL cells (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f4">4</xref>E, lane 2). Thus, although the pattern of GATA-1 and E2A-containing complexes was present in both undifferentiated and TPA-treated K562 cells, two extra bands (complex III) could only be detected in differentiated K562 cells. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f7">7</xref>B, competition experiments revealed that the specificity of GATA-1 and E2A-containing complexes was identical to that detected in HEL cells. However, BEbox<sup>M</sup> oligonucleotide was able to compete in the binding of complex III to BEbox. Indeed, complex III remained detectable when an excess of unlabeled BGATA<sup>M</sup> oligonucleotide was used as competitor, indicating that these faster migrating bands contained a protein whose binding to Box B site occurred through the GATA-binding element. Accordingly, GATA-1 and complex III, but not E2A complex, could be detected when EMSA was performed with TPA-treated K562 nuclear extracts and labeled BEbox<sup>M</sup> oligonucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f7">7</xref>C). In an attempt to determine whether GATA-1 protein was part of complex III, supershift experiments were performed with TPA-treated K562 nuclear extracts.

HeLa (epithelial origin) or U937 (promonocytic) did not contain any detectable complex, whereas osteosarcoma-derived U2OS, and embryonic kidney 293 contained endogenous proteins able to bind this oligonucleotide, but the pattern of bound proteins was distinct from that detected in megakaryoblastic HEL, HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) K562 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f8">8</xref>A).</p><p>We finally investigated whether primary megakaryocytes contained endogenous nuclear factors were able to bind &#x02018;<italic>in vitro</italic>&#x02019; the E2 box&#x0002f;GATA site.

The pattern of complexes bound to oligonucleotide B in MK extracts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f8">8</xref>D, lanes 1 and 2) was identical to that found in the corresponding Tpo culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f8">8</xref>B), and also to that detected in megakayoblastic HEL cell line (lanes 7 and 8). No retarded bands were detected in non-megakaryocytic MNC cells (lane 3). Addition of anti-GATA-1 (lane 5) and anti-E2A (lane 10) antibodies to nuclear extracts from megakaryocytic-enriched cultured cells was able to abolish the formation of complexes II and I, respectively, indicating that these complexes contained E2A and GATA-1. Interestingly, Cdc6 was present in the terminally differentiated primary megakaryocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f8">8</xref>E).</p><p>Taken together, these results indicate that the binding of E2A and GATA-1 containing complexes to the E2 box&#x0002f;GATA motif is a characteristic of the megakaryocytic lineage.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The data presented in this work indicate that a 1.7 kb fragment located at &#x02212;4537 to &#x02212;2800 bp upstream <italic>cdc6</italic> gene is a transcription enhancer active in megakaryocytic but not in erythrocytic differentiated cells nor in exponentially growing cells. We have found that the stimulation of <italic>cdc6</italic> promoter activity during megakaryocytic endoreplication is dependent on the integrity of a novel <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element defined by an E2 box overlapping a GATA motif (GCAGG<underline>TGATAA</underline>) located at &#x02212;3535&#x0002f;&#x02212;3525. Our data also show evidence that this motif is recognized &#x02018;<italic>in vitro</italic>&#x02019; and &#x02018;<italic>in vivo</italic>&#x02019; by GATA-1 and E2A containing complexes that bind the E2 box&#x0002f;GATA site in a specific manner. Finally, our data indicate that in human primary megakaryocytes, GATA-1 and E2A transcription factors are able to bind this motif, at least &#x02018;<italic>in vitro</italic>&#x02019;, with identical pattern to that detected in megakaryoblastic cell lines.</p><p>The E2 box&#x0002f;GATA motif in <italic>cdc6</italic> upstream region appears to be critical for the endoreplication-related stimulation of the promoter activity. First, when either the E2 box or the GATA elements are mutated, the transcriptional activity of the entire 1.7 kb region is severely impaired. Second, ectopic expression of transcriptional repressor <italic>Esg</italic>, which specifically binds the E2 box element of the E2 box&#x0002f;GATA motif, leads to a significant inhibition of the enhancer activity in HEL cells. This parallels the loss of Cdc6 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c11">11</xref>) and of endoreplication ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c8">8</xref>). Interestingly, ectopically expressing mouse Snail HEL cells, which also have lost the ability to undergo endomitosis, show identical pattern of binding of nuclear complexes to the E2 box&#x0002f;GATA motif than HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) cells (N. Vilaboa, R. Bermejo and C. Cal&#x000e9;s, unpublished data). To our view, it is highly relevant for <italic>Esg</italic> to interfere with the transcriptional activity of <italic>cdc6</italic> gene in differentiated HEL cells, especially as such inhibitory effect seems to affect the endogenous gene transcription as well as an exogenous, reporter gene. It has recently been reported that mouse Sna can attenuate the cell cycle in epithelial MDCK cells, as well as in early embryo development, through partial repression of cyclin D2 promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c26">26</xref>). <italic>Esg</italic> does not affect cell cycle progression in proliferating megakaryoblastic HEL cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c8">8</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Esg</italic> inhibition of megakaryocytic endoreplication seems to be related to its ability to interfere with transcriptional activity of <italic>cdc6</italic> promoter in differentiated HEL (<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) cells.</p><p>It has already been described that a CAGGTG E2 box and a GATA site define a composite, bipartite regulatory element involved in the regulation of a number of erythrocytic and megakaryocytic specific promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c28">28</xref>) including GATA-1 gene itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c29">29</xref>). The formation of a multimeric complex formed by GATA-1, Tal1, E47, Lmo2 and Ldb1A seems to rely on a specific spacing of &#x0223c;8&#x02013;10 bp (&#x0223c;1 helix turn) between the E2 box and the GATA motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c28">28</xref>). The <italic>cis</italic>-acting element we have found to direct <italic>cdc6</italic> transcription during megakaryocytic endoreplication appears to be somehow distinct from that found in promoters of lineage specific genes. Notably, there is no spacing between the E2 box and GATA motifs, and in fact they overlap each other. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this type of E2 box&#x0002f;GATA site is reported and that a differentiation-related role in transcriptional control of a licensing factor involved in polyploidization regulation assigned to such a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element. It is also highly relevant that an identical E2 box&#x0002f;GATA motif was also found in the mouse <italic>cdc6</italic> gene locus, although in the 3&#x02032; untranslated end of the gene instead of the upstream region, and a similar E box&#x0002f;GATA motif in a similar position of the 5&#x02032; end of the rat locus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh981f9">9</xref>). This suggests that similar mechanisms may be acting in rodent megakaryocytic polyploidization. The E2box&#x0002f;GATA element is also present in the human GATA-1 locus at chromosome X (N. V., R. B. and C. C., unpublished data). This last observation might be indicative of an additional lineage-specific regulation of GATA-1 expression during megakaryocytic maturation.</p><p>This paper provides the first evidence that E2A and GATA-1 containing complexes, individually or in coordination, could be regulating <italic>cdc6</italic> expression. While both GATA-1 and E2A have been proposed to affect cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c32">32</xref>), to date only E2A has been described to directly affect the expression of cdk inhibitors, such as p21, p15 and p16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c34">34</xref>). That <italic>cdc6</italic> expression might be specifically controlled during megakaryocytic endoreplication by a lineage-specific transcriptional regulator, such as GATA-1 is reinforced by the earlier proposed implication of this transcription factor in determining proper megakaryocytic polyploidization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c35">35</xref>). For instance, GATA-1 deficient megakaryocytes do not undergo endomitosis and show evidence of retarded nuclear maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c36">36</xref>). Moreover, X-linked macrothrombocytopenia is due to various mutations resulting in GATA-1 lack-of-function and an increased number of dysplastic micromegakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c38">38</xref>). Micromegakaryocytes are hypoploid megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c41">41</xref>), most probably unable to undergo endoreplication cycles. Disruption of the GATA binding motif strongly diminished the <italic>cdc6</italic> promoter activity in endoreplicating cells while mutation of the E2 box decreased it to a lesser extent. This is in accordance to the reported predominant importance of the GATA site compared to the E2 box present in the composite E-box&#x02013;10 bp GATA element 3.7 kb upstream GATA-1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c29">29</xref>). Also, in a non-megakaryocytic cell type, a transcriptional complex between GATA-4 and a bHLH factor (dHAND) requires the GATA site to be intact, whereas the E-box motif is dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c42">42</xref>). Finally, it is also worth noting that the &#x02018;<italic>in vitro</italic>&#x02019; binding of E2A-containing complex to the E2 box&#x0002f;GATA motif requires an intact GATA site, especially when it would be expected that the binding of a bHLH protein took place exclusively through the E2 box element.</p><p>One interesting result of this paper is the fact that GATA-1 complexes bound to the E2 box&#x0002f;GATA-1 motif &#x02018;<italic>in vitro</italic>&#x02019; show significant differences between endoreplicating and non-endoreplicating differentiated megakaryocytic cells. In particular, a faster migrating GATA complex is detected in non-endoreplicating differentiated K562 cells. The enhancer activity of the E2 box&#x0002f;GATA motif-containing region is highly reduced in these cells. Certainly, it will be of great interest to investigate whether GATA-1 forms multimeric complexes with other proteins during megakaryocytic differentiation and whether the composition of the complexes and&#x0002f;or post-translational modifications of GATA-1 are different depending on the cell ability to endoreplicate. GATA-1 has been shown to form multimeric complexes with a variety of other transcription factors (i.e. FOG, EKLF, LMO2, SP1, CBP and Fli-1) and the resulting complexes can even display stimulatory or repressive transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh981c43">43</xref>).</p><p>We have found that human cell lines of different lineages contain endogenous factors able to bind this motif, at least &#x02018;<italic>in vitro</italic>&#x02019;, and that the resulting complex patterns are distinct of those found in megakaryoblastic cells. Noteworthy, our &#x02018;<italic>in vitro</italic>&#x02019; experiments indicate that GATA-1 and E2A-containing complexes are able to bind to the E2 box&#x0002f;GATA motif present in cultured human primary megakaryocytes, reinforcing the hypothesis that <italic>cdc6</italic> promoter activity could be regulated by differentiation-related transcription factors such as E2A and GATA-1.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh981f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>cdc6</italic> mRNA levels are downregulated in differentiated HEL(<italic>Esg</italic>&#x0002b;) cells.
