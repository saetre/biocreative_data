Together these genes make up a subclass (the NET family) that is related to the Sp family of zinc finger transcription factors (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). Specifically, NET family proteins share three sequence motifs (a 'buttonhead box', an 'Sp motif' and a C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>zinc finger) with Sp family proteins. While Sp family transcription factors (Sp1&#x02013;Sp8) are sequence-specific transcription factors acting as activators or repressors depending on the cellular context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], it is unclear if NET proteins play a similar role. For instance, Sp proteins contain three C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>zinc fingers that bind DNA, but NET proteins contain only one zinc finger and this may not be sufficient to bind DNA ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]). Further, the single C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>finger in NET proteins is atypical and is unlikely to bind DNA directly (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). Accordingly, direct sequence-specific DNA-binding has not been reported for any NET family proteins. Thus, while Sp proteins function as transcription factors, the biochemical activity of NET family proteins is unclear.</p><p>Though NET proteins may not bind DNA directly, the available evidence points to their having a role in transcriptional regulation. For instance, Elbow, TLP-1, Nlz1 and Nlz2 are located in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and Nlz1 must be nuclearly localized to be fully active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, gain- and loss-of-function experiments suggest that NET family proteins modulate gene expression during embryogenesis. In particular, expression of <italic>spalt</italic>, a marker of the dorsal tracheal trunk in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, is abolished in response to ectopic expression of <italic>elbow </italic>and is expanded in <italic>elbow </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Similarly, ectopic expression of <italic>nlz1 </italic>or <italic>nlz2 </italic>disrupts <italic>krox20 </italic>expression in rhombomere 3 of the zebrafish hindbrain and leads to an expansion of <italic>hoxb1a </italic>expression from rhombomere 4. Disruption of <italic>nlz </italic>function has the opposite effect, leading to loss of <italic>hoxb1a </italic>expression and expansion of <italic>krox20 </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>While NET proteins appear likely to regulate transcription, it is unclear if they function as activators or repressors or both, as is the case for SP-family proteins. <italic>Drosophila </italic>Elbow is reported to interact with the transcriptional repressor Groucho [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and both Nlz1 and Nlz2 interact with Groucho as well as with several histone deacetylase (HDAC) co-repressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Against this background, we have hypothesized that NET family proteins act as repressors of transcription during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], but there is no direct evidence for NET family proteins repressing transcription and it remains plausible that they can function as both activators and repressors.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that Nlz proteins repress transcription both in cell lines and in developing zebrafish embryos. We first use standard cell culture-based reporter assays to demonstrate that Nlz1 represses transcription of a luciferase reporter in four different cell lines. We find that this repression requires a domain of Nlz1 that includes the HDAC binding site and that it is blocked by the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A, indicating that Nlz1-mediated repression requires HDACs. Next, we generate a stable transgenic zebrafish reporter line and use it to demonstrate that Nlz1 represses a luciferase reporter in the developing embryo. By adapting chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to zebrafish embryos, we further demonstrate that this repression is accompanied by histone deacetylation at the transgene promoter, again consistent with Nlz-mediated repression requiring HDACs. Lastly, we take a genetic approach to examine the function of endogenous Nlz proteins. We find that Nlz proteins are required for formation of hindbrain rhombomere 4 because they repress expression of non-rhombomere 4 genes. We do not find any evidence for Nlz proteins being required as activator during hindbrain formation. We conclude that Nlz proteins act as repressors of transcription and hypothesize that other NET family members function in a similar manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The UAS-SV40:Luciferase plasmid was generated by inserting oligonucleotides containing three UAS sites upstream of the SV40 promoter in the pGL3 plasmid (Promega).

Since Nlz1 is unlikely to bind DNA directly, we generated a fusion protein where the DNA-binding domain (DBD) from the yeast GAL4 protein is fused in-frame to the C-terminus of full-length Nlz1. Western blotting experiments demonstrate that the resulting Nlz1-GAL4DBD protein is well expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Transcription activity was measured using a reporter plasmid (UAS-SV40:Luciferase) containing 3 GAL4 binding sites (upstream activator sequence; UAS) in front of the SV40 promoter driving luciferase expression (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Transfection of the reporter plasmid alone produces robust luciferase expression in HeLa cells. Co-transfection of the GAL4DBD produces a small, but reproducible increase in luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>), suggesting that the GAL4DBD has weak activator activity. In contrast, co-transfection of the Nlz1-GAL4DBD fusion protein produces a dose-dependent reduction in luciferase levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). While the extent of this repression varies slightly between experiments, we routinely observe up to a 10&#x02013;40 fold repression (n = 6 experiments). This repression requires recruitment of Nlz1 to DNA, since Nlz1 lacking the GAL4DBD domain does not repress luciferase expression in this assay (not shown). Analyses of Nlz1-GAL4DBD function in ZF4 (zebrafish fibroblast), SN17 (rat neuronal) and NIH3T3 (mouse fibroblast) cell lines also demonstrate robust repression of luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). We conclude that Nlz1 has the ability to repress transcription in cell lines derived from different tissues and various organisms.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Nlz1 represses transcription in various cell lines</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Hence, we next used our previous structure-function data to begin testing whether Nlz1 utilizes HDACs to repress transcription in HeLa cells. Specifically, the domain of Nlz1 required for HDAC binding appears to reside between the 'buttonhead box' (Btd) and the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>zinc finger (ZF), although the buttonhead box may also be required for optimal binding ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]; Summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Nlz1-mediated repression requires an intact HDAC interaction domain</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Western blotting experiments demonstrate that all constructs are well expressed upon transfection into HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Additionally, the GAL4DBD contains a nuclear localization signal ensuring that all fusion proteins localize to the nucleus (not shown). We next examined each of the deletion constructs for its ability to repress the UAS-SV40:Luciferase reporter in HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). As expected, we find that intact Nlz1-GAL4DBD represses Luciferase expression in a robust, dose-dependent manner. Further, deleting the buttonhead box (&#x00394;385&#x02013;408) has a minimal effect on HDAC binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]) and this construct retains repressor activity (~2 fold less repression than full-length Nlz1; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In contrast, Nlz1 constructs lacking the HDAC-interaction domain (&#x00394;385&#x02013;460, &#x00394;408&#x02013;589) repress the reporter only weakly (~4&#x02013;5 fold less repression than full-length Nlz1). Together these results demonstrate that the HDAC-interaction domain is required for optimal activity of Nlz1 and are consistent with Nlz1 recruiting HDACs to repress transcription. However, we note some residual repressor activity (~3 fold above GAL4DBD alone) in the two constructs that do not bind HDACs (&#x00394;385&#x02013;460 and &#x00394;408&#x02013;589) suggesting that Nlz1 may also repress transcription by a HDAC-independent mechanism.</p><p>Nlz family proteins share an N-terminal sequence motif (S-P-L-A-L/M-L-A-A/Q-T-C) with Sp-family proteins (SP; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). While the function of this domain is not fully understood, it has been implicated in regulating the transcription activity of Sp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Further, although this motif is not involved in binding to co-repressors, we have shown that it is required for Nlz1 function in zebrafish embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We therefore tested a construct lacking the N-terminal 115 amino acids, including the Sp motif, in the reporter assay. We find that &#x00394;N115Nlz1-GAL4DBD has robust repressor activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), indicating that this domain is not required for Nlz1-mediated repression in HeLa cells (see discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>Nlz1-mediated repression is sensitive to Trichostatin A</title><p>To further test whether Nlz1-mediated repression requires HDAC activity, we made use of trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of HDAC activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. For these experiments HeLa cells were transfected with the UAS-SV40:Luciferase reporter together with Nlz1-GAL4DBD, &#x00394;385&#x02013;460Nlz1-GAL4DBD or GAL4DBD and treated with various concentration of TSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In the absence of TSA, the Nlz1-GAL4DBD construct represses luciferase expression ~22 fold, similar to the results in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. However, addition of TSA revealed a dose dependent block of this repression such that at 0.3 &#x003bc;M TSA, we observed only 6&#x02013;7 fold repression. We were unable to test higher concentrations of TSA since treatment with higher doses was toxic to the cells. However, higher TSA doses may not completely block Nlz1-mediated repression. In particular, the &#x00394;385&#x02013;460Nlz1-GAL4DBD construct that cannot bind HDACs repressed ~5-fold in both the presence and absence of TSA. Hence, we conclude that HDAC activity is required for optimal Nlz-mediated repression, but our results again suggest an HDAC-independent component of Nlz1-mediated repression.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>TSA relieves Nlz1-mediated repression.</bold> HeLa cells were transfected with the UAS-SV40:Luciferase reporter together with GAL4DBD fusion constructs as indicated.

We find that injection of Nlz1-GAL4DBD mRNA reproducibly represses luciferase activity about 2.5-fold compared to un-injected transgenic embryos. Control injections of GAL4DBD mRNA does not repress expression from the <italic>TG(UAS-SV40:Luciferase) </italic>transgene &#x02013; instead GAL4DBD leads to ~2-fold activation, similar to the weak activation by GAL4DBD in our cell-based reporter assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We also used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to determine whether repression of the luciferase transgene is accompanied by reduced histone acetylation at the transgenic promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). We find that histone H4 is deacetylated at the transgenic promoter in embryos expressing Nlz1-GAL4DBD relative to control embryos. In agreement with the apparent ability of the GAL4DBD control construct to activate expression of the luciferase reporter, we observe increased histone H4 acetylation at the transgenic promoter in embryos expressing the GAL4DBD construct. It is possible that higher doses of Nlz1-GAL4DBD mRNA would lead to further histone deacetylation and repression, but we have been unable to test this possibility since we find that higher concentrations of mRNA are toxic to zebrafish embryos. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that Nlz1 can repress transcription and promote histone deacetylation in zebrafish embryos.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Nlz1 represses expression of the <italic>luciferase </italic>transgene and promotes histone deacetylation at the transgenic promoter in <italic>TG(UAS-SV40:Luciferase) </italic>embryos.</bold><bold>A, B</bold>. <italic>TG(UAS-SV40:Luciferase) </italic>embryos were injected with mRNA encoding GAL4DBD or Nlz1-GAL4DBD as indicated under the graph.

During early embryogenesis, the vertebrate hindbrain is transformed from an immature and relatively uniform structure into a structure that is subdivided into a series of rhombomere segments (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]). Nlz1 and Nlz2 proteins are required in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], but the effect of disrupting Nlz function (achieved with antisense morpholino oligos [MOs] to Nlz1 and Nlz2, or a Nlz dominant negative construct) has only been assayed for two genes. Specifically, loss of Nlz function leads to expansion of <italic>krox20 </italic>expression from rhombomere 3 (r3) and r5 into r4 and loss of <italic>hoxb1a </italic>expression in r4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Notably, there are genes acting earlier than <italic>krox20 </italic>in r3 and r5. In particular, the <italic>vhnf1 </italic>transcription factor is reported to be the earliest-acting gene in the formation of r5 and more posterior rhombomeres (at least r5 and r6; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]), while the <italic>gbx1 </italic>transcription factor acts early in more anterior rhombomeres (r1-r3;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]). Thus, we examined <italic>vhnf1 </italic>and <italic>gbx1 </italic>expression in <italic>nlz</italic><sup>-</sup>embryos. As expected, simultaneous detection of <italic>vhnf1 </italic>and <italic>gbx1 </italic>expression by whole mount in situ hybridization reveals a gap corresponding to r4 in wild type embryos (Arrows in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). In contrast, <italic>nlz</italic><sup>- </sup>embryos lack such a gap (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Specifically, the <italic>gbx1 </italic>expression domain expands and low-level <italic>gbx1 </italic>expression appears caudally in <italic>nlz</italic><sup>- </sup>embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C, D</xref>). The <italic>vhnf1 </italic>expression domain also appears to expand as revealed by a reduced gap between <italic>vhnf1 </italic>expression in r5/r6 and <italic>pax2 </italic>expression at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E, F</xref>), as well as between <italic>vhnf1 </italic>expression in r5/r6 and <italic>krox20 </italic>expression in r3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G, H</xref>).

Put more generally, if expression of <italic>hoxb1a </italic>requires repression of a repressor, then removing both repressors should restore <italic>hoxb1a </italic>expression. As reported, <italic>hoxb1a </italic>expression is lost in <italic>nlz</italic><sup>- </sup>embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6J</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]) by the 14 somite stage.

We also note the same behavior for <italic>fgf3 </italic>expression, as <italic>fgf3 </italic>expression is lost in r4 of <italic>nlz</italic><sup>- </sup>embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6R</xref>) and restored to <italic>nlz</italic><sup>-</sup>/<italic>vhnf1</italic><sup>- </sup>embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6T</xref>).

This finding also excludes the possibility that Nlz proteins are required to activate <italic>hoxb1a </italic>or <italic>fgf3 </italic>expression in r4. Notably, since <italic>vhnf1 </italic>function is lacking in r5/r6 of <italic>nlz</italic><sup>-</sup>/<italic>vhnf1</italic><sup>- </sup>embryos, <italic>krox20 </italic>expression is lost from r5 and r4 expression extends into r5/r6 in these embryos, as also observed in <italic>vhnf1</italic><sup>- </sup>embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6K, S</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]). Lastly, <italic>nlz</italic><sup>-</sup>/<italic>vhnf1</italic><sup>- </sup>embryos display expanded r3 <italic>krox20 </italic>expression, perhaps as a result of a failure to repress <italic>gbx1 </italic>expression. In summary, our genetic analysis supports a role for Nlz proteins in repressing expression of non-r4 genes.</p><p>Rhombomere 4 has been postulated as an important signaling center required for segmentation of the hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Yet, while <italic>nlz</italic><sup>- </sup>embryos lack r4, the adjacent r3 and r5 territories appear relatively intact (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6J, R</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). We therefore examined earlier stage embryos and find that <italic>hoxb1a </italic>is robustly expressed in <italic>nlz</italic><sup>- </sup>embryos at the tailbud stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6N</xref>). Similarly, although <italic>fgf3 </italic>expression is weak in tailbud stage embryos, we routinely observe <italic>fgf3 </italic>expression in the region corresponding to r4 of <italic>nlz</italic><sup>- </sup>embryos (arrow in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6V</xref>). Thus, r4 gene expression appears to be initiated in <italic>nlz</italic><sup>- </sup>embryos, further supporting our hypothesis that Nlz proteins are not required to induce gene expression in r4, but to repress expression of non-r4 genes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Based on their sequence relationship to Sp transcription factors and their roles during embryonic development, Nlz proteins and other NET family members have been postulated to regulate transcription. In particular, Nlz proteins share several domains, including a C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>zinc finger, with Sp transcription factors and Nlz proteins localize to the nucleus. Additionally, mis-expression of <italic>nlz1 </italic>or <italic>nlz2 </italic>blocks expression of <italic>krox20 </italic>in rhombomere 3 of the zebrafish hindbrain and permits expansion of r4 gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Conversely, disruption of Nlz function leads to expansion of <italic>krox20 </italic>expression accompanied by loss of <italic>hoxb1a </italic>expression, albeit to various degrees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Here we use a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches to demonstrate that Nlz proteins function as repressors, at least in part by recruiting HDACs, and that they act to repress non-r4 genes during zebrafish hindbrain development.</p><sec><title>Biochemical activity of Nlz proteins</title><p>Our results demonstrate that Nlz proteins repress transcription of a luciferase reporter gene both in cell lines and in zebrafish embryos. Our structure-function analysis revealed that Nlz proteins require a region containing the HDAC interaction domain for optimal repression activity. In addition, Nlz1-mediated repression in cell lines is blocked by the HDAC antagonist Trichostatin A (TSA) and Nlz1 expression promotes histone deacetylation at a transgenic promoter in zebrafish embryos. These findings suggest that Nlz proteins repress transcription by recruiting HDACs to target promoters. Notably, HDACs are broadly expressed in zebrafish embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], suggesting that they are available for Nlz-mediated repression. Our results also indicate that Nlz proteins may repress transcription partly by an HDAC-independent mechanism. Specifically, we observe residual repressor activity for Nlz constructs that cannot bind HDACs and Nlz1 retains some repressor activity even in the presence of TSA. Although we do not presently know how this residual repressor effect is mediated, our finding that Nlz proteins repress transcription by recruiting HDACs represents an important advance in the understanding of Nlz function.</p><p>We have noted that NET family proteins are unlikely to bind DNA directly. These proteins may therefore need to be recruited to DNA by other DNA binding factors, but it is presently unclear how this may be achieved. A potential clue may be provided by our structure-function analysis, which revealed that the N-terminal SP domain (that is conserved between NET and Sp family proteins) is not required for Nlz-mediated repression in cell lines. This is in contrast to our previous analysis in zebrafish embryos, where we found that the Sp domain is required for optimal Nlz1 function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We note that these analyses differ such that our current report utilizes a Nlz1-GAL4DBD fusion protein &#x02013; where Nlz1 is recruited to DNA via the GAL4 DNA binding domain &#x02013; whereas our previous work utilized wild type Nlz1. Hence, it is possible that the Sp domain acts as a binding site for a protein that recruits Nlz1 to target promoters in the embryo, although this possibility awaits confirmation by the identification of proteins that bind the Sp motif. The role of this motif in Sp protein function is not clear and it has been ascribed several potential functions (e.g. regulation of protein stability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]), but there are reports that the Sp motif acts as a protein interaction site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Lastly, while we have not detected any evidence that Nlz proteins can activate transcription, we cannot exclude the possibility that Nlz proteins function as activators in specific cellular contexts. Indeed, some Sp proteins are thought to function as activators or repressors depending on the availability of cofactors (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]). Since such an activator function might be obscured by the high basal activity of the SV40 promoter in our reporter construct, we have tested if Nlz1-GAL4DBD can activate transcription from a reporter construct containing a minimal &#x003b2;-globin promoter, but we have not observed activation of transcription (not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Biological role of Nlz proteins</title><p>Disruption of Nlz function leads to loss of <italic>hoxb1a </italic>expression in r4 and expansion of <italic>krox20 </italic>expression from r3 and r5 of the hindbrain. While <italic>hoxb1a </italic>is one of the earliest-acting genes in r4, there are several genes acting earlier than <italic>krox20 </italic>in r3 and r5. In particular, <italic>vhnf1 </italic>is reported to act very early in the formation of r5 and to be required for <italic>krox20 </italic>expression in r5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], while <italic>gbx1 </italic>acts early in r1-r3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Hence, we examined expression of <italic>vhnf1 </italic>and <italic>gbx1 </italic>in Nlz loss-of-function embryos and found that expression of these genes expands into r4 &#x02013; indicating that <italic>gbx1 </italic>and <italic>vhnf1 </italic>expression is normally repressed in r4 by Nlz proteins. Since vHnf1 represses <italic>hoxb1a </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], we postulated that Nlz proteins might function to repress <italic>vhnf1 </italic>expression in r4 &#x02013; thereby preventing <italic>vhnf1</italic>-mediated repression of <italic>hoxb1a </italic>expression. In support of this hypothesis we find that removing <italic>vhnf1 </italic>function on a Nlz loss-of-function background restores <italic>hoxb1a </italic>expression, indicating that Nlz proteins are required to repress <italic>vhnf1 </italic>expression in cells that will form r4. At present, we do not know if this repression is direct (i.e. whether Nlz acts at the <italic>vhnf1 </italic>promoter to repress transcription) or if there are additional intervening steps. This issue is complicated by the fact that Nlz proteins may need to be recruited to target promoters by as yet unknown DNA binding proteins (see above), further underscoring that an important next step will be to identify Nlz-binding proteins. We also note that <italic>gbx1 </italic>expression expands throughout the caudal embryo in the absence of Nlz function. This indicates that Nlz may repress gene expression also outside r4, consistent with the broad expression of <italic>nlz </italic>genes at early stages of development.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrate that Nlz1 represses transcription of a luciferase reporter in four different cell lines and that this repression requires HDACs. We generate a transgenic zebrafish reporter line and demonstrate that Nlz1 represses transcription and promotes histone deacetylation at the transgene promoter in developing embryos, consistent with Nlz1-mediated repression requiring HDACs also in vivo. Lastly, we take a genetic approach to demonstrate that Nlz proteins are required as repressors, but not activators, of transcription in formation of hindbrain rhombomere 4 during zebrafish embryogenesis. We conclude that Nlz proteins act as repressors of transcription and hypothesize that other NET family members function in a similar manner. Our results also demonstrate the utility of stable transgenic zebrafish-based reporter assays as a complement to cell culture-based reporter assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MN carried out the cell-culture reporter assays, generated the TG(UAS-SV40:Luciferase) line, carried out luciferase assays in zebrafish embryos, participated in the ChIP experiments and helped draft the manuscript.
