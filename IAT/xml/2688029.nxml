The paraneoplastic Hu syndrome provides a powerful paradigm for addressing this hypothesis&#x0003b; it is believed to develop because small cell lung cancers (SCLC) express the neuron-specific Hu protein. This leads to an Hu-specific tumor immune response that can develop into an autoimmune attack against neurons, presumably when immune privilege in the brain is breached. Interestingly, all SCLC express the onconeural HuD antigen, and clinically useful tumor immune responses can be detected in up to 20&#x00025; of patients, yet the paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome is extremely rare. We found that HuD-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells are normally present in the mouse T cell repertoire, but are not expanded upon immunization, although they can be detected after <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion. In contrast, HuD-specific T cells could be directly activated in HuD null mice, without the need for <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion. Taken together, these results demonstrate robust tolerance to the neuronal HuD antigen <italic>in vivo</italic>, and suggest a re-evaluation of the current concept of immune privilege in the brain.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Immune tolerance to self antigens is believed to protect against autoimmunity, but not in the central nervous system (CNS), which has been widely accepted to be an immune privileged site since Medawar discovered that transplanted allografts were rejected in the body but survived in the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Medawar1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Galea1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. This idea was reinforced when it was recognized that the blood-brain barrier, the absence of lymphatics in the CNS, and the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines and death receptors all serve to protect the brain from potentially harmful inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Carson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Hickey1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanisms that might underlie CNS immune privilege have been periodically redefined as new ways of maintaining tolerance have been discovered, and as it has been recognized that CD8&#x0002b; T cells can infiltrate the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Galea2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, but the idea remains that the immune system is restricted from seeing brain specific cellular antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Galea1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Although soluble brain antigens readily gain access to the draining cervical lymph nodes where they are taken up by antigen presenting cells, no such pathway has been defined for cellularly-restricted proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-HarlingBerg1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-HarlingBerg2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The immune system, it would seem, is ignorant of antigens sequestered within neurons, providing an explanation of how the brain is protected from potentially damaging autoimmune disease.</p><p>The paraneoplastic neurologic diseases (PND) provide an important model of immunity to brain-specific antigens. For example in the Hu paraneoplastic syndrome, patients experience neurologic symptoms that may affect the dorsal root ganglia, limbic system, cerebellum, and brainstem. The neurologic symptoms develop in patients who have small cell lung cancer (SCLC), tumors that express the HuD antigen, and patients generate impressive tumor immunity to this otherwise aggressive malignancy. SCLCs from Hu patients are usually limited to single nodules, and are typically discovered only after presentation of neurologic symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Graus1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Dalmau1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. A link between the neurologic symptoms and tumor immunity in the disorder was made by Posner and colleagues, who discovered that these patients harbor high titer antibodies to HuD, a normally neuron-specific RNA binding protein that is also expressed by SCLC cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Dalmau2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Jaeckle1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. A general model for the disorder has been that the normally neuron-specific expression of the HuD antigen, combined with immune privilege in the brain, accounts for the immunogenicity of the HuD antigen when it is ectopically expressed in SCLC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Darnell1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the nature of such immune privilege is poorly understood, and may not explain all aspects of the disorder. For example, even though all SCLC express HuD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Manley1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, only some patients make an immune response to the tumor (20&#x00025;), and very few go on to develop PND <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Darnell2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, as diagnosed clinically and confirmed by the presence of high titer anti-HuD antibodies in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. While these observations suggest the possibility that there may be mechanisms responsible for inhibiting autoimmunity to HuD, they would also conflict with the idea of immune privilege to neuron-restricted antigens.</p><p>The presence of antibodies to Hu in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid are important diagnostic markers for the disorder. However several observations have suggested a T cell mediated component to the PNDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Darnell1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The Hu proteins are sequestered intracellularly within neurons, activated T cells are present in the cerebrospinal fluid of Hu patients, and the immune response in patients is Th1-skewed, with Th1 CD4 helper T cells and IgG<sub>1</sub> antibodies present in circulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Benyahia1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Jean1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. All attempts to create mouse models of the disease by immunizing with whole HuD protein have failed to induce neuronal degeneration despite the generation of high titer antibodies to Hu. Moreover, CD8 T cells have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of another form of PND, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Santomasso1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Albert1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Nonetheless, efforts to identify HuD-specific T cells in SCLC patients with the Hu syndrome have yielded mixed results. Some investigators have reported negative results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-deBeukelaar1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, while others have found inconsistent evidence for such cells specific to affected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Plonquet1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, or the presence of atypical T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Roberts1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

We used this tetramer to monitor the expansion of HuD-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells after immunization with adenovirus-HuD. For comparison, mice were immunized with influenza virus to track the expansion of NP-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells (NP is an influenza epitope that binds D<sup>b</sup> MHC I).

The proliferation of HuD-specific T cells depended on the presence of antigen <italic>in vivo</italic>, since na&#x000ef;ve splenocytes did not expand after <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with p321. Thus, T cells specific for the neuronal antigen HuD do not respond to antigen in a similar manner as T cells specific for a neoantigen&#x0003b; after immunization with adenovirus-HuD, CD8&#x0002b; T cells are not detectable directly <italic>ex vivo</italic>, but are after <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion, suggesting that their expansion is suppressed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Pertussis toxin and in vitro stimulation are required for HuD-specific CD8&#x0002b; T activation</title><p>To assess the functional status of HuD-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells we compared their ability to produce IFN&#x003b3; after priming <italic>in vivo</italic>.

In the p321 region of the two proteins, HuA differs from HuD at a single amino acid residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005739-g004">Fig 4a</xref>), although the anchor residues that stabilize the peptide-MHC interaction are conserved between the two peptides, suggesting that they might bind MHC I with similar affinity.

This is clearly the case in the PNDs, where the clinical outcome in these cancer patients is typically determined by the neurologic disease. In the severest forms of the Hu syndrome, patients survive an average of only 7 months from the onset of their illness. Dogma in the past &#x0223c;60 years has been that the immune system is ignorant to neuron-specific proteins such as the Hu antigen. However, it has become clear that the HuD antigen, as well as other PND antigens, may be commonly expressed outside of neurons in common cancer types (all small cell lung cancers express HuD, and over half of ovarian cancers express cdr2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Darnell3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Although only rare subsets of these cancer patients ever develop PND, it would seem that reliance on ignorance of neuronal proteins would pose a potentially great immunologic risk, as neurons induce MHC I molecules during inflammation, at the same time that activated T cells are allowed entry to the CNS across the blood brain barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Carson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Galea2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Neumann1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Ransohoff1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In setting out here to look for HuD-specific T cell responses we have discovered an unexpected resolution to these conflicting points by finding that there is strong tolerance to the HuD protein in normal resting mice. Tolerance to HuD was confirmed by finding that HuD-deficient mice generate functional HuD p321-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells directly <italic>ex vivo</italic>, without the need for <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with peptide. This tolerance was functionally relevant, as mice examined after receiving HuD immunizations or at various times after HuD CD8&#x0002b; T cell adoptive transfer (9 days, 18 days, one month) did not develop evidence of neurologic dysfunction or abnormalities evident by immunohistochemical studies of brain sections.</p><p>The presence of HuD p321-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells in the H-2<sup>b</sup> repertoire indicates that these cells are either not subject to central tolerance induction in the thymus, or exist as a result of incomplete central tolerance. Extensive examination of HuD expression in the adult mouse has failed to find protein in the thymus or any other tissue outside of the nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Okano1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, and HuD does not appear to be regulated by the AIRE protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Derbinski1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, we immunized AIRE KO mice with adenovirus-HuD and saw no HuD p321 specific T cell directly ex vivo (data not shown). In contrast, when we compared the CD8&#x0002b; T cell response to HuD p321 versus its homologous epitope in HuA, we found that HuA p321-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells were not detected after TiterMax immunization, suggesting that they were centrally deleted. Given HuA's ubiquitous expression pattern, central tolerance would be important to prevent the development of widespread peripheral autoimmunity, which is not observed in HuD patients. In contrast, HuD p321-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells were present in the repertoire&#x0003b; moreover, the IFN&#x003b3; response of HuD p321-specific T cells was comparable in magnitude to that elicited from neoantigen-specific T cells after Titermax-peptide immunization. While this experiment was done with a high concentration of peptide (1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> M), which could have obscured low affinity T cell responses, we found that the affinity of restimulated HuD and &#x003b2;gal T cells were comparable (in peptide ELISPOT titration assays, both recognized targets pulsed with dilutions of peptide down to 1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup> M&#x0003b; data not shown). Taken together, our data point to the possibility that mice normally have a mechanism for maintaining active tolerance to a neuron-specific protein.</p><p>The maintenance of tolerance, either by regulatory T cells or through induction of anergy of CD8&#x0002b; T cells in the periphery, requires a means for antigen to be captured and presented to antigen presenting cells (APCs), which themselves make no detectable HuD mRNA (unpublished data). Given the restricted expression of HuD to neurons, which do not turnover in the steady state, the means of sustaining peripheral tolerance to HuD would seem dependent on either ectopic expression of the protein by a non-neuronal cell type, or cross presentation of HuD by an APC. Examination of HuD expression in adult mouse tissue has confirmed its restriction to neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Okano1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> (Darnell et al., unpublished data), although it is difficult to exclude the possibility that an undetectable amount of protein may have escaped detection in these negative results. Recently, ectopic expression of peripheral-tissue antigens by lymph node stromal cells was reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Lee1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In this transgenic mouse model, a cytosolic form of ovalbumin (OVA) under the control of a tissue-specific promoter was shown to be endogenously processed and presented onto MHC I molecules by a stromal cell population in the lymph node cortex. Endogenous presentation of OVA in the lymph node was an effective means of inducing tolerance in na&#x000ef;ve OT-I CD8&#x0002b; T cells. Circulating HuD-specific CD8&#x0002b; T cells may be subject to a similar form of regulation if ectopic expression of HuD by lymph node cells resulted in presentation of HuD p321 peptide complexes, although we have no expression data to support such a speculation.</p><p>Soluble CNS antigens may drain to cervical lymph nodes, and proteins in the CNS can readily access lymphoid tissues via the CSF and cervical lymphatics for processing and presentation to the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Galea1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Ransohoff1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-deVos1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Karman1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is not clear that this pathway is relevant to an intracellular neuronal protein like HuD. Another possibility is that phagocytosis of HuD-expressing neurons, or fragments of neurons such as remodeling synapses, could provide a means for antigen entry into an APC. While whole neurons may not be a likely form of antigen for APCs given their limited ability to turn-over, APCs may be able to phagocytose membrane-bound neuronal blebs for cross presentation and subsequent tolerance induction, in a manner analogous to their general ability to cross-present antigen from apoptotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Albert1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Albert2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

The maintenance of tolerance to HuD is apparently quite effective, given that all SCLC express the HuD antigen but only a very small (0.01&#x00025;) population of patients succumbs to neuronal degeneration. Tolerance to HuD suggests revisiting the model of the brain as an immune privileged organ. Rather, we suggest the opposite possibility, that there exists a natural mechanism that acts in the steady state, similar to what occurs with peripheral tissue antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005739-Heath1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, but that is perhaps even more profound, to tolerize T cells to brain antigens as a default, and for the same end purpose&#x02014;to keep the organ from autoimmune attack. In this context, Medawar's data and follow-up studies may be explained by immunologic tolerance to brain antigens, even newly transplanted antigens, rather than by immunologic ignorance as originally suggested.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank members of the laboratory and Matthew Albert for helpful discussions and critical review of the work.
