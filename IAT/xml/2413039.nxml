Craig, M. Farzan, D. Sogah, N.V. Santo, H. Choe, and J. Sodroski. 2001. <italic>J. Exp. Med.</italic> 194:1661&#x02013;1673). This prompted us to investigate chemokine-induced leukocyte adhesion in inflamed cremaster muscle venules of &#x003b1;2,3 sialyltransferase (ST3Gal-IV)-deficient mice. We found a marked reduction in leukocyte adhesion to inflamed microvessels upon injection of the CXCR2 ligands CXCL1 (keratinocyte-derived chemokine) or CXCL8 (interleukin 8). In addition, extravasation of ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neutrophils into thioglycollate-pretreated peritoneal cavities was significantly decreased. In vitro assays revealed that CXCL8 binding to isolated ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neutrophils was markedly impaired. Furthermore, CXCL1-mediated adhesion of ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> leukocytes at physiological flow conditions, as well as transendothelial migration of ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> leukocytes in response to CXCL1, was significantly reduced. In human neutrophils, enzymatic desialylation decreased binding of CXCR2 ligands to the neutrophil surface and diminished neutrophil degranulation in response to these chemokines. In addition, binding of &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acid&#x02013;specific <italic>Maackia amurensis</italic> lectin II to purified CXCR2 from neuraminidase-treated CXCR2-transfected HEK293 cells was markedly impaired. Collectively, we provide substantial evidence that sialylation by ST3Gal-IV significantly contributes to CXCR2-mediated leukocyte adhesion during inflammation in vivo.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: CF-CXCL8, human carboxyfluorescein-labeled CXCL8; fMLP, <italic>N</italic>-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe; GPCR, G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> protein&#x02013;coupled receptor; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1; MAL-II, <italic>Maackia amurensis</italic> lectin II; PTx, pertussis toxin; ST3Gal-IV, &#x003b1;2,3 sialyltransferase; WBC, white blood cell.</p></fn><fn><p>D.

Both capture and rolling are mediated by selectins binding to selectin ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). During rolling, neutrophils are in intimate contact with the inflamed endothelium, enabling endothelial-bound chemokines to interact with specific chemokine receptors expressed on the surface of neutrophils. This in turn triggers the activation of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> integrins, which eventually leads to firm neutrophil arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). The CXC chemokine CXCL8 has been demonstrated to induce human neutrophil arrest from neutrophil rolling in a dynamic in vitro assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Using intravital microscopy, a subsequent report demonstrated that triggering of neutrophil arrest in unstimulated mouse cremaster muscle venules was almost completely dependent on CXCR2-mediated events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). In contrast, stimulating the cremaster muscle by intrascrotal injection of TNF-&#x003b1; led to neutrophil arrest, which was not strictly dependent on CXCR2 but occurred in an overlapping fashion with an E-selectin&#x02013;mediated mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>).</p><p>During leukocyte recruitment, an essential role of posttranslational glycosylation has been identified for selectin ligand function. This became particularly apparent in mice with a genetic deletion in glycosyltransferases such as fucosyltransferase VII or core 2 GlcNAcT-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Both enzymes are critically involved in the synthesis of core 2&#x02013;decorated O-glycans carrying the selectin binding motif sialyl Lewis X as a capping group. Deletion of these enzymes led to a profound impairment of selectin-dependent leukocyte rolling in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Recently, it has been demonstrated that posttranslational glycosylation also influences the function of chemokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Ludwig et al. demonstrated that <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation of human CXCR2 protects this receptor from proteolytic degradation and removal from the surface of neutrophils, whereas it does not interfere with its trafficking function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Bannert et al. used a canine thymocyte cell line to generate cells stably expressing WT CCR5 and CCR5 mutants. In CCR5 mutants, serine or threonine residues were changed to alanine at putative O-glycosylation sites at the N terminus of CCR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Functional analysis of the cell lines carrying the different CCR5 mutants revealed that CCR5 binding to the CC chemokines macrophage inflammatory proteins 1&#x003b1; and 1&#x003b2; was strongly dependent on a sialic acid carrying O-glycan linked to serine 6 at the N terminus of CCR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Although these findings point toward an important role of glycosylation and sialylation in the function of some chemokine receptors, the contribution of distinct glycosyltransferases in the proper synthesis of carbohydrate structures crucial for chemokine receptor function has not been investigated. Recently, mice deficient in the &#x003b1;2,3 sialyltransferase (ST3Gal-IV) have been generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). In vivo studies on P-, E-, and L-selectin&#x02013;mediated leukocyte rolling in inflamed cremaster muscle venules of ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice revealed a complete absence of L-selectin ligand function and a partial impairment in E-selectin&#x02013;dependent leukocyte rolling, whereas P-selectin&#x02013;dependent rolling was not affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we will present substantial evidence that leukocyte adhesion and extravasation are impaired in ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Because of the rather mild defect at the level of leukocyte rolling, the impairment in leukocyte adhesion and extravasation in ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice cannot be explained by the observed rolling defect. We therefore hypothesized that sialylation by ST3Gal-IV contributes to chemokine-triggered neutrophil arrest in vivo. To this end, we investigated leukocyte arrest mechanisms in unstimulated and TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;stimulated cremaster muscle venules of ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in vivo and in various static and dynamic assays in vitro.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Leukocyte adhesion in trauma-induced inflammation</title><p>Leukocyte adhesion was assessed in 58 cremaster muscle venules of 13 ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and compared with leukocyte adhesion in 37 venules of 13 WT control mice. Hemodynamic parameters between the groups showed no significant difference in vascular diameter, blood flow velocity, wall shear rate, and systemic white blood cell (WBC) count (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). Leukocyte adhesion in postcapillary venules of the cremaster muscle during the first hour after exteriorization of the cremaster muscle was significantly lower in ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> than in WT control mice, suggesting a defect in firm leukocyte arrest in ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). As recently demonstrated, leukocyte adhesion in untreated cremaster muscle venules is mediated via interactions between chemokine receptor CXCR2 expressed on the surface of rolling neutrophils and endothelial-bound chemokines, including keratinocyte-derived chemokine (CXCL1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). We analyzed leukocyte adhesion in untreated mice before and 3 min after systemic injection of 600 ng CXCL1 or the human prototype CXC chemokine CXCL8 (600 ng/mouse). Microvascular parameters during those experiments were similar between the groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). In WT mice, the number of adherent leukocytes increased by 457 &#x000b1; 83 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> after CXCL1 injection and by 422 &#x000b1; 87 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> after CXCL8 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>; and Video 1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070846/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070846/DC1</ext-link>). In contrast, leukocyte adhesion in ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice increased only by 73 &#x000b1; 17 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> after CXCL1 injection and by 73 &#x000b1; 34 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> after CXCL8 injection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>; and Video 2), suggesting that CXCL1- and CXCL8-induced firm adhesion are dependent on ST3Gal-IV. Next, leukocyte adhesion was investigated in mice pretreated with 4 &#x003bc;g pertussis toxin (PTx), an inhibitor of G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> protein&#x02013;coupled receptors, 3 h before cremaster muscle exteriorization. Similar to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), PTx pretreatment of WT control mice led to a significant attenuation in the increase of adherent leukocytes after CXCL1 injection (83 &#x000b1; 21 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) when compared with WT control mice without PTx (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Similar results were obtained in PTx-pretreated control mice after injection of CXCL8 (88 &#x000b1; 33 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>). In ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, no significant influence of PTx pretreatment was noted on the number of accumulated leukocytes after CXCL1 or CXCL8 injection (45 &#x000b1; 27 and 88 &#x000b1; 40 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), suggesting that leukocyte adhesion triggered by CXCR2 is significantly impaired in ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Finally, we investigated the increase in the number of adherent leukocytes in cremaster muscle venules of CXCR2<sup>bm&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice after systemic injection of CXCL1 or CXCL8. Similar to ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, leukocyte adhesion after CXCL1 increased only by 80 &#x000b1; 16 and 88 &#x000b1; 41 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> after CXCL8 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). This was significantly different to the results observed in WT mice, demonstrating that CXCR2 is crucial in mediating CXCL1/CXCL8-dependent leukocyte adhesion in this setting.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table I.</label><caption><p>Hemodynamic parameters (mean &#x000b1;

To address the possibility that a lower expression of CXCR2 on ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> leukocytes contributes to the decrease in the number of adherent leukocytes, we initially performed flow cytometric analysis of CXCR2 expression on GR-1&#x02013;positive leukocytes of ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT control mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). CXCR2 expression was slightly higher in ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> compared with WT control mice, excluding a lower expression of CXCR2 in ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to be responsible for the observed defect in leukocyte adhesion in these mice. We then questioned whether ST3Gal-IV deficiency would affect ligand binding to CXCR2. For the ligand binding assays, we chose to use human carboxyfluorescein-labeled CXCL8 (CF-CXCL8), because bound CF-CXCL8 can be directly detected by flow cytometric analysis of leukocyte populations within mouse blood. Human CXCL8 binds with high affinity to mouse CXCR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>) and exerts the same in vivo effect as CXCL1 when injected into WT cremaster muscle venules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref> and Video 1). Human CXCL8 can therefore be used for binding studies in mouse neutrophils. The specificity of CF-CXCL8 binding was demonstrated by its decreased binding to neutrophils from CXCR2<sup>bm&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>) When compared with WT leukocytes, leukocytes from ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed a considerably reduced ability to bind CF-CXCL8. A reduction in CF-CXCL8 binding was also observed when WT neutrophils were treated with neuraminidase, which removes terminal sialic acids from surface glycoproteins.

Spontaneous neutrophil transmigration (without CXCL1) was similar for WT and ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neutrophils (0.07 &#x000b1; 0.04 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> vs. 0.06 &#x000b1; 0.01 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells, respectively) and accounted for 20 and 17% of migrated neutrophils, respectively, compared with the total number of migrated WT neutrophils observed during CXCL1-induced transmigration (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of enzymatic desialylation on the binding and activity of CXCR2 on human neutrophils</title><p>Biochemical studies on the presence of terminal sialic acids on CXCR2 were performed with human CXCR2, which could be precipitated from CXCR2-transfected HEK293 cells and subsequently probed for the binding of the <italic>Maackia amurensis</italic> lectin II (MAL-II), which preferentially recognizes carbohydrate chains containing sialic acid residues &#x003b1;2,3 linked to penultimate galactose residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).

In addition, binding of CF-CXCL8 to HEK293 cells was clearly dependent on the presence of CXCR2, because CF-CXCL8 did not bind to untransfected HEK293 cells (unpublished data).

As demonstrated by binding assays with the radioactively labeled CXCR2 ligand <sup>125</sup>I-labeled neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (CXCL7), treatment with neuraminidase resulted in reduced binding of the chemokine to neutrophils (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). For these experiments, CXCL7 was chosen as a radioligand, because this chemokine displays high affinity binding to CXCR2 and low affinity binding to CXCR1, whereas CXCL8 binds to both CXCR1 and CXCR2 with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Scatchard plot analysis revealed that CXCL7 binding to high affinity sites was shifted from 6.6 to 20 nM after neuraminidase treatment, whereas the low affinity binding was not affected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>). The total number of binding sites was not changed upon treatment with neuraminidase, which was consistent with the unaffected expression level of CXCR2 and CXCR1 on the surface of these cells, as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070846/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20070846/DC1</ext-link>). Binding of platelet factor 4 (CXCL4), which is not dependent on either of the two receptors (CXCR1 or CXCR2), was not affected by neuraminidase treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>).</p><p>Functionally, CXCL7 and CXCL8 induce lysosomal degranulation of neutrophils. We investigated the release of elastase from primary granules of CXCL8- and CXCL7-treated neutrophils and found that elastase release was considerably reduced when human neutrophils were pretreated with neuraminidase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Notably, elastase release in response to the preferential CXCR2 ligand CXCL7 was more profoundly reduced than that after CXCL8 stimulation, which is explained by the fact that CXCL8 binds and functions via both CXCR1 and CXCR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Importantly, enzymatic digestion did not lead to a decreased reactivity of neutrophils in general, as stimulation with the tripeptide <italic>N</italic>-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) induced similar responses in untreated and enzyme-treated neutrophils (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 D</xref>). These findings were further corroborated by measuring CXCL7-induced lactoferrin release from secondary granules, which was significantly diminished in neuraminidase-treated neutrophils (Fig. S2 B). In contrast, lactoferrin release triggered by CXCL4 (which does not bind to CXCR2) was not influenced by the enzymatic treatment (Fig. S2 B). Thus, terminal sialic acids are found on CXCR2, and deficient sialylation in neutrophils decreases ligand binding and activity of the receptor.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Chemokine receptors and their ligands are involved in many immunological processes requiring specific and high affinity interactions between chemokine receptors and their respective ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Specificity is in part achieved by posttranslational modification of chemokine receptors, as recently demonstrated for CXCR2 and CCR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><p>The chemokine receptor CXCR2 (mouse homologue of IL-8 receptor B) is involved in chemokine-induced leukocyte adhesion and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Two studies identified CXCR2 as playing a critical role during the pathogenesis of ventilator- or LPS-induced inflammatory lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). In addition, CXCR2 was also shown to participate in the recruitment of macrophages into established atherosclerotic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the variety of publications illustrating CXCR2-mediated effects in a wide spectrum of diseases, little is known about how CXCR2 achieves specific binding to its ligands. We present for the first time in vivo evidence that CXCR2-triggered leukocyte arrest during inflammation is strongly dependent on posttranslational sialylation mediated by ST3Gal-IV. This can be deduced from results in ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, where baseline as well as CXCL1- or CXCL8-triggered leukocyte adhesion in trauma-induced inflammation was significantly lower than in WT control mice. However, leukocyte adhesion was comparable to either WT control and ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice pretreated with PTx, an inhibitor of GPCRs, or CXCR2<sup>bm&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, suggesting an important role for &#x003b1;2,3-sialylation in CXCR2 function in vivo. In a second approach, we found that leukocyte adhesion in TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;stimulated cremaster muscle venules was similar between ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, CXCR2<sup>bm&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and WT control mice. In this model, leukocyte adhesion occurs in an overlapping fashion by E-selectin&#x02013; and chemokine-triggered CXCR2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Although blockade of GPCRs with PTx did not have any effect on leukocyte adhesion in ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, CXCR2<sup>bm&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, or WT mice, pretreatment of ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and CXCR2<sup>bm&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice but not WT mice with E-selectin blocking mAb 9A9 led to a significant reduction of leukocyte adhesion, suggesting that CXCR2-triggered firm arrest is defective in ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>To challenge our results and directly investigate CXCR2-dependent leukocyte adhesion in a more reductionist system in which all &#x0201c;endothelial players&#x0201d; are known, we used a recently described ex vivo flow chamber system and coated the surface of the rectangular flow chamber with recombinant mouse P-selectin, ICAM-1, and CXCL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Although we observed some adhesion of ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> leukocytes in the flow chamber, the number of adherent cells was significantly lower than that seen in control mice. These data strongly support the hypothesis that CXCR2-mediated events leading to firm leukocyte arrest are impaired in ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In addition, the results suggest that the adhesion defect is located on neutrophils. This observation was confirmed and expanded into the human system in direct ligand binding assays using fluorescently labeled CXCL8 and radiolabeled CXCL7. We found a significant and dose-dependent reduction in the binding of CF-CXCL8 to ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> neutrophils when compared with control neutrophils. In addition, we observed a strong reduction in <sup>125</sup>I-labeled CXCL7 binding to neuraminidase-pretreated human neutrophils. Recently, Reutershan et al. identified a critical role for endothelial CXCR2 in the successful migration of neutrophils into LPS-stimulated lung tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). We have not formally ruled out a role for endothelial CXCR2 in leukocyte adhesion and migration in stimulated cremaster muscle venules in vivo. However, we did not detect an effect of endothelial CXCR2 in mediating neutrophil transmigration in the chemotaxis assay using the brain endothelial cell line b.End5, suggesting that various endothelial compartments may differ in their ability to express functional CXCR2.</p><p>In a previous study, we reported that human CXCR2 is <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated at two distinct sites. This was shown by enzymatic deglycosylation and Western blotting of the immunoprecipitated receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that enzymatic removal of terminal sialic acids results in reduced CXCR2 ligand binding to human neutrophils. When using <sup>125</sup>I-labeled CXCL7 as a high affinity CXCR2 ligand for binding studies with human neutrophils, we found a strong reduction in the affinity of CXCR2 when neutrophils were treated with neuraminidase, as shown by Scatchard analysis of the binding kinetics. In contrast, neuraminidase treatment of neutrophils neither affected the number of binding sites nor the expression level of CXCR2. These data suggest that sialic acids on neutrophils are required to maintain high ligand binding affinity rather than surface expression of the receptor. Although defective sialylation of CXCR2 in ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice could not be directly demonstrated at the molecular level, we were able to demonstrate that human CXCR2 carries terminal sialic acids, which were sensitive to neuraminidase treatment. As a consequence of reduced receptor interaction, we observed decreased adhesion, transmigration, and degranulation of mouse or human leukocytes in response to CXCR2 ligands. To confirm that glycosylation defects would not affect the responsiveness of neutrophils in general, we stimulated neutrophils independent of CXCR2 using fMLP and CXCL4. Treatment with those proinflammatory mediators did not alter neutrophil responsiveness after desialylation. This does not exclude a requirement for terminal sialic acids for ligand binding by other chemokine receptors such as CCR5, for which an important role of glycosylation has also been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). However, CCR7-dependent migration of dendritic cells was not affected in ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (unpublished data), suggesting that sialylation cannot be considered a general requirement for optimal chemokine receptor&#x02013;mediated events. Accordingly, our results suggest that posttranslational sialylation may be a new regulatory mechanism by which chemokine-triggered recruitment of some leukocyte subpopulations may occur. However, at present it remains unclear how cell type&#x02013;specific expression of the different sialyltransferases contributes to chemokine receptor&#x02013;mediated leukocyte adhesion. For the ST3Gal family of sialyltransferases, six different isoenzymes have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Previous studies of ST3Gal sialyltransferases have revealed different substrate specificity and tissue expression of the various isoenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). ST3Gal-IV shares substrate specificity mostly with ST3Gal-VI and, to a minor degree, with ST3Gal-III. This may indicate that ST3Gal-VI (besides ST3Gal-IV) could also be involved in the regulation of chemokine receptor&#x02013;triggered leukocyte arrest. Currently, ST3Gal-VI<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are not available. Future studies using ST3Gal-VI<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/ST3Gal-VI<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice will help to further characterize the role of sialylation on chemokine receptor function.</p><p>Collectively, our findings provide novel evidence for a crucial role of the sialyltransferase ST3Gal-IV in CXCR2-mediated neutrophil adhesion and recruitment under inflammatory conditions. Besides initiating the development of new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of CXCR2-mediated diseases, these results should also serve in stimulating additional studies in elucidating the role of posttranslational sialylation/glycosylation on chemokine receptor function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Animals.</title><p>ST3Gal-IV<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and CXCR2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow chimeric mice were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>) and housed in barrier facilities under specific pathogen-free conditions.
