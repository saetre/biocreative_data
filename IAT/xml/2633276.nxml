We have previously reported that RPS2, a 33 Kda ribosomal protein was over expressed in malignant prostate cancer cell lines and in archived tumor specimens. Thus, RPS2 or other aberrantly over-expressed ribosomal proteins might promote cancer and be excellent therapeutic targets for treatment of the disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Western blotting and RT-PCR have been used to measure and compare the levels of expression of RPS2 in a variety of malignant prostate cancer cell lines, plus normal and benign cells lines. We have developed a 'ribozyme-like' DNAZYM-1P '10&#x02013;23' motif oligonucleotide and examined whether it targets RPS2 in different cell lines by RT-PCR and Western blots. Growth and apoptosis assays were carried out to measure whether DNAZYM-1P 'knock-down' of RPS2 influenced cell proliferation or survival.

RT-PCR assays showed that DNAZYM-1P, which targeted RPS2, 'knocked-down' RPS2 expression in the malignant cells (i.e. PC-3ML cells) <italic>in vitro</italic>. The DNAZYM-1P also inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in the malignant prostate cells, but had little effect on the normal IBC-10a or NPTX-1532 cell lines. Finally, SCID mouse tumor modeling studies showed that DNAZYM-1P blocked tumor growth and metastasis by PC-3ML cells and eventually eradicated tumors following localized or systemic i.v. delivery. Mouse survival studies revealed that there was a dosage dependent increase in disease free survival rates in mice treated systemically with DNAZYM-1P (i.e. mouse survival increased from 0% to 100%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In sum, we have shown for the first time that therapeutic targeting of RPS2 is an excellent approach for the eradication of prostate cancer in preclinical tumor modeling studies.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Although our understanding of their role in cancer is limited, the expression of a variety of ribosomal proteins has been associated with the development of prostate and colon cancer. For example, we have previously reported that RPS2, a 33 Kda ribosomal protein was over expressed in malignant prostate cancer cell lines and in archived tumor specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Vaarala et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] found that L7a and L37 ribosomal proteins were over-expressed in prostate-cancer cell lines and in prostate cancer tissue samples. Furthermore, L23a- and S14-transcript levels were significantly elevated in PC-3 cells as compared to a normal prostate epithelial cell line termed PrEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Utilizing 'micro-quantity differential display', Bee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] found L19 (RPL19) was 5-fold higher in malignant prostate cell lines and 8-fold higher in malignant tissues, when compared with their benign counterparts of human prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The authors suggested that expression of RPL19 protein could be a valuable marker in prostate cancer diagnosis and patient management. Similarly, Pogue-Geile et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] found that the RPS3, RPS6, RPS8, RPS12, RPL5, and PO ribosomal proteins were expressed at higher levels in 8 different colon adenocarcinomas and adenomatous polyps. These results suggest that a select pool of ribosomal proteins might be elevated in prostate and colon cancer during the transformation process and play a key role in tumorigenesis.</p><p>Previously, we have cloned a mutant variant of the RPS2 ribosomal protein, termed PCADM-1, and shown that RPS2 was over expressed in malignant prostate cell lines and in human prostate cancer (PCa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. PCADM-1 was over-expressed in human PCa and not found in benign (BPH), high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), or seminal vesicle (SV) tissue. Likewise, the normal RPS2 gene was found to be over-expressed by malignant prostate lines (i.e. PC-3 ML and LNCaP cells), and by early stage prostate cancer cell lines (HGPIN, CPTX-1532). The data suggest that PCADM-1 and/or RPS2 might be novel bio-markers and excellent prognostic indicators for human prostate cancer. More importantly, PCADM-1 or RPS2 might be novel therapeutic targets for treating the disease.</p><p>In this paper, we have examined the importance of the RPS2 gene for proliferation and survival of malignant and normal prostate cell lines <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have developed a 'ribozyme-like' oligonucleotide, DNAZYM-1P, which specifically targets RPS2 and found that DNAZYM-1P treatment of PC-3ML, LNCaP, and CPTX-1532 cells induced a significant increase in cellular apoptosis and death (i.e. &#x0003e; 95% after 48 hr). Mouse tumor modeling studies further revealed that DNAZYM-1P delivered locally or systemically, eradicated primary and metastatic tumors of PC-3ML cells in SCID mice. More importantly, treatment dramatically increased mice disease free survival rates by 100%. For the first time, we have convincingly demonstrated that tumors which over express the RPS2 protein can be eradicated with a DNAZYM-1P targeting this gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>LNCaP, DU145, CRW22R1 and mouse 3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC (Bethesda, MD) and grown according to their instructions.

CPTX-1532 and NPTX-1532 cells were derived from malignant and normal tissue of the same human prostate tissue, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].

H&#x00026;E stained sections and RPS2 antibody labeled sections of the tiny tumors present at the time treatment was initiated, showed that the PC-3ML cells normally formed solid tumor masses and the cells over expressed RPS2. In mice treated with the scrambled oligonucleotide for 2&#x02013;3 mos, the tumors still consisted of a packed mass of PC-3ML cells (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>) which expressed RPS2 (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5e</xref>). Residual nodules sometimes remained following treatment of the mice with DNAZYM-1P for 2 mos. These nodules consisted of a collagen shell, but were largely empty masses filled with debris that was not immunolabeled with RPS2 antibodies (data not shown). Overall, we found that DNAZYM-1P treatment of the mice appeared to be of low or zero toxicity to the mice since they gained weight on a regular basis, were robust and healthy in appearance and showed zero neuropathy or hair loss. Histology of the liver, kidney, spleen, brain, spine, lungs, and heart indicated normal undamaged tissue. Also the growth of fibroblast cultures from the prostate tissue of mice was not hindered by 4 and 6 <italic>ug/ml </italic>DNAZYM-1P, indicating the DNAZYM-1P probably does not target cells which express low levels of RPS2 protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Earlier immunolabeling studies with polyclonal antibodies had revealed that the RPS2 antigen was over-expressed in 100% of prostate cancer luminal epithelial cells (n = 20 prostates examined). In contrast, the protein was not expressed in NPTX-1532, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), seminal vesicle (SV) or in skeletal or smooth muscle tissues from the same prostates with (or without) cancer foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Likewise, RPS2 (aka: PCADM-1) was not expressed by primary prostate tissue fibroblast cultures, WI38 human fibroblasts, human peripheral blood lymphocytes or human hepatocyte cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we have examined whether the PCADM-1 gene/protein is normally over expressed in malignant prostate cancer. Western blots indicated benign prostate did not express the protein, whereas malignant prostate cancer expressed PCADM-1 and the amount of RPS2 expressed increased with the tumor grade. We have, therefore, focused on studies designed to test whether RPS2 over expression in prostate cancer cell lines is essential for cell survival. To our surprise, we found in 'anti-sense' knock-out experiments with a DNAZYM-1P which targeted the RPS2 mRNA, that gene expression was essential for cell survival, but only in cells which over expressed the RPS2 protein (i.e. in PC-3 ML, LNCaP, CPTX-1532 and pBABE-IBC-10a-c-myc cells). In comparison, prostate cell lines expressing very little RPS2 (i.e. BPH-1, NPTX-1532 or IBC-10a cells) were not affected by the DNAZYM-1P treatment even at high concentrations for prolonged intervals. That is, only the PC-3ML and pBABE- IBC-10a-c-myc cells which expressed elevated RPS2 underwent apoptosis and failed to grow in response to DNAZYM-1P. NPTX-1532 or IBC-10a cells which failed to express detectable RPS2 did not undergo apoptosis. Likewise, DNAZYM-1P treatment of localized or metastatic tumors in SCID mice, completely eradicated the tumors, but did not inflict noticeable harm to normal mouse cells. We interpret this to mean that the over-expression of RPS2 might promote ribosomal biogenesis and growth of tumor cells and that the tumor cells acquire a dependence on RPS2 for survival. Thus, 'knock-out' of RPS2 results in a 'shut-down' of ribosomal biogenesis and a cascade of apoptotic events leading to inhibition of cell growth and apoptosis. Again, a similar response was not observed in normal cells since the temporary 'knock-down' of RPS2 mRNA had little impact on overall cell homeostasis.</p><p>Perhaps more importantly, we found that DNAZYM-1P treatment of tumor bearing mice was a highly effective therapeutic approach to eradicating tumors and dramatically improving disease free mouse survival rates. We showed that the DNAZYM-1P eliminated PC-3ML tumors in mice (&#x0003e; 90%) and that treatment resulted in a significant increase in disease free mouse survival rates (&#x0003e; 80&#x02013;100%) after discontinuation of the treatment for ~4 mos. The DNAZYM-1P was non-toxic after prolonged treatment intervals and following the discontinuation of treatment, tumor recurrence was not detected in the liver, lungs, peritoneum or other organs after several months indicating the mice were cured of cancer. The implication is that targeting RPS2 in prostate cancer might be an excellent therapeutic strategy.</p><p>A number of studies have previously shown that the over expression of different ribosomal proteins might play an important role in cancer. Chiao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] has shown that RPS2 ribosomal mRNA was over expressed in head and neck cancer and barely detectable in normal tissue. Others have found that the rat ribosomal protein S3a is identical to rat v-fos transformation effector protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Karan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] found 34 genes are up-regulated and eight genes are down-regulated in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, including L10 (RPL10), L32 (RPL32), and S16 (RPS16). It therefore appears that independent, non-coordinate changes in expression of a subset of ribosomal proteins, might occur which have no direct association or correlation with proliferative and/or protein synthetic activities involved in ribosomal biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], but could be involved in transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. For example, studies by Naora et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] showed that enhancement of RPS3a expression in NIH 3T3 cells induced transformation and formation of tumors in nude mice and they found that S3a expression was a critical gene for tumor cell survival and tumorigenesis.</p><p>Like S3a, our data suggested that over expression of RPS2 was associated with prostate tumor formation and key for tumor cell survival. The interesting aspect of these studies is that suppression of enhanced RPS3a or RPS2 expression both could be associated with and/or involved in a downstream pathway which leads to apoptosis. For example, S-12 cells that over express RPS3a, undergo apoptosis when enhanced RPS3a expression was inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>There is some precedent for this suggestion. There are cases where growth inhibition and/or apoptosis have been induced by switching off expression of c-<italic>myc </italic>and <italic>bcr-abl </italic>in promyelocytic, and in chronic myeloid, leukemia cells, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that apoptotic induction might arise as a default event when RPS3a or RPS2 expression is blocked, simply from an inadvertent inhibition of survival factors. Unfortunately, the physiological signals that mediate such suppression are probably cell specific and obviously remain to be elucidated.</p><p>As pointed out in the introduction, there are many reports showing a connection between over-expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The implication is that these ribosomal proteins have additional functions distinct from their role as ribosomal proteins regulating protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In this respect, specific 'leucine zipper' sequence motifs are characteristic of numerous ribosomal proteins which allow binding to nucleic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and a possible role in regulating transcriptional and translational mechanisms. For example, the rat ribosomal protein S3a is identical to the product of the rat v-fos transformation effector gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. And S3a is normally involved in initiation of protein synthesis and is related to proteins involved in the regulation of growth and the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In one study, over expression of S3a was able to induce transformation of NIH 3T3 cells and induce formation of tumors in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. But the ability of S3a to induce transformation was dependent on its role in suppressing programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A second example is the rat ribosomal protein L10. L10 is homologous to a DNA-binding protein and to a putative Wilm's tumor suppressor gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A third example is S19 where a mutation in the S19 ribosomal protein has been associated with a predisposition to cancer in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anaemia [34]. Finally, RPS2 was shown by our lab to specifically bind a classical 'break point cluster region' sequence found in leukemia [35], implicating RPS2 as a DNA binding protein. The DNA binding domain is a leucine zipper domain where 4 point mutations have been detected. Thus, aberrant over expression of RPS2 or the mutant form of RPS2 (termed PCADM-1) might somehow activate oncogenes involved in tumor development. In this connection, the individual and/or combined effects of a variety of ribosomal proteins (i.e. like RPS2, S3a, L10, and L19) might directly control gene expression patterns, oncogene expression and transformation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We believe that targeting one or more of these ribosomal proteins (i.e. RPS2 or S3a) may lead to development of a highly effective treatment for prevention of cancer, eradication or primary tumors or a blockade of tumor metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>RPS2, RPS3, S5, RPS6, RPS8, RPS12 and S14: Ribosomal protein S2, S3a, S5, S6, S12 and S14, respectively; L5, L7, L10, L16, L19 and L37: Ribosomal protein L5, L7, L10, L16, L19 and L37; HGPIN: High grade prostatic neoplasia; BPH: Benign prostatic hypoplasia; SCID mice: Severe Combined Immunodeficient mice; SV: Seminal vesicle.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors contributed equally to the research work and writing of the manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title>Additional file 1</title><p><bold>Illustrates the basic design of the DNAZYM-1P construct. </bold>Shows 8b flanking regions which correspond to specific sequences in the 5' region of the RPS2 mRNA.
