Interestingly, of two closely related PLC&#x003b3; isoforms, only PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> has previously been shown to be activated by Rac. Here, we explore the molecular basis of this interaction as well as the structural properties of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> required for activation. Based on reconstitution experiments with isolated PLC&#x003b3; variants and Rac2, we show that an unusual pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, designated as the split PH domain (spPH), is both necessary and sufficient to effect activation of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> by Rac2. We also demonstrate that Rac2 directly binds to PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> as well as to the isolated spPH of this isoform. Furthermore, through the use of NMR spectroscopy and mutational analysis, we determine the structure of spPH, define the structural features of spPH required for Rac interaction, and identify critical amino acid residues at the interaction interface. We further discuss parallels and differences between PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> and PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> and the implications of our findings for their respective signaling roles.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><italic>The atomic coordinates and structure factors (code 2k2j) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/">http://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>).</italic></p></fn><fn><p><italic>Chemical shifts for resonance assignments for the spPH have been deposited at the BioMagResBank (accession code 15707).</italic></p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.

There are six major families of PLC enzymes (PLC&#x003b2;,-&#x003b3;,-&#x003b4;,-&#x003b5;,-&#x003b6;, and -&#x003b7;) that share a common core of domains related to catalysis and are distinguished by family-specific regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). The two isoforms of the PLC&#x003b3; family, PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> and PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub>, uniquely incorporate an array of domains comprising two SH2 domains, an SH3 domain, and an internal or &#x0201c;split&#x0201d; PH domain (spPH). spPHs represent a unique subclass of PH domains that are characterized by insertions of one or several autonomously folded protein modules encoded within the boundaries of PH domain sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). This array also contains sites for phosphorylation by several receptor (<italic>e.g.</italic> epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors) and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, multiple protein-protein interactions (mainly mediated by SH2 and SH3 domains) contribute to PLC&#x003b3; activation and have an important role in localizing the enzyme to protein complexes in different cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). However, the elucidation at the molecular level of how PLC&#x003b3; isoforms are regulated remains an area of intense study.</p><p>Despite the common domain organization shared by the PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> and PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> isoforms, studies using gene-targeting approaches demonstrated that each has a distinct biological role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Different functions of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> (essential role in embryonic development) and PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> (requirement for development and function of hematopoietic cells) to some degree reflect their different expression patterns and, in particular, the abundance of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> in hematopoietic cells. However, studies of different cell types where both isoforms are present (<italic>e.g.</italic> platelets, macrophages/monocytes, granulocytes, and NK cells) have shown that one isoform can be preferentially activated over the other, suggesting that additional mechanisms must exist to determine the distinct roles of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> and PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Overall, studies of proteins that bind to SH2 and SH3 domains and target PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> and PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> to signaling complexes suggest that these binding partners are not specific to either PLC&#x003b3; isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). However, a recent analysis of the two PLC&#x003b3; isoforms has shown that only PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> can be activated by the Rho family GTPase, Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Importantly, this was the first report to identify a signaling component that could provide a basis for differential regulation of these two closely related PLC&#x003b3; isoforms.</p><p>The report of activation of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> by Rac has also expanded the scope of potential regulators of the PLC&#x003b3; family and is in line with the interconnection between other Ras superfamily GTPases and PLC isoforms. Thus, although the possible role of small GTPases in the activation of phosphoinositide-specific PLC was noted over 20 years ago, it is only recently that progress has been made in uncovering the identity of the interacting protein components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Initially, it was reported that Rac GTPases and Cdc42 specifically activate the PLC&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). The recently discovered PLC&#x003b5; isoform was reported to be regulated by specific Ras and Rho family GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). In addition, the PLC&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub> isoform has been implicated in binding to Ral GTPases, leading to subsequent activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies have defined the structural basis for select examples of these interactions. For example, the crystal structure of activated H-Ras bound to the isolated PLC&#x003b5; RA2 domain revealed an interaction surface that is distinctly different from those of other known Ras effectors (c-Raf, RalGDS, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) that contain the same RA/RBD fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). More recently, the crystal structure of activated Rac1 bound to a C-terminally truncated PLC&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), in which the interaction interface is restricted to the N-terminal PH domain, a region previously implicated as a key structural determinant for Rac-dependent PLC&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). This Rac-PH domain complex has expanded the structural diversity of domain types involved in binding Rho family GTPases and highlighted the potential role of PH domains as a site for either protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report an investigation of the structural basis of the Rac binding specificity for PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> over PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> and how Rac-dependent activation of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> compares with that found for PLC&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>. We uncover a specific mode of interaction with PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> that involves the spPH rather than the N-terminal PH domain common to PLC&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>. Determination of the three-dimensional structure of the PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> spPH and identification of residues critical for Rac binding further identify relatively subtle differences between highly similar PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> and PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> isoforms, resulting in distinct selectivity for Rac regulatory proteins, important for their function in cellular signaling.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Construction of Vectors</italic>&#x02014;Complementary DNAs encoding c-<italic>myc</italic> epitope-tagged human PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> (1291 aa, accession number ABB84466) and human PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> (1265 aa, accession number NP_002652) were inserted into pcDNA3.1(-) and pVL1393 or pcDNA3.1(+) and pVL1392, respectively.

These experiments were conducted with cell extracts enriched in recombinant PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> and Rac2 that had been separately expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. To exclude the possibility that other signaling proteins could mediate activation of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> by Rac, we set out to extend these data with purified components (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>). We noted a 7-fold activation of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> by GTP&#x003b3;S-loaded Rac2. This result strongly suggests that Rac2 interacts directly with PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> and that the presence of Rac2 is both necessary and sufficient for guanine nucleoside triphosphate-dependent PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> activation. Next, we prepared a number of chimeric proteins where the N-terminal PH domains of the Rac-responsive PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> and the Rac-nonresponsive PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> were exchanged. The specific PLC activities of each of these chimeras were tested in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup> and shown to be comparable (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>left</italic>). However, when introduced into the reconstitution assay, it was evident that the N-terminal PH domain of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> does not impart Rac2 activation on PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> (variant PLC&#x003b3;1-211) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Similarly, the exchange of the PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> N-terminal PH domain into PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> (variant PLC&#x003b3;2-122) did not significantly alter the propensity of this chimera to be activated by Rac2. These <italic>in vitro</italic> observations were further supported by experiments in intact COS-7 cells co-transfected with cDNAs encoding Rac2 and PLC&#x003b3; isozymes to display the same basal PLC activities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). We confirmed that Rac2<sup>G12V</sup> activates PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> but not PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> and that the N-terminal PH domain is not involved in the Rac2-mediated activation. In addition, we showed that the Rac-binding N-terminal PH domain of PLC&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> is functionally interchangeable by constructing a PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> chimera that incorporates this domain (variant PLC&#x003b3;1-&#x003b2;11) and showing its activation by Rac2<sup>G12V</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Together, these experiments suggest that, unlike with PLC&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>, the N-terminal PH domain of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> is not involved in the observed interaction of Rac2. Furthermore, the findings support the idea that Rho family GTPase effector interaction sites are not conserved and cannot easily be predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>The role of the N-terminal and split PH domains of PLC</bold>&#x003b3;<bold><sub>2</sub> in cellular activation by Rac2.</bold><italic>Left</italic>, COS-7 cells were transfected with increasing amounts per well of vector encoding wild-type or mutant PLC&#x003b3; isozymes.

The total amount of DNA was maintained constant in each transfection by adding empty vector. In additional experiments (results not shown), we found that expression of Rac2<sup>G12V</sup> also caused only a minor (&#x02264;1.9-fold) stimulation of inositol phosphate formation in cells cotransfected with 1000 ng/well of vector encoding PLC&#x003b3;1-111 or PLC&#x003b3;1-211.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0460854590003"></graphic></fig></p><p>The PLC&#x003b3; isoforms contain a second PH domain within the specific array (SA) region located between the X and Y domains of the catalytic barrel. This spPH consists of two parts separated by the tandem array insert of two SH2 domains and an SH3 domain. Although the two halves of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> spPH can form a contiguous fold when expressed without the other domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>), it is not known whether, in the context of the full-length PLC&#x003b3; molecules, these two sections also form a contiguous PH domain or are spatially separated. Recently, there have been reports that attribute different functions to spPHs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>) with the insertion of other domains between either &#x003b2;-strands 6 and 7 or &#x003b2;-strands 3 and 4, as in the case of the PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). Accordingly, we prepared chimeric PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> proteins that contained either one or both of the PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> spPH sections. The swapping of either the N- or C-terminal spPH subdomains (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) from PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> did not confer Rac activation on PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>right</italic>). However, the insertion of both partial spPH subdomains from PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> produced a PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> chimera that was stimulated 5.4-fold in activity by recombinant Rac2. The reverse chimera experiment was also carried out. The PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> spPH subdomains were engineered into the PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> polypeptide chain both as individual partial domains and as both halves together (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>right</italic>). The exchange of either or both of the partial domains abolished activation by Rac2 in reconstitution experiments. Therefore, both spPH subdomains of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> are necessary and sufficient to impart Rac2-dependent PLC&#x003b3; activation. This conclusion is supported by experiments that tested these PLC&#x003b3; chimeras in transfected COS-7 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). Of note, the two spPH subdomains of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> also imparted on PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> a marked sensitivity to activation by exogenous Vav1 and endogenous Rac GTPases present in COS-7 cells, whereas the presence of the two spPH subdomains of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> within the context of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> rendered the chimeric enzyme indistinguishable in this regard from wild-type PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> (Fig. S1).</p><p>The data obtained from the analysis of PLC&#x003b3; spPH (Figs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>, and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3<italic>B</italic></xref>), suggest that either the site of Rac2 interaction is distributed over both halves of spPH or that correct folding of each half requires the presence of the other from the same isoform. Since our further studies suggest that the first scenario is unlikely (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), the incorrect folding of each spPH half could be the reason for the loss of interaction with Rac. Indeed, recent studies of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> have shown that the construct of the isolated second half of its spPH was unfolded but that the interaction with the complementary half induces the correct folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). Since the sequence identity (29%) of the spPH regions of the PLC&#x003b3; isoforms is low, it is likely that their subdomains cannot be interchanged without losing correct spPH folding.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Three-dimensional structure of the PLC</bold>&#x003b3;<bold><sub>2</sub> split PH domain.</bold><italic>A</italic>, heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> spPH (471-913, &#x00394;516-841).

For comprehensive, quantitative analysis we used surface plasmon resonance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Consistent with the data where we analyzed the requirements for activation of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> by Rac2 (Figs. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub>, but not PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub>, selectively bound GTP&#x003b3;S-activated Rac2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, the PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> chimera incorporating both halves of the PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> spPH (PLC&#x003b3;1-122) was fully functional in Rac2-GTP&#x003b3;S binding.

These data confirm PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> as a direct effector of Rac and show that its spPH determines the isoform specificity for this interaction.</p><p>We also assessed whether PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> spPH in isolation can bind GTP&#x003b3;S-activated Rac2. Based on the recent structural characterization of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> spPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>), we designed a contiguous PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> spPH construct lacking the intervening SH2 and SH3 domains and being replaced by a linker consisting of the remaining natural loop regions. In essence, a &#x0201c;regular&#x0201d; PH domain is predicted to be formed by the directly linked spPH subdomains. The corresponding domain from PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> was also constructed. Both PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> and PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> spPHs could be prepared in good yields. PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> spPH selectively bound Rac2-GTP&#x003b3;S, similar to the full-length protein; importantly, for PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> spPH, no interaction with Rac2 could be detected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The binding strength for PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> spPH with Rac2 (<italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> = 17 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) is in close agreement with previously reported affinities of Rac2 for the isolated PH domain of PLC&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Subsequent structural studies have shown that the PLC&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> isoform contacts Rac solely through its PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>).</p><p>The strengths of interaction between PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> and Rac2 shown here (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), in the micromolar range for <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>, are generally consistent with values obtained for PLC&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-Rac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>) and PLC&#x003b5;-Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) complexes and more broadly with a number of other small GTPase-effector interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>) measured <italic>in vitro</italic>. There are, however, instances of Rac- and Cdc42-effector interactions with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>). However, in a cellular setting, the posttranslationally modified C terminus of Rac2 or the plasma membrane could be involved in stabilizing the interaction between activated Rac2 and full-length PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub>. It is important to note that the spPHs of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> and -&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> are unlikely to bind to membrane lipids directly. Experimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>) and molecular modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>) studies agree that these domains do not possess the amino acid sequence motifs typical of lipid binding modules. Accordingly, although some changes in the subcellular distribution do occur with some of the chimeras (PLC&#x003b3;1-121, PLC&#x003b3;1-112, and PLC&#x003b3;2-221) (Fig. S2), these effects do not correlate with the variation in activity observed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref> (<italic>left</italic>), which are also evident in the cell-free system (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>right</italic>).</p><p><italic>Structural Analysis of the PLC</italic>&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub><italic>Split PH Domain Interaction Interface with Rac2</italic>&#x02014;To provide a basis for further analysis of the interaction between the PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> spPH and Rac2, we determined the three-dimensional solution structure of the spPH by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Single (<sup>15</sup>N) and double (<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N) isotope-labeled samples of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> spPH were prepared, and nearly complete resonance assignments were obtained using standard triple resonance NMR experiments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). On the basis of the analysis of three-dimensional <sup>15</sup>N- and <sup>13</sup>C-edited <sup>1</sup>H NOESY spectra, 2487 interproton distance restraints were obtained and used in structure calculations along with 70 hydrogen bond restraints and 114 dihedral angle restraints. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> shows the structural statistics for the bundle of 20 lowest energy conformers, each of which displays low restraint violations and good stereochemical and nonbonded interaction scores.

Omitting the loop between &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b2;4, which contains the linker between the spPH subdomains, and a small number of apparently flexible residues at the N and C termini, the refined conformer bundle provides a well defined model for the PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> spPH with coordinate root mean square difference values of 0.41 &#x000b1; 0.05 &#x000c5; for the backbone and 0.76 &#x000b1; 0.06 &#x000c5; for all heavy atoms (residues 478-508 and 849-908).</p><p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl2"><label>TABLE 2</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of structure statistics for PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> spPH</bold></p><p>&#x0003c;SA&#x0003e; represents the set of 20 selected lowest energy conformers obtained by restrained dynamical simulated annealing in CNS.

It is noteworthy that the sequence identity of the two spPHs is considerably lower (29%) than for the intact PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> and PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> proteins (49.5%) or the respective N-terminal PH domains (48%).

Overall, there is a strong correspondence of the surface distribution of charge and hydrophobicity. Notably, a patch of negative charge visible at the lower region of the N view is common between the two domains. Given this apparent global homology, it seems likely that the differences in Rac2 interaction with these two spPHs must reside in rather specific variation in surface side chain distribution. To probe this hypothesis, the residues important for the specific Rac2-binding interface were identified through NMR titration experiments and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Surface charge distribution of PLC</bold>&#x003b3;<bold><sub>1</sub> and PLC</bold>&#x003b3;<bold><sub>2</sub> spPHs.</bold> Surface electrostatic potentials representations of these two spPHs were computed with PyMol (<italic>top</italic>, PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> spPH; <italic>bottom</italic>, PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> spPH).

We observed 20 backbone NH cross-peaks for PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> spPH that shift or disappear completely upon Rac titration.

A number of full-length PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> mutants were prepared with amino acid substitutions in its spPH subdomains. The specific mutations were designed so as to swap the PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> residue for the amino acid type in the equivalent position in PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> residue (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>). Specifically, full-length K862I, V893Q, F897Q, Q901K/S902K, and K909T PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> variants were constructed. The wild-type and mutant PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> constructs were each co-expressed in COS-7 cells with Rac2<sup>G12V</sup>, and the PLC activities were assessed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). We identified three residues as important for activation of the enzyme by Rac2. In the &#x003b2;-strand 5 region, the K862I mutant showed a substantially diminished activation by Rac2. The V893Q and F897Q mutations, bordering the &#x003b1;-helix, also yielded a substantially lower activation by Rac2. The remaining mutants demonstrated either a small reduction or even an enhancement of Rac2-dependent activation. We ruled out the possibility that the mutations perturb the spPH fold; the corresponding substitutions were introduced into the isolated spPH construct, and these variants were assessed by one-dimensional <sup>1</sup>H NMR. All of these proteins retained a wild-type fold (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>C</italic></xref>).

This variance is generally consistent with the observed diversity of binding sites for Rho family GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>) and further shows that even when the same fold (<italic>i.e.</italic> aPH domain) is involved, the interaction surfaces engaged in Rac binding can be different.</p><p><italic>Implications for Regulation of PLC</italic>&#x003b3; <italic>Isoforms</italic>&#x02014;In conjunction with the conclusions drawn from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), the results described here reveal several aspects of the regulation of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> activity by Rac. First, in reconstitution assays, Rac2 is sufficient to activate PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> in the absence of other protein components (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Second, when the proteins are co-expressed in COS-7 cells, Rac2 mediates translocation of the PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> isoform to cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Third, in transfected cells, Rac2-mediated PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> activation is not dependent upon the phosphorylation of critical tyrosine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) previously linked to PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> regulation in B-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>). Taken together, these results could be taken to imply that substantial activation of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub><italic>in vivo</italic> can be achieved through interaction with Rac alone. However, such a view potentially ignores complexity in the regulation of PLC&#x003b3; isoforms that is suggested by other studies that implicate synergy of signaling inputs. Most notably, recent studies of activation of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> by growth factor receptors have shown that Tyr<sup>783</sup> phosphorylation is not sufficient for full PLC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). The concurrent production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), via epidermal growth factor-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, was reported to contribute to the activation of phosphorylated PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub>. Similarly, in B-cells, where signaling via PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> has been best documented, it is possible that Rac2 can contribute to full activation of this isoform together with a set of specific adapter proteins and tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>). In the B-cell system, the evidence suggests that Rac proteins and their activators (such as the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors Vav) contribute to production of higher levels of IP<sub>3</sub> and greater calcium responses rather then being essential for PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>). However, the role and relative contribution of Rac GTPases in the regulation of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> could vary between cell types. Importantly, the identification of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> residues critical for Rac binding described here (Figs. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, and S1) provides a solid basis for the design of a Rac-insensitive PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> variant that could be exploited to dissect the roles and assess the relative importance of the Rac-dependent and other modes of PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> regulation in different cell types.</p><p>It is also interesting to ponder the mechanism by which Rac might regulate PLC&#x003b3;<sub>2</sub> activity. Here we have identified the spPH as the binding site for Rac, the domain within the &#x003b3;-SA region and thus in proximity to critical tyrosine residues and the SH2 and SH3 domains that mediate interactions with a number of binding partners linked to activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>). Some reports suggest that the unliganded &#x003b3;-SA region may have an autoinhibitory role, since removal of this region appears to enhance enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>). The observation that some of the chimeric PLC&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub> spPH mutants displayed enhanced basal activity is consistent with this concept (<italic>cf.</italic> Figs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2<italic>B</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3<italic>B</italic></xref>, and S1). Based on the published initial observations, it has been proposed that the &#x003b3;-SA region acts as a &#x0201c;hinged lid&#x0201d; that can adopt either a closed or open state, thereby occluding or exposing the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>), respectively, depending upon the occupancy of the various ligand binding sites in the &#x003b3;-SA region. It has recently been suggested that the inactive conformation is characterized by an intramolecular association between the N-terminal half of the split PH domain and the C-terminal SH2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref>). In the context of this model, the role of Rac could be to, on its own or together with other regulatory inputs, mediate the release of intramolecular constraints. However, it seems clear that more experimental data, including a greater understanding of the three-dimensional structures of holo-PLC&#x003b3; enzymes, are required to critically evaluate such models for autoinhibition and activation mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M803316200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M803316200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank N.
